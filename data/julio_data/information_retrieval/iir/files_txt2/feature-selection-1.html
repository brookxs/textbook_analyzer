We can view feature selection as a method for replacing a complex classifier (using all features) with a simpler one (using a subset of the features). It may appear counterintuitive at first that a seemingly weaker classifier is advantageous in statistical text classification, but when discussing the bias-variance tradeoff in Section 14.6 (page ), we will see that weaker models are often preferable when limited training data are available. The basic feature selection algorithm is shown in Figure 13.6 . For a given class , we compute a utility measure for each term of the vocabulary and select the terms that have the highest values of . All other terms are discarded and not used in classification. We will introduce three different utility measures in this section: mutual information, ; the test, ; and frequency, . Of the two NB models, the Bernoulli model is particularly sensitive to noise features. A Bernoulli NB classifier requires some form of feature selection or else its accuracy will be low. This section mainly addresses feature selection for two-class classification tasks like China versus not-China. Section 13.5.5 briefly discusses optimizations for systems with more than two classes.
