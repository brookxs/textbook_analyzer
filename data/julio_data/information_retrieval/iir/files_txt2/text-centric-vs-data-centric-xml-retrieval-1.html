Text-centric vs. data-centric XML retrieval
 Text-centric vs. data-centric XML retrieval  text-centric XML   In contrast, data-centric XML mainly encodes numerical and non-text attribute-value data. When querying data-centric XML, we want to impose exact match conditions in most cases. This puts the emphasis on the structural aspects of XML documents and queries. An example is: Find employees whose salary is the same this month as it was 12 months ago. Text-centric approaches are appropriate for data that are essentially text documents, marked up as XML to capture document structure. This is becoming a de facto standard for publishing text databases since most text documents have some form of interesting structure - paragraphs, sections, footnotes etc. Examples include assembly manuals, issues of journals, Shakespeare's collected works and newswire articles. Data-centric approaches are commonly used for data collections with complex structures that mainly contain non-text data. A text-centric retrieval engine will have a hard time with proteomic data in bioinformatics or with the representation of a city map that (together with street names and other textual descriptions) forms a navigational database. Two other types of queries that are difficult to handle in a text-centric structured retrieval model are joins and ordering constraints. The query for employees with unchanged salary requires a join. The following query imposes an ordering constraint: Retrieve the chapter of the book Introduction to algorithms that follows the chapter Binomial heaps.  Relational databases are better equipped to handle many structural constraints, particularly joins (but ordering is also difficult in a database framework - the tuples of a relation in the relational calculus are not ordered). For this reason, most data-centric XML retrieval systems are extensions of relational databases (see the references in Section 10.6 ). If text fields are short, exact matching meets user needs and retrieval results in form of unordered sets are acceptable, then using a relational database for XML retrieval is appropriate.
