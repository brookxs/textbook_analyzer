Efficient scoring and ranking
 Efficient scoring and ranking We begin by recapping the algorithm of Figure 6.14 . For a query such as jealous gossip, two observations are immediate: The unit vector has only two non-zero components. In the absence of any weighting for query terms, these non-zero components are equal - in this case, both equal 0.707. For the purpose of ranking the documents matching this query, we are really interested in the relative (rather than absolute) scores of the documents in the collection. To this end, it suffices to compute the cosine similarity from each document unit vector to (in which all non-zero components of the query vector are set to 1), rather than to the unit vector . For any two documents (34)      6.14  7.1  6.3.3   Figure 7.1: A faster algorithm for vector space scores. Given these scores, the final step before presenting results to a user is to pick out the highest-scoring documents. While one could sort the complete set of scores, a better approach is to use a heap to retrieve only the top documents in order. Where is the number of documents with non-zero cosine scores, constructing such a heap can be performed in comparison steps, following which each of the highest scoring documents can be ``read off'' the heap with comparison steps.
