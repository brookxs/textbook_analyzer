Linear algebra review
 Linear algebra review   The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in it; thus, . A square matrix all of whose off-diagonal entries are zero is called a diagonal matrix; its rank is equal to the number of non-zero diagonal entries. If all diagonal entries of such a diagonal matrix are , it is called the identity matrix of dimension and represented by . For a square matrix and a vector that is not all zeros, the values of satisfying (213)   eigenvalues    213  right eigenvector principal eigenvector. left eigenvectors     (214)    The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is obtained by rewriting Equation 213 in the form . The eigenvalues of are then the solutions of , where denotes the determinant of a square matrix . The equation is an th order polynomial equation in and can have at most roots, which are the eigenvalues of . These eigenvalues can in general be complex, even if all entries of are real. We now examine some further properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, to set up the central idea of singular value decompositions in Section 18.2 below. First, we look at the relationship between matrix-vector multiplication and eigenvalues. Worked example. Consider the matrix (215)      (216)       (217)     (218)   (219)   (220)   (221)   End worked example. Example 18.1 shows that even though is an arbitrary vector, the effect of multiplication by is determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of . Furthermore, it is intuitively apparent from Equation 221 that the product is relatively unaffected by terms arising from the small eigenvalues of ; in our example, since , the contribution of the third term on the right hand side of Equation 221 is small. In fact, if we were to completely ignore the contribution in Equation 221 from the third eigenvector corresponding to , then the product would be computed to be rather than the correct product which is ; these two vectors are relatively close to each other by any of various metrics one could apply (such as the length of their vector difference). This suggests that the effect of small eigenvalues (and their eigenvectors) on a matrix-vector product is small. We will carry forward this intuition when studying matrix decompositions and low-rank approximations in Section 18.2 . Before doing so, we examine the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of special forms of matrices that will be of particular interest to us. For a symmetric matrix , the eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Further, if is both real and symmetric, the eigenvalues are all real. Worked example. Consider the real, symmetric matrix (222)        End worked example.   Subsections Matrix decompositions
