The search user experience
 The search user experience It is clear that the more user traffic a web search engine can attract, the more revenue it stands to earn from sponsored search. How do search engines differentiate themselves and grow their traffic? Here Google identified two principles that helped it grow at the expense of its competitors: (1) a focus on relevance, specifically precision rather than recall in the first few results; (2) a user experience that is lightweight, meaning that both the search query page and the search results page are uncluttered and almost entirely textual, with very few graphical elements. The effect of the first was simply to save users time in locating the information they sought. The effect of the second is to provide a user experience that is extremely responsive, or at any rate not bottlenecked by the time to load the search query or results page.
