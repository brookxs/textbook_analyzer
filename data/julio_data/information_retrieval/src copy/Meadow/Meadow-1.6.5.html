It was discovered that computers were able to produce such indexes.  Chemical Titles, published by the Chemical Abstracts, was the first subject index created by a computer.  Many others soon followed.  The database was created by manual analysis of the documents.  A person would create a surrogate for each document, which were then used by the computer to create the index.  The selective dissemination of information (SDI) was conquered next.  This enabled users to query document records stored on a computer.  As computer speed improved, the search time for these queries decreased.  This led the way for the development of commercial document query systems.  By the 1970s many different systems were available through telecommunications.  This technology eventually led to the Internet.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-1.6.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.6.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
