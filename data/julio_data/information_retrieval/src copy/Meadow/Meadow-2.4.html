A database is used as a retrieval system, whereas a knowledge base is used to help someone perform a specific function.  Knowledge bases can be used to make decisions.  The stored information and information inputted into the system by the user are both used as knowledge by the system.  Knowledge bases can be in any form.  Some common forms are frames and rules.  A frame is set of information that describes an entity.  A rule is a conditional statement that determines the importance of a piece of information.  Knowledge engineers build knowledge bases.  These people are usually experts in their filed.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-2.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-2.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-2.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
