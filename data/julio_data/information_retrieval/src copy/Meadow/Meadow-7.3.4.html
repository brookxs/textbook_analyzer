In Boolean sets, a record is either in the set or out of the set.  In fuzzy sets the line delineating the two sets is not clearly defined.  In Boolean sets, records are given a value of 1 or 0.  In fuzzy sets, records can be assigned any value between 0 and 1.  If a user asks a question that is not well defined, they would not expect a set of records that is well defined.  Weighted terms can be used within a query.  Usually when used in a Boolean query, the weighting is used to put the records in order after the set has been created.  Word lists are also used to query the database.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-7.3.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-7.3.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-7.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
