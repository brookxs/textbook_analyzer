The user is more likely to search for a particular word within the text.  For this type of searching, it is necessary to use keyword method of indexing.  There are different ways of doing this.  One method is to index every word in the text.  However, this uses a lot of space and indexes words that are not useful for searching.  Another method is to use a stop list.  This is a list of words that are not indexed.  In some cases this may cause problems in some specific searches.  It is also possible to have humans index text.  The problem here is that people are not consistent with each other.<p><P><hr size=4><UL><LI><A HREF="Meadow-6.5.1.html"> 6.5.1 Phrase Parsing </A><LI><A HREF="Meadow-6.5.2.html"> 6.5.2 Word Parsing </A><LI><A HREF="Meadow-6.5.3.html"> 6.5.3 Word and Phrase Parsing </A></UL><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-6.4.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-6.5.1.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-6.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
