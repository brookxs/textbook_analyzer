A knowledge base can have credence in a way because it makes judgments on what information to provide based on the way it was programmed.  It is important to note that information, knowledge, meaningful, and wisdom are not inherent in the data.  They are something that a person possesses.  When a person has knowledge of a certain subject they are easily able to spot errors that can occur in data.  A novice user may have the same data and not be able to see the error.  This highlights the importance of communication between record creators and users.  It is important to realize that there are many different ways to express and idea and that must be taken into account when designing and building an IRS.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-2.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-2.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-2.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
