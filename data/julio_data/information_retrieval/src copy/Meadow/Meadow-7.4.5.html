When searching for a word it is important to remember that there can be several different forms that mean the same thing.  For example, electric is the same thing as electrical and electricity.  By using the wild card character, it is possible to find all words beginning with electri.  This can cause an increase in false drops.  In the case of green*, all text containing greene, greenleaf, and greenspan would be returned.  In many systems it is possible to use a wildcard and specify how many letters can replace the wildcard.  A few systems allow the wildcard at the beginning of a word.  However this uses a lot of resources and should only be used on small sets.  Most commercial systems do not allow this.  It is also possible to search for phrases, however they must be stored in the inverted index or thesaurus.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-7.4.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-7.4.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-7.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
