It is important to realize that judgment is needed to translate a user's information need into a query that the IRS can understand.  This judgment can come from a person.  In the case of a natural language IRS, the judgment is within the system.  A query is defined as the user or intermediary's statement to the IRS.  It is usually stated in a query language.  A successful query is one that retrieves all the information the user wants without a lot of unwanted information.  This must be done at a reasonable cost.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-7.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-7.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-7.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
