First, the user determines that they have an information need.  This is sometimes called an anomalous state of knowledge (ASK).  The user may not have a clear-cut definition of what they need, but they know that they need something.  The need is expressed to an intermediary who determines a strategy to fulfill the need.  Miscommunication can occur during this portion of the process.  From the strategy created, the intermediary formulates a query to retrieve the information from the IRS.  Lastly the computer processes the query.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-1.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.3.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
