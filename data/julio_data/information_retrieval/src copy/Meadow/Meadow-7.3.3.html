It defines the operations that can be performed on sets.  There are several different operators.  They are AND, OR, NOT, and EXCLUSIVE OR.  The AND operator specifies a subset as the records that are in both sets being used.  The OR operator takes all records that are in at least one of the sets.  The NOT operator uses one set.  It specifies all records that are not in the set.  This operator can be used incorrectly if the user is not careful.  The EXCLUSIVE OR specifies records that are in one of the two sets, but not in both of them.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-7.3.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-7.3.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-7.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
