This is done through a query.  The concept of selectivity is very important.  The user does not want to be given lots of useless information.  The specific user need has to be answered.  IR is also thought of as a communication process, where the authors of documents are able to communicate with their readers.  An information retrieval system (IRS) is a computer-based information retrieval system.  Interactive IR is basically an IRS where information is flowing between the user and the database.  Previously, the major problem facing IR was determining how to represent documents.  The focus has now switched to determining how to match a user's information need to the documents stored in the database.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-1.1.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
