First they query must be interpreted.  The terms are parsed out and are then looked up in the index.  All records that match the query are identified.  The user is told how many records were retrieved and is given several options.  The user can browse the records, look up other search terms in the index, or revise the query.  The retrieved records are prepared for presentation and sent to the user.  In some cases the user is charged a fee for each query.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-1.3.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.3.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
