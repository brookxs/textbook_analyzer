In Boolean retrieval systems, retrieval is based on mapping of document space into query space. Each document that is mapped is transformed into a representation compatible with the query to evaluate the query requirements.<p>If query cannot be included in document space, characteristic function, that is, function having the value 1 on documents relevant to the query and 0 on documents that are not relevant, is used for evaluation.<p>Measure is an evaluation of each document on the basis of some computable function to match the query given. Relevance of a document to a query is difficult to measure directly. Therefore, most retrieval systems equate relevance with lexical similarity, that is the matching of words relevant to the query and 0 on documents that are not relevant, is used for evaluation.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-3.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-4.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-3.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
