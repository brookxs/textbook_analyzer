Concept of information has both personal and time-dependent components that are not present in the concept of data.<p>Three more concepts are of important emphasis on information processing.  They are:<p><ol><li>	Signal - must be transmitted from one place to another during information processing. The study of signal processing is called the transmission theory or information theory.<li>	Knowledge - builds upon information, integrating any new information with that previously known to form a large, coherent view of a portion of reality. In artificial intelligence, knowledge base is typically constructed by attempting to incorporate into the stored data and algorithms various facts, concepts, and rules that are representative of one or more selected experts in a particular area. The system built on this knowledge base is called the expert system.<li>	Wisdom - adds to knowledge a broader view, encompassing all of known reality, and governing the use of the information that has been obtained and the knowledge that has been developed.</ol><p>The development of knowledge and wisdom depends on access to good information. This development depends on efficient and effective information storage and retrieval.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-1.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-1.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
