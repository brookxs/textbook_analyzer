Relative recall addresses more directly the question of how many documents the user wants. <p>Another user-related measure is called the recall effort, that is, the ratio of the number of relevant documents desired to the number of documents examined by the user to find the number of relevant documents desired.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-8.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-8.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-7.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
