Then conversion to a text file format is required, using the OCR. Smudged, misalignment, skewed printing and incomplete printing may result in very poor OCR performance.<p>Several techniques are employed in OCR software to improve recognition capabilities:<p><ul><li>	To make use of context to resolve ambiguities in recognition.<li>	Graphical alterations of characters such as assign missing bits or adding an extra border to a character.<li>	Segmentation of the document image based on the fact that text image usually have several components that may be a title block, sentence or paragraphs.</ul><p>Basic output from the OCR processing is an ASCII text file but there is also an increasing interest in incorporating SGML or HTML as the resulting file.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-12.1.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-12.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-11.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
