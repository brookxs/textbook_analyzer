These definite fields make sit possible to determine exactly whether the value of a given term matches the value specified by in the query.<p>Range match is a type of matching that accepts a range of values for each term. Range matches are possible on terms that have a natural order (numerical order or alphabetical order) so that it is meaningful to specify a term be greater than some minimum value or less than some maximum value.<p>Most text or image databases are not well adapted to exact or range matching. These types of queries posed are not precise. Therefore, a good approximate match to a query is required to measure how well a given document matches a query. The goal is to satisfy information need exactly and user must settle for approximately matching a query.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-2.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-3.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-2.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
