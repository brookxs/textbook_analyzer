One way to solve this is to have the value for any term not specifically included in or excluded from the query to be left undefined.<p>Vector model arises another problem from the relationships among the terms in a document or query.  Results for vector model are defined from a linearly independent set of basis vectors. Linearly independent vector is a set of vectors such that no linear combination adds up to the zero vector. Basis vector is set of vectors from which all vectors within a given vector space can be defined. In the document context, this would mean defining a document by means of terms that have no relationships among themselves. Terms that are used to define the vector model is clearly not independent: a digital computer, for example, is much more common than digital canary.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-4.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-4.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-3.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
