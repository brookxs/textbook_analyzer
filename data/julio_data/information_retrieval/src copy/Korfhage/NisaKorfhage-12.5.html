Retrieving relevant documents from this vast collection of document is difficult.<p>Many search engines are developed to help users deposit query to get the relevant documents but this method can be inefficient and ineffective due to the search engines that are developed by people with little background and training in information retrieval.<p>Most searches in the Web find no relevant documents among the first 20 results with document ranking methods that are inappropriately used. This area is still improving as many companies are trying to develop techniques for improving Web searching.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-12.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-12.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-11.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
