For these reasons, it is common to define a stop list, or negative dictionary, consisting of such words.</ul><p><p>When a text is initially processed, each word occurrence is checked against the stop list. If the word is found there, it is ignored in any further processing. In organizing a retrieval system that uses phrases, the use of stop words must be carefully considered, as these are frequently words that identify significant phrases. <p>To perform the stop list checking, it takes time. Various techniques and algorithms are used to minimize processing time. Hashing technique is a technique focused on being able to determine whether a word is on a stop list with just one computation and one comparison, and hence, reduce time in processing. Stop lists can also be structured into a trie where each word is checked character by character against the stop list.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-5.7.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-5.9.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-4.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
