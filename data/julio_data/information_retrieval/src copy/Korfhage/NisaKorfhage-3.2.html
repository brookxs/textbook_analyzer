The connectives permitted are AND, OR, and NOT. These connectives are sufficient to express logical combination of terms to be search in a query.<p>The AND requires that both terms this connects be present in the retrieved document whereas the use of OR requires that at least one of the terms be present. This type of OR is also called the inclusive OR, meaning that it is acceptable for both terms to be present. An exclusive OR looks for documents that have one term or the other, but not both. <p>The search can also be expanded using the stemming and the thesaurus for a list of related terms. Some retrieval systems allows proximity operators, so that user can specify "icing within three words of chocolate" and a few conditional queries ("if icing then chocolate"). <p>Despite its simplicity, the Boolean query presents some problems such that there is no good way to weight terms for significance. The order of precedence for the logical connectives can also present confusion as there are two standards of order. One follows the grouping of precedence according to the grouped terms using the parentheses and another type of system follows the left-to-right precedence.<p>Every Boolean query can be recast into either disjunctive normal form (DNF), or conjunctive normal form (CNF) each of which provides a standard form that is easy to process. <p>There are three levels of expression in a DNF:<p><ol><li>	Terms, which are individual words or phrases that occur either naturally or negated.<li>	Conjuncts, which are terms joined by AND.<li>	Disjuncts, which are conjuncts joined by OR.</ol><p><p>A CNF is similarly defined, with roles of AND and OR interchanged. Terms are joined together by OR to form disjuncts and these are joined by AND to form conjuncts.<p>The process of transforming a Boolean query into either DNF or CNF is called normalization. Normalization of an arbitrary Boolean query is most easily accomplished through the use of a truth table. In a truth table, each row has a value of wither true or false.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-3.1.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-3.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-2.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
