An index is constructed on the basis of an indexing language, or vocabulary, consisting of a set of index items. These terms may be single words, longer phrases, or both.<p>Indexing is the act of assigning index terms to a document that may be carried out manually or automatically. In either situation, the indexing language may be controlled, that is limited to a predefined set of index terms, or uncontrolled, allowing use of any term that fits some broad criteria.<p>One problem in indexing is the lack of consistency to create or assign the same index terms to a given document because indexing requires the use of several indexers that have no standardization in classifying terms. <p>Two characteristics of indexing language are:<p><ul><li>	Exhaustivity - refers to the breadth of coverage of the index terms - the extent to which all topics and concepts met in a document set are covered.<li>	Specificity - refers to the depth of coverage - the extent to which specific topic ideas are indexed in detail.</ul><p>Varying level of exhaustivity and specificity is used in indexing. The imposition of controlled vocabulary may alleviate the lack of consistency problem to some extent.<p>Another problem with manual indexing is indexer-user mismatch where the indexer and the user represent the same concepts by quite differently. The use of controlled vocabulary does little help in this situation.<p>The concept of links and roles are sometimes used to characterize the occurrence of terms in an indexing language.  Two terms are linked together if they occur together. A term in an index may occur in one or more roles, indicating its function or usage. Prepositional phrases may identify the roles that a given word assumes.<p>Cross-referencing is used to enhance the usability of an indexing language where reference to one index term automatically produces references to related terms.<p>In automatic indexing, an algorithm is used to decide which index terms shall be used to represent document. Almost all automatic indexing algorithms are based in some way on the frequency of occurrence of words within a document and words that are content-bearing. Content-bearing words are words that are of likely to be of importance to the document.<p>A major use of index is to create an inverted file of documents that lists the documents containing each term rather than the terms contained in each document.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-5.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-4.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
