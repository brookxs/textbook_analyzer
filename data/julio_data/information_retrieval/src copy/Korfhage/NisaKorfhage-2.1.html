A larger body of data is a collection of smaller documents.<p>A query, on the other hand has different interpretations according to various researchers. Some cite the query to be typically shorter that a document to be retrieved and that the query is different from the documents being sought that it should not be considered a document. Some researchers regard queries as document despite its difference from other documents. For example, in the TREC experiments, the queries are presented in the form of topics that have specific formats and characteristics of a document. Thus, a query should be considered to be a document in this literature.<p>If a query is considered to be a document, the retrieval process used is a process of matching one document to another. If, however, queries are considered to be distinct from documents, the retrieval process becomes one of mapping documents onto queries. Mapping involves transforming the document into a form or structure that can be directly matched to a query.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-2.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
