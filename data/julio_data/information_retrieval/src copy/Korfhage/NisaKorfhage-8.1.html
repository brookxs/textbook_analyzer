There are binary and n-ary measure that can be used in user's evaluation.<p>A binary measure is simplest but presents only a coarse judgment for the user. Each document is either accepted or rejected according to the relevance of the document defined by the user. Difficulties in this measure includes:<p><ul><li>	Relevance in itself is ill-defined.<li>	The user has three representations - the need, the question, and the query - against which to judge document.</ul><p><p>To be precise, relevance of the document relates to how well the document responds to the query that was asked. How well the document responds to the information need is pertinence. Usefulness is a combination of relevance and pertinence that refer documents that are retrieved but not relevant to the information need present but might be relevant to another information need.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-7.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-8.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-7.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
