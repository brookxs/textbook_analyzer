Text consists of string of characters that has a structure to aid readability and interpretation. The syntax, semantics and pragmatics of a sentence help determine matches for user's information need.<p>Markup languages constitute one class of tools available for interpretation of text document. Markup language provides a set of instructions for computer based formatting, organization and typesetting of a text for retrieval. Widely used markup language today is SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language. SGML identifies within the documents the title, author, section titles, paragraph boundaries and the location of nontextual elements. A subset of SGML is HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language that is used to compose Web pages for the World Wide Web.<p>Scanning of documents that exist on paper involve segmentation. Segmentation is the identification of the various pieces, textual and nontextual, of a document. In this process, the syntactic and semantic methods are used in piecing together text that ahs been separated by graphical elements such as a figure or table.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-2.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-2.8.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
