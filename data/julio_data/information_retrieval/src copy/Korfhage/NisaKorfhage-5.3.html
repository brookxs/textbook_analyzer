Numerous studies show that if the words in a text are ranked in order or decreasing frequency, they follow a relationship known as Zipf's law:<p>Rank X frequency = constant<p>The law implies that the frequency of words in a text falls off very rapidly for the most frequently occurring words, then more and more gradually as words occur more rarely.<p>Zipf's law makes 2 observations:<p><ol><li>	The most common words have little specific relationship to the content (topic) of documents within a given collection.<li>	There will likely be a large number of words that occur only once, twice, three times within a document collections.</ol><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-5.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-5.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-4.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
