There are two kinds of format:<p><ol><li>	Fully formatted documents<ul><li>	Includes data found in relational, network, or hierarchical databases.<li>	Each document consists of predefines number of fields that has a predefined size and position in    the document.<li>	Excellent for exact retrieval of exact data or data falling within a specific range of values.<li>	Less appropriate for storage of imprecise data and for response to imprecise queries.</ul>	Fully unformatted data<ul><li>	Includes documents for which the only structure is the order imposed by the process of recording them.<li>	Retrieval depends on complete scans of the document set.</ul></ol><p><p>Many documents are an intermediate form or mixed form, largely unformatted but including some formatted portions. Therefore, two retrieval processes might be the most efficient - that is by rough retrieval based on formatted portion of the document and then refining the unformatted to locate the desired items.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-2.1.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-2.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
