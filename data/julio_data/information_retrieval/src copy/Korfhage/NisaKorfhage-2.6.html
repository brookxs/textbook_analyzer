Document surrogates may be regard as a crude form of data compression, since they represent relatively large documents in small number of bytes.  <p>One compression technique used is stemming, or the removal of grammatical suffixes, converting a set of related words to a common root form.<p>Two decisions may impact the effect of any data compression:<p><ol><li>	Level of compression - compression can be done either at the character or word level.<li>	Data model used includes:<ul><li>	A static model - constructed by examining a sample of text and constructing statistical table representing this sample.<li>	An adaptive model - begins with a priori statistical distribution for the text symbols but modifies the distribution as each character or word is encoded.<li>	Semi-static model - a compromise between static model and the adaptive model.</ul></ol><p>There are three types of codes used for text compression:<p><ol><li>	Huffman code - is based on the frequency distribution of the symbols to be encoded, whether characters or words.<li>	Ziv-Lempel codes - is based on identifying each text segment the first time and simply pointing back to the first occurrence rather than repeating the segment.<li>	Arithmetic codes - is based on the text stream represented by a number whose digits reflect the statistical frequency distribution of the symbols.</ol><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-2.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-2.7.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
