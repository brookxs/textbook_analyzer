The values of C can be used to derive an operating curve to a given information retrieval system by plotting the points &lt;%P1, %P2&gt; corresponding to the values of C. <p>The shape of the curve will depend on the relationship of C to relevance. If high values of C are correlated strongly with relevance, the curve will rise sharply toward high values of %P1. If the documents in P1 and P2 each form a normal distribution with respect to C, then the operating curve is a straight line whose slope depends on the relationship of the characteristic to relevance.<p>Swets' E measure is determined by measuring the distance of a point from the operating curve for measuring the system effectiveness.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-8.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-8.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-7.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
