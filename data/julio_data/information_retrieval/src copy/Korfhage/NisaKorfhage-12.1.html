Increasingly, access to full document is being held by a computer. A user can immediately order a document upon scanning the surrogate of a document available in on-line systems. Fully electronic books and journal are increasingly becoming available on-line but hardcopy of documents are still largely available, some of which are still not accessible using a computer. <p>The need to convert documents into electronic is becoming more important. Document scanners of high resolution and accuracy have been developed, accompanied by optical character recognition software (OCR) designed to convert scanned images into character files that can then be processed by customary text processing and information retrieval software.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-11.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-12.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-11.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
