If similarity is measured by distance, a document must be judged for retrieval not only on its distance from the query point but also on its distance from the profile point. Judgments are based on these two distances, using query and profile as co-filters. <p>There are four ways to combine query and profile distances:<p><ol><li>	Disjunctive model - requires a document be within distance d of either the query or the profile.<li>	Conjunctive model - requires the distances from a document to both the query and the profile within the limit fixed.<li>	Ellipsoidal model - requires the sum of the two distances be within a prescribed limit.<li>	Cassini oval model - requires the product of the distances from document and query be within a prescribed limit.</ol><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-6.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-6.7.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-5.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
