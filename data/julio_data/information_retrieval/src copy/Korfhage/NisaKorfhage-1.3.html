However, performance evaluation of the system is dictated by the members of the ectosystem. There are 3 types of measures for an information system:<p><ol><li>	Effectiveness of the system - mainly evaluated by the user in terms of how well the system meets his or her information need.<li>	Efficiency of the system - the server tends to be more aware of how well the system is designed to efficiently express the user's information needs, how much time the system takes in locating data and whether the algorithms and structures chosen by the system minimizes the effort needed to perform major tasks.<li>	Economy of the system - the funder is mainly concern on the system that meets the economic goals set.</ol><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-1.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-1.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
