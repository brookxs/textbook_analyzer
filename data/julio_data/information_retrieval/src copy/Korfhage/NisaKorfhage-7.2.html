It is also possible to define a reference point from a group of related documents. This can be done by defining a document cluster and determine one or more cluster points that represents the cluster.<p>Clustering techniques are based on statistical techniques or graph theory. Some systems generate clusters that are distinct, that is, each object is in only one cluster; others generate overlapping clusters. Some clusters begin with everything in one cluster, then successively break this into smaller clusters. Other techniques work in the opposite direction. <p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-7.1.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-7.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-6.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
