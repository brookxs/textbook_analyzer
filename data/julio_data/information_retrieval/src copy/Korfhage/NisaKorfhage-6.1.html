Such profiles were originally developed for use in current awareness system (CA) or selective dissemination of information (SDI) that is commonly used where there is relatively fixed body of users with persistent interests.<p>Profile acts as a standard query that can be run periodically against updates to the database. The term routing query has recently been introduced to describe a persistent query such as a profile, in contrast to an ad hoc query, which typically is asked just once.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-5.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-6.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-5.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
