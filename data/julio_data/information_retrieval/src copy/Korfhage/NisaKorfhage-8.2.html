Recall is defines as the proportion of relevant documents that are retrieved. Precision and recall are both bounded above by 1 and below by 0. In general precision and recall has an inverse relationship. Precision falls and recalls rises as the number of documents retrieved in response to a query is increased. This relationship can be demonstrated in a smoothed precision-recall graph. Retrieval of a relevant document increases both precision and recall, while retrieval of a nonrelevant document decreases precision but does not affect recall.<p>Fallout is the proportion of nonrelevant documents that are not retrieved. Generality is the proportion of relevant documents within the entire collection.<p>There are there major problem of precision recall measures:<p><ul><li>	While precision can be determined exactly, recall cannot.<li>	It is not clear that recall and precision are significant to the user.<li>	Recall and precision are related to each other, and each alone provides an incomplete picture of the retrieval systems.</ul><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-8.1.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-8.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-7.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
