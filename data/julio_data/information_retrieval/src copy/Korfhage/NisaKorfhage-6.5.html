Therefore, a query made to the system need to be modified according to the user profile. <p>There are a number of ways to use the profile to modify the query or its interpretation. One of the ways is to use the profile as a post-filter on the query, that is, the query is processed normally and then the results are organized according to the user's profile. This moves the query point directly towards the profile point.<p>Another way is the pre-filter that makes use of the user profile to modify the query to be processed by the system. The concept of document space underlies this method of profile use. Simple linear transformation is a simple way to modify a query based on the user profile linearly. A more complex algorithm is called the piecewise linear transformation that modifies individual term weights depending on how the terms occur in the query and profile.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-6.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-6.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-5.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
