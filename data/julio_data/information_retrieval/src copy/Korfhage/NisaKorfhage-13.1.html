At the same time, the user is the central to the system, for it is the user who has information need and who ultimately decides whether the system will be used or not. However, the efficient measure of a system usually is developed without much regard to the user's applicability.  Measurements such as the coverage ratio, novelty ratio, and relative recall raise the issue of whether precision and recall are appropriate measures at all.<p>One aspect of the user impact that is often overlooked is the fact that the users have distinct information needs. It is easier to address this problem when the system is a closed system serving a limited, homogeneous, and stable group of users. <p>The emergence of World Wide Web has added more complexity to the problem of providing good information access to users. Search engines are developed to provide help in searches in the Web but it mostly handles simple queries of list of words. <p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-12.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-13.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-12.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
