The effects of sequentiality are:<p><ul><li>	The examination of one document affects the user's judgment of all documents that follow it.<li>	Mixed documents of relevant and nonrelevant documents may stop users from retrieving relevant documents that follow nonrelevant documents.</ul><p><p>Normalized recall is an ideal system to which all relevant documents are retrieved before any of the nonrelevant ones.  A step function graph is developed such that an ideal graph is a graph that will rise one unit as each of the relevant documents is retrieved, to a maximum value equal to the number of relevant documents in the collection. The difference between an actual graph and an ideal graph is a measure of the performance of the retrieval system. A normalized precision can also be developed on the same idea as the normalized recall.<p>The sliding ratio is another measure similar to normalized recall but differ in two ways:<p><ol><li>	It is developed on the basis of weighted relevance judgments.<li>	It is based on the retrieval of N documents for some specified value of N, rather than on the full set of relevant documents.</ol><p><p>There are three measures similar to sliding ratio:<p><ol><li>	Satisfaction measure, which considers only the relevant documents.<li>	Frustration measure, which considers only the nonrelevant documents.<li>	Total measure, a weighted combination of satisfaction and frustration.</ol><p><p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-8.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-8.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-7.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
