The syntactic structure of a document is the way in which it is written, following the grammatical or structural rules of the language. Thus the syntax of a sentence is focused on its structure rather than its meaning.  <p>Syntactic analysis suffers from a number of problems:<p><ul><li>	Syntactic ambiguity - the existence of sentences that can be assigned more than one syntactic structure.<li>	Deep structure - the structure of a sentence related to its meaning, independent of the specific syntax used.<li>	There is no guarantee in which a sentence that is syntactically correct is semantically correct.<li>	Syntactic approach assumes that the language to be handled is syntactically correct.</ul><p>Semantic analysis involves analyzing a text to determine its meaning. In retrieval system, there is a need to match the meaning of a document to the meaning of a query. Semantic structure of a document is the way sentences are structure based on the meaning. One semantic analysis technique is the latent semantic indexing that uses multidimensional scaling methods to identify major concepts in a document, in contrast to simply the vocabulary words used.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-9.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-10.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-9.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
