BIRD provides similar, but more limited approach to meeting information needs. <p>These three systems emphasize different aspects of information processing. GUIDO focuses on the problem of retrieving document sets. VIBE uses the similarity ratios and this reduces its effectiveness as a retrieval tool. BIRD focuses on constructing bibliographic lists of documents with interface most directly tied to the ultimate information need.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-7.7.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-7.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-6.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
