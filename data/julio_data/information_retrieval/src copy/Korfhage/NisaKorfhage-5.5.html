Relative term frequency is term frequency counts that have been adjusted to take into account the document and collection sizes and characteristics.<p>Inverse document frequency weight is a method for viewing term frequencies in the context of a specific document collection where the frequency of a term in a document is weighted by the number of documents in the collection that contain the term. If the term occurs in many of the documents in the collection, then it does not serve well as a document identifier and should be given a low weight as a potential index term.<p> A different measure of the value of a term for indexing and retrieval is based on information theory and is called the signal-to noise ratio. The basis of the theory is the definition of the information content of a given signal or sequence of words. The term discrimination value is a measure of how well a term will distinguish one document from another. This requires a way to measure the similarity of two documents.<p>Phrase frequency is another method to index documents. Weighting can also be applied to phrases to measure importance of the phrases in the documents. Phrases can be broken down into words in the process and the word proximity is applied to provide more information to help indexing better.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-5.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-5.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-4.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
