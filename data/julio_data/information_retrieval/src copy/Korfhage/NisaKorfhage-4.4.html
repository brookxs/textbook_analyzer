Using the cosine transforms the angular measure into a measure ranging from 1 for the highest to 0 for the lowest.<p>The distance and angular measures represent two distinct approaches o the judgment of similarity. Distance measures are intrinsic, that is, similarity depends only on how far a given document is from the point. <p>Angular measures are extrinsic, representing a view of the document space from a fixed point, the origin. Angular measure does not consider the distance of each document from the origin, but only the direction. Hence, two documents that lie along the same vector from the origin will be judged identically, despite the fact that they may be far apart in the document space.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-4.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-4.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-3.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
