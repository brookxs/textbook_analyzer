Ectosystem consists of factors that are not under the control of the system designer. Ectosystem has three main components:<p><ol><li>	The user - the person stores or retrieves information from the information system.<li>	The funder - the person or organization who underwrites the cost of operating the information system.<li>	The server - the information professional who operates the system and provides service to the users.</ol><p>Endosystem consists of factors that a designer can specify and control that has four components:<p><ol><li>	Media - includes various forms of hard copy, such as printed text and machine-readable media, such as magnetic tapes and disks, and CD-ROMs.<li>	Devices - ranges from file drawers to digital computers, scanners and laser-based processing equipment.<li>	Algorithms - the most efficient one is chosen for processing stored information and queries for an effective and efficient information system.<li>	Data structures - chosen based on algorithms and applications of the system.</ol><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-1.1.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-1.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
