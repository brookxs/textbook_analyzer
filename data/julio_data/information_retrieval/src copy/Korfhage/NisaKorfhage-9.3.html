Therefore, several hills that might be climbed are identified and examined, with the best few of these hills chosen for further processing.<p>Replication of the solutions creates a breeding population, from which new solutions will be generated, or bred. The breeding is accompanied by an exchange of some of the characteristics of the chosen solutions in a crossover operation. <p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-9.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-9.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-8.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
