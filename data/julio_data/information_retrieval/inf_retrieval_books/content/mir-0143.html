 8.5    Sequential Searching We now cover the algorithms for text searching when no data structure has been built on the text. As shown, this is a basic part of some indexing techniques as well as the only option in some cases. We cover exact string matching in this section. Later we cover matching of more complex patterns. Our exposition is mainly conceptual and the implementation details are not shown (see the Bibliographic Discussion at the end of this chapter for more information). The problem of exact string matching is: given a short pattern P of length m and a long text T of length n, find all the text positions where the pattern occurs. With minimal changes this problem subsumes many basic queries, such as word, prefix, suffix, and substring search. This is a classical problem for which a wealth of solutions exists. We sketch the main algorithms, and leave aside a lot of the theoretical work that is not competitive in practice. For example, we do not include the Karp-Rabin algorithm, which is a nice application of hashing to string searching, but is not practical. We also briefly cover multipattern algorithms (that search many patterns at once), since a query may have many patterns and it may be more efficient to retrieve them all at once. Finally, we also mention how to do phrases and proximity searches. We assume that the text and the pattern are sequences of characters drawn from an alphabet of size lt;r, whose first character is at position 1. The average-case analysis assumes random text and patterns.
