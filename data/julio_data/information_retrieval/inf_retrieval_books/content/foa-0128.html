 INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      221  6.4.1 AI Genealogy  The AI Genealogy project (AIG) is an attempt to collect information relating authors in artificial intelligence to one another through shared advisors. In analogy to genealogical family trees, we can treat the advisor as a parent to the advisee. Students of students become grandchildren, and so on. A subset of this data is shown in Figure 6.17.  As an example of how this additional information about authors can be exploited to understand more about the words used in documents, Steier has analyzed word-pair cooccurrence data as a means of finding potential index phrases [Steier and Belew, 1994b]. Take, for example, the phrase CASE-BASED REASONING. This phrase has a high degree of phrasal information content (using mutual information statistics to identify statistically dependent word pairs) when these statistics are collected across the entire AIT document corpus.  But a statistically significant different distribution is observed within dissertations coming from a particular set of universities: Yale, Georgia Tech, and the University of Massachusetts. Within these particular university contexts, the constituent concepts of CASE-BASED and REASONING are examined in detail and independently. Not only do these words occur together as CASE-BASED REASONING, but they often occur separately (e.g., CASE-BASED PLANNING, CASE-BASED ARGUMENT, CASE-BASED PROBLEM, SCHEMA-BASED REASONING, ANALOGICAL REASONING, COMMONSENSE REASONING). Within the limited context of these subcorpora, the keywords occur more independently and hence are considered less phraselike. As this phrase is "exported" into the general AI vocabulary, the semantic nuances are left behind, and the dominant use of the constituent words is as part of the phrase.  What is it that makes language use so different at Yale, Georgia Tech, and the University of Massachusetts? Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but our hypothesis is that it is the common lineage traced to Roger Schank! Work across these geographically distant research institutions is pulled together by an intellectual tradition captured by the AIG data.  Part of what is interesting about the AIT corpus is its demonstration within a single corpus of many of the representations discussed in this chapter. The AI genealogy captures some of the intellectual linkage due 222       FINDING OUT ABOUT  McCulloch, W.
