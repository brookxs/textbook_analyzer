 8.4    Boolean Queries We now cover set manipulation algorithms.   These algorithms are used when operating on sets of results, which is the case in Boolean queries. Boolean queries are described in Chapter 4, where the concept of query syntax tree is defined. Once the leaves of the query syntax tree are solved (using the algorithms to find the documents containing the basic queries given), the relevant documents must be worked on by composition operators. Normally the search proceeds in three phases: the first phase determines which documents classify, the second determines the relevance of the classifying documents so as to present them appropriately to the user, and the final phase retrieves the exact positions of the matches to highlight them in those documents that the user actually wants to see. This scheme avoids doing unnecessary work on documents which will not classify at last (first phase), or will not be read at last (second phase). However, some phases can be merged if doing the extra operations is not expensive. Some phases may not be present at all in some scenarios. 208        INDEXING AND SEARCHING AND                                                        AND lt;Âªgt;     /    \           /    \ 146        OR                       146      23467 (b) AND 246       237 OR 2   4         OR 2   4         OR 3   4         OR 4 3       4                     3       4                     7       6 Figure 8.12   Processing the internal nodes of the query syntax tree.    In (a) full evaluation is used. In (b) we show lazy evaluation in more detailOnce the leaves of the query syntax tree find the classifying sets of documents, these sets are further operated by the internal nodes of the tree. It is possible to algebraically optimize the tree using identities such as a OR (a AND b) = a, for instance, or sharing common subexpressions, but we do not cover this issue here. As all operations need to pair the same document in both their operands, it is good practice to keep the sets sorted, so that operations like intersection, union, etc. can proceed sequentially on both lists and also generate a sorted list. Other representations for sets not consisting of the list of matching documents (such as bit vectors) are also possible. Under this scheme, it is possible to evaluate the syntax tree in full or lazy form. In the full evaluation form, both operands are first completely obtained and then the complete result is generated. In lazy evaluation, results are delivered only when required, and to obtain that result some data is recursively required to both operands. Full evaluation allows some optimizations to be performed because the sizes of the results are known in advance (for instance, merging a very short list against a very long one can proceed by binary searching the elements of the short list in the long one). Lazy evaluation, on the other hand, allows the application to control when to do the work of obtaining new results, instead of blocking it for a long time. Hybrid schemes are possible, for example obtain all the leaves at once and then proceed in lazy form. This may be useful, for instance, to implement some optimizations or to ensure that all the accesses to the index are sequential (thus reducing disk seek times). Figure 8.12 illustrates this. The complexity of solving these types of queries, apart from the cost of obtaining the results at the leaves, is normally linear in the total size of all the intermediate results. This is why this time may dominate the others, when there are huge intermediate results. This is more noticeable to the user when the final result is small.
