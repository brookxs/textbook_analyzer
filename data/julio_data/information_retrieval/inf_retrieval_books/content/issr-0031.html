Users tend to have areas of interest within which they execute their searches on a regular basis. A canned query allows a user to create and refine a search that focuses on the user's general area of interest one time and then retrieve it to add additional search criteria to retrieve data that is currently needed. For example, a user may be responsible for European investments. Rather than always having to create a query that limits the search to European geographic search terms and then the specific question requiring resolution, a canned query can be created with all the needed geographic terms and used as a starting point for additional query specification. Significant effort can go into making the canned query into a comprehensive and focused search since it is created once but used many times with additional search terms for specific information needs. Queries that start with a canned query are significantly larger than ad hoc queries. Canned query features also allow for variables to be inserted into the query and bound to specific values at execution time.
