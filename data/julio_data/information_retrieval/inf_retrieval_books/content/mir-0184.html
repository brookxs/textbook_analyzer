 10.3.1    Models of interaction Most accounts of the information access process assume an interaction cycle consisting of query specification, receipt and examination of retrieval results, and then either stopping or reformulating the query and repeating the process THE INFORMATION ACCESS PROCESS        263 until a perfect result set is found [700, 726]. In more detail, the standard process can be described according to the following sequence of steps (see Figure 10.2): (1)  Start with an information need. (2)  Select a system and collections to search on. (3)  Formulate a query. (4)  Send the query to the system. (5)  Receive the results in the form of information items. (6)  Scan, evaluate, and interpret the results. (7)  Either stop, or, (8)  Reformulate the query and go to step 4. This simple interaction model (used by Web search engines) is the only model that most information seekers see today. This model does not take into account the fact that many users dislike being confronted with a long disorganized list of retrieval results that do not directly address their information needs. It also contains an underlying assumption that the user's information need is static and the information seeking process is one of successively refining a query until it retrieves all and only those documents relevant to the original information need.

A simplified diagram of the standard model of the information access 264        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION In actuality, users learn during the search process. They scan information, read the titles in result sets, read the retrieved documents themselves, viewing lists of topics related to their query terms, and navigating within hyperlinked Web sites. The recent advent of hyperlinks as a pivotal part of the information seeking process makes it no longer feasible to ignore the role of scanning and navigation within the search process itself. In particular, today a near-miss is much more acceptable than it was with bibliographic search, since an information seeker using the Web can navigate hyperlinks from a near-miss in the hopes that a useful page will be a few links away. The standard model also downplays the interaction that takes place when the user scans terms suggested as a result of relevance feedback, scans thesaurus structures, or views thematic overviews of document collections. It de-emphasizes the role of source selection, which is increasingly important now that, for the first time, tens of thousands of information collections are immediately reachable for millions of people. Thus, while useful for describing the basics of information access systems, this simple interaction model is being challenged on many fronts [65, 614, 105, 365, 192]. Bates [65] proposes the 'berry-picking' model of information seeking, which has two main points. The first is that, as a result of reading and learning from the information encountered throughout the search process, the users' information needs, and consequently their queries, continually shift. Information encountered at one point in a search may lead in a new, unanticipated direction. The original goal may become partly fulfilled, thus lowering the priority of one goal in favor of another. This is posed in contrast to the assumption of 'standard' information retrieval that the user's information need remains the same throughout the search process. The second point is that users' information needs are not satisfied by a single, final retrieved set of documents, but rather by a series of selections and bits of information found along the way. This is in contrast to the assumption that the main goal of the search process is to hone down the set of retrieved documents into a perfect match of the original information need. The berry-picking model is supported by a number of observational studies [236, 105], including that of O'Day and Jeffries [614]. They found that the information seeking process consisted of a series of interconnected but diverse searches on one problem-based theme. They also found that search results for a goal tended to trigger new goals, and hence search in new directions, but that the context of the problem and the previous searches was carried from one stage of search to the next. They also found that the main value of the search resided in the accumulated learning and acquisition of information that occurred during the search process, rather than in the final results set. Thus, a user interface for information access should allow users to reassess their goals and adjust their search strategy accordingly. A related situation occurs when users encounter a 'trigger' that causes them to pursue a different strategy temporarily, perhaps to return to the current unfinished activity at a later time. An implication of these observations is that the user interface should support search strategies by making it easy to follow trails with unanticipated results. This can be accomplished in part by supplying ways to record the progress THE INFORMATION ACCESS PROCESS        265 of the current strategy and to store, find, and reload intermediate results, and by supporting pursuit of multiple strategies simultaneously. The user interface should also support methods for monitoring the status of the current strategy in relation to the user's current task and high-level goals. One way to cast the activity of monitoring the progress of a search strategy relative to a goal or subgoal is in terms of a cost/benefit analysis, or an analysis of diminishing returns [690]. This kind of analysis assumes that at any point in the search process, the user is pursuing the strategy that has the highest expected utility. If, as a consequence of some local tactical choices, another strategy presents itself as being of higher utility than the current one, the current one is (temporarily or permanently) abandoned in favor of the new strategy. There are a number of theories and frameworks that contrast browsing, querying, navigating, and scanning along several dimensions [75, 159, 542, 804]. Here we assume that users scan information structure, be it titles, thesaurus terms, hyperlinks, category labels, or the results of clustering, and then either select a displayed item for some purpose (to read in detail, to use as input to a query, to navigate to a new page of information) or formulate a query (either by recalling potential words or by selecting categories or suggested terms that have been scanned). In both cases, a new set of information is then made viewable for scanning. Queries tend to produce new, ad hoc collections of information that have not been gathered together before, whereas selection retrieves information that has already been composed or organized. Navigation refers to following a chain of links, switching from one view to another, toward some goal, in a sequence of scan and select operations. Browsing refers to the casual, mainly undirected exploration of information structures, and is usually done in tandem with selection, although queries can also be used to create subcollections to browse through. An important aspect of the interaction process is that the output of one action should be easily used as the input to the next.
