 4.2.1 Using relevance feedback for Query Refinement  While Figure 4.2 showed the retrieved set of documents as a simple set, it is interesting to impose the relevance feedback labeling on the retrieved documents viewed in vector space. Figure 4.4 shows a query vector and a number of retrieved documents, together with a plausible distribution of relevance feedback over them. That is, we can expect that there Is some localized region in vector space where © relevant documents are most likely to occur. If we believe that these positively labeled retrieved documents are in fact clustered, it becomes appropriate to consider a hypothetical centroid 112      FINDING OUT ABOUT  FIGURE 4.4 relevance feedback Labels in Vector Space  FIGURE 4.5 Various Ways of Being Irrelevant  (average) document d+gt; which is at the center of all those documents that users have identified as relevant.  It is less reasonable* however, to imagine that the negatively labeled 9 documents are similarly clustered. Documents that were inappropriately retrieved failed to be relevant for one reason or another; there may be several such reasons. These are shown as discriminating planes in Figure 4.5. ASSESSING THE RETRIEVAL       113  -bcT  FIGURE 4.6 Using relevance feedback to Refine the Query  The vector space view also lets us easily portray two very different uses to which relevance feedback information might be applied. Most typically, relevance feedback is used to refine the user's query. Figure 4.6 represents this refinement in terms of two changes we can make to the initial query vector. The first is to "take a step toward" the centroid of the positive relevance feedback cluster. The size of this stept reflects how confident we are that the positive cluster centroid is a better characterization of the user's interests than the original query.  There is one important difference between the query and even a slight perturbation of it toward a cluster's centroid: While the original query vector is often very sparse and results from just those few words used in the user's original query, any movement toward the centroid will include (linear combinations of) all those keywords used in any of the positively labeled documents. The additional difficulty in implementing this more densely filled feature vector becomes a serious obstacle in many system implementations. The fact that relevance feedback-refined queries involve many more nonzero keyword entries also means that query weighting and matching techniques may be sensitive to this difference.  Seminal work on the use of relevance feedback was done by Saltongt; especially with students Rocchio, Brauen, and Ide in the late 1960s and early 1970s [Rocchio, 1966; Brauen, 1969; Salton, 1972]. More recent students have extended the theory of query refinement and related it to topics in machine learning [Buckley et aL, 1994; Buckley and Salton, 1995; Allan, 1996].  Neural-net style learning 114       FINDING OUT ABOUT  Some of these experiments explored a second modification to the query vector. In addition to moving toward the d"^ center of ©, it is also plausible to move away from the irrelevant retrieved documents 0. As noted earlier, however, it is much less likely that these irrelevant documents are as conveniently clustered. As Salton [Salton and McGill, 1983] reported:  ... retrieval operation is most effective when the relevant documents as well as the non-relevant documents are tightly clustered and the difference between the two groups is as large as  possible___The relevance feedback operation is less favorable in the more  realistic case where the set of non-relevant documents covers a wider area of the space, [p. 145]  One possible strategy is to take a single element d~~ of the irrelevant retrieved documents (for example, the most highly ranked irrelevant retrieval) and define the direction of movement with respect to it alone.  As we have discussed in connection with Figure 4.2, relevance feedback helps to link individual queries into a browsing sequence. And so, although we have focused here on the simplest form of query refinement, with respect to the users' initial queries, relevance feedbackcn be given again and again. An initial query vector is moved toward the centroid of documents identified as relevant (and perhaps away from an especially bad one); this modified query instigates a new retrieval, which is again refined. In practice, it appears that such adjustments result in diminishing returns after only a few iterations of query refinement [Salton and McGill, 1983; Stanfill and Kahle, 1986b].  However, Section 7.3 will discuss a type of FOA in which a document corpus is constantly changing and the user's interest in a topic is longlived. In this case, we can imagine the query as a filter against which a constant stream (e.g., of newly published Web documents) is applied relevance feedback has also been used in this setting, to make ongoing changes to the query/filter that continue to improve its effectiveness [Allan, 1996].  Using relevance feedback for query refinement produces results that are immediately satisfying to the users. First, it automatically generates a new query with which they can continue their browsing process. Second, the statistical analysis of positively labeled retrieved documents can provide other forms of useful information to the users as well. For example, rather than ASSESSING THE RETRIEVAL       115  FIGURE 4.7 Document Modifications due to relevance feedback  simply retrieving a new set of documents, new keywords that are not in the users' original queries but are present in positively labeled documents at statistically significantly levels can be suggested to the users as new vocabulary. Conversely, words that were in the original query but are negatively correlated with d+ (and/or positively correlated with d~~) can also be identified.
