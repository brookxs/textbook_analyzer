 5.4.2    Query Expansion based on a Statistical Thesaurus In this section, we discuss a query expansion technique based on a global statistical thesaurus [200], Despite also being a global analysis technique, the approach is quite distinct from the one described above which is based on a similarity thesaurus. The global thesaurus is composed of classes which group correlated terms in the context of the whole collection. Such correlated terms can then be used to expand the original user query. To be effective, the terms selected for expansion must have high term discrimination values [699] which implies that they must be low frequency terms. However, it is difficult to cluster low frequency terms effectively due to the small amount of information, about them (they occur in few documents). To circumvent this problem, we cluster documents into AUTOMATIC GLOBAL ANALYSIS        135 classes instead and use the low frequency terms in these documents to define our thesaurus classes. In this situation, the document clustering algorithm must produce small and tight clusters. A document clustering algorithm which produces small and tight clusters is the complete link algorithm which works as follows (naive formulation). (1)  Initially, place each document in a distinct cluster. (2)  Compute the similarity between all pairs of clusters. (3)  Determine the pair of clusters [CU,CV] with the highest inter-cluster similarity. (4)  Merge the clusters Cu and Cv. (5)  Verify a stop criterion. If this criterion is not met then go back to step 2. (6)  Return a hierarchy of clusters. The similarity between two clusters is defined as the minimum of the similarities between all pairs of inter-cluster documents (i.e., two documents not in the same cluster). To compute the similarity between documents in a pair, the cosine formula of the vector model is used. As a result of this minimality criterion, the resultant clusters tend to be small and tight. Consider that the whole document collection has been clustered using the complete link algorithm. Figure 5.3 illustrates a small portion of the whole cluster hierarchy in which sirn(Cu,Cv) = 0.15 and sim(Cu+v,Cz) =0.11 where CujrV is a reference to the cluster which results from merging Cu and Cv. Notice that the similarities decrease as we move up in the hierarchy because high level clusters include more documents and thus represent a looser grouping. Thus, the tightest clusters lie at the bottom of the clustering hierarchy. Given the document cluster hierarchy for the whole collection, the terms that compose each class of the global thesaurus are selected as follows. 誰 Obtain from the user three parameters: threshold class (TC), number of Figure  5.3    Hierarchy of three clusters (inter-cluster similarities indicated in the ovals) generated by the complete link algorithm. 136        QUERY OPERATIONS documents in a class (NDC), and minimum inverse document frequency (MIDF). 誰  Use the parameter TC as a threshold value for determining the document clusters that will be used to generate thesaurus classes. This threshold has to be surpassed by sim(CU} Cv) if the documents in the clusters Cu and Cv are to be selected as sources of terms for a thesaurus class. For instance, in Figure 5.3, a value of 0.14 for TC returns the thesaurus class Cu+V while a value of 0.10 for TC returns the classes Cu+V and Cu+V+Z. 誰  Use the parameter NDC as a limit on the size of clusters (number of documents) to be considered.   For instance, if both Cu+V and Cu+u+2 are preselected (through the parameter TC) then the parameter NDC might be used to decide between the two. A low value of NDC might restrict the selection to the smaller cluster Cu+V. 誰  Consider the set of documents in each document cluster preselected above (through the parameters TC and NDC). Only the lower frequency documents are used as sources of terms for the thesaurus classes. The parameter MIDF defines the minimum value of inverse document frequency for any term which is selected to participate in a thesaurus class.   By doing so, it is possible to ensure that only low frequency terms participate in the thesaurus classes generated (terms too generic are not good synonyms). Given that the thesaurus classes have been built, they can be used for query expansion. For this, an average term weight wtc for each thesaurus class C is computed as follows. where \C\ is the number of terms in the thesaurus class C and wt,c is a Pre~ computed weight associated with the term-class pair [kt, C]. This average term weight can then be used to compute a thesaurus class weight we as The above weight formulations have been verified through experimentation and have yielded good results. Experiments with four test collections (ADI, Medlars, CACM, and LSI; see Chapter 8 for details on these collections) indicate that global analysis using a thesaurus built by the complete link algorithm might yield consistent improvements in retrieval performance. The main problem with this approach is the initialization of the parameters TC, NDC, and MIDF. The threshold value TC depends on the collection and can be difficult to set properly. Inspection of the cluster hierarchy is almost always necessary for assisting with the setting of TC. Care must be exercised because a TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        137 high value of TC might yield classes with too few terms while a low value of TC might yield too few classes. The selection of the parameter NDC can be decided more easily once TC has been set. However, the setting of the parameter MIDF might be difficult and also requires careful consideration.
