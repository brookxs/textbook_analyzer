 11.4    Trends and Research Issues In this chapter we have discussed the main issues in developing a Multimedia IR system. We have observed that only the integration of DBMS and IR technologies provides the ability to represent, store, and manipulate multimedia data and, at the same time, to retrieve those data by applying content-based searches. 342        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES We then discussed the main issues arising in defining a data model for multimedia data. Since multimedia data has, in general, a complex structure, the data model must be able to reflect and manage this complexity. Object-oriented or object-relational data models represent the right technology for multimedia data representation. Additional relevant requirements include the support of semi-structured data and metadata. Another important requirement is the ability to internally represent the content of multimedia data in a way that ensures fast retrieval of the stored data and efficient processing of content-based queries. To achieve this goal, semantic features can be extracted from the data, stored inside the system, and used during query processing. The second topic discussed in this chapter is related to multimedia query languages. We observed that a multimedia query language is characterized by the type of interface presented to the user and the types of predicates it allows in a query. Such predicates are used to perform content-based searches and to let the user drive the selection of relevant objects. Examples of commercial and prototype systems have been discussed, with respect to the data modeling and query language capabilities. Several aspects require further investigation. For example, even though SQL3 supports multimedia data representation, it cannot be taken as the basis for the definition of a Multimedia IR system. Additional research is needed to integrate SQL3 with specific language constructs and underlying techniques to perform information retrieval and query optimization. Another topic is related to XML (see Chapter 6), the new standard format for data on the Web [304]. XML is a text-based format, providing a standard data model to encode the content, the semantics, and the schema of ordinary documents, structured records, and metacontent information about a Web site. The extension of such a standard to support multimedia data and content-based queries is an important research direction. A further direction concerns the techniques for ranking the objects returned by a partial-match query. Such ranking usually only takes into account the degree of similarity of the objects retrieved with the query request. However, other factors can be considered, such as the profile of the user submitting the query, or the history of the previous queries specified by the user. Taking into account these aspects is very important, since it gives rise to a customized ranking which is closer to the user needs.
