 6.2.1 Footnotes, Hyperfootnotes, and cf.  Footnote text embellishes a primary text. It provide a more detailed treatment of terms or concepts used in the primary text. A lexical token, typically smaller in size,* creates a correspondence between the primary text and the annotation on it.  Perhaps the most direct claim of hypertext authors is that the standard linear presentation of text does violence to the more networked way  * This footnote doesn't do much to amplify, but It does create a small example:).  7 www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashLbks /oomputer/bushf. htm  8 jefferson.village.virginia.edu/elab/lifiOl 55.html INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      201  in which we naturally conceive of the concepts being discussed. At the same time, the conventional sequential flow through text mandated by printed media does a great deal to support a rhetorical argument. For this reason, this FOA text was written first as a traditional book, assuming a basically linear flow. On this linear spine, two hypertext extensions have been added (cf. Section 8.2.1).  For example, the primary purpose of the last paragraph was to move (the primary, linear course of the textbook) from a discussion of the syntactic conventions of footnoting to a consideration of communication's ultimate purposes. Because these issues are covered in more depth in Section 8.2.1, a parenthetical cf. reference to this other section was made. The cf. relation is best viewed as an opportunity (offered by the author to a reader) to compare the two passages.^                                    cf. for confer  In this FOA text I have also chosen to distinguish between standard footnotes and hyperfootnotes, which are used to capture more extended digressions. The last paragraph allows readers with access to the CD-ROM version of FOA who are interested in the Latin etymology of the cf. token to poke into that. Hyperfootnotes include a caption, providing a clue to what additional information lies on the other end of the hyperjump; standard footnotes are referenced by a simple asterisk.
