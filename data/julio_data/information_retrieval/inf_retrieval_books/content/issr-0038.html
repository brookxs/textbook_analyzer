Availability of the full text of the item in searchable form alters the objectives historically used in determining guidelines for manual indexing. The full text searchable data structure for items in the Document File provides a new class of indexing called total document indexing. In this environment, all of the words within the item are potential index descriptors of the subject(s) of the item. Chapter 1 discusses the process of Item normalization that takes all possible words in an item and transforms them into processing tokens used in defining the searchable representation of an item. In addition to determining the processing tokens, current systems have the ability to automatically weight the processing tokens based upon their potential importance in defining the concepts in the item.  The first reaction of many people is to question the need for manual indexing at all, given that total document indexing is available for search. If one can search on any of the words in a document why does one need to add additional index terms? Previously, indexing defined the source and major concepts of an item and provided a mechanism for standardization of index terms (i.e., use of a controlled vocabulary). A controlled vocabulary is a finite set of index terms from which all index terms must be selected (the domain of the index). In a manual indexing environment, the use of a controlled vocabulary makes the indexing process slower, but potentially simplifies the search process. The extra processing time comes from the indexer trying to determine the appropriate index terms for concepts that are not specifically in the controlled vocabulary set. Controlled vocabularies aide the user in knowing the domain of terms that the indexer had to select from and thus which terms best describe the information needed. Uncontrolled vocabularies have the opposite effect, making indexing faster but the search process much more difficult.  The availability of items in electronic form changes the objectives of manual indexing. The source information (frequently called citation data) can automatically be extracted. There is still some utility to the use of indexes for index term standardization. Modern systems, with the automatic use of thesauri and other reference databases, can account for diversity of language/vocabulary use and thus reduce the need for controlled vocabularies. Most of the concepts discussed in the document is locatable via search of the total document index. The primary use of manual subject indexing now shifts to abstraction of concepts and judgments on the value of the information. The automatic text analysis algorithms can not consistently perform abstraction on all concepts that are in an item. They can not correlate the facts in an item in a cause/effect relationship to determine additional related concepts to be indexed. An item that is discussing the increase in water temperatures at factory discharge locations could be discussing "economic stability" of a country that has fishing as its major industry.    It requires the Cataloging and Indexing                                                                              55  associative capabilities of a human being to make the connection. A computer system would typically not be able to correlate the changes in temperature to economic stability. The additional index terms added under this process enhance the recall capability of the system. For certain queries it may also increase the precision. This processing deficiency indicates the potential for future enhancements of Information Retrieval Systems with Artificial Intelligence techniques.  The words used in an item do not always reflect the value of the concepts being presented. It is the combination of the words and their semantic implications that contain the value of the concepts being discussed. The utility of a concept is also determined by the user's need. The Public File indexer needs to consider the information needs of all users of the library system. Individual users of the system have their own domains of interest that bound the concepts in which they are interested. It takes a human being to evaluate the quality of the concepts being discussed in an item to determine if that concept should be indexed. The difference in "user need" between the library class of indexers and the individual users is why Private Index files are an essential part of any good information system. It allows the user to logically subset the total document file into folders of interest including only those documents that, in the user's judgment, have future value. It also allows the user to judge the utility of the concepts based upon his need versus the system need and perform concept abstraction. Selective indexing based upon the value of concepts increases the precision of searches.  Availability of full document indexing saves the indexer from entering index terms that are identical to words in the document. Users may use Public Index files as part of their search criteria to increase the recall. They may want to constrain the search by their Private Index file to increase the precision of the search. Figure 3.1 shows the potential relationship between use of the words in an item to define the concepts. Public Indexing of the concept adds additional index terms over the words in the item to achieve abstraction. The index file use fewer terms than found in the items because it only indexes the important concepts. Private Index files are even more focused, limiting the number of items indexed to those that have value to the user and within items only the concepts bounded by the specific user's interest domain. There is overlap between the Private and Public Index files, but the Private Index file is indexing fewer concepts in an item than the Public Index file and the file owner uses his specific vocabulary of index terms.  In addition to the primary objective of representing the concepts within an item to facilitate the user's finding relevant information, electronic indexes to items provide a basis for other applications to assist the user. The format of the index, in most cases, supports the ranking of the output to present the items most likely to be relevant to the user's information needs first (see Chapters 5 and 7). Also, the index can be used to cluster items by concept (see Chapter 6). The clustering of items has the effect of making an electronic system similar to a physical library.   The paradigm of going to the library and browsing the book 56  Chapter 3  shelves in a topical area is the same as electronically browsing through items clustered by concepts.
