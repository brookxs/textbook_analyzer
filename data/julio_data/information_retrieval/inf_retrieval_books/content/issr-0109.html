 8.2 Cognition and Perception  The user-machine interface has primarily focused on a paradigm of a typewriter. As computers displays became ubiquitous, man-machine interfaces focused on treating the display as an extension of paper with the focus on consistency of operations. The advent of WIMP interfaces and simultaneous parallel tasks in the user work environment expanded the complexity of the interface to manipulate the multiple tasks. The evolution of the interface focused on how to represent to the user what is taking place in the computer environment. The advancements in computer technology, information sciences and understanding human information processing are providing the basis for extending the human computer interface to improve the information flow, thus reducing wasted user overhead in locating needed information. Although the major focus is on enhanced visualization of information, other senses are also being looked at for future interfaces. The audio sense has always been part of simple alerts in computers. Illegal inputs are usually associated with a beep, and more recently users have a spectrum of audio sounds to associate with everything from start-up to shut down. The sounds are now being replaced by speech in both input and output interfaces. Still in the research arena is the value of using audio to encapsulate information (e.g., higher pitch as you move through an information space plus increased relevance). The tactile (touch) sense is being addressed in the experiments using Virtual Realty (VR). For example, VR is used as a training environment for areas such as medical procedures where tactile feedback plays an increasing role. Olfactory and taste are two areas where practical use for information processing or computer interfaces in general has yet to be identified. For Information Retrieval Systems, the primary area of interest is in information visualization.
