 7.7    Bibliographic Discussion Our discussion on lexical analysis and elimination of stopwords is based on the work of Fox [263]. For stemming, we based our discussion on the work of Frakes [274]. The Porter stemming algorithm detailed in the appendix is from [648], while our coverage of thesauri is based on the work of Foskett [261], Here, however, we did not cover automatic generation of thesauri. Such discussion can be found in Chapter 5 and in [739, 735]. Additional discussion on the usefulness of thesauri is presented in [419, 735]. Regarding text compression, several books are available. Most of the topics discussed here are covered in more detail by Witten, Moffat and Bell [825]. They also present implementations of text compression methods, such as Huffman and arithmetic coding, as part of a fully operational retrieval system written in ANSI 190        TEXT OPERATIONS C. Bell, Cleary and Witten [78] cover statistical and dictionary methods, laying particular stress on adaptive methods as well as theoretical aspects of compression, with estimates on the entropy of several natural languages. Storer [747] covers the main compression techniques, with emphasis on dictionary methods. Huffman coding was originally presented in [386]. Adaptive versions of Huffman coding appear in [291, 446, 789]. Word-based compression is considered in [81, 571, 377, 77]. Bounds on the inefficiency of Huffman coding have been presented by [291]. Canonical codes were first presented in [713]. Many properties of the canonical codes are mentioned in [374]. Byte Huffman coding was proposed in [577]. Sequential searching on byte Huffman compressed text is described in [577, 576]. Sequential searching on Ziv-Lempel compressed data is presented in [250, 19]. More recently, implementations of sequential searching on Ziv-Lempel compressed text are presented in [593]. One of the first papers on arithmetic coding is in [675]. Other references are [823, 78]. A variety of compression methods for inverted lists are studied in [573]. The most effective compression methods for inverted lists are based on the sequence of gaps between document numbers, as considered in [77] and in [572]. Their results are based on run-length encodings proposed by Elias [235] and Golomb [307]. A comprehensive study of inverted file compression can be found in [825]. More recently Vo and Moffat [790] have presented algorithms to process the index with no need to fully decode the compressed index.
