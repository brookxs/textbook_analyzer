 9.1     Introduction The volume of electronic text available online today is staggering. By many accounts, the World Wide Web alone contains over 200 million pages of text, comprising nearly 500 gigabytes of data. Moreover, the Web (see Chapter 13) has been growing at an exponential rate, nearly doubling in size every six months. Large information service providers, such as LEXIS-NEXIS (see Chapter 14), have amassed document databases that reach into the terabytes. On a slightly smaller scale, the largest corporate intranets now contain over a million Web pages. Even private collections of online documents stored on personal computers are growing larger as disk space becomes cheaper and electronic content becomes easier to produce, download, and store. As document collections grow larger, they become more expensive to manage with an information retrieval system. Searching and indexing costs grow with the size of the underlying document collection; larger document collections invariably result in longer response times. As more documents are added to the system, performance may deteriorate to the point where the system is no longer usable. Furthermore, the economic survival of commercial systems and Web search engines depends on their ability to provide high query processing rates. In fact, most of a Web search company's gross income comes from selling 'advertising impressions' (advertising banners displayed at the user's screen) whose number is proportional to the number of query requests attended. To support the demanding requirements of modern search environments, we must turn to alternative architectures and algorithms. In this chapter we explore parallel and distributed information retrieval techniques. The application of parallelism can greatly enhance our ability to scale traditional information retrieval algorithms and support larger and larger document collections. We continue this introduction with a review of parallel computing and parallel program performance measures. In section 9.2 we explore techniques for 229 230        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR implementing information retrieval algorithms on parallel platforms, including inverted file and signature file methods. In section 9.3, we turn to distributed information retrieval and approaches to collection partitioning, source selection, and distributed results merging (often called collection fusion). We discuss future trends in section 9.4, and conclude with a bibliographic discussion in section 9.5.
