 5.5.2 Bayesian Inversion  If we had worked hard on a particular test corpus of documents to identify (always with respect to some particular query) which documents were  Rel and which were not, it would be possible to carefully study which features xt were reliably found in relevant documents and which were not. Collecting such statistics for each feature would then allow us to estimate:  Pr(x\Rel) 170       FINDING  OUT ABOUT  the probability of any particular set of features x, given that we know it is ReL (Just which statistics we collect, and how, will be discussed in more detail in Section 7.4 as part of a more general classification task.) The retrieval question requires that we ask the converse: the probability that a document with features x should be considered relevant. This inversion is accomplished via the familiar Bayes rule:  (5.37,
