 Theorem  Suppose lt;R x P, gt;= gt; is an additive conjoint structure, then there exist functions, [[Phi]]1 from R, and [[Phi]]2 from P into the real numbers such that, for all R, R' [[propersubset]] R and P, P' [[propersubset]] P:  (R, P) gt;= (R', P' ) lt;=gt; [[Phi]]1 (R ) + [[Phi]]2 (P ) gt;= [[Phi]]1 (R' ) + [[Phi]]2 (P' )  If [[Phi]]i['] are two other functions with the same property, then there exist constants [[Theta]] gt; 0, [[gamma]]1, and [[gamma]]2 such that  [[Phi]]1['] = [[Theta]][[Phi]]1 + [[gamma]]1 [[Phi]]2['] = [[Theta]][[Phi]]2 + [[gamma]]2  The proof of this theorem may be found in Krantz et al.[15].  Let us stop and take stock of this situation. So far we have discussed the properties of an additive conjoint structure and justified its use for the measurement of effectiveness based on precision and recall. We have also shown that an additively independent representation (unique up to a linear transformation) exists for this kind of relational structure. The explicit form of [[Phi]]i has been left unspecified. To determine the form of [[Phi]]i we need to introduce some extrinsic considerations. Although the representation F = [[Phi]]1 + [[Phi]]2 , this is not the most convenient form for expressing the further conditions we require of F, nor for its interpretation. So, in spite of the fact that we are seeking an additively independent representation we consider conditions on a general F. It will turn out that the F which is appropriate can be simply transformed into an additive representation. The transformation is f (F) = - (F - 1)[-1] which is strictly monotonically increasing in the range 0 lt;= F lt;= 1, which is the range of interest. In any case, when measuring retrieval effectiveness any strictly monotone transformation of the measure will do just as well.
