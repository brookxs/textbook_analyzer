 Boolean search  A Boolean search strategy retrieves those documents which are 'true' for the query. This formulation only makes sense if the queries are expressed in terms of index terms (or keywords) and combined by the usual logical connectives AND, OR, and NOT. For example, if the query Q = (K1 AND K2) OR (K3 AND (NOT K4)) then the Boolean search will retrieve all documents indexed by K1 and K2, as well as all documents indexed by K3 which are not indexed by K4.  An obvious way to implement the Boolean search is through the inverted file. We store a list for each keyword in the vocabulary, and in each list put the addresses (or numbers) of the documents containing that particular word. To satisfy a query we now perform the set operations, corresponding to the logical connectives, on the Ki-lists. For example, if  K1 -list : D1, D2, D3, D4  K2 -list : D1, D2  K3 -list : D1, D2, D3  K4 -list : D1  and Q = (K1 AND K2) OR (K3 AND (NOT K4))  then to satisfy the (K1 AND K2) part we intersect the K1 and K2 lists, to satisfy the (K3 AND (NOT K4)) part we subtract the K4 list from the K3 list. The OR is satisfied by now taking the union of the two sets of documents obtained for the parts. The result is the set {D1, D2, D3} which satisfies the query and each document in it is 'true' for the query.  A slight modification of the full Boolean search is one which only allows AND logic but takes account of the actual number of terms the query has in common with a document. This number has become known as the co-ordination level. The search strategy is often called simple matching. Because at any level we can have more than one document, the documents are said to be partially ranked by the co-ordination levels.  For the same example as before with the query Q = K1 AND K2 AND K3 we obtain the following ranking:  Co-ordination level  3 D1, D2  2 D3  1 D4  In fact, simple matching may be viewed as using a primitive matching function. For each document D we calculate |D [[intersection]] Q|, that is the size of the overlap between D and Q, each represented as a set of keywords. This is the simple matching coefficient mentioned in Chapter 3.
