 3.4    Trends and Research Issues A major trend today is research in interactive user interfaces. The motivation is a general belief that effective retrieval is highly dependent on obtaining proper feedback from the user. Thus, evaluation studies of interactive interfaces will tend to become more common in the near future. The main issues revolve around deciding which evaluation measures are most appropriate in this scenario. A typical example is the informativeness measure [754] introduced in 1992. Furthermore, the proposal, the study, and the characterization of alternative measures to recall and precision, such as the harmonic mean and the E measures, continue to be of interest.
