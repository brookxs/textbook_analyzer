 2.6.2    Extended Boolean Model Boolean retrieval is simple and elegant. However, since there is no provision for term weighting, no ranking of the answer set is generated. As a result, the size of the output might be too large or too small (see Chapter 10 for details on this issue). Because of these problems, modern information retrieval systems are no longer based on the Boolean model. In fact, most of the new systems adopt at their core some form of vector retrieval. The reasons are that the vector space model is simple, fast, and yields better retrieval performance. One alternative approach though is to extend the Boolean model with the functionality of partial matching and term weighting. This strategy allows one to combine Boolean query formulations with characteristics of the vector model. In what follows, we discuss one of the various models which are based on the idea of extending the Boolean model with features of the vector model. The extended Boolean model, introduced in 1983 by Salton, Fox, and Wu [703], is based on a critique of a basic assumption in Boolean logic as follows. Consider a conjunctive Boolean query given by q ó kx A ky. According to the Boolean model, a document which contains either the term kx or the term ky is as irrelevant as another document which contains neither of them. However, this binary decision criteria frequently is not in accordance with common sense. An analogous reasoning applies when one considers purely disjunctive queries. When only two terms are considered, we can plot queries and documents in a two-dimensional map as shown in Figure 2.6. A document dj is positioned in this space through the adoption of weights wxj and wyj associated with the pairs [kx,dj] and [ky,dj], respectively. We assume that these weights are normalized and thus lie between 0 and 1. For instance, these weights can be computed as normalized tf-idf factors as follows. = /          idf* max,   idf * (0,1) (0,0) ALTERNATIVE SET THEORETIC MODELS        39 (1,1) ky  (1.0)   (0,0)!

For simplicity, in the remainder of this section, we refer to the weight wx^ as x, to the weight wyj as y, and to the document vector d3 = (wx,3,wy,3) as the point dj = (x,y). Observing Figure 2.6 we notice two particularities. First, for a disjunctive query qor ó kxV fcy, the point (0, 0) is the spot to be avoided. This suggests taking the distance from (0,0) as a measure of similarity with regard to the query qor. Second, for a conjunctive query qand = kx A ky, the point (1,1) is the most desirable spot. This suggests taking the complement of the distance from the point (1,1) as a measure of similarity with regard to the query qand-Furthermore, such distances can be normalized which yields, sim(qorid)    = sim(qandid)    =    1If the weights are all Boolean (i.e., wxj £ {0,1}), a document is always positioned in one of the four corners (i.e., (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), or (1,1)) and the values for sim(qor,d) are restricted to 0, l/\/2, and 1. Analogously, the values for sim(qand,d) are restricted to 0, 1 ó l/\/2, and 1. Given that the number of index terms in a document collection is t, the Boolean model discussed above can be naturally extended to consider Euclidean distances in a t-dimensional space. However, a more comprehensive generalization is to adopt the theory of vector norms as follows. The p-norrn model generalizes the notion of distance to include not only Euclidean distances but also p-distances, where 1 lt; p lt; oc is a newly introduced parameter whose value must be specified at query time. A generalized disjunctive 40        MODELING query is now represented by qor ó a-i   v     A/2   v     ... v   /im Analogously, a generalized conjunctive query is now represented by qand = h  Ap k2 Ap   ... Ap km The respective query-document similarities are now given by t{ + x\ + ... + x m sim{qand)dj)    =    1 - I 771 where each X{ stands for the weight w^d associated to the pair [ki,d3]. The p norm as defined above enjoys a couple of interesting properties as follows. First, when p = 1 it can be verified that .     /           , N           .      /              -, \        Xi   {-          \  X sim(qor,dj) = sim{qand,dj) = Second, when p = oo it can be verified that sim(qor, dj) = sim(qand,d3) = min[xi) Thus, for p = 1, conjunctive and disjunctive queries are evaluated by a sum of term-document weights as done by vector-based similarity formulas (which compute the inner product). Further, for p = oo, queries are evaluated according to the formalism of fuzzy logic (which we view as a generalization of Boolean logic). By varying the parameter p between 1 and infinity, we can vary the p-norm ranking behavior from that of a vector-like ranking to that of a Boolean-like ranking. This is quite powerful and is a good argument in favor of the extended Boolean model. The processing of more general queries is done by grouping the operators in a predefined order. For instance, consider the query q = (fci Ap 2) Vp k%. The similarity sim(q, d3) between a document dj and this query is then computed as /        /                      \ {!-[--------2--------)    )   +x3 [gt;¶-{-------2-------;   ; t4 sim{q,d) = V                                           / This procedure can be applied recursively no matter the number of AND/OR operators. ALTERNATIVE ALGEBRAIC MODELS        41 One additional interesting aspect of this extended Boolean model is the possibility of using combinations of different values of the parameter p in a same query request. For instance, the query (fci V2 k2) A∞∞ fc3 could be used to indicate that k\ and k2 should be used as in a vector system but that the presence of ks is required (i.e., the conjunction is interpreted as a Boolean operation). Despite the fact that it is not clear whether this additional functionality has any practical impact, the model does allow for it and does so in a natural way (without the need for clumsy extensions to handle special cases). We should also observe that the extended Boolean model relaxes Boolean algebra interpreting Boolean operations in terms of algebraic distances. In this sense, it is really a hybrid model which includes properties of both the set theoretic models and the algebraic models. For simplicity, we opted for classifying the model as a set theoretic one. The extended Boolean model was introduced in 1983 but has not been used extensively. However, the model does provide a neat framework and might reveal itself useful in the future.
