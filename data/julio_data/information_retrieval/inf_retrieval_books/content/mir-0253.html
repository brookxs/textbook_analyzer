 13.4    Search Engines In this section we cover different architectures of retrieval systems that model the Web as a full-text database. One main difference between standard IR systems and the Wreb is that, in the Web, all queries must be answered without accessing the text (that is, only the indices are available). Otherwise, that would require either storing locally a copy of the Web pages (too expensive) or accessing remote pages through the network at query time (too slow). This difference has an impact on the indexing and searching algorithms, as well as on the query languages made available.
