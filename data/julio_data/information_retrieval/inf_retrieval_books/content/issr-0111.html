 8.2.2 Aspects of the Visualization Process  One of the first-level cognitive processes is preattention, that is, taking the significant visual information from the photoreceptors and forming primitives. Information Visualization  205  Primitives are part of the preconscious processes that consist of involuntary lower order information processing (Friedhoff-89). An example of this is the ease with which our visual systems detect borders between changes in orientation of the same object. In Figure 8.1 the visual system detects the difference in orientations between the left and middle portion of the figure and determines the logical border between them. An example of using the conscious processing capabilities of the brain is the detection of the different shaped objects and the border between them shown between the left side and middle of the Figure 8.1. The reader can likely detect the differences in the time it takes to visualize the two different boundaries.  ft         ft  ft     ftc:  lt;=    lt;=  ft  ft     ft   ft       ft       lt;=lt;=     CC=  ftft   ft  ft    ft ft   ftftft     ft  ftft ftftftftftft    ft  Figure 8.1 Preattentive Detection Mechanism  This suggests that if information semantics are placed in orientations, the mind's clustering aggregate function enables detection of groupings easier than using different objects (assuming the orientations are significant). This approach makes maximum use of the feature detectors in the retina.  The preattentive process can detect the boundaries between orientation groups of the same object. A harder process is to identify the equivalence of rotated objects. For example, a rotated square requires more effort to recognize it as a square. As we migrate into characters, the problem of identification of the character is affected by rotating the character in a direction not normally encountered. It is easier to detect the symmetry when the axis is vertical. Figure 8.2 demonstrates these effects.

Making use of this factor suggests that a visual display of small objects should use bright colors. An even more complex area is the use of colors. Colors have many attributes that can be modified such as hue, saturation and lightness. Hue is the physiological attribute of color sensation. Saturation is the degree to which a hue is different from a gray line with the same lightness, while lightness is the sensation of the amount of white or black. Complementary colors are two colors that form white or gray when combined (red/green, yellow/blue). Color is one of the most frequently used visualization techniques to organize, classify, and enhance features (Thorell-90). Humans have an innate attraction to the primary colors (red, blue, green and yellow), and their retention of images associated with these colors is longer. But colors also affect emotion, and some people have strong aversion to certain colors. The negative side of use of colors is that some people are color blind to some or many colors. Thus any display that uses colors should have other options available.  Depth, like color, is frequently used for representing visual information. Classified as monocular cues, changes in shading, blurring (proportional to distance), perspective, motion, stereoscopic vision, occlusion and texture depict depth. Most of the cues are affected more by lightness than contrast. Thus, choice of colors that maximizes brightness in contrast to the background can assist in presenting depth as a mechanism for representing information. Depth has the advantage that depth/size recognition are learned early in life and used all of the time. Gibson and Walk showed that six-month-old children already understand depth suggesting that depth may be an innate concept (Gibson-60). The cognitive processes are well developed, and the use of this information in classifying objects is ubiquitous to daily life. The visual information processing system is attuned to processing information using depth and correlating it to real world paradigms.  Another higher level processing technique is the use of configural aspects of a display (Rose-95). A configural effect occurs when arrangements of objects are presented to the user allowing for easy recognition of a high-level abstract condition. Configural clues substitute a lower level visual process for a higher level one that requires more concentration (see preattentive above). These clues are frequently used to detect changes from a normal operating environment such as in monitoring an operational system. An example is shown in Figure 8.3 where the sides of a regular polygon (e.g., a square in this example) are modified. The visual processing system quickly detects deviations from normally equally sized objects.  Another visual cue that can be used is spatial frequency. The human visual and cognitive system tends towards order and builds an coherent visual image whenever possible. The multiple spatial channel theory proposes that a complex image is constructed from the external inputs, not received as a single image. The final image is constructed from multiple receptors that detect changes Information Visualization  207  Figure 8.3 Distortions of a Regular Polygon  in spatial frequency, orientation, contrast, and spatial phase. Spatial frequency is an acuity measure relative to regular light-dark changes that are in the visual field or similar channels. A cycle is one complete light-dark change. The spatial frequency is the number of cycles per one degree of visual field. Our visual systems are less sensitive to spatial frequencies of about 5-6 cycles per degree of visual field (NOTE: one degree of visual field is approximately the viewing angle subtended by the width of a finger at arms length). Other animals have significantly more sensitive systems that allow them to detect outlines of camouflaged prey not detected by humans until we focus on the area. Associated with not processing the higher spatial frequencies is a reduction in the cognitive processing time, allowing animals (e.g. cats) to react faster to motion. When looking at a distinct, well defined image versus a blurred image, our visual system will detect motion/changes in the distinct image easier than the blurred image. If motion is being used as a way of aggregating and displaying information, certain spatial frequencies facilitate extraction of patterns of interest. Dr. Mary Kaiser of NASA-AMES is experimenting with perceptually derived displays for aircraft. She is interested in applying the human vision filters such as limits of spatial and temporal resolution, mechanisms of stereopsis, and attentional focus to aircraft (Kaiser-96).  The human sensory systems learn from usage. In deciding upon visual information techniques, parallels need to be made between what is being used to represent information and encountering those techniques in the real world environment. The human system is adept at working with horizontal and vertical references. They are easily detected and processed. Using other orientations requires additional cognitive processes to understand the changes from the expected inputs. The typical color environment is subdued without large areas of bright colors. Thus using an analogous situation, bright colors represent items to be focused on correlating to normal processing (i.e., noticing brightly colored flowers in a garden). Another example of taking advantage of sensory information that the brain is use to processing is terrain and depth information. Using a graphical representation that uses depth of rectangular objects to represent information is an image that the visual system is used to processing. Movement in that space is more easily interpreted and understood by the cognitive processes than 208                                                                                                Chapter 8  if, for example, a three-dimensional image of a sphere represented a visual information space.  In using cognitive engineering in designing information visualization techniques, a hidden risk is that "understanding is in the eye of the beholder." The integration of the visual cues into an interpretation of what is being seen is also based upon the user's background and context of the information. The human mind uses the latest information to assist in interpreting new information. If a particular shape has been representing important information, the mind has a predisposition to interpret new inputs as the same shape. For example, if users have been focusing on clusters of items, they may see clusters in a new presentation that do not exist. This leads to the question of changing visualization presentations to minimize legacy dispositions. Another issue is that our past experiences can affect our interpretation of a graphic. Users may interpret figures according to what is most common in their life experiences rather than what the designer intended.
