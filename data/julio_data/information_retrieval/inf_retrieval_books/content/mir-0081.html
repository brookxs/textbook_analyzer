 4.7    Bibliographic Discussion The material on classical query languages (most simple patterns, Boolean model, and fixed structure) is based on current commercial systems, such as Fulcrum, Verity, and others, as well as on non-commercial systems such as Glimpse [540] and Igrep [26]. The fuzzy Boolean model is described in [703]. The Levenshtein distance is described in [504] and [25]. Soundex is explained in [445]. A comparison of the effectiveness of different similarity models is given in [595]. A good source on regular expressions is [375]. A rich language on extended patterns is described in [837]. A classical reference on hypertext is [181]. The WebGlimpse system is presented in [539]. The discussion of hierarchical text is partially based on [41]. The original proposals are: PAT Expressions [693], Overlapped Lists [173] and the new improved proposal [206], Lists of References [534], Proximal Nodes [590], and Tree Matching [439]. PAT Expressions are the basic model of the PAT Text Searching System [309]. A simple structured text model is presented in [36] and a visual query language that includes structure is discussed in [44]. More information on Z39.50 can be obtained from [23]. More information on WAIS is given in [425]. For details on SFQL see [392].
