 2.5 Implementation  The range of potential implementations of the basic techniques discussed in this chapter and subsequent ones is quite remarkable. Each depends EXTRACTING LEXICAL FEATURES       51  on features of the specific application, available hardware, and so on, such as:  ï  using a massively parallel supercomputer of the mid-1980s to provide current news to financial analysts [Stanfill and Kahle, 1986a];  ï  searching for file names as part of the MacOS Finder on a single personal computer and then extending to support file content searching as part of the MacOS Sherlock2 utility;  ï  SMART3 is a classic software suite designed to support experimentation into basic IR techniques (see Section 3.4.3 for more details);  ï  providing a generic utility for Managing Gigabytes4 (MG), for example, building an index for a CD-ROM or DVD; and  ï  making all of the pages on a WWW server searchable via Web Server Search Tools5 or Information filtering tools.6  Design decisions depend on features such as corpus size, available memory, and query response time. Two implementations have been developed to accompany this textbook, an earlier one in C and a more recent one in Java; see the FOA Web site7 for details.
