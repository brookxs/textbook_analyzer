 1.2.3 Document Descriptors  We've introduced keywords as features mentioned by users as part of their queries, but the other face of keywords is as descriptive features of documents. That is, we might naturally say that a document is about ROBOTICS. Users mentioning ROBOTICS in their query should expect to get those documents that are about this topic. Keywords must therefore also function as the documents' description language. The same vocabulary of words used in queries must be used to describe the topical content of each and every document. Keywords become our characterization of what each document is about. Indexing is the process of associating one or more keywords with each document.  The vocabulary used can either be controlled or uncontrolled (a.k.a. closed vocabularies or open vocabularies). Suppose we decide to have all the documents in our corpus manually indexed by their authors; this is quite common in many conference proceedings, for example. If we provide a list of potential keywords and tell authors they must restrict their choices to terms on this list, we are using a controlled indexing vocabulary. On the other hand, if we allow the authors to assign any terms they choose, the resulting index has an uncontrolled vocabulary [Svenonius, 1986].  To get a feel for the indexing process, imagine that you are given a piece of text and must come up with a set of keywords that describe what the document is about. Let's make the exercise more concrete. You are the author of a report entitled USIHG A MEUHAL NETWORK FOR OVERVIEW       13  PREDICTION, and you are submitting it to a journal. One of the things this particular journal requires is that the author provide up to six keywords under which this article will be indexed. If you are sending it to the Communications of the ACM, you might pick a set of keywords that identify, to the audience of computer scientists you think read this publication, connections between this new work and prior work in related areas: NONLINEAR REGRESSION; TIME SERIES PREDICTION.  But now imagine that you've decided to submit the exact same paper to Byte magazine, and you must again pick keywords that have meaning to this audience. You might choose: NEURAL NETWORKS; STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS.  What is the context in which these keywords are going to be interpreted? Who's the audience? Who's going to understand what these keywords mean? Anticipating the FOA activity in which these keywords will function, we know that the real issue to be solved is not only to describe this one document, but to distinguish it from the millions of others in the same corpus. How are the keywords chosen going to be used to distinguish your document from the others?  It is often easiest to imagine keywords as independent features of each document. In fact, however, keywords are best viewed as a relation between a document and its prospective readers, sensitive to both characteristics of the users' queries and other documents in the same corpus. In other words, the keywords you pick for Byte should be different from those you pick for Communications of the ACMgt; and for deeper reasons than what we might cynically consider "spin control."
