 1.4.1 Structured Aspects of Documents  In addition to their free text, many documents will carry meta-data that gives some facts about the document. We may have publication information, for example, that this document appeared in this journal, in this issue, on this page. We are likely to know the author(s) of the document. Queries will often refer to aspects of both free text and meta-data.  QUERY 1   Vm interested in documents about Fools7 Gold that have been published in childrens magazines in the last five years.  The first portion of this query depends on the same about-ness relation that is at the core of our FOA process. But the last two criteria, concerning publication type and date, seem to be just the sort of query against structured attributes that database systems perform very successfully. In most real-life applications a hybrid of database and IR technologies will be necessary. (We distinguish between these techniques in Section 1.6.) The most interesting examples concern characteristics that do not clearly fall into either IR or database categories. For example, can you define precisely what you mean by a "children's magazine" in terms of unambiguous attributes on which a database would depend? Consider another query.  QUERY 2   What sort of work has K. E. Smith done on metabolic proteins affecting neurogenesis?  Finding an exact match for the string K. E. Smith in the AUTHORS attribute is straightforward. But the conventions in much of medical and biological publication (as well as in some areas of physics) sometimes lead to dozens of authors on papers, from the director of the institute through all of the laboratory assistants. Although K. B. Smith might well fulfill the syntactic requirements of authorship on a particular paper, users searching for "the work of" this person might well have a more narrowly defined semantic relationship in mind.
