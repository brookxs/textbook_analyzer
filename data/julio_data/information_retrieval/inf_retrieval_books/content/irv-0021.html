 Introduction  In this chapter I shall attempt to present a coherent account of classification in such a way that the principles involved will be sufficiently understood for anyone wishing to use classification techniques in IR to do so without too much difficulty. The emphasis will be on their application in document clustering, although many of the ideas are applicable to pattern recognition, automatic medical diagnosis, and keyword clustering.  A formal definition of classification will not be attempted; for our purposes it is sufficient to think of classification as describing the process by which a classificatory system is constructed. The word 'classification' is also used to describe the result of such a process. Although indexing is often thought of (wrongly I think) as 'classification' we specifically exclude this meaning. A further distinction to be made is between 'classification' and 'diagnosis'. Everyday language is very ambiguous on this point:  'How would you classify (identify) this?'  'How are these best classified (grouped)?'  The first example refers to diagnosis whereas the second talks about classification proper. These distinctions have been made before in the literature by Kendall[1] and Jardine and Sibson[2].  In the context of information retrieval, a classification is required for a purpose. Here I follow Macnaughton-Smith[3] who states: 'All classifications, even the most general are carried out for some more or less explicit "special purpose" or set of purposes which should influence the choice of [classification] method and the results obtained.' The purpose may be to group the documents in such a way that retrieval will be faster or alternatively it may be to construct a thesaurus automatically. Whatever the purpose the 'goodness' of the classification can finally only be measured by its performance during retrieval. In this way we can side-step the debate about 'natural' and 'best' classifications and leave it to the philosophers (see for example Hempel[4]).  There are two main areas of application of classification methods in IR:  (1) keyword clustering;  (2) document clustering.  The first area is very well dealt with in a recent book by Sparck Jones[5]. Document clustering, although recommended forcibly by Salton and his co-workers, has had very little impact. One possible reason is that the details of Salton's work on document clustering became submerged under the welter of experiments performed on the SMART system. Another is possibly that as the early enthusiasm for clustering wanted, the realisation dawned that significant experiments in this area required quantities of expensive data and large amounts of computer time.  Good[6] and Fairthorne[7] were amongst the first to recommend that automatic classification might prove useful in document retrieval. A clear statement of what is implied by document clustering was made early on by R. M. Hayes[8]: 'We define the organisation as the grouping together of items (e.g. documents, representations of documents) which are then handled as a unit and lose, to that extent, their individual identities. In other words, classification of a document into a classification slot, to all intents and purposes identifies the document with that slot. Thereafter, it and other documents in the slot are treated as identical until they are examined individually. It would appear, therefore, that documents are grouped because they are in some sense related to each other; but more basically, they are grouped because they are likely to be wanted together, and logical relationship is the means of measuring this likelihood.' In the main, people have achieved the 'logical organisation' in two different ways. Firstly, through direct classification of the documents, and secondly via the intermediate calculation of a measure of closeness between documents. The first approach has proved theoretically to be intractable so that any experimental test results cannot be considered to be reliable. The second approach to classification is fairly well documented now, and above all, there are some forceful arguments recommending it in a particular form. It is this approach which is to be emphasised here.  The efficiency of document clustering has been emphasised by Salton[9], he says: 'Clearly in practice it is not possible to match each analysed document with each analysed search request because the time consumed by such operation would be excessive. Various solutions have been proposed to reduce the number of needed comparisons between information items and requests. A particular promising one generates groups of related documents, using an automatic document matching procedure. A representative document group vector is then chosen for each document group, and a search request is initially checked against all the group vectors only. Thereafter, the request is checked against only those individual documents where group vectors show a high score with the request.' Salton believes that although document clustering saves time, it necessarily reduces the effectiveness of a retrieval system. I believe a case has been made showing that on the contrary document clustering has potential for improving the effectiveness (Jardine and van Rijsbergen[10]).
