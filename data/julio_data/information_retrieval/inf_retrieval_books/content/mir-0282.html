 14.3.1    OPACs and Their Content Libraries use standardized systems for cataloging and classifying the materials (texts and other media) they hold. Typically, they follow the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules to describe these materials, an organizational scheme (such as Library of Congress or the Dewey Decimal Classification) to assign subject codes, and use a subject heading list (such as the Library of Congress Subject ONLINE PUBLIC ACCESS CATALOGS (OPACS)        409 00723cam    22002418a 4500001001300000008004100013005001700054 010001800071020003300089040001300122050002600135082001700161 100002000178245007400198250001200272260005200284300003400336 504006400370650004100434 97002718 970417sl997        ilua         b        001 0 eng 19971128134653.1 $a      97002718 $a0838907075  (acid-free paper) $adigital libraryC$cdigital libraryC 00$aZ699.35.M28$bH34  1997 00$a025.3/16$221 1 $aHagler,  Ronald. 14$aThe bibliographic record and information technology / $cRonald Hagler. $a3rd ed. $aChicago   :$bAmerican Library Association,$cl997. $axvi,   394 p.   :$bill.   ;$c24 cm. $alncludes bibliographical references   (p.375-380) and index. 650    0041        0$aMachine-readable bibliographic data.# 001	0013 008	0041 005	0017 010	0018 020	0033 040	0013 050	0026 082	0017 100	0020 245	0074 250	0012 260	0052 300	0034 504	0064 Figure 14.8    Sample MARC record. Headings) to assign a series of subject descriptors. Given this standardization, cooperative cataloging ventures by library consortia have the potential to lower the cost per unit to catalog library materials, broaden access through shared databases, and facilitate the sharing of materials. Thus library cataloging relies on centralized and shared information through bibliographic utilities such as the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). (OCLC is also a database vendor with characteristics shown in Figure 14.2.) The structure that underlies this cooperation among many libraries supporting distinct online catalogs is the MARC Record. MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging Record) is a data format that implements national and international standards, such as the Information Interchange Format (ANSI Z39.2) and the Format for Information Exchange (ISO 2709). With some variations (USMARC, UKMARC, etc.) it is used worldwide. A sample MARC record is shown in Figure 14.8. The MARC record has three parts: a fixed length (24 character) leader; a record directory showing the 3-digit tag for each field contained in the record with the length of that field in characters; and the data-containing fields and subfields themselves. Subfields are indicated by codes (e.g., ($a') within the field and are specific to each field. For instance, field 260 contains publication information and may have subfields for place, publisher, and date. (To improve readability the record here has been reformatted slightly, so that the field tag (e.g., 001) and field length (e.g., 0013) from the directory are repeated with the data for each field). A recent innovation is the adoption of the 856 field for holdings information to include URLs, allowing the specification of Web hyperlinks. 410        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS
