 2.1.5 Term Masking  Term masking is the ability to expand a query term by masking a portion of the term and accepting as valid any processing token that maps to the unmasked portion of the term. The value of term masking is much higher in systems that do  not perform stemming or only provide a very simple stemming algorithm. There are two types of search term masking: fixed length and variable length. Sometimes they are called fixed and variable length "don't care" functions.  Fixed length masking is a single position mask. It masks out any symbol in a particular position or the lack of that position in a word. Figure 2.3 gives an example of fixed term masking.   It not only allows any character in the masked Information Retrieval System Capabilities                                                   33  position, but also accepts words where the position does not exist. Fixed length term masking is not frequently used and typically not critical to a system.  Variable length "don't cares" allows masking of any number of characters within a processing token. The masking may be in the front, at the end, at both front and end, or imbedded. The first three of these cases are called suffix search, prefix search and imbedded character string search, respectively. The use of an imbedded variable length don't care is seldom used. Figure 2.3 provides examples of the use of variable length term masking. If "*" represents a variable length don't care then the following are examples of its use:  ""COMPUTER"                            Suffix Search  "COMPUTER*"                            Prefix Search  "?COMPUTER*"                          Imbedded String Search  Of the options discussed, trailing "don't cares" (prefix searches) are by far the most common. In operational systems they are used in 80-90 per cent of the search terms (Kracsony-81) and in may cases are a default without the user having to specify it.
