 15.4.4    Distributed Collections Though our view of digital librarys encompasses even those that are small, self-contained, and constrained to a personal collection with a suitable system and services, most digital librarys are spread across computers, that is spanning physical and/or logical spaces. Dealing with collections of information that are distributed in nature is one of the common requirements for digital library technology. Yet, proper handling of such collections is a challenging problem, possibly since many computer scientists are poorly equipped to think about situations involving spaces as well as the other aspects of 5S. Of particular concern is working with a number of digital librarys, each separately constructed, so the information systems are truly heterogeneous. Integration requires support for at least some popular scenarios (often a simple search that DOCUMENT MODELS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND ACCESS        423 External Servers Figure 15.2    Architecture of the BioKleisli system (adapted from [829, 128]). is a type of least common denominator) by systems that expect differing types of communication streams (e.g., respond to different protocols and query languages), have varying types of streams and structures, and combine these two differently in terms of representations of data and metadata. To tackle this problem, one approach has been to develop a description language for each digital library and to build federated search systems that can interpret that description language [161]. However, when digital library content is highly complex (e.g., when there are 'unstructured' collections, meaning that the structure is complex and not well described), there is need for richer description languages and more powerful systems to interpret and support highly expressive queries/operations [828, 209, 128]. An architecture of this type is illustrated in Figure 15.2 for the BioKleisli system [829]. In addition to these two approaches - namely reducing functionality for end users in order to give digital library developers more freedom and increasing functionality by making the federated system smarter and able to use more computational resources on both servers and clients - there is the third approach of making each digital library support a powerful protocol aimed at effective retrieval. This third course is supported by the Computer Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI) effort [570], wherein a Z39.50 interface exists on a number of museum information servers and clients [570]. While Z39.50 was aimed at the needs of libraries desiring interoperability among library catalogs, it does support many of the needs for digital librarys. Thus, the CIMI interoperability demonstration, with its support for multimedia content, is of great import, but does leave open further improvement 424        DIGITAL LIBRARIES in supporting richer digital library interaction scenarios, involving more powerful federated searchers.
