 14.4    Libraries and Digital Library Projects Libraries are concerned with enhanced, seamless access to electronic information from all sources. These libraries [351] see the library's Web pages, not the OPAC, as the entry point for library users. Through the web pages the user gains access to the library catalog, networked information resources, and locally created information, (p.5) Through the Web, a single interface can provide access to the local OPAC and reference materials, as well as to remotely accessible databases in the sciences, humanities, and business, including full-text journals, newspapers, and directories. Special collections, in multimedia as well as text formats, become available to the user through the same gateway. Many libraries, particularly academic and large public libraries, have undertaken digital library projects to achieve interoperability, ease of use, and equity of access (see Chapter 15). Two such projects, the Los Angeles Public Library's Virtual Electronic Library project (http://www.lapl.org), and University of Pennsylvania's Digital Library (http://www.library.upenn.edu) are described in [351]. The Web not only provides integration in terms of resources and collections, but the accompanying standards which support interoperability lead to a uniform search architecture. With this approach, the traditional distinction between information retrieval from OPACs and from remote electronic databases is beginning to disappear.
