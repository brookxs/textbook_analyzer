 9.2.1    Introduction We can approach the development of parallel information retrieval algorithms from two different directions. One possibility is to develop new retrieval strategies that directly lend themselves to parallel implementation. For example, a text search procedure can be built on top of a neural network. Neural networks (see Chapter 2) are modeled after the human brain and solve problems using a large number of nodes (neurons), each of which has a set of inputs, a threshold, and an output. The output of one node is connected to the input of one or more other nodes, with the boundaries of the network defining the initial input and final output of the system. A node's output value is determined by a weighted function of the node's inputs and threshold. A training procedure is used to learn appropriate settings for the weights and thresholds in the network. Computation proceeds by applying input values to the network, computing each active node's output value, and conditioning these values through the network until the final output values are obtained. Neural networks naturally lend themselves to parallel implementation on SIMD hardware. The challenge with this approach is to PARALLEL IR        233 define the retrieval task in such a way that it maps well onto the computational paradigm. The other possibility is to adapt existing, well studied information retrieval algorithms to parallel processing. This is the approach that we will consider throughout the rest of this chapter. The modifications required to adapt an existing algorithm to parallel implementation depend on the target parallel platform. We will investigate techniques for applying a number of retrieval algorithms to both MIMD and SIMD architectures. Since parallel information retrieval is still very much an active research area, few approaches have fallen out as accepted standard techniques. We will, therefore, present a sampling of the work that has been done and avoid preferring one technique over another.
