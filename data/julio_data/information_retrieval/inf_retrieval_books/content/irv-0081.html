 Interpolation  Many interpolation techniques have been suggested in the literature. See, for example, Keen[11].  Figure 7.3 shows a typical P-R graph for a single query. The points A, B, C and D, I shall call the observed points, since these are the only points observed directly during an experiment the others may be inferred from these. Thus given that A = (R1, P1) has been observed, then the next point B is the one corresponding to an increase in recall, which follows from a unit increase in the number of relevant documents retrieved. Between any two observed points the recall remains constant, since no more relevant documents are retrieved.  It is an experimental fact that average precision-recall graphs are monotonically decreasing. Consistent with this, a linear interpolation estimates the best possible performance between any two adjacent observed points. To avoid inflating the experimental results it is probably better to perform a more conservative interpolation as follows:  Let (R[[lambda]] , P[[lambda]] ) be the set of precision-recall values obtained by varying some parameter [[lambda]]. To obtain the set of observed points we specify a subset of the parameters [[lambda]]. Thus (R[[theta]] , P[[theta]] ) is an observed point if [[theta]] corresponds to a value of [[lambda]] at which an increase in recall is produced. We now have:  Gs = (R[[theta]]s, P[[theta]]s )  the set of observed points for a request. To interpolate between any two points we define:  Ps(R) = {sup P : R' gt;= R s.t. (R', P) [[propersubset]] Gs}  where R is a standard recall value. From this we obtain the average precision value at the standard recall value R by:  The set of observed points is such that the interpolated function is monotonically decreasing. Figure 7.3 shows the effect of the interpolation procedure, essentially it turns the P-R curve into a step-function with the jumps at the observed points. A necessary consequence of its monotonicity is that the average P-R curve will also be monotonically decreasing. It is possible to define the set of observed points in such a way that the interpolate function is not monotonically decreasing. In practice, even for this case, we have that the average precision-recall curve is monotonically decreasing.  In Figure 7.4 we illustrate the interpolation and averaging process.
