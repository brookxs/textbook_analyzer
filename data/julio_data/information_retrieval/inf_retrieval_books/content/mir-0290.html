 15.1    Introduction Information retrieval is essential for the success of digital libraries (digital librarys), so they can achieve high levels of effectiveness while at the same time affording ease of use to a diverse community. Accordingly, a significant portion of the research and development efforts related to digital librarys has been in the IR area. This chapter reviews some of these efforts, organizes them into a simple framework, and highlights needs for the future. Those interested in a broader overview of the field are encouraged to refer to the excellent book by Lesk [501] and the high quality papers in proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries Conferences. Those more comfortable with online information should refer to D-Lib Magazine [280]; the publications of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 'Research on Digital Libraries Initiative7 (digital libraryI) [349]; or online courseware [268]. There also have been special issues of journals devoted to the topic [265, 267, 710]. Recently, it has become clear that a global focus is needed [270] to extend beyond publications that have a regional [55] or national emphasis [221]. Many people's views of digital librarys are built from the foundation of current libraries [683]. Capture and conversion (digitization) are key concerns [160], but digital librarys are more than digital collections [634]. It is very important to understand the assumptions adopted in this movement towards digital librarys [509] and, in some cases, to relax them [29]. Futuristic perspectives of libraries have been a key part of the science fiction literature [811] as well as rooted in visionary statements that led to much of the work in IR and hypertext [135]. digital librarys have been envisaged since the earliest days 415 416        DIGITAL LIBRARIES of the IR field. Thus, in Libraries of the Future, Licklider lays out many of the challenges, suggests a number of solutions, and clearly calls for IR-related efforts [516]. He describes and predicts a vast expansion of the world of publishing, indicating the critical need to manage the record of knowledge, including search, retrieval, and all the related supporting activities. He notes that to handle this problem we have no underlying theory, no coherent representation scheme, no unification of the varied approaches of different computing specialties รณ and so must tackle it from a number of directions. After more than 30 years of progress in computing, we still face these challenges and work in this field as a segmented community, viewing digital librarys from one or another perspective: database management, human-computer interaction (HCI), information science, library science, multimedia information and systems, natural language processing, or networking and communications. As can be seen in the discussion that follows, this practice has led to progress in a large number of separate projects, but has also made interoperability one of the most important problems to solve [624]. Since one of the threads leading to the current interest in digital librarys came out of discussions of the future of IR [264], since people's needs still leave a rich research agenda for the IR community [197], and since the important role of Web search systems demonstrates the potential value of IR in digital librarys [711], it is appropriate to see how IR may expand its horizons to deal with the key problems of digital librarys and how it can provide a unifying and integrating framework for the digital library field. Unfortunately, there is little agreement even regarding attempts at integrating database management and text processing approaches [325]. Sometimes, though, it is easier to solve a hard problem if one takes a broader perspective and solves a larger problem. Accordingly we briefly and informally introduce the k5S' model as a candidate solution and a way to provide some theoretical and practical unification for digital librarys. We argue that digital librarys in particular, as well as many other types of information systems, can be described, modeled, designed, implemented, used, and evaluated if we move to the foreground five key abstractions: streams, structures, spaces, scenarios, and societies. 'Streams' have often been used to describe texts, multimedia content, and other sequences of abstract items, including protocols, interactive dialogs, server logs, and human discussions. 'Structures' cover data structures, databases, hypertext networks, and all of the IR constructs such as inverted files, signature files, MARC records (see Chapter 8 for more details), and thesauri. "Spaces" cover not only ID, 2D, 3D, virtual reality, and other multidimensional forms, some including time, but also vector spaces, probability spaces, concept spaces, and results of multidimensional scaling or latent-semantic indexing. 'Scenarios' not only cover stories, HCI designs and specifications, and requirements statements, but also describe processes, procedures, functions, services, and transformations รณ the active and time-spanning aspects of digital librarys. Scenarios have been essential to our understanding of different digital library user communities" needs [525], and are particularly important in connection with social issues [48]. 'Societies' cover these concerns especially regarding authors, librarians, annotators, and other stakeholders. For the sake of brevity we omit further DEFINITIONS        417 direct discussion of this abstraction, especially since anthropologists, communication researchers, psychologists, sociologists, and others are now engaging in digital library research. Since the 5S model can be used to describe work on databases, HCI, hyper-bases, multimedia systems, and networks, as well as other fields related to library and information science, we refer to it below to help unify our coverage and make sure that it encompasses all aspects of digital librarys. For example, the 5S model in general, and scenarios in particular, may help us move from a paper-centered framework for publishing and communicating knowledge [195] to a hybrid paper/electronic one with a variety of streams and spaces. The 5S model is a simple way to organize our thinking and understand some of the changes that digital librarys will facilitate: The boundaries between authors, publishers, libraries, and readers evolved partly in response to technology, particularly the difficulty and expense of creating and storing paper documents. New technologies can shift the balance and blur the boundaries. [525] To ground these and other subsequent discussions, then, we explore a number of definitions of digital librarys, using 5S to help us see what is missing or emphasized in each.
