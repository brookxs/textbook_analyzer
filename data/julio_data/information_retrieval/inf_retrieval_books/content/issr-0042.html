 3.3 AUTOMATIC INDEXING  Automatic indexing is the capability for the system to automatically determine the index terms to be assigned to an item. The simplest case is when all words in the document are used as possible index terms (total document indexing). Cataloging and Indexing                                                                             59  More complex processing is required when the objective is to emulate a human indexer and determine a limited number of index terms for the major concepts in the item. As discussed, the advantages of human indexing are the ability to determine concept abstraction and judge the value of a concept. The disadvantages of human indexing over automatic indexing are cost, processing  INDEX TERMS                                         Methodology  oil, wells, Mexico, CITGO, refineries,                No linking of terms  Peru, BP, drilling  (oil wells, Mexico, drilling, CITGO)                     linked (Precoordination)  (U.S.,oil refineries, Peru, introduction)  (CITGO, drill, oil wells, Mexico)                          linked (Precoordination)  (U.S., introduction, oil refineries, Peru)                 with position indicating role  (SUBJECT: CITGO;                               linked (Pre-coordination)  ACTION: drilling;                                with modifier indicating role  OBJECT: oil,wells MODIFIER: in Mexico)  (SUBJECT:U.S.; ACTION:introduces; OBJECT: oil refineries; MODIFIER: in Peru)  Figure 3.2 Linkage of Index Terms  time and consistency.   Once the initial hardware cost is amortized, the costs of  automatic indexing are absorbed as part of the normal operations and maintenance costs of the computer system. There are no additional indexing costs versus the salaries and benefits regularly paid to human indexers.  Processing time of an item by a human Indexer varies significantly based upon the indexer's knowledge of the concepts being indexed, the exhaustivlty and specificity guidelines and the amount and accuracy of preprocessing via Automatic File Build. Even for relatively short items (e.g., 300 - 500 words) it normally takes at least five minutes per item. A significant portion of this time is caused by the human interaction with the computer (e.g., typing speeds, cursor positioning, correcting spelling errors, taking breaks between activities).   Automatic indexing 60                                                                                                Chapter 3  requires only a few seconds or less of computer time based upon the size of the processor and the complexity of the algorithms to generate the index.  Another advantage to automatic indexing is the predictably of algorithms. If the indexing is being performed automatically, by an algorithm, there is consistency in the index term selection process. Human indexers typically generate different indexing for the same document. In an experiment on consistency in TREC-2, there was, on the average, a 20 per cent difference in judgment of the same item's topics between the original and a second independent judge of over 400 items (Harman-95). Since the judgments on relevance are different, the selection of index terms and their weighting to reflect the topics is also different. In automatic indexing, a sophisticated researcher understands the automatic process and be able to predict its utility and deficiencies, allowing for compensation for system characteristics in a search strategy. Even the end user, after interacting with the system, understands for certain classes of information and certain sources, the ability of the system to find relevant items is worse than other classes and sources. For example, the user may determine that searching for economic issues is far less precise than political issues in a particular newspaper based information system. The user may also determine that it is easier to find economic data in a information database containing Business Weekly than the newspaper source.  Indexes resulting from automated indexing fall into two classes: weighted and unweighted. In an unweighted indexing system, the existence of an index term in a document and sometimes its word location(s) are kept as part of the searchable data structure. No attempt is made to discriminate between the value of the index terms in representing concepts in the item. Looking at the index, it is not possible to tell the difference between the main topics in the item and a casual reference to a concept. This architecture is typical of the commercial systems through the 1980s. Queries against unweighted systems are based upon Boolean logic and the items in the resultant Hit file are considered equal in value. The last item presented in the file is as likely as the first item to be relevant to the user's information need.  In a weighted indexing system, an attempt is made to place a value on the index term's representation of its associated concept in the document. An index term's weight is based upon a fiinction associated with the frequency of occurrence of the term in the item. Luhe, one of the pioneers in automatic indexing, introduced the concept of the "resolving power" of a term. Luhn postulated that the significance of a concept in an item is directly proportional to the frequency of use of the word associated with the concept in the document (Luhn-58, Salton-75). This is reinforced by the studies of Brookstein, Klein and Raita that show "content bearing" words are not randomly distributed (i.e., Poisson distributed), but that their occurrence "clump" within items (Brookstein-95). Typically, values for the index terms are normalized between zero and one. The higher the weight, the more the term represents a concept discussed in the item. The weight can be adjusted to account for other information such as the number of items in the database that contain the same concept (sec Chapter 5). Cataloging and Indexing                                                                               61  The query process uses the weights along with any weights assigned to terms in the query to determine a scalar value (rank value) used in predicting the likelihood that an item satisfies the query. Thresholds or a parameter specifying the maximum number of items to be returned are used to bound the number of items returned to a user (see Chapter 7). The results are presented to the user in order of the rank value from highest number to lowest number.  Automatic indexing can either try to preserve the original text of an item basing the final set of searchable index values on the original text or map the item into a completely different representation, called concept indexing, and use the concepts as a basis for the final set of index values. The automatic indexing techniques are introduced in this section and later described in detail in Chapter 5.
