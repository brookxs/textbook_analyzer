 7.2.1    Lexical Analysis of the Text Lexical analysis is the process of converting a stream of characters (the text of the documents) into a stream of words (the candidate words to be adopted as index terms). Thus, one of the major objectives of the lexical analysis phase is the identification of the words in the text. At first glance, all that seems to be involved is the recognition of spaces as word separators (in which case, multiple 166 TEXT OPERATIONS Figure 7.1    Logical view of a document throughout the various phases of text preprocessing. spaces are reduced to one space). However, there is more to it than this. For instance, the following four particular cases have to be considered with care [263]: digits, hyphens, punctuation marks, and the case of the letters (lower and upper case). Numbers are usually not good index terms because, without a surrounding context, they are inherently vague. For instance, consider that a user is interested in documents about the number of deaths due to car accidents between the years 1910 and 1989. Such a request could be specified as the set of index terms {deaths, car, accidents, years, 1910, 1989}. However, the presence of the numbers 1910 and 1989 in the query could lead to the retrieval, for instance, of a variety of documents which refer to either of these two years. The problem is that numbers by themselves are just too vague. Thus, in general it is wise to disregard numbers as index terms. However, we have also to consider that digits might appear mixed within a word. For instance, '510B.C/ is a clearly important index term. In this case, it is not clear what rule should be applied. Furthermore, a sequence of 16 digits identifying a credit card number might be highly relevant in a given context and, in this case, should be considered as an index term. A preliminary approach for treating digits in the text might be to remove all words containing sequences of digits unless specified otherwise (through regular expressions). Further, an advanced lexical analysis procedure might perform some date and number normalization to unify formats. Hyphens pose another difficult decision to the lexical analyzer. Breaking up hyphenated words might be useful due to inconsistency of usage. For instance, this allows treating "state-of-the-art' and 'state of the art' identically. However, there are words which include hyphens as an integral part. For instance, gilt-edge, B-49, etc. Again, the most suitable procedure seems to adopt a general role and specify the exceptions on a case by case basis. Normally, punctuation marks are removed entirely in the process of lexical analysis.  While some punctuation marks are an integral part of the word (for DOCUMENT PREPROCESSING         167 instance, '510B.C.7), removing them does not seem to have an impact in retrieval performance because the risk of misinterpretation in this case is minimal. In fact, if the user specifies '510B.C in his query, removal of the dot both in the query term and in the documents will not affect retrieval. However, very particular scenarios might again require the preparation of a list of exceptions. For instance, if a portion of a program code appears in the text, it might be wise to distinguish between the variables 'x.id' and *xid.' In this case, the dot mark should not be removed. The case of letters is usually not important for the identification of index terms. As a result, the lexical analyzer normally converts all the text to either lower or upper case. However, once more, very particular scenarios might require the distinction to be made. For instance, when looking for documents which describe details about the command language of a Unix-like operating system, the user might explicitly desire the non-conversion of upper cases because this is the convention in the operating system. Further, part of the semantics might be lost due to case conversion. For instance, the words Bank and bank have different meanings รณ a fact common to many other pairs of words. As pointed out by Fox [263], all these text operations can be implemented without difficulty. However, careful thought should be given to each one of them because they might have a profound impact at document retrieval time. This is particularly worrisome in those situations in which the user finds it difficult to understand what the indexing strategy is doing. Unfortunately, there is no clear solution to this problem. As already mentioned, some Web search engines are opting for avoiding text operations altogether because this simplifies the interpretation the user has of the retrieval task. Whether this strategy will be the one of choice in the long term remains to be seen.
