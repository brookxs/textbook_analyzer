 Ring structures  A ring is simply a linear list that closes upon itself. In terms of the definition of a K-list, the beginning and end of the list are the same record. This data-structure is particularly useful to show classification of data.  Let us suppose that a set of documents  {Dl, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8}  has been classified into four groups, that is  {(Dl, D2), (D3, D4), (D5, D6), (D7, D8)}  Furthermore these have themselves been classified into two groups,  {((Dl, D2), (D3, D4)), ((D5, D6), (D7, D8))}  The dendrogram for this structure would be that given in Figure 4.7. To represent this in storage by means of ring structures is now a simple matter (see Figure 4.8).  The Di indicates a description (representation) of a document. Notice how the rings at a lower level are contained in those at a higher level. The field marked Ci normally contains some identifying information with respect to the ring it subsumes. For example, C1 in some way identifies the class of documents {D1, D2}.  Were we to group documents according to the keywords they shared, then for each keyword we would have a group of documents, namely, those which had that keyword in common. Ci would then be the field containing the keyword uniting that particular group. The rings would of course overlap (Figure 4.9), as in this example:  D1 = {K1, K2}  D2 = {K2, K3}  D3 = {K1, K4}  The usefulness of this kind of structure will become more apparent when we discuss searching of classifications. If each ring has associated with it a record which contains identifying information for its members, then, a search strategy searching a structure such as this will first look at Ci (or Ki in the second example) to determine whether to proceed or abandon the search.
