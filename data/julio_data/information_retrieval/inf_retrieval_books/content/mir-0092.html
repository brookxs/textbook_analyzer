 5.4    Automatic Global Analysis The methods of local analysis discussed above extract information from the local set of documents retrieved to expand the query. It is well accepted that such a procedure yields improved retrieval performance with various collections. An alternative approach is to expand the query using information from the whole set of documents in the collection. Strategies based on this idea are called global analysis procedures. Until the beginning of the 1990s, global analysis was considered to be a technique which failed to yield consistent improvements in retrieval performance with general collections. This perception has changed with the appearance of modern procedures for global analysis. In the following, we discuss two of these modern variants. Both of them are based on a thesaurus-like structure built using all the documents in the collection. However, the approach taken for building the thesaurus and the procedure for selecting terms for query expansion are quite distinct in the two cases.
