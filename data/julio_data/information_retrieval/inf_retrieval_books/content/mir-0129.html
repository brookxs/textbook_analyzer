 7.4.4    Dictionary Methods Dictionary methods achieve compression by replacing groups of consecutive symbols (or phrases) with a pointer to an entry in a dictionary. Thus, the central decision in the design of a dictionary method is the selection of entries in the dictionary. The choice of phrases can be made by static, semi-adaptive, or adaptive algorithms. The simplest dictionary schemes use static dictionaries containing short phrases. Static dictionary encoders are fast as they demand little effort for achieving a small amount of compression. One example that has been proposed several times in different forms is the digram coding, where selected pairs of letters are replaced with codewords. At each step the next two characters are inspected and verified if they correspond to a digram in the dictionary. If so, they are coded together and the coding position is shifted by two characters: otherwise, the single character is represented by its normal code and the coding 184        TEXT OPERATIONS position is shifted by one character. The main problem with static dictionary encoders is that the dictionary might be suitable for one text and unsuitable for another. One way to avoid this problem is to use a semi-static dictionary scheme, constructing a new dictionary for each text to be compressed. However, the problem of deciding which phrases should be put in the dictionary is not an easy task at all. One elegant solution to this problem is to use an adaptive dictionary scheme, such as the one proposed in the 1970s by Ziv and Lempel. The Ziv-Lempel type of adaptive dictionary scheme uses the idea of replacing strings of characters with a reference to a previous occurrence of the string. This approach is effective because most characters can be coded as part of a string that has occurred earlier in the text. If the pointer to an earlier occurrence of a string is stored in fewer bits than the string it replaces then compression is achieved. Adaptive dictionary methods present some disadvantages over the statistical word-based Huffman method. First, they do not allow decoding to start in the middle of a compressed file. As a consequence direct access to a position in the compressed text is not possible, unless the entire text is decoded from the beginning until the desired position is reached. Second, dictionary schemes are still popular for their speed and economy of memory, but the new results in statistical methods make them the method of choice in an IR environment. Moreover, the improvement of computing technology will soon make statistical methods feasible for general use, and the interest in dictionary methods will eventually decrease.
