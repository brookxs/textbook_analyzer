 3.2.2 Zipfs Own Explanation  To explain his empirical observations, Zipf himself proposed a theoretical model that described the ultimate purpose of communication between authors and readers.  Zipfs theory was extraordinarily broad, addressing not only (!) patterns in text but also patterns across all human activities. According WEIGHTING AND MATCHING AGAINST INDICES       65  to Zipf 's fundamental Principle of Least Effort all activities can be viewed as interactions between jobs needing to be done and tools developed to accomplish the jobs. In a mature society in which a variety of jobs and tools have existed for some time, a "reciprocal economy" forms. That is, there is a set of tools appropriate for doing certain jobs, and there is a set of jobs requiring certain tools. The Principle of Least Effort asserts that a person attempting to apply a tool to a job does so in order to minimize the probable effort in using that tool for that particular job.  In applying this principle to texts, Zipf makes an important correspondence - words work as tools, accomplishing jobs we need done. To simplify the situation greatly, imagine that the job an author is attempting to accomplish is simply to "point" to some referent, something in the world."'' Authors would find it most convenient to simply use one Pointing word all the time for all the jobs they are trying to accomplish. It makes their task much easier; picking the right word is effortless. The author has a pressure toward unification of the vocabulary.  From the reader's point of view, it would be least ambiguous if a unique term were used for every possible function, every possible interpretation, every meaning. Readers therefore have a pressure toward diversification of the vocabulary. This leads to the vocabulary balance we observe in Zipf's rule. Zipf hypothesized that interplay between the forces of diversification and unification results in the use of existing words, which does not extend the vocabulary in most situations, together with the inclusion of new words in those novel situations that demand them. The trick is to find an economy of language that best satisfies both writer and reader. Note, however, that the maintenance of the balance requires that authors receive feedback from their readers, confirming that they are both "pointing" to the same referent.  Blair has extended Zipf's analysis, considering ZipPs tool/job setting as it's applied to our FOA task [Blair, 1990; Blair, 1992]. He argues that one of the primary reasons FOA systems fail is that the vocabulary balance is upset. The system of descriptors indexing the authors' works (for example, the library or the Web), standing between the authors who are writing the books and the searchers attempting to find them, breaks the feedback channel that keeps the shared vocabulary in balance when author and reader are in direct contact.
