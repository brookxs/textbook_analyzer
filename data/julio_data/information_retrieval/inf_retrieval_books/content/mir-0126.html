 7.4.1    Motivation Text compression is about finding ways to represent the text in fewer bits or bytes. The amount of space required to store text on computers can be reduced significantly using compression techniques. Compression methods create a reduced representation by identifying and using structures that exist in the text. From the compressed version, the original text can be reconstructed exactly. Text compression is becoming an important issue in an information retrieval environment.   The widespread use of digital libraries, office automation 174        TEXT OPERATIONS systems, document databases, and the Web has led to an explosion of textual information available online. In this scenario, text compression appears as an attractive option for reducing costs associated with space requirements, input/output (I/O) overhead, and communication delays. The gain obtained from compressing text is that it requires less storage space, it takes less time to be transmitted over a communication link, and it takes less time to search directly the compressed text. The price paid is the time necessary to code and decode the text. A major obstacle for storing text in compressed form is the need for IR systems to access text randomly. To access a given word in a compressed text, it is usually necessary to decode the entire text from the beginning until the desired word is reached. It could be argued that a large text could be divided into blocks that are compressed independently, thus allowing fast random access to each block. However, efficient compression methods need to process some text before making compression effective (usually more than 10 kilobytes). The smaller the blocks, the less effective compression is expected to be. Our discussion here focuses on text compression methods which are suitable for use in an IR environment. For instance, a successful idea aimed at merging the requirements of compression algorithms and the needs of IR systems is to consider that the symbols to be compressed are words and not characters (character-based compression is the more conventional approach). Words are the atoms on which most IR systems are built. Moreover, it is now known that much better compression is achieved by taking words as symbols (instead of characters). Further, new word-based compression methods allow random access to words within the compressed text which is a critical issue for an IR system. Besides the economy of space obtained by a compression method, there are other important characteristics to be considered such as compression and decompression speed. In some situations, decompression speed is more important than compression speed. For instance, this is the case with textual databases in which it is common to compress the text once and to read it many times from disk. Another important characteristic of a compression method is the possibility of performing compressed pattern matching, defined as the task of performing pattern matching in a compressed text without decompressing it. In this case, sequential searching can be speeded up by compressing the search key rather than decoding the compressed text being searched. As a consequence, it is possible to search faster on compressed text because much less text has to be scanned. Chapter 8 presents efficient methods to deal with searching the compressed text directly. When the text collection is large, efficient text retrieval requires specialized index techniques. A simple and popular indexing structure for text collections are the inverted files. Inverted files (see Chapter 8 for details) are especially adequate when the pattern to be searched for is formed by simple words. Since this is a common type of query (for instance, when searching the Web), inverted files are widely used for indexing large text collections. An inverted file is typically composed of (a) a vector containing all the distinct words in the text collection (which is called the vocabulary) and (b) for TEXT COMPRESSION        175 each word in the vocabulary, a list of all documents (identified by document numbers) in which that word occurs. Because each list of document numbers (within the inverted file) is organized in ascending order, specific compression methods have been proposed for them, leading to very efficient index compression schemes. This is important because query processing time is highly related to index access time. Thus, in this section, we also discuss some of the most important index compression techniques. We first introduce basic concepts related to text compression. We then present some of the most important statistical compression methods, followed by a brief review of compression methods based on a dictionary. At the end, we discuss the application of compression to inverted files.
