 12.5.2    Lower-bounding In applying the GEMINI method for color indexing, there are two obstacles: first, the 'dimensionality curse' (k may be large, e.g. 64 or 256 for color features) and, most importantly, the quadratic nature of the distance function.  The distance function in the feature space involves cross-talk among the features (see equation 12.6), and thus it is a full quadratic form involving all cross terms. Not only is such a function much more expensive to compute than a Euclidean (or any Lp) distance, but it also precludes efficient implementation of commonly used spatial access methods. Figure 12.8 illustrates the situation. To compute the distance between the two color histograms x and q, the, e.g., bright-red component off has to be compared not only to the bright-red component of q, but also to the pink, orange, etc. components of q. TWO-DIMENSIONAL COLOR IMAGES        359 bright red pink orange _e.g., 64 colors. Figure 12.8    Illustration of the 'cross-talk' between two color histograms. To resolve the cross-talk problem, we try to apply the GEMINI approach (algorithm 2). The first step of the algorithm has been done: the distance function between two color images is given by equation 12.6, that is, V() = dhistO-The second step is to find one or more numerical features, whose Euclidean distance would lower-bound dhistO- Thus, we ask the feature-extracting question again: // we are allowed to use only one numerical feature to describe each color image, what should this feature be? Taking a cue from the previous section on time series, we can consider some average value, or the first few coefficients of the two-dimensional DFT transform. Since we have three color components, (e.g., Red, Green, and Blue), we could consider the average amount of red, green, and blue in a given color image. Notice that different color spaces (such as Munsell) can be used, with absolutely no change in our indexing algorithms. Thus, we continue the discussion with the RGB color space. This means that the color of an individual pixel is described by the triplet (R,G,B) (for cR'ed, 'G'reen, 4B'lue). The average color vector of an image or item x = {Ravg, GaVgy Bavg)t, is defined in the obvious way, with p=l p p=l p Bavg     = p=l where P is the number of pixels in the item, and R(p), G(p), and B(p) are the red, green and blue components (intensities, typically in the range 0-255) respectively of the p-th pixel. Given the average colors j1 and y of two items, we define davg() as the Euclidean distance between the three-dimensional average 360        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING color vectors, d2avg{x,y) = (x-y)\x~y)                                                    (12.7) The third step of the GEMINI algorithm is to prove that our simplified distance davg() lower-bounds the actual distance dhistQ- Indeed, this is true, as an application of the so-called Quadratic Distance Bounding or QDB Theorem (see [244]). The result is that, given a color query, our retrieval proceeds by first filtering the set of images based on their average (R, G, B) color, then doing a final, more accurate matching using their full /c-element histogram. The resulting speedup is discussed next.
