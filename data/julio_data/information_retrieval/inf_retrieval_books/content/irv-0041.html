 Cellular multi-lists  A further modification of the multi-list is inspired by the fact that many storage media are divided into pages, which can be retrieved one at a time. A K-list may cross several page boundaries which means that several pages may have to be accessed to retrieve one record. A modified multi-list structure which avoids this is called a cellular multi-list. The K-lists are limited so that they will not cross the page (cell) boundaries.  At this point the full power of the notation introduced before comes into play. The directory for a cellular multi-list will be the set of sequences  (Ki, ni, hi, ai1, . . . aihi) i = 1, 2, . . . , m  where the hi have been picked to ensure that a Ki-list does not cross a page boundary. In an implementation, just as in the implementation of an index-sequential file, further information will be stored with each address to enable the right page to be located for each key value.
