 8.1 Things that Are Changing  Alta Vista was, in 1995, arguably the first search engine offered for general use, so Alta Vista's history1 is especially interesting. At that time, Alta Vista was developed by Digital Equipment Corporation to primarily demonstrate how powerful its new Alpha architecture was, especially its  then-novel 64-bit addressing and the consequentially vast data spaces. Indexing all the WWW's pages and providing a useful service to many  was simply good publicity.  Since that time Digital Equipment has been acquired by Compaq, and Alta vista has been spun off to CMGL As searching newly authored pages on the WWW has become increasingly profitable, similar  ! doc. altavlsta. com/company info /aJxgt;ut^v/baalqÂ£round. slitml  192 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS       293  search technologies have been applied to existing, traditionally published corpora to form the next generation of digital libraries [Fox and Marchionini, 1998; Paepcke et al., 1998]. It is amazing how closely they resemble the vision H. G. Wells had of what a "World Encyclopedia5' might mean, as early as 1938 [Wells, 1938]!  As the Internet reaches a mass audience and these new search engine users begin to FOA in earnest, important new data are becoming available about how these real users (as opposed to most IR experimental subjects; cf. Section 4.3.1) behave. Silverstein et al. report on their analysis of approximately one billion (109) queries issued against the Alta Vista search engine during six weeks in August and September 1998 [Silverstein et al., 1999]. Another important qualification on this preliminary study is that no attempt was made to discriminate "real," human-generated queries from automatic queries generated by robots. Still, several features of this study are significant.  First, fully 15% of the queries were entirely empty; they contained no keywords! Two-thirds of these empty queries were generated within Alta Vista's "advanced query" interface. Clearly, good interface design and user education remains a fundamental issue for effective search engine design.  Second, WWW searches use very short? simple queries, averaging only 2.3 keywords/query (not including the zero-length queries in this average). Only 12.6 percent of queries used more than three keywords. Of course, the fact that Alta Vista's interface does not easily support longer relevance feedback queries (cf. Section 3.6) keeps these from occurring. Most users also avoid query syntax and issue simple queries: Only 20 percent of queries used any of Alta Vista's query operators (+, -, and, or, not, near); half of these used only one operator.  These findings are especially significant because they paint a different picture of the "typical user" from what IR has traditionally held. When IR systems were first developed, the target audience was primarily reference librarians, search intermediates who helped library patrons find what they were seeking from sophisticated systems such as DIALOG. These librarians were specially educated, in particular in the subtleties of Boolean query operators and other sophisticated techniques for constructing exactly the right "magic bullet'* query for a particular corpus. IR system design and theory therefore generally 294      FINDING OUT ABOUT  assumed that queries were fairly rich, structured expressions. At least at the moment, these assumptions do not seem to hold for most Web searching.  But despite the relatively simple form of most queries, the third  interesting fact is that Web queries are rarely repeated. Even folding case  and ignoring word order, only one third of queries appeared more than  once in the billion queries; only 14 percent occurred more than three  We mostly ask      times.t These statistics are especially significant in the face of new services  about SEX          suc]1 as Ask Jeeves,2 which focus on providing especially relevant answers  for a restricted set of anticipated queries.  Finally, Silverstein et al. attempted to analyze query sessions. Knowing when a query is part of a session is notoriously difficult, especially when some queries are being generated by robots; this study used a combination of server-set cookies and a five-minute time window to capture coherent searches by the same user. It appears that 78 percent of query sessions involve only a single query and that an average session involves only two queries! These data are preliminary, but they provide an interesting contrast to the power law, Zipfian distribution of Web surfing behavior reported by Huberman et al. [Huberman et al, 1998] (cf. Section 3.2.5).  The primary extension of the search engine technology developed so far in this text is the crawling function that must harvest Web pages prior to their indexing. The design of Web crawlers is now one of the most active areas of computer science research; we provide only a few basic references here.
