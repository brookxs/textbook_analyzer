 6.5.3 Discovering Latent Knowledge within a Corpus  Nothing is more frustrating than spending many hours on a technical problem, unless it is finding out later that someone else had previously solved the same problem! One of the motivations shared by many people working on search engine technology is the hope that we can reduce the number of times the same wheel is reinvented.  D. R. Swanson has concentrated on the scientific and medical literature and viewed it as "a potential source of new knowledge" [Swanson, 1990; Swanson and Smalheiser, 1997]. Each new medical report contains new knowledge about some particular disease or treatment. But Swanson has taken the next step: to imagine what modes of inference might be most appropriate across a network of such papers, each of which describes potential causal relations:  Each scientific article contributes to a web of logical connections that interlace the literature of science. Some of these connections are made explicit through references from one  article to another, citations that reflect, among other things, authors' perceptions of how their own work is related to that of others and how it fits into the scheme of existing knowledge. However, there may exist many implicit logical interarticle INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      235  connections that are unintended and not marked by citations; such implicit links are the focus of this paper. (The word "logical" here is used informally; a "logical connection" is formed by statements that are related by any process of scientific reasoning or argument.)  Scientific articles can be seen as clustering into more or less independent sets or "literatures." Within each set, common problems are addressed, common arguments are advanced, and articles "interact" by citing one another. Distinct literatures that are essentially unrelated are in general "noninteractive" in that they do not cite or refer directly to each other, have no articles in common, and are not cited together by other articles. On the other hand, if two literatures are linked by arguments that they respectively put forward - that is, are "logically" related or connected - one would expect them to cite each other. If they do not, then the logical connections between them would be of great interest, for such connections may be unintended, unnoticed, and unknown - therefore potential sources of new knowledge....  The number of possible pairs of literatures (that might be connected) increases very nearly as the square of the number of literatures; the number of possible connections increases at even a greater rate if triple or higher combinations are taken into account rather than just pairs. From this perspective, the significance of the "information explosion" may lie not in an explosion of quantity per se, but in an incalculably greater combinatorial explosion of unnoticed logical connections, (pp. 29, 35)  Swanson's first and most well-known example of new knowledge  discovered in this fashion identified fish oil as a treatment for Raynaud's syndrome, a circulatory problem resulting in poor blood supply to the extremities. Figure 6.22 shows a second example of Swanson's method. Beginning with a syndrome like migraine headaches, Swanson searches the literature for features mentioned in the context of migraines that have also been mentioned in a second, disjoint, "mutually oblivious" literature. Working backwards from the syndrome to be explained, a query is formed against a medical corpus like Medline.

The clusters are used to suggest new additional queries. Finally, the single common "cause" of magnesium is identified. Figure 6.22 also shows an attempt to classify the relationship between common phrases in the retrieved literature and the relation to the syndrome. Further, the relationship between these same phrases (or lexical variations on them!) and the common cause magnesium is also forced into structured relationships.  It is hard to imagine a more exciting prospect for the analysis of all literature. The identification of such "undiscovered public knowledge" is almost certainly possible in many other situations. The question INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      237  becomes how we might algorithmically search for all of them. Note especially the liberties taken in interpreting the literature and phrases used consistently within it as they have been transformed into the structured relations of Figure 6.22. These relations are meant to suggest more formal and powerful modes of inference between causes and effects mentioned within each paper. Some of the arrowheads show suggested causal relationships; some relationships (e.g., associated_with) are neutral with respect to correlation versus causation; others (type.of) suggest hierarchic relations between classes.  Swanson is aware of these difficulties:  ... [the] form and structure of logically connected arguments are in general recognizable by scientists irrespective of their specialty, a point that may have implications for research on futuristic, more fully automated systems. However, the simple structure of the syllogistic model does not in many respects reflect the depth or range of actual problems that would be encountered if  one tried to build a database of logical connections___  The objective, moreover, is not simply to draw mechanistic logical inferences, but rather to determine whether certain plausible connections or hypotheses appear to be worth testing. Most articles harbor, either explicitly or implicitly, an enormous number of logical connections. Which connections are relevant and important can be determined only in the light of a specific context, hypothesis, problem, or question; but such contexts and questions are always changing. The degree to which one can hope to encode logical connections in any form suitable for all future uses may therefore be quite limited. [Swanson, 1990, p. 35]  Recognizing that even if fully automatic discovery of new facts is currently too hard, Gordon and Lindsey have investigated forms of  "discovery support" [Gordon and Lindsay, 1996]. Gordon and Duraais have also explored the use of LSI techniques (cf. Section 5.2.3) as part of the literature-based discovery process [Gordon and Dumais, 1998]. The formation of an SVD, eigenstructure analysis of the relationship between a query and documents (step 2), and then the analysis of these intermediate literatures and ultimate causes (step 3) is an 238       FINDING OUT ABOUT  important extension beyond the  manual investigations  originally proposed by Swanson.
