 Introduction  So far in this book we have made very little use of probability theory in modelling any sub-system in IR. The reason for this is simply that the bulk of the work in IR is non-probabilistic, and it is only recently that some significant headway has been made with probabilistic methods[1,2,3]. The history of the use of probabilistic methods goes back as far as the early sixties but for some reason the early ideas never took hold. In this chapter I shall be describing methods of retrieval, i.e. searching and stopping rules, based on probabilistic considerations. In Chapter 2 I dealt with automatic indexing based on a probabilistic model of the distribution of word tokens within a document (text); here I will be concerned with the distribution of index terms over the set of documents making up a collection or file. I shall be relying heavily on the familiar assumption that the distribution of index terms throughout the collection, or within some subset of it, will tell us something about the likely relevance of any given document.  Perhaps it is as well to warn the reader that some of the material in this chapter is rather mathematical. However, I believe that the framework of retrieval discussed in this chapter is both elegant and potentially extremely powerful*. Although the work on it has been rather recent and thus some may feel that it should stand the test of time, I think it probably represents the most important break-through in IR in the last few years. Therefore I unashamedly make this chapter theoretical, since the theory must be thoroughly understood if any further progress is to be made. There are a number of equivalent ways of presenting the basic theory; I have chosen to present it in such a way that connections with other fields such as pattern recognition are easily made. I shall have more to say about other formulations in the Bibliographic Remarks at the end of the chapter.  The fundamental mathematical tool for this chapter is Bayes' Theorem: most of the equations derive directly from it. Although the underlying mathematics may at first look a little complicated the interpretation is rather simple. So, let me try and immediately given some interpretation of what is to follow.  * This was recognised by Maron in his 'The Logic Behind a Probabilistic Interpretation' as early as 1964[4].  Remember that the basic instrument we have for trying to separate the relevant from the non-relevant documents is a matching function, whether it be that we are in a clustered environment or an unstructured one. The reasons for picking any particular matching function have never been made explicit, in fact mostly they are based on intuitive argument in conjunction with Ockham's Razor. Now in this chapter I shall attempt to use simple probability theory to tell us what a matching function should look like and how it should be used. The arguments are mainly theoretical but in my view fairly conclusive. The only remaining doubt is about the acceptability of the assumptions, which I shall try and bring out as I go along. The data used to fix such a matching function are derived from the knowledge of the distribution of the index terms throughout the collection of some subset of it. If it is defined on some subset of documents then this subset can be defined by a variety of techniques: sampling, clustering, or trial retrieval. The data thus gathered are used to set the values of certain parameters associated with the matching function. Clearly, should the data contain relevance information then the process of defining the matching function can be iterated by some feedback mechanism similar to the one due to Rocchio described in the previous chapter. In this way the parameters of the matching function can be 'learnt'. It is on matching functions derived from relevance information that we shall concentrate.  It will be assumed in the sequel that the documents are described by binary state attributes, that is, absence or presence of index terms. This is not a restriction on the theory, in principle the extension to arbitrary attributes can be worked out, although it is not clear that this would be worth doing[5].
