 3.3.2    The CACM and ISI Collections The TREC collection is a large collection which requires time consuming preparation before experiments can be carried out effectively at a local site. Further, 92        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION the testing itself is also time consuming and requires much more effort than that required to execute the testing in a small collection. For groups who are not interested in making this investment, an alternative approach is to use a smaller test collection which can be installed and experimented with in a much shorter time. Further, a small collection might include features which are not present in the larger TREC collection. For instance, it is well known that the example information requests at TREC present very little overlap among themselves and thus are not very useful for investigating the impact of techniques which take advantage of information derived from dependencies between the current and past user queries (an issue which received attention at the TREC-7 conference). Further, the TREC collection does not provide good support for experimenting with algorithms which combine distinct evidential sources (such as co-citations, bibliographic coupling, etc.) to generate a ranking. In these situations, alternative (and smaller) test collections might be more appropriate. For the experimental studies in [271], five different (small) test collections were developed: ADI (documents on information science), CACM, INSPEC (abstracts on electronics, computer, and physics), ISI, and Medlars (medical articles). In this section we cover two of them in detail: the CACM and the ISI test collections. Our discussion is based on the work by Fox [272]. The CACM Collection The documents in the CACM test collection consist of all the 3204 articles published in the Communications of the ACM from the first issue in 1958 to the last number of 1979. Those documents cover a considerable range of computer science literature due to the fact that the CACM served for many years as the premier periodical in the field. Besides the text of the documents, the collection also includes information on structured subfields (called concepts by Fox) as follows: ï  author names ï  date information ï  word stems from the title and abstract sections ï  categories derived from a hierarchical classification scheme ï  direct references between articles ï  bibliographic coupling connections ï  number of co-citations for each pair of articles. The subfields 'author names5 and "date information' provide information on authors and date of publication. The subfield 'word stems1 provides, for each document, a list of indexing terms (from the title and abstract sections) which have been stemmed (i.e., reduced to their grammatical roots as explained in Chapter 7). The subfield "categories' assigns a list of classification categories (from the Computing Reviews category scheme) to each document.  Since the REFERENCE COLLECTIONS        93 categories are fairly broad, the number of categories for any given document is usually smaller than five. The subfield 'direct references' provides a list of pairs of documents [da,d] in which each pair identifies a document da which includes a direct reference to a document d^. The subfield 'bibliographic coupling' provides a list of triples [di,d2,ttCited] m which the documents d\ and c?2 both include a direct reference to a same third document dj and the factor ncite(i counts the number of documents dj cited by both d\ and cfe- The subfield 'co-citations' provides a list of triples [di,d2 ,nCiting] in which the documents d\ and cfe are both cited by a same third document dj and the factor nCiting counts the number of documents dj citing both d\ and d^. Thus, the CACM collection provides a unique environment for testing retrieval algorithms which are based on information derived from cross-citing patterns ó a topic which has attracted much attention in the past. The CACM collection also includes a set of 52 test information requests. For instance, the information request numbered 1 reads as follows. What articles exist which deal with TSS (Time Sharing System), an operating system for IBM computers? For each information request, the collection also includes two Boolean query formulations and a set of relevant documents. Since the information requests are fairly specific, the average number of relevant documents for each information request is small and around 15. As a result, precision and recall figures tend to be low. The ISI Collection The 1460 documents in the ISI (often referred to as CISI) test collection were selected from a previous collection assembled by Small [731] at the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). The documents selected (which are about information sciences) were those most cited in a cross-citation study done by Small. The main purpose of the ISI collection is to support investigation of similarities based on terms and on cross-citation patterns. The documents in the ISI collection include three types of subfieids as follows. ï  author names ï  word stems from the title and abstract sections ï  number of co-citations for each pair of articles. The meaning of each of these subfieids is as in the CACM collection. The ISI collection includes a total of 35 test information requests (in natural language) for which there are Boolean query formulations. It also includes 41 additional test information requests for which there is no Boolean query formulation (only the version in natural language).  The information requests are 94        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION fairly general which resulted in a larger number of relevant documents to each request (around 50). However, many of these relevant documents have no terms in common with the information requests which implies that precision and recall figures tend to be low. Statistics for the CACM and ISI Collections Tables 3.2 and 3.3 provide comparative summary statistics for the CACM and the ISI test collections. Collection    Num. Docs    Num. Terms    Terms/Docs.

We notice that, compared to the size of the collection, the ISI collection has a much higher percentage of relevant documents per query (3.4%) than the CACM collection (0.5%). However, as already discussed, many of the relevant documents in the ISI collection have no terms in common with the respective information requests which usually yields low precision. Related Test Collections At the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Fox has assembled together nine small test collections in a CD-ROM. These test collections have sizes comparable to those of the CACM and ISI collections, but include their own particularities. Since they have been used throughout the years for evaluation of information retrieval systems, they provide a good setting for the preliminary testing of information retrieval algorithms. A list of these nine test collections is provided in Table 3.4.
