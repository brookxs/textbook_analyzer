 14.5    Trends arid Research Issues With a few exceptions, librarians are consumers of information systems, whether information retrieval systems provided by database vendors, or turnkey OPACs. Even in the digital library environment, their emphasis is on providing integrated access to a diversity of modules for information retrieval. Their interest therefore is in obtaining and using systems which offer ease of integration in their automated environment, and ease of use for themselves and their patrons. The former goal is approached through standards such as SGML and Z39.50, and the development and application of these standards is an important trend in the design of IR systems for libraries. For the latter goal, ease of use. the trend toward user-centered research and design is significant because it offers the potential to answer Bergman's query, 'Why are online catalogs still hard to use?' [105]. Much of the recent research interest is in cognitive and behavioral BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        413 issues (as reviewed in [482]). Developing an understanding of information need, either in general or for a specific client group, has been an important component of this work. Researchers are also interested in the searching behavior of users. Obviously, there is no single 'user' group, and studies have focused on groups such as trained intermediaries, children, and subject specialists, in both the search service and OPAC environment. One such project conducted over two years is the Getty Online Search Project which studied the end user search behavior of humanities scholars [67]. The interest in end user behavior also extends to an examination of relevance, since an understanding of the criteria by which users determine if retrieved information meets their information need is critical to achieving user-centered design.
