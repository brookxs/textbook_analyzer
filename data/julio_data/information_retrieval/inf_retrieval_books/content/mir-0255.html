 13.4.2    Distributed Architecture There are several variants of the crawler-indexer architecture. Among them, the most important is Harvest [108]. Harvest uses a distributed architecture to gather and distribute data, which is more efficient than the crawler architecture. The main drawback is that Harvest requires the coordination of several Web servers. The Harvest distributed approach addresses several of the problems of the crawler-indexer architecture, such as: (1) Web servers receive requests from different crawlers, increasing their load; (2) Web traffic increases because crawlers retrieve entire objects, but most of their content is discarded; and (3) information is gathered independently by each crawler, without coordination between all the search engines. To solve these problems, Harvest introduces two main elements: gatherers and brokers. A gatherer collects and extracts indexing information from one or more Web servers. Gathering times are defined by the system and are periodic (i.e. there are harvesting times as the name of the system suggests). A broker provides the indexing mechanism and the query interface to the data gathered. Brokers retrieve information from one or more gatherers or other brokers, updating incrementally their indices. Depending on the configuration of gatherers and brokers, different improvements on server load and network traffic can be 376 SEARCHING THE WEB Figure 13.4    Harvest architecture. achieved. For example, a gatherer can run on a Web server, generating no external traffic for that server. Also, a gatherer can send information to several brokers, avoiding work repetition. Brokers can also filter information and send it to other brokers. This design allows the sharing of work and information in a very flexible and generic manner. An example of the Harvest architecture is shown in Figure 13.4 [108]. One of the goals of Harvest is to build topic-specific brokers, focusing the index contents and avoiding many of the vocabulary and scaling problems of generic indices. Harvest includes a distinguished broker that allows other brokers to register information about gatherers and brokers. This is useful to search for an appropriate broker or gatherer when building a new system. The Harvest architecture also provides replicators and object caches. A replicator can be used to replicate servers, enhancing user-base scalability. For example, the registration broker can be replicated in different geographic regions to allow faster access. Replication can also be used to divide the gathering process between many Web servers. Finally, the object cache reduces network and server load, as well as response latency when accessing Web pages. More details on the system can be found in [108]. Currently, there are hundreds of Harvest applications on the Web (for example, the CIA, NASA, the US National Academy of Sciences, and the US Government Printing Office), as this software is on the public domain.!
