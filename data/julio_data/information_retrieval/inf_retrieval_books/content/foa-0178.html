 8.3.2 Scientists  Scientifically constructed knowledge can take many forms, especially in the modern age of genomic data, hypertexts, and multimedia. Knowledge networks is a term used (e.g., by the National Science Foundation) to refer to an even wider range of interconnections, among both the scientists who have created them and the representations themselves. In the new science occurring on the WWW, the speed with which a manuscript can go from author to reader has been accelerated dramatically.  Perhaps because the physical installations required to do modern physics (high-energy accelerators, telescopes, etc.) required them to come to the same geographical location (CERN, Livermore, Los Alamos), physicists have long been aware of how useful informal "preprint" communication channels can be [Latour, 1987]. This may be one reason why the server begun by P. Ginsparg at Los Alamos National Labs has been a leader in exploring how scientific publication can occur. This system, originally developed for only physicists, has been so wildly successful that it now houses many documents from many disciplines. The National Institute of Health has recently proposed extending this example with PubMed Central,10 which would disseminate research reports, both with and without peer review.  As might be expected, computer scientists have a particularly wide range of resources for searching their own literature, including:  ï  The Computing Research Repository11 (CoRR);  ï  CORAy12 a search engine developed especially for computer science research;  ï  NCSTRL13 (pronounced "ancestral"), a system for sharing archives of technical reports in computer science.  10 http://www.nih.gov/aJ3Out/director/pubm^cªntral-htin  11 xxxJanl.gov/arcMve/cs/intro.html  12 www.oorajiistresearcli.cx5m/ " www.ncstrl.org/ 310       FINDING OUT ABOUT  One ugly truth of science is that the primary task of scientists is to disagree with one another. The scientific process works because it effectively weeds out flawed arguments. One scientist can gain fame by claiming something new is true; a second scientist can gain fame by showing that it is not. If the question is sufficiently important, a third, scholarly scientist can do useful work by enumerating the many people who said all the things that were neither new nor true, as well as the very few publications that are both.  The printed record of science must contain all aspects of this ongoing debate, but the channel is not wide enough to contain all debates among all scientists, and so only some aspects of the debate can be published. Reviewers play a critical role in deciding what is worthy of publication. Searching for journal articles is only a part of what scientists must do. They are planning experiments and executing them, they may be teaching, they may be relating their basic findings to the development of a product, etc.  The browsing behaviors of scientists contribute to a philosophy of how science is actually prosecuted, but only if it deals with the larger realm of scientists' activities. A great deal has been said about the small fraction of a typical scientist's day that is in fact reflected in their publication record [Latour, 1987]. But the WWW and email suggest a new characterization of scientists' activities that includes traditional publication channels and informal artifacts similar to the letters and correspondence that have traditionally been the mainstay of historians of science [Rudwick, 1985].  Logical positivists aside, most current philosophy of science acknowledges the tremendous burden carried by the language used as scientists muddle toward a common understanding. This point has been made especially clear in biology by Keller and Lloyd's Keywords in Evolutionary Biology [Keller and Lloyd, 1992]. For these philosophers, the word "keyword" is not being used as it has in this text, as an element of an automatically assigned indexing vocabulary. Rather, they are interested in those key words that scientists use to talk to one another. As parts of scientific theories expressed in natural language, keywords  ... serve as conduits for unacknowledged, unbidden, and often unwelcome traffic between worlds. Words also have memories; they cae insinuate theoretical or cultural past into the present. Finally, they have force. Upon examination, their multiple shadows CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS       311  and memories can be seen to perform real conceptual work, in science as in ordinary language. [Keller and Lloyd, 1992, p. 2]  Indeed, it is precisely because of the large overlap between forms of scientific thought and forms of societal thought that "keywords" - terms whose meanings chronically and insistently traverse the boundaries between ordinary and technical discourse can serve not simply as indicators of either social meanings and social change or scientific meaning and scientific change, but as indicators of the ongoing traffic between social and scientific meaning and, accordingly, between social and scientific change. [Keller and Lloyd, 1992, pp. 4-5, emphasis in original]  As suggested by Section 6.8, the emergence of vast data sets like those surrounding the Human Genome Project point to qualitatively different relationships between the keywords used as part of natural language by scientists and the data and theories to which they are meant to refer.
