 1.6.2    The Book's Web Page As IR is a very dynamic area nowadays, a book by itself is not enough. For that reason (and many others), the book has a Web home page located and mirrored in the following places (mirrors in USA and Europe are also planned): BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        17 ï  Brazil: http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/irbook ï  Chile: http://sunsite.dcc.ucliile.cl/irbook Comments, suggestions, contributions, or mistakes found are welcome through email to the contact authors given on the Web page. The Web page contains the Table of Contents, Preface, Acknowledgements, Introduction, Glossary, and other appendices to the book. It also includes exercises and teaching materials that will be increasing in volume and changing with time. In addition, a reference collection (containing 1239 documents on Cystic Fibrosis and 100 information requests with extensive relevance evaluation [721]) is available for experimental purposes. Furthermore, the page includes useful pointers to IR syllabuses in different universities, IR research groups, IR publications, and other resources related to IR and this book. Finally, any new important results or additions to the book as well as an errata will be made publicly available there.
