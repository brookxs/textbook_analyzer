 7.2.2    Elimination of Stopwords As discussed in Chapter 2, words which are too frequent among the documents in the collection are not good discriminators. In fact, a word which occurs in 80% of the documents in the collection is useless for purposes of retrieval. Such words are frequently referred to as stopwords and are normally filtered out as potential index terms. Articles, prepositions, and conjunctions are natural candidates for a list of stopwords. Elimination of stopwords has an additional important benefit. It reduces the size of the indexing structure considerably. In fact, it is typical to obtain a compression in the size of the indexing structure (for instance, in the size of an inverted list, see Chapter 8) of 40% or more solely with the elimination of stopwords. Since stopword elimination also provides for compression of the indexing structure, the list of stopwords might be extended to include words other than articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. For instance, some verbs, adverbs, and adjectives could be treated as stopwords. In [275]. a list of 425 stopwords is illustrated. Programs in C for lexical analysis are also provided. 168        TEXT OPERATIONS Despite these benefits, elimination of stopwords might reduce recall. For instance, consider a user who is looking for documents containing the phrase Ho be or not to be.: Elimination of stopwords might leave only the term be making it almost impossible to properly recognize the documents which contain the phrase specified. This is one additional reason for the adoption of a full text index (i.e., insert all words in the collection into the inverted file) by some Web search engines.
