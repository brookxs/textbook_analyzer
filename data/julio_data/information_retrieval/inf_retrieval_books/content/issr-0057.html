 4.4 N-Gram Data Structures  N-Grams can be viewed as a special technique for conflation (stemming) and as a unique data structure in information systems. N-Grams are a fixed length consecutive series of "n" characters. Unlike stemming that generally tries to determine the stem of a word that represents the semantic meaning of the word, ngrams do not care about semantics. Instead they are algorithmically based upon a fixed number of characters. The searchable data structure is transformed into overlapping n-grams, which are then used to create the searchable database. Examples of bigrams, trigrams and pentagrams are given in Figure 4.7 for the word phrase "sea colony." For n-grams, with n greater than two, some systems allow interword symbols to be part of the n-gram set usually excluding the single character with interword symbol option. The symbol # is used to represent the interword symbol which is anyone of a set of symbols (e.g., blank, period, semicolon, colon, etc.). Each of the n-grams created becomes a separate processing tokens and are searchable. It is possible that the same n-gram can be created multiple times from a single word.  The INQUIRE DBMS provides this feature. 86                                                                                                Chapter 4  se ea co ol lo on ny                                            Digrams  (no interword symbols)  sea col olo Ion ony                                              Trigrams  (no interword symbols)  #se sea ea# #co col olo Ion ony ny#                   Trigrams  (with interword symbol #)  #sea# #colo colon olony Iony#                              Pentagrams  (with interword symbol #)  Figure 4.7   Bigrams, Trigrams and Pentagrams for "sea colony"
