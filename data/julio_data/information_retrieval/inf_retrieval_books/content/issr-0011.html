 1.5 Digital Libraries and Data Warehouses  Two other systems frequently described in the context of information retrieval are Digital Libraries and Data Warehouses (or DataMarts).   There is 22                                                                                                Chapter 1  significant overlap between these two systems and an Information Storage and Retrieval System. All three systems are repositories of information and their primary goal is to satisfy user information needs. Information retrieval easily dates back to Vannevar Bush's 1945 article on thinking (Bush-45) that set the stage for many concepts in this area. Libraries have been in existence since the beginning of writing and have served as a repository of the intellectual wealth of society. As such, libraries have always been concerned with storing and retrieving information in the media it is created on. As the quantities of information grew exponentially, libraries were forced to make maximum use of electronic tools to facilitate the storage and retrieval process. With the worldwide interneting of libraries and information sources (e.g., publishers, news agencies, wire services, radio broadcasts) via the Internet, more focus has been on the concept of an electronic library. Between 1991 and 1993 significant interest was placed on this area because of the interest in U.S. Government and private funding for making more information available in digital form (Fox-93). During this time the terminology evolved from electronic libraries to digital libraries. As the Internet continued its exponential growth and project funding became available, the topic of Digital Libraries has grown. By 1995 enough research and pilot efforts had started to support the 1st ACM International Conference on Digital Libraries (Fox-96).  There remain significant discussions on what is a digital library. Everyone starts with the metaphor of the traditional library. The question is how do the traditional library functions change as they migrate into supporting a digital collection. Since the collection is digital and there is a worldwide communications infrastructure available, the library no longer must own a copy of information as long as it can provide access. The existing quantity of hardcopy material guarantees that we will not have all digital libraries for at least another generation of technology improvements. But there is no question that libraries have started and will continue to expand their focus to digital formats. With direct electronic access available to users the social aspects of congregating in a library and learning from librarians, friends and colleagues will be lost and new electronic collaboration equivalencies will come into existence (Wiederhold-95).  Indexing is one of the critical disciplines in library science and significant effort has gone into the establishment of indexing and cataloging standards. Migration of many of the library products to a digital format introduces both opportunities and challenges. The fiill text of items available for search makes the index process a value added effort as described in Section 1.3. Another important library service is a source of search intermediaries to assist users in finding information. With the proliferation of information available in electronic form, the role of search intermediary will shift from an expert in search to being an expert in source analysis. Searching will identify so much information in the global Internet information space that identification of the "pedigree" of information is required to understand its value. This will become the new refereeing role of a library.  Information Storage and Retrieval technology has addressed a small subset of the issues associated with Digital Libraries. The focus has been on the search and retrieval of textual data with no concern for establishing standards on Introduction to Information Retrieval Systems                                              23  the contents of the system. It has also ignored the issues of unique identification and tracking of information required by the legal aspects of copyright that restrict functions within a library environment. Intellectual property rights in an environment that is not controlled by any country and their set of laws has become a major problem associated with the Internet. The conversion of existing hardcopy text, images (e.g., pictures, maps) and analog (e.g., audio, video) data and the storage and retrieval of the digital version is a major concern to Digital Libraries. Information Retrieval Systems are starting to evolve and incorporate digitized versions of these sources as part of the overall system. But there is also a lot of value placed on the original source (especially printed material) that is an issue to Digital Libraries and to a lesser concern to Information Reteval systems. Other issues such as how to continue to provide access to digital information over many years as digital formats change have to be answered for the long term viability of digital libraries.  The term Data Warehouse comes more from the commercial sector than academic sources. It comes from the need for organizations to control the proliferation of digital information ensuring that it is known and recoverable. Its goal is to provide to the decision makers the critical information to answer future direction questions. Frequently a data warehouse is focused solely on structured databases. A data warehouse consists of the data, an information directory that describes the contents and meaning of the data being stored, an input function that captures data and moves it to the data warehouse, data search and manipulation tools that allow users the means to access and analyze the warehouse data and a delivery mechanism to export data to other warehouses, data marts (small warehouses or subsets of a larger warehouse), and external systems.  Data warehouses are similar to information storage and retrieval systems in that they both have a need for search and retrieval of information. But a data warehouse is more focused on structured data and decision support technologies. In addition to the normal search process, a complete system provides a flexible set of analytical tools to "mine" the data. Data mining (originally called Knowledge Discovery in Databases - KDD) is a search process that automatically analyzes data and extract relationships and dependencies that were not part of the database design. Most of the research focus is on the statistics, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect the hidden relationships of data. In reality the most difficult task is in preprocessing the data from the database for processing by the algorithms. This differs from clustering in information retrieval in that clustering is based upon known characteristics of items, whereas data mining does not depend upon known relationships. For more detail on data mining see the November 1996 Communications of the ACM (Vol. 39, Number 11) that focuses on this topic.
