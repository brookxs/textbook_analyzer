    Information retrieval system evaluation To measure ad hoc information retrieval effectiveness in the standard way, we need a test collection consisting of three things: A document collection A test suite of information needs, expressible as queries A set of relevance judgments, standardly a binary assessment of either relevant or nonrelevant for each query-document pair.  relevant nonrelevant   gold standard  ground truth Relevance is assessed relative to an , not a query. For example, an information need might be: Information on whether drinking red wine is more effective at reducing your risk of heart attacks than white wine. wine and red and white and heart and attack and effective 8.5.1 Many systems contain various weights (often known as parameters) that can be adjusted to tune system performance. It is wrong to report results on a test collection which were obtained by tuning these parameters to maximize performance on that collection. That is because such tuning overstates the expected performance of the system, because the weights will be set to maximize performance on one particular set of queries rather than for a random sample of queries. In such cases, the correct procedure is to have one or more development test collections , and to tune the parameters on the development test collection. The tester then runs the system with those weights on the test collection and reports the results on that collection as an unbiased estimate of performance.
