 3.3.3    The Cystic Fibrosis Collection The cystic fibrosis (CF) collection [721] is composed of 1239 documents indexed with the term * cystic fibrosis' in the National Library of Medicine's MEdigital libraryINE database. Each document contains the following fields: REFERENCE COLLECTIONS        95 Collection	Subject	Num. Docs	Num.

The collection also includes 100 information requests (generated by an expert with two decades of clinical and research experience with cystic fibrosis) and the documents relevant to each query. Further, 4 separate relevance scores are provided for each relevant document. These relevance scores can be 0 (which indicates non-relevance), 1 (which indicates marginal relevance), and 2 (which indicates high relevance). Thus, the overall relevance score for a document (relative to a given query) varies from 0 to 8. Three of the relevance scores were provided by subject experts while the fourth relevance score was provided by a medical bibliographer. Table 3.5 provides some statistics regarding the information requests in the CF collection. We notice that the number of queries with at least one relevant document is close to the total number of queries in the collection. Further, for various relevance thresholds (the minimum value of relevance score used to characterize relevance), the average number of relevant documents per query is between 10 and 30. The CF collection, despite its small size, has two important characteristics. First, its set of relevance scores was generated directly by human experts through a careful evaluation strategy. Second, it includes a good number of information requests (relative to the collection size) and, as a result, the respective query vectors present overlap among themselves.   This allows experimentation 96        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION Relevance	Queries	Min.	Num.	Max.	Num.	Avg.	Num.
