 7.5.1  Nearest-Neighbor Matching  One of the most straightforward ways to classify documents is to make a rote memory of the training set T and retrieve those documents from T that are most similar to a new document to be classified [Cost and Salzberg, 1993; Larkey and Croft, 1996; Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Larkey, 1998a]. This corresponds to using the | d Â¶ d\ similarity metric discussed in Section 5.2. A weighted sum of the k most similar documents' classifications can be used to pick the best match.
