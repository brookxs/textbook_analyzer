 10.8.3    Example Systems The following sections describe the information layout and management approaches taken by several modern information access interfaces. The InfoGrid Layout The InfoGrid system [667] is a typical example of a monolithic layout for an information access interface.   The layout assumes a large display is available INTERFACE SUPPORT FOR THE SEARCH PROCESS         313 Search Parameters		Property Sheet Document Text Control Panel	Thumbnail Images Holding Area		Search Paths Control Panel Table of Contents	TOC Subset Document Text Search Parameters Figure 10.28     Diagrams of monolithic layouts for information access interfaces. and is divided into a left-hand and right-hand side (see Figure 10.28). The left-hand side is further subdivided into an area at the top that contains structured entry forms for specifying the properties of a query, a column of iconic controls lining the left side, and an area for retaining documents of interest along the bottom. The main central area is used for the viewing of retrieval results, either as thumbnail representations of the original documents, or derived organizations of the documents, such as Scatter/Gather-style cluster results. Users can select documents from this area and store them in the holding area below or view them in the right-hand side. Most of the right-hand side of the display is used for viewing selected documents, with the upper portion showing metadata associated with the selected document. The area below the document display is intended to show a graphical history of earlier interactions. Designers must make decisions about which kinds of information to show in the primary view(s). If InfoGrid were used on a smaller display, either the document viewing area or the retrieval results viewing area would probably have to be shown via a pop-up overlapping window; otherwise the user would have to toggle between the two views. If the system were to suggest terms for relevance feedback, one of the existing views would have to be supplanted with this information or a pop-up window would have to be used to display the candidate terms. The system does not provide detailed information for source selection, although this could be achieved in a very simple way with a pop-up menu of choices from the control panel. The SuperBook Layout The layout of the InfoGrid is quite similar to that of SuperBook (see section 10.6). The main difference is that SuperBook retains the table of contents-like display in the main left-hand pane, along with indicators of how many documents containing search hits occur in each level of the outline. Like InfoGrid, the main pane of the right-hand side is used to display selected documents. Query 314        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION formulation is done just below the table of contents view (although in earlier versions this appeared in a separate window). Terms related to the user's query are shown in this window as well Large images appear in pop-up overlapping windows. The SuperBook layout is the result of several cycles of iterative design [481]. Earlier versions used overlapping windows instead of a monolithic layout, allowing users to sweep out a rectangular area on the screen in order to create a new text box. This new text box had its own set of buttons that allowed users to jump to occurrences of highlighted words in other documents or to the table of contents. SuperBook was redesigned after noting results of experimental studies [350, 532] showing that users can be more efficient if given fewer, well chosen interaction paths, rather than allowing wide latitude (A recent study of auditory interfaces found that although users were more efficient with a more flexible interface, they nevertheless preferred the more rigid, predictable interface [801]). The designers also took careful note of log files of user interactions. Before the redesign, users had to choose to view the overall frequency of a hit, move the mouse to the table of contents window, click the button and wait for the results to be updated. Since this pattern was observed to occur quite frequently, in the next version of the interface, the system was redesigned to automatically perform this sequence of actions immediately after a search was run. The SuperBook designers also attempted a redesign to allow the interface to fit into smaller displays. The redesign made use of small, overlapping windows. Some of the interaction sequences that were found useful in this more constrained environment were integrated into later designs for large monolithic displays. The digital library1TE Interface The digital library1TE system [193, 192] makes a number of interesting design choices. It splits functionality into two parts: control of the search process and display of results . The control portion is a graphical direct manipulation display with animation (see Figure 10.29). Queries, sources, documents, and groups of retrieved documents are represented as graphical objects.   The user creates a query by filling out the editable fields within a query constructor object.   The system manufactures a query object, which is represented by a small icon which can be dragged and dropped onto iconic representations of collections or search services. If a service is active, it responds by creating an empty results set object and attaching the query to this. A set of retrieval results is represented as a circular pool, and documents within the result set are represented as icons distributed along the perimeter of the pool. Documents can be dragged out of the results set pool and dropped into other services, such as a document summarizer or a language translator. Meanwhile, the user can make a copy of the query icon and drop it onto another search service. Placing the mouse over the iconic representation of the query causes a 'tool-tips* window to pop up to show the contents of the underlying query. Queries can be stored and reused at a later time, thusgt; facilitating retention of previously successful search strategies. INTERFACE SUPPORT FOR THE SEARCH PROCESS        315 Figure 10.29     The digital libraryITE interface [193]. A flexible interface architecture frees the user from the restriction of a rigid order of commands. On the other hand, as seen in the SuperBook discussion, such an architecture must provide guidelines, to help get the user started, give hints about valid ways to proceed, and prevent the user from making errors. The graphical portion of the digital libraryITE interface makes liberal use of animation to help guide the user. For example, if the user attempts to drop a query in the document summarizer icon รณ an illegal operation รณ rather than failing and giving the user an accusatory error message [185], the system takes control of the object being dropped, refusing to let it be placed on the representation for the target application, and moves the object left, right, and left again, mimicking a cshake-the-head-no' gesture. Animation is also used to help the user understand the state of the system, for example, in showing the progress of the retrieval of search results by moving the result set object away from the service from which it was invoked. digital libraryITE uses a separate Web browser window for the display of detailed information about the retrieved documents, such as their bibliographic citations and their full text. The browser window is also used to show Scatter/Gather-style cluster results and to allow users to select documents for relevance feedback. Earlier designs of the system attempted to incorporate text display into the direct manipulation portion, but this was found to be infeasible because of the space required [192]. Thus, digital libraryITE separates the control portion of the information access process from the scanning and reading portion. This separation allows for reusable query construction and service selection, while at the same time allowing for a legible view of documents and relationships among retrieved documents. The selection in the display view is linked to the graphical control portion, so a document viewed in the display could be used as part of a query in a query constructor. 316        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION digital libraryITE also incorporates the notion of a workspace, or 'workcenter,' as it is known in this system. Different workspaces are created for different kinds of tasks. For example, a workspace for buying computer software can be equipped with source icons representing good sources of reviews of computer software, good Web sites to search for price information and link to the user's online credit service. The SketchTrieve Interface The guiding principle behind the SketchTrieve interface [365] is the depiction of information access as an informal process, in which half-finished ideas and partly explored paths can be retained for later use, saved and brought back to compare to later interactions, and the results can be combined via operations on graphical objects and connectors between them. It has been observed [584, 722] that users use the physical layout of information within a spreadsheet to organize information. This idea motivates the design of SketchTrieve, which allows users to arrange retrieval results in a side-by-side manner to facilitate comparison and recombination (see Figure 10.30). The notion of a canvas or workspace for the retention of the previous context should be adopted more widely in future. Many issues are not easily solved, such as how to show the results of a set of interrelated queries, with minor modifications based on query expansion, relevance feedback, and other forms of modification.  One idea is to show sets of related retrieval results as a stack of 1 John a-.:-- .5 wortt!.: Jotno ar 'iM f _*t.ps pro^t    : .1 h jv.*i:_: ': be lock::!.;:* Figure 10.30     The SketchTYieve interface [365].
