 9 Text Search Algorithms  9.1    Introduction to Text Search Techniques  9.2    Software Text Search Algorithms  9.3    Hardware Text Search Systems  Three classical text retrieval techniques have been defined for organizing items in a textual database, for rapidly identifying the relevant items and for eliminating items that do not satisfy the search. The techniques are full text scanning (streaming), word inversion and multiattribute retrieval (Faloutsos-85, Salton-83). In addition to using the indexes as a mechanism for searching text in information systems, streaming of text was frequently found in the systems as an additional search mechanism. In addition to completing a query, it is frequently used to highlight the search terms in the retrieved item prior to display. In the earlier history of information systems, where the hardware (CPU, memory and disk systems) were limiters in performance, specialized hardware text search systems were created. The were used to offload the search process from the main computer leaving the user interface, access and display. If there is a requirement for a system to be able to accurately search for the complete set of search terms, then streaming will be required as a final step. The need for hardware text search streamers has been declining with the increases in CPU power, disk access and memory. But there is still a market for it in the areas of genetic research and many existing legacy systems in use.
