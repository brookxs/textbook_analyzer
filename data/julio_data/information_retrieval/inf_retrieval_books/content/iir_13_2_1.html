    Relation to multinomial unigram language model 12.2.1 12.2.1 113 104 12.2.1       (120)    113 120   120  We also used MLE estimates in Section 12.2.2 (page ) and encountered the problem of zero estimates owing to sparse data (page 12.2.2 ); but instead of add-one smoothing, we used a mixture of two distributions to address the problem there. Add-one smoothing is closely related to add- smoothing in Section 11.3.4 (page ). Exercises. Why is in Table 13.2 expected to hold for most text collections ?
