 6.2 Thesaurus Generation  Manual generation of clusters usually focuses on generating a thesaurus (i.e., clustering terms versus items) and has been used for hundreds of years. As items became available in electronic form, automated term statistical clustering techniques became available. Automatically generated thesauri contain classes that reflect the use of words in the corpora. The classes do not naturally have a name, but are just a groups of statistically similar terms. The optimum technique for generating the classes requires intensive computation. Other techniques starting with existing clusters can reduce the computations required but may not produce optimum classes.  There are three basic methods for generation of a thesaurus; hand crafted, co-occurrence, and header-modifier based. Using manually made thesauri only helps in query expansion if the thesauri is domain specific for the domain being searched. General thesaurus (e.g., WordNet) does not help as much because of the many different meanings for the same word (Voorhees-93, Voorhees-94). Techniques for co-occurrence creation of thesauri are described in detail below. In header-modifier based thesauri term relationships are found based upon linguistic relationships. Words appearing in similar grammatical contexts are assumed to be similar (Hindle-90, Grafenstette-94, Jing-94, Ruge-92). The linguistic parsing of the document discovers the following syntactical structures: Subject-Verb, VerbObject, Adjective-Noun, and Noun-Noun. Each noun has a set of verbs, adjectives and nouns that it co-occurs with, and a mutual information value is calculated for each using typically a log function (see Mandala-99). Then a final similarity between words is calculated using the mutual information to classify the terms. 144                                                                                               Chapter 6  6.2.1  Manual Clustering  The manual clustering process follows the steps described in Section 6.1 in the generation of a thesaurus. The first step is to determine the domain for the clustering. Defining the domain assists in reducing ambiguities caused by homographs and helps focus the creator. Usually existing thesauri, concordances from items that cover the domain and dictionaries are used as starting points for generating the set of potential words to be included in the new thesaurus. A concordance is an alphabetical listing of words from a set of items along with their frequency of occurrence and references of which items in which they are found. The art of manual thesaurus construction resides in the selection of the set of words to be included. Care is taken to not include words that are unrelated to the domain of the thesaurus or those that have very high frequency of occurrence and thus hold no information value (e.g., the term Computer in a thesaurus focused on data processing machines). If a concordance is used, other tools such as KWOC, KWIC or KWAC may help in determining useful words. A Key Word Out of Context (KWOC) is another name for a concordance. Key Word In Context (KWIC) displays a possible term in its phrase context. It is structured to identify easily the location of the term under consideration in the sentence. Key Word And Context (KWAC) displays the keywords followed by their context. Figure 6.1 shows the various displays for "computer design contains memory chips" (NOTE: the phrase is assumed to be from doc4; the other frequency and document ids for KWOC were  KWOC  TERM FREQ                    ITEM Ids  chips 2                       doc2, doc4  computer 3                       docl, doc4, doclO  design 1                       doc4  memory 3                       doc3, doc4, doc8, docl2  KWIC   chips/ computer design contains memory  computer design contains memory chips/  design contains memory chips/ computer  memory chips/ computer design contains  KWAC   chips computer design contains memory chips  computer computer design contains memory chips  design computer design contains memory chips  memory computer design contains memory chips  Figure 6.1 Example of KWOC, KWIC and KWAC Document and Term Clustering                                                                  145  created for this example.) In the Figure 6.1 the character "/" is used in KWIC to indicate the end of the phrase. The KWiC and KWAC are useful in determining the meaning of homographs. The term "chips" could be wood chips or memory chips. In both the KWIC and KWAC displays, the editor of the thesaurus can read the sentence fragment associated with the term and determine its meaning. The KWOC does not present any information that would help in resolving this ambiguity.  Once the terms are selected they are clustered based upon the word relationship guidelines and the interpretation of the strength of the relationship. This is also part of the art of manual creation of the thesaurus, using the judgment of the human analyst. The resultant thesaurus undergoes many quality assurance reviews by additional editors using some of the guidelines already suggested before it is finalized.
