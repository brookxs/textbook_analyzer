 4.2.4 Successor Stemmers  Successor stemmers are based upon the length of prefixes that optimally stem expansions of additional suffixes. The algorithm is based upon an analogy in structural linguistics that investigated word and morpheme boundaries based upon the distribution of phonemes, the smallest unit of speech that distinguish one word from another (Hafer-74). The process determines the successor varieties for a word, uses this information to divide a word into segments and selects one of the segments as the stem.  The successor variety of a segment of a word in a set of words is the number of distinct letters that occupy the segment length plus one character. For example, the successor variety for the first three letters (i.e., word segment) of a five-letter word is the number of words that have the same first three letters but a different fourth letter plus one for the current word. A graphical representation of successor variety is shown in a symbol tree. Figure 4.2 shows the symbol tree for the terms bag, barn, bring, both, box, and bottle. The successor variety for any prefix of a word is the number of children that are associated with the node in the symbol tree representing that prefix. For example, the successor variety for the first letter "b" is three. The successor variety for the prefix uba" is two.  The successor varieties of a word are used to segment a word by applying one of the following four methods:  1.   Cutoff method:  a cutoff value is selected to define stem length.  The value varies for each possible set of words.  2.   Peak and Plateau:   a segment break is made after a character whose successor variety exceeds that of the character immediately preceding it and the character immediately following it.  3- Complete word method: break on boundaries of complete words. Data Structure  79  4. Entropy method: uses the distribution of successor variety letters. Let Dak| be the number of words beginning with the k length sequence of letters a. Let |Dakj| be the number of words in Dak with successor j. The   a   /   \  9  r  n  n  h  t            Figure 4.2 Symbol Tree for terms bag, barn, bring, box, bottle , both  probability that a member of D has the successor j is given by |Dak,|/|Daic|. The  entropy (Average Information as defined by Shannon-5 J) of |DtfJ is: 80                                                                                                Chapter 4  26  Hak   =      Â£   -(|Dakj|/|Dak|)(log2(|Dakj|/|Dak|))  P=\  Using this formula a set of entropy measures can be calculated for a word and its predecessors. A cutoff value is selected and a boundary is identified whenever the cutoff value is reached. Hafer and Weiss experimented with the techniques, discovering that combinations of the techniques performed best, which they used in defining their stemming process. Using the words in Figure 4.2 plus the additional word "boxer," the successor variety stemming is shown in Figure 4.3.

The peak and plateau method can not apply because the successor variety monotonically decreases. Applying the complete word method, the stem is "box." The example given does not have enough values to apply the entropy method. The advantage of the peak and plateau and the complete word methods is that a cutoff value does not have to be selected (Frakes-92).  After a word has been segmented, the segment to be used as the stem must be selected. Hafer and Weiss used the following rule:  if (first segment occurs in lt;= 12 words in database)  first segment is stem else (second segment is stem)  The idea is that if a segment is found in more than 12 words in the text being analyzed, it is probably a prefix. Hafer and Weiss noted that multiple prefixes in the English language do not occur often and thus selecting the first or second  segment in general determines the appropriate stem.
