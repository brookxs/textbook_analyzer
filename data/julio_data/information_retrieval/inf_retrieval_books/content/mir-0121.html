 7.2.3    Stemming Frequently, the user specifies a word in a query but only a variant of this word is present in a relevant document. Plurals, gerund forms, and past tense suffixes are examples of syntactical variations which prevent a perfect match between a query word and a respective document word. This problem can be partially overcome with the substitution of the words by their respective stems. A stem is the portion of a word which is left after the removal of its affixes (i.e., prefixes and suffixes). A typical example of a stem is the word connect which is the stem for the variants connected, connecting, connection, and connections. Stems are thought to be useful for improving retrieval performance because they reduce variants of the same root word to a common concept. Furthermore, stemming has the secondary effect of reducing the size of the indexing structure because the number of distinct index terms is reduced. While the argument supporting stemming seems sensible, there is controversy in the literature about the benefits of stemming for retrieval performance. In fact, different studies lead to rather conflicting conclusions. Frakes [275] compares eight distinct studies on the potential benefits of stemming. While he favors the usage of stemming, the results of the eight experimental studies he investigated do not allow us to reach a satisfactory conclusion. As a result of these doubts, many Web search engines do not adopt any stemming algorithm whatsoever. Frakes distinguishes four types of stemming strategies: affix removal, table lookup, successor variety, and n-grams. Table lookup consists simply of looking for the stem of a word in a table. It is a simple procedure but one which is dependent on data on stems for the whole language. Since such data is not readily available and might require considerable storage space, this type of stemming algorithm might not be practical. Successor variety stemming is based on the determination of morpheme boundaries, uses knowledge from structural linguistics, and is more complex than affix removal stemming algorithms. N-grams stemming is based on the identification of digrams and trigrams and is more a term clustering procedure than a stemming one. Affix removal stemming is intuitive, simple, and can be implemented efficiently. Thus, in the remainder of this section we concentrate our discussion on algorithms for affix removal stemming only. In affix removal the most important part is suffix removal because most variants of a word are generated by the introduction of suffixes (instead of preDOCUMENT PREPROCESSING        169 fixes). While there are three or four well known suffix removal algorithms, the most popular one is that by Porter because of its simplicity and elegance. Despite being simpler, the Porter algorithm yields results comparable to those of the more sophisticated algorithms. The Porter algorithm uses a suffix list for suffix stripping. The idea is to apply a series of rules to the suffixes of the words in the text. For instance, the rule s ógt; 0                                                                                          (7.1) is used to convert plural forms into their respective singular forms by substituting the letter s by nil. Notice that to identify the suffix we must examine the last letters in the word. Furthermore, we look for the longest sequence of letters which matches the left hand side in a set of rules. Thus, application of the two following rules sses    ógt;    ss                                                                                                   (7.2) to the word stresses yields the stem stress instead of the stem stresse. By separating such rules into five distinct phases, the Porter algorithm is able to provide effective stemming while running fast. A detailed description of the Porter algorithm can be found in the appendix.
