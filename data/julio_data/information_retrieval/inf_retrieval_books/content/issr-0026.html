The user wants to see the minimum information needed to determine if the item is relevant. Once the determination is made an item is possibly relevant, the user wants to display the complete item for detailed review. Limited display screen sizes require selectability of what portions of an item a user needs to see to make the relevance determination. For example, display of the Title and Abstract may be sufficient information for a user to predict the potential relevance of an item. Limiting the display of each item to these two zones allows multiple items to be displayed on a single display screen. This makes maximum use of the speed of the user's cognitive process in scanning the single image and understanding the potential relevance of the multiple items on the screen.  Related to zoning for use in minimizing what an end user needs to review from a hit item is the idea of locality and passage based search and retrieval. In this case the basic search unit is not the complete item, but an algorithmic defined subdivision of the item. This has been known as passage retrieval where the item is divided into uniform-sized passages that are indexed (Kaskiel-97, Knaus-95, Zobel-95) and locality based retrieval where the passage boundaries can be dynamic (Kretser-99.) In these cases the system can display the particular passage or locality that caused the item to be found rather than the complete item. The system would also provide an expand capability to retrieve the complete item as an option.
