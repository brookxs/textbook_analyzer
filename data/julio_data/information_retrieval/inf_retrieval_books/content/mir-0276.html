 14.2    Online IR Systems and Document Databases A synergistic relationship exists between the producers and vendors of document databases^ (see Figure 14.1). In general, database producers create a product which they license to the database vendors. These vendors or search services provide search software and access to their customers, who benefit from the ability to search multiple databases from a single source. It is common to speak of the online database industry, since production of databases has usually been undertaken by corporations, organizations, or government on a for-profit or cost-recovery basis. These database producers have seen databases as products for sale or lease, often to libraries, and usually by a third party or database vendor. The role of database vendor is to license databases from their producers and add value by making them available to users. Database vendors provide some degree of standardization to the record formats, create indexes (usually in the form of inverted files), and provide a common interface for searching multiple databases. Examples of well known database vendors are DIALOG, LEXIS-NEXIS, OCLC, and H.W. Wilson; profiles are given in Figure 14.2. Some database producers choose to serve as their own search service providers, leading to a degree of vertical integration within the database industry; examples are the National Library of Medicine (NLM), which provides free access to its Medline database through the Web, and the H.W. Wilson Company, which markets its own series of databases. A significant aspect of these major commercial services is the very large size of their databases and the need for rapid, reliable service for many simultaneous users. In a description of their computing complex, LEXIS-NEXIS [510] give their database size as 1.3 billion documents, with 1.3 million subscribers, and 120 million annual searches. They return an answer set within six to ten seconds. | 'Database' is commonly used by producers and vendors of document databases when referring to their product. These databases lack the tabular structure of relational databases and contain bibliographic information and/or the full-text of documents. This usage will be followed in this chapter.

Similarly, DIALOG claims to be over 50 times the size of the Web.
