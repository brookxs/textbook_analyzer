 6.5.2    Textual Images A particular class of images that is very important in office systems, multimedia retrieval and digital libraries are images of documents that contain mainly typed or typeset text. These are called textual images and are obtained by scanning the documents, usually for archiving purposes ó a procedure that also makes the images (and their associated text) available to anyone through a computer network. The fact that a large portion of a textual image is text can be used for retrieval purposes and efficient compression. Although we do not cover image compression in this chapter, we have seen that the most popular image formats include some form of compression embedded in them. In the case of textual images, further compression can be achieved by extracting the different text symbols or marks from the image, building a library of symbols for them, and representing each one (within the image) by a position in the library. As many symbols are repeated, the compression ratio is quite good. Although this technique is lossy (because the reconstructed image is not equal to the original), the reconstructed image can be read without problems. Additional information can be stored to reproduce the original image, but for most applications this is not needed. If the image contains non-textual information such as logos or signatures, which might be necessary to reproduce, they may be extracted through a segmentation process, stored, and compressed separately. When needed, the textual and non-textual parts of the image can be combined and displayed together. Regarding the retrieval of textual images, several alternatives are possible as follows: ï  At creation time or when added to the database, a set of ke}rwords that describe the image is associated with it (for example, metadata can be used). Later, conventional text retrieval techniques can be applied to those keywords. This alternative is valid for any multimedia object. ï  Use OCR to extract the text of the image. The resultant ASCII text can be used to extract keywords, as before, or as a full-text description of the MULTIMEDIA        159 image. Depending on the document type, the OCR output could be reasonably good or actually quite bad (consider the first page of a newspaper, with several columns, different font types and sizes). In any case, many typos are introduced and a usual keyword-based query might miss many documents (in this case, an approximate search is better, but also slower). Use the symbols extracted from the images as basic units to combine image retrieval techniques (see Chapter 12) with sequence retrieval techniques (see Chapter 8). In this case, the query is transformed into a symbol sequence that has to match approximately another symbol sequence in the compressed image. This idea seems promising but has not been pursued yet.
