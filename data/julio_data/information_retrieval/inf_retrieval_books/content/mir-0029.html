 2.5.2    Boolean Model The Boolean model is a simple retrieval model based on set theory and Boolean algebra. Since the concept of a set is quite intuitive, the Boolean model provides a framework which is easy to grasp by a common user of an IR system. Furthermore, the queries are specified as Boolean expressions which have precise semantics. Given its inherent simplicity and neat formalism, the Boolean model received great attention in past years and was adopted by many of the early commercial bibliographic systems. 26        MODELING k Figure 2.3    The three conjunctive components for the query [q = ka A (fc V -gt;kc)]. Unfortunately, the Boolean model suffers from major drawbacks. First, its retrieval strategy is based on a binary decision criterion (i.e., a document is predicted to be either relevant or non-relevant) without any notion of a grading scale, which prevents good retrieval performance. Thus, the Boolean model is in reality much more a data (instead of information) retrieval model. Second, while Boolean expressions have precise semantics, frequently it is not simple to translate an information need into a Boolean expression. In fact, most users find it difficult and awkward to express their query requests in terms of Boolean expressions. The Boolean expressions actually formulated by users often are quite simple (see Chapter 10 for a more thorough discussion on this issue). Despite these drawbacks, the Boolean model is still the dominant model with commercial document database systems and provides a good starting point for those new to the field. The Boolean model considers that index terms are present or absent in a document. As a result, the index term weights are assumed to be all binary, i.e., Wij G {0,1}. A query q is composed of index terms linked by three connectives: not, and, or.Thus, a query is essentially a conventional Boolean expression which can be represented as a disjunction of conjunctive vectors (i.e., in disjunctive normal form รณ DNF). For instance, the query [q = ka A (fc V ^kc)] can be written in disjunctive normal form as [qdnf รณ (1? 1gt; 1) V (1? 1? 0) V (1,0,0)], where each of the components is a binary weighted vector associated with the tuple (ka, fc, kc). These binary weighted vectors are called the conjunctive components of qdnf-Figure 2.3 illustrates the three conjunctive components for the query q. Definition     For the Boolean model, the index term weight variables are all binary i.e., u^j ยฃ {0,1}.  A query q is a conventional Boolean expression.  Let qdnf be the disjunctive normal form for the query q. Further, let qcc be any of the conjunctive components of qdnf- The similarity of a document dj to the query q is defined as simid   a) = { J         \ 0    otherwise CLASSIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL         27 If sim(dj1q) = 1 then the Boolean model predicts that the document dj is relevant to the query q (it might not be). Otherwise, the prediction is that the document is not relevant. The Boolean model predicts that each document is either relevant or non-relevant There is no notion of a partial match to the query conditions. For instance, let dj be a document for which dj = (0,1,0). Document dj includes the index term fc but is considered non-relevant to the query [q = feo A(fc V-ifec)]. The main advantages of the Boolean model are the clean formalism behind the model and its simplicity. The main disadvantages are that exact matching may lead to retrieval of too few or too many documents (see Chapter 10). Today, it is well known that index term weighting can lead to a substantial improvement in retrieval performance. Index term weighting brings us to the vector model.
