 Introduction  This chapter is mainly concerned with the way in which file structures are used in document retrieval. Most surveys of file structures address themselves to applications in data management which is reflected in the terminology used to describe the basic concepts. I shall (on the whole) follow Hsiao and Harary[1] whose terminology is perhaps slightly non-standard but emphasises the logical nature of file structures. A further advantage is that it enables me to bridge the gap between data management and document retrieval easily. A few other good references on file structures are Roberts[2], Bertziss[3], Dodd[4], and Climenson[5].
