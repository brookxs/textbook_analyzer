This function is primarily used to compensate for errors in spelling of words. Fuzzy searching increases recall at the expense of decreasing precision (i.e., it can erroneously identify terms as the search term). In the process of expanding a query term fuzzy searching includes other terms that have similar spellings, giving more weight (in systems that rank output) to words in the database that have similar word lengths and position of the characters as the entered term. A Fuzzy Search on the term "computer" would automatically include the following words from the information database: "computer," "compiler," "conputer," "computter," "compute." An additional enhancement may lookup the proposed alternative spelling and if it is a valid word with a different meaning, include it in the search with a low ranking or not include it at all (e.g., "commuter"). Systems allow the specification of the maximum number of new terms that the expansion includes in the query. In this case the alternate spellings that are "closest" to the query term is included. "Closest" is a heuristic function that is system specific.  Fuzzy searching has its maximum utilization in systems that accept items that have been Optical Character Read (OCRed). In the OCR process a hardcopy item is scanned into a binary image (usually at a resolution of 300 dots per inch or more). The OCR process is a pattern recognition process that segments the scanned in image into meaningful subregions, often considering a segment the area defining a single character. The OCR process will then determine the character and translate it to an internal computer encoding (e.g., ASCII or some other standard for other than Latin based languages). Based upon the original quality of the hardcopy this process introduces errors in recognizing characters. With decent quality input, systems achieves in the 90 - 99 per cent range of accuracy. Since these are character errors throughout the text, fuzzy searching allows location of items of interest compensating for the erroneous characters.
