 13.7.1    User Problems We have already glanced at some of the problems faced by the user when interacting with the query interfaces currently provided by search engines. First, the user does not exactly understand the meaning of searching using a set of words, as discussed in Chapter 10. Second, the user may get unexpected answers because he is not aware of the logical view of the text adopted by the system. An example is the use of uppercase letters when the search engine is not case sensitive. Hence, a word like 'Bank7 loses part of its semantics if we search for 'bank.' Simple experiments also show that due to typos or variations of a word, even if correctly capitalized, 10-20% of the matches can be lost. Similarly, foreign names or words that are difficult to spell may appear incorrectly which may result in a loss of up to 50% of the relevant answers, as mentioned in section 13.2. Another problem is that most users have trouble with Boolean logic. In natural language, sometimes we use 'and7 and %or' with different meaning depending on the context. For example, when choosing between two things, we use an exclusive "or,' which does not match the Boolean interpretation. Because of this, several studies show that around 80% of the queries do not use any Boolean or other operation. For these reasons many people have trouble using command query languages, and query forms should clearly specify which words must or must not be contained in a document that belongs to the answer. There are a few surveys and analyses of query logs with respect to the usage of search engines [647, 403, 728], The latter reference is based on 285 million user sessions containing 575 million queries.  Table 13.6 gives the main results 390        SEARCHING THE WEB of that study, carried out in September 1998. Some of the strange results might be due to queries done by mechanized search agents. The number of queries submitted per day to AltaVista is over 13 million. Users select a search engine mainly based on ease of use, speed, coverage, relevance of the answer, and habit. The main purposes are research, leisure, business, and education. The main problems found are that novice users do not know how to start and lack the general knowledge that would help in finding better answers. Other problems are that search engines are slow, that the answer is too large, not very relevant, and not always up to date. Also, most people do not care about advertising, which is one of the main sources of funding for search engines. When searching, 25% of the users use a single keyword, and on average their queries have only two or three terms. In addition, about 15% of the users restrict the search to a predefined topic and most of them (nearly 80%) do not modify the query. In addition, most users (about 85%) only look at the first screen with results and 64% of the queries are unique. Also, many words appear in the same sentence, suggesting that proximity search should be used. There are also studies about users1 demographics and software and hardware used.
