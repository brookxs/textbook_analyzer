 10.2.2    The Role of Visualization The tools of computer interface design are familiar to most computer users today: windows, menus, icons, dialog boxes, and so on. These make use of bitmapped display and computer graphics to provide a oiore accessible Interface 260        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION than command-line-based displays. A less familiar but growing area is that of information visualization, which attempts to provide visual depictions of very large information spaces. Humans are highly attuned to images and visual information [769, 456, 483]. Pictures and graphics can be captivating and appealing, especially if well designed. A visual representation can communicate some kinds of information much more rapidly and effectively than any other method. Consider the difference between a written description of a person's face and a photograph of it, or the difference between a table of numbers containing a correlation and a scatter plot showing the same information. The growing prevalence of fast graphics processors and high resolution color monitors is increasing interest in information visualization. Scientific visualization, a rapidly advancing branch of this field, maps physical phenomena onto two- or three-dimensional representations [433]. An example of scientific visualization is a colorful image of the pattern of peaks and valleys on the ocean floor; this provides a view of physical phenomena for which a photograph cannot (currently) be taken. Instead, the image is constructed from data that represent the underlying phenomena. Visualization of inherently abstract information is more difficult, and visualization of textually represented information is especially challenging. Language is our main means of communicating abstract ideas for which there is no obvious physical manifestation. What does a picture look like that describes negotiations over a trade agreement in which one party demands concessions on environmental policies while the other requires help in strengthening its currency? Despite the difficulties, researchers are attempting to represent aspects of the information access process using information visualization techniques. Some of these will be described later in this chapter. Aside from using icons and color highlighting, the main information visualization techniques include brushing and Unking [233, 773], panning and zooming [71], focus-plus-context [502], magic leimts [95], and the use of animation to retain context and help make occluded information visible [676, 143]. These techniques support dynamic, interactive use. Interactivity seems to be an especially important property for visualizing abstract information, although it has not played as large a role within scientific visualization. Brushing and linking refers to the connecting of two or more views of the same data, such that a change to the representation in one view affects the representation in the other views as well. For example, say a display consists of two parts: a histogram and a list of titles. The histogram shows, for a set of documents, how many documents were published each year. The title list shows the titles for the corresponding documents. Brushing and linking would allow the user to assign a color, say red, to one bar of the histogram, thus causing the titles in the list display that were published during the corresponding year to also be highlighted in red. Panning and zooming refers to the actions of a movie camera that can scan sideways across a scene (panning) or move in for a closeup or back away to get a wider view (zooming).   For example, text clustering can be used to show a HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION        261 top-level view of the main themes in a document collection (see Figures 10.7 and 10.8). Zooming can be used to move 'closer,' showing individual documents as icons, and then zoom in closer still to see the text associated with an individual document. When zooming is used, the more detail that is visible about a particular item, the less can be seen about the surrounding items. Focus-plus-context is used to partly alleviate this effect. The idea is to make one portion of the view รณ the focus of attention รณ larger, while simultaneously shrinking the surrounding objects. The farther an object is from the focus of attention, the smaller it is made to appear, like the effect seen in a fisheye camera lens (also in some door peepholes). Magic lenses are directly manipulable transparent windows that, when overlapped on some other data type, cause a transformation to be applied to the underlying data, thus changing its appearance (see Figure 10.13). The most straightforward application of magic lenses is for drawing tasks, and it is especially useful if used as a two-handed interface. For example, the left hand can be used to position a color lens over a drawing of an object. The right hand is used to mouse-click on the lens, thus causing the appearance of the underlying object to be transformed to the color specified by the lens. Additionally, there are a large number of graphical methods for depicting trees and hierarchies, some of which make use of animation to show nodes that would otherwise be occluded (hidden from view by other nodes) [286, 364, 407, 478, 676]. It is often useful to combine these techniques into an interface layout consisting of an overview plus details [321, 644]. An overview, such as a table-of-contents of a large manual, is shown in one window. A mouse-click on the title of the chapter causes the text of the chapter itself to appear in another window, in a linking action (see Figure 10.19). Panning and zooming or focus-plus-context can be used to change the view of the contents within the overview window.
