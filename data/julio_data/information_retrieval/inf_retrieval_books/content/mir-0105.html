 6.4    Markup Languages Markup is defined as extra textual syntax that can be used to describe formatting actions, structure information, text semantics, attributes, etc. For example, the formatting commands of TeX (a popular text formatting software) could be considered markup. However, formal markup languages are much more structured. The marks are called tags, and usually, to avoid ambiguity, there is an initial and ending tag surrounding the marked text. The standard metalanguage for markup is SGML, as already mentioned. An important subset of SGML is XML (extensible Markup Language), the new metalanguage for the Web. The most popular markup language used for the Web, HTML (HyperText Markup Language), is an instance of SGML. All these languages and examples of them are described below.
