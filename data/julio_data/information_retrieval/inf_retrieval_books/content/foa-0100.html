 5.4.1 The Cluster Hypothesis  We have been talking about a measure of association between query and document, but as discussed in Section 5.2.5, we can use X = JJT (cf. Equation 5.15) to capture similarities or differences among the documents themselves. Van Rijsbergen's cluster hypothesis suggests how useful this data might be:  Closely associated documents tend to be relevant to the same request, [van Rijsbergen, p. 45]  The cluster hypothesis suggests that if we first compute a measure of distance X among all the documents, we could cluster those documents that seem to be close to one another or seem to be about the same topic  and retrieve them all in response to a query that matched any of them. If  a query happens to match one document based on an overlap of features,  then we will claim that other documents that are similar to it should also be retrieved. 166      FINDING OUT ABOUT  As van Rijsbergen, p. 38 notes, the fact that most measures of association are monotonic with respect to one another makes it sufficient that clustering methods only respect the same rank ordering of their results; once again the nonmetric quality of critical FOA quantities is striking.
