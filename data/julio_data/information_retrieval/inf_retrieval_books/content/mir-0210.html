 10.7.5    Pseudo-Relevance Feedback At the far end of the system versus user feedback spectrum is what is informally known as pseudo-relevance feedback. In this method, rather than relying on the user to choose the top k relevant documents, the system simply assumes that its top-ranked documents are relevant, and uses these documents to augment the query with a relevance feedback ranking algorithm. This procedure has been found to be highly effective in some settings [760, 465, 12], most likely those in which the original query statement is long and precise. An intriguing extension to this idea is to use the output of clustering of retrieval results as the input to a relevance feedback mechanism, either by having the user or the system select the cluster to be used [359], but this idea has not yet been evaluated.
