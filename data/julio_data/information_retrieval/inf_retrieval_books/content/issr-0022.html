 2.1.8 Natural Language Queries  Rather than having the user enter a specific Boolean query by specifying search terms and the logic between them, Natural Language Queries allow a user to enter a prose statement that describes the information that the user wants to find. The longer the prose, the more accurate the results returned. The most difficult logic case associated with Natural Language Queries is the ability to specify negation in the search statement and have the system recognize it as negation. The system searches and finds those items most like the query statement entered. The techniques for locating items similar to the search statement (described in Chapters 5 and 7) are suited for finding items like other items but do not have inherent techniques to exclude items that are like a certain portion of the search statement. For many users, this type of an interface provides a natural extension to asking someone to perform a search. In this case the discourse is with the computer. An example of a Natural Language Query is:  Find for me all the items that discuss oil reserves and current attempts to find new oil reserves. Include any items that discuss the international financial aspects of the oil production process. Do not include items about the oil industry in the United States.  The way a system uses this input for a search Is described in Chapter 7. The problem with many techniques and systems is to understand the negation concept of excluding items about the oil industry in the United States.  When this capability has been made available, users have a tendency to enter sentence fragments that reflect their search need rather than complete  sentences. This is predictable because the users want to minimize use of the human resource (their time). The likely input for the above example is:  oil reserves and attempts to find new oil reserves, international financial aspects of oil production, not United States oil industry Information Retrieval System Capabilities                                                    37  This usage pattern is important because sentence fragments make morphological analysis of the natural language query difficult and may limit the system's ability to perform term disambiguation (e.g., understand which meaning of a word is meant).  Using the same search statement, a Boolean query attempting to find the same information might appear:  ("locate" AND "new" and "oil reserves") OR ("international" AND "financ*" AND "oil production") NOT ("oil industry" AND "United States")  Associated with natural language queries is a function called relevance feedback. The natural language does not have to be input by the user but just identified by the user. This introduces the concept of finding items that "are like" other items. Thus a user could identify a particular item(s) in the database or text segments within item(s) and use that as the search statement. This is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.  To accommodate the negation function and provide users with a transition to the natural language systems, most commercial systems have a user interface that provides both a natural language and Boolean logic capability. Negation is handled by the Boolean portion of a search. The integration of these two search statement types has not been achieved in Information Retrieval Systems. Natural language interfaces improve the recall of systems with a decrease in precision when negation is required.
