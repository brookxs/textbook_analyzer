 2.9.1    Mode! Based on Non-Overlapping Lists Burkowski [132, 133] proposes to divide the whole text of each document in non-overlapping text regions which are collected in a list Since there are multiple ways to divide a text in non-overlapping regions, multiple lists are generated. For instance, we might have a list of all chapters in the document, a second list of all sections in the document, and a third list of all subsections in the document. These lists are kept as separate and distinct data structures. While the text regions in the same (flat) list have no overlapping, text regions from distinct lists might overlap. Figure 2.11 illustrates four separate lists for the same document. STRUCTURED TEXT RETRIEVAL MODELS        63  Chapter Ã‘ Sections Subsections Subsubsections Figure 2.11    Representation of the structure in the text of a document through four separate (flat) indexing lists. To allow searching for index terms and for text regions, a single inverted file (see Chapter 8 for a definition of inverted files) is built in which each structural component stands as an entry in the index. Associated with each entry, there is a list of text regions as a list of occurrences. Moreover, such a list could be easily merged with the traditional inverted file for the words in the text. Since the text regions are non-overlapping, the types of queries which can be asked are simple: (a) select a region which contains a given word (and does not contain other regions); (b) select a region A which does not contain any other region B (where B belongs to a list distinct from the list for A); (c) select a region not contained within any other region, etc.
