  3.2.1 Looking for Meaning in All the Wrong Places (At the Character Level)  The ubiquity of data obeying Zipf *s law has made it a lightning rod, attracting a number of "explanations." These explanations come from 64      FINDING OUT ABOUT  an extremely impressive set of original thinkers, in widely ranging disciplines:  ï  Noam Chomsky, the most influential linguist of the past 30 years, together with George Miller, the mathematical psychologist famous for such insights as the "7 ± 2 chunks" of memory limitation [Miller, 1957];  ï  Herbert Simon, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and one of the fathers of artificial intelligence [Simon, 1955]; and  ï  Benoit Mandelbrot, the mathematician and physicist most famous for his work on fractals [Mandelbrot, 1953].  Herbert Simon, a keen observer of much cognitive activity, suggests that the ubiquity of Zipf 's law across heterogeneous collections should make us somewhat suspicious of its ability to address the "fine structure"  of linguistics:  No one supposes that there is any connection between horse kicks suffered by soldiers in the German army and blood clots on a microscope slide other than that the same urn scheme provides a satisfactory abstract model of both phenomena. It is in the same direction that we shall look for an explanation of the observed close similarities among the five classes of distributions___[Simon, 1955]  (With "urn " Simon is referring to mathematical models, e.g., related to Poisson processes. See Section 3.3.2 for more on the "five classes" of  Simon's models.)  We therefore begin this section by reviewing a number of early attempts to explain the phenomena underlying Zipf *s law; its mathematical derivation is reserved for Chapter 5.
