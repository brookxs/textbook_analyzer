 6.4.3    XML XML stands for extensible Markup Language and is a simplified subset of SGML. That is, XML is not a markup language, as HTML is, but a metalanguage that is capable of containing markup languages in the same way as SGML. XML allows a human-readable semantic markup, which is also machine-readable. As a result, XML makes it easier to develop and deploy new specific markup, enabling automatic authoring, parsing, and processing of networked data. In some ways, XML alkws one to do many things that today are done by Java scripts or other program interfaces. XML does not have many of the restrictions imposed by HTML but on the other hand imposes a more rigid syntax on the markup, which becomes important at processing time. In XML, ending tags cannot be omitted. Also, tags for elements that do not have any content, like BR and IMG, are specially marked by a slash before the closing angle bracket. XML also distinguishes upper MARKUP LANGUAGES         155 lt;?XML VERSION="i.O"  RMD="NOKrE"   ?gt; lt;e-mail id="94108rbyn  date^sent="02101998"gt; lt;prologgt; lt;sendergt; Pablo Neruda lt;/sendergt; lt;addressgt; Federico Garcia Lorca lt;/addressgt; lt;addressgt; Ernest Hemingway lt;/addressgt; lt;subjectgt; Pictures of my house in Isla Negra lt;Ccgt; Gabriel Garcia Marquez lt;/Ccgt; lt;/prologgt; lt;contentsgt; lt;pargt; As promised in my previous letter, I am sending two digital pictures to show you my house and the splendid view of the Pacific Ocean from my bedroom (photo lt;ref idref="F2"/gt;) . lt;/pargt; lt;image id="Fl" ref="photol.gif" /gt; lt;image id="F2"gt; ref="photo2.jpg" /gt; lt;pargt; Regards from the South, Pablo. lt;/pargt; lt;/contentsgt; Figure 6.5    An XML document without a DTD analogous to the previous SGML example. and lower case, so img and IMG are different tags (this is not true in HTML). In addition, all attribute values must be between quotes. This implies that parsing XML without knowledge of the tags is easier. In particular, using a DTD is optional. If there is no DTD, the tags are obtained while the parsing is done. With respect to SGML, there are a few syntactic differences, and many more restrictions. Listing all these differences is beyond the scope of this book, but Figure 6.5 shows an example of a DTDless XML document based on the previous electronic mail DTD given for SGML (see Figure 6.3). The RMD attribute stands for Required Markup Declaration, which indicates whether a DTD must be used or not (no DTD in this case). Other possible values are INTERNAL which means that the DTD is inside the document or ALL (default value) which allows the use of external sources for part or the whole DTD as in SGML. XML allows any user to define new tags, define more complex structures (for example, unbounded nesting with the same rules of SGML) and has data validation capabilities. As XML is very new, there is still some discussion of how it will change or impact Internet applications. XML is a profile of SGML that eliminates many of the difficulties of implementing things, so for the most part it behaves just like SGML, as shown before. As mentioned, XML removes the requirement for the existence of a DTD, which can be parsed directly from the data. Removing the DTD places even more importance on the application documentation. This can also have a large impact on the functions that the software 156        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES provides. For example, it means that if an XML editor does not use a DTD, how will it help the user to tag the documents consistently? These problems should be resolved in the near future. In the case of semantic ambiguity between tag names, one goal is to have a namespace such that there is a convention for its use. The Extensible Style sheet Language (XSL) is the XML counterpart of Cascading Style Sheets. XSL is designed to transform and style highly-structured, data-rich documents written in XML. For example, with XSL it would be possible to automatically extract a table of contents from a document. The syntax of XSL has been defined using XML. In addition to adding style to a document, XSL can be used to transform XML documents to HTML and CSS. This is analogous to macros in a word processor. Another extension to XML, defined using XML, is the Extensible Linking Language (XLL). XLL defines different types of links, including external and internal links. In particular, any element type can be the origin of a link and outgoing links can be defined on documents that cannot be modified. The behavior of the links is also more generic. The object linked can be embedded in, or replace the document. It is also possible to generate a new context without changing the current application (for example, the object is displayed in a new window). Recent uses of XML include: ï  Mathematical Markup Language (MathML): two sets of tags, one for presentation of formulas and another for the meaning of mathematical expressions. ï  Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL): a declarative language for scheduling multimedia presentations in the Web, where the position and activation time of different objects can be specified. ï  Resource Description Format (already covered in section 6.2): metadata information for XML should be given using RDF. The XML movement is one indication that a parseable, hierarchical object model will play an increasingly major role in the evolution of HTML. The next generation of HTML should be based on a suite of XML tag sets to be used together with mathematics, synchronized multimedia, and vector graphics (possibly using the XML-based languages already mentioned). That is, the emphasis will be on structuring and modeling data rather than on presentation and layout issues.
