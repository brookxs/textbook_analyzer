 6.5.1    Formats Multimedia includes images, audio and video, as well as other binary data. We now briefly survey the main formats used for all these data types. They are used mainly in the Web and in digital libraries (see Chapters 13 and 15). There are several formats for images. The simplest formats are direct representations of a bit-mapped (or pixel-based) display such as XBM, BMP, or PCX. However, those formats consume too much space. For example, a typical computer screen which uses 256 colors for each pixel might require more than 1 Mb (one megabyte) in storage just for describing the content of a single screen frame. In practice, images have a lot of redundancy and can be compressed efficiently. So, most popular image formats incorporate compression such as CompuServe's Graphic Interchange Format (GIF). GIF is good for black and white pictures, as well as pictures that have a small number of colors or gray levels (say 256). To improve compression ratios for higher resolutions, lossy compression was developed. That is, uncompressing a compressed image does not give the original. This is done by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format, which tries to eliminate parts of the image that have less impact on the human eye. This format is parametric, in the sense that the loss can be tuned. Another common image format is the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF). This format is used to exchange documents between different applications and different computer platforms. TIFF has fields for metadata and also supports compression as well as different numbers of colors. Yet another format is Truevision Targa image file (TGA), which is associated with video game boards. There are many more image formats, many of them associated to particular applications ranging from fax (bi-level image formats such as JBIG) to fingerprints (highly accurate and compressed formats such as WSQ) and satellite images (large resolution and full-color images). In 1996 a new bit-mapped image format was proposed for the Internet: Portable Network Graphics (PNG). This format could be important in the future. Audio must be digitalized first in order to be stored properly. The most common formats for small pieces of digital audio are AU, MIDI, and WAVE. MIDI is an standard format to interchange music between electronic instruments and computers. For audio libraries other formats are used such as RealAudio or CD formats. 158        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES There are several formats for animations or moving images (similar to video or TV), but here we mention only the most popular ones. The main one is MPEG (Moving Pictures Expert Group) which is related to JPEG. MPEG works by coding the changes with respect to a base image which is given at fixed intervals. In this way, MPEG profits from the temporal image redundancy that any video has. Higher quality is achieved by using more frames and higher resolution. MPEG specifies different compression levels, but usually not all the applications support all of them. This format also includes the audio signal associated with the video. Other video formats are AVI, FLI, and QuickTime. AVI may include compression (CinePac), as well as QuickTime, which was developed by Apple. As for MPEG, audio is also included.
