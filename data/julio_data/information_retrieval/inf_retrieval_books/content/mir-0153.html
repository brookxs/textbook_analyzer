 8.6.2    Regular Expressions and Extended Patterns General regular expressions are searched by building an automaton which finds all their occurrences in a text. This process first builds a non-deterministic finite automaton of size O(ra), where m is the length of the regular expression. The classical solution is to convert this automaton to deterministic form. A deterministic automaton can search any regular expression in O(n) time. However, its size and construction time can be exponential in m, i.e. O(m2m). See Figure 8.23. Excluding preprocessing, this algorithm runs at 6 Mb/sec in the reference machine. Recently the use of bit-parallelism has been proposed to avoid the construction of the deterministic automaton. The non-deterministic automaton is simulated instead. One bit per automaton state is used to represent whether the state is active or not. Due to the algorithm used to build the non-deterministic automaton, all the transitions move forward except for ^-transitions. The idea is that for each text character two steps are carried out. The first one moves forward, and the second one takes care of all the e-transitions. A function E from bit masks to bit masks is precomputed so that all the corresponding bits are moved according to the ^-transitions. Since this function is very large (i.e., 2m entries) its domain is split in many functions from 8- or 16-bit submasks to 7n-bit masks. This is possible because E(B\,..B3) ~ E{B\)\...\E(B3), where B% Figure 8.23    The non-deterministic (a) and deterministic (h) automata for the regular expression b b*   (b j b*a). 220        INDEXING AND SEARCHING are the submasks. Hence, the scheme performs |"m/8] or |~ra/16] operations per text character and needs [ra/8] 28 \m/w] or [ra/16]216|"m/it/] machine words of memory. Extended patterns can be rephrased as regular expressions and solved as before. However, in many cases it is more efficient to give them a specialized solution, as we saw for the extensions of exact searching (bit-parallel algorithms). Moreover, extended patterns can be combined with approximate search for maximum flexibility. In general, the bit-parallel approach is the best equipped to deal with extended patterns. Real times for regular expressions and extended pattern searching using this technique are between 2-8 Mb/sec.
