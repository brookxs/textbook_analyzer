 1.2.1    The User Task The user of a retrieval system has to translate his information need into a query in the language provided by the system. With an information retrieval system, this normally implies specifying a set of words which convey the semantics of the information need. With a data retrieval system, a query expression (such as, for instance, a regular expression) is used to convey the constraints that must be satisfied by objects in the answer set. In both cases, we say that the user searches for useful information executing a retrieval task. Consider now a user who has an interest which is either poorly denned or which is inherently broad. For instance, the user might be interested in documents about car racing in general. In this situation, the user might use an interactive interface to simply look around in the collection for documents related to car racing. For instance, he might find interesting documents about Formula 1 racing, about car manufacturers, or about the '24 Hours of Le Mans.1 Furthermore, while reading about the k24 Hours of Le Mans\ he might turn his attention to a document which provides directions to Le Alans and, from there, to documents which cover tourism in France. In this situation, we say that the user is browsing the documents in the collection, not searching. It is still a process of retrieving information, but one whose main objectives are not clearly defined in the beginning and whose purpose might change during the interaction with the system. In this book, we1 make a clear distinction between the different tasks the liber of t lie retrieval system might be engaged in. His task might be of two distinct types: information or data retrieval and browsing. Classic information retrieval systems normally allow information or data retrieval. Hypertext systems are usually tuned for providing quick browsing. Modern digital library and Web interfaces might attempt to combine these tasks to provide improved retrieval capabilities.   However, combination of retrieval and browsing is not yet a well BASIC CONCEPTS         5 established approach and is not the dominant paradigm. Figure 1.1 illustrates the interaction of the user through the different tasks we identify. Information and data retrieval are usually provided by most modern information retrieval systems (such as Web interfaces). Further, such systems might also provide some (still limited) form of browsing. While combining information and data retrieval with browsing is not yet a common practice, it might become so in the future. Both retrieval and browsing are, in the language of the World Wide Web, 'pulling' actions. That is, the user requests the information in an interactive manner. An alternative is to do retrieval in an automatic and permanent fashion using software agents which push the information towards the user. For instance, information useful to a user could be extracted periodically from a news service. In this case, we say that the IR system is executing a particular retrieval task which consists of filtering relevant information for later inspection by the user. We briefly discuss filtering in Chapter 2.
