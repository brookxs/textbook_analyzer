 1.1 Finding Out About - A Cognitive Activity  We are all forced to make decisions regularly, sometimes on the spur of  the moment. But the rest of the time we have enough warning that it is possible to collect our thoughts and do some research that makes our  * Robert Mankoff, 0 The New Yorker, 26 January 1998. FINDING OUT ABOUT  decision as sound as it can be. This book is a closer look at the process of finding out about (FOA), research activities that allow a decision-maker to draw on others' knowledge. It is written from a technical perspective, in terms of computational tools that speed the FOA activity in the modern era of the distributed networks of knowledge collectively known as the World Wide Web (WWW). It shows you how to build many of the tools that are useful for searching collections of text and other media. The primary argument advanced is that progress requires that we appreciate the cognitive foundation we bring to this task as academics, as language users, and even as adaptive organisms.  As organisms, we have evolved a wide range of strategies for seeking useful information about our environment. We use the term "cognitive" to highlight the use of internal representations that help even the simplest organisms perceive and respond to their world; as the organisms get less simple, their cognitive structures increase in complexity. Whether done by simple or complex organisms, however, the process of finding out about is a very active one - making initial guesses about good paths, using complex sets of features to decide if we seem to be on the right path, and proceeding forward.  As humans, we are especially expert at searching through one of the most complex environments of all: language. Its system of linguistic features is not derived from the natural world, at least not directly. It is a constructed, cultural system that has worked well since (by definition! ) prehistoric times. In part, languages remain useful because they are capable of change when necessary. New features and new objects are noticed, and it becomes necessary for us to express new things about them, to form our reactions to them, and to express these reactions to one another.  Our first experience of language, as children and as a species, was oral - we spoke and listened. As children we learn Sprachspiele (word or language games) [Wittgenstein, 1953] - how to use language to get what we want. A baby saying "Juice!" is using the exclamation as a tool to make adults move; that's what a word means. Such a functional notion of language, in terms of the jobs it accomplishes, will prove central to our conception of what keywords in documents and queries mean as part of the FOA task.  Beyond the oral uses of language, as a species we have also learned the advantages of writing down important facts we might otherwise forget. OVERVIEW  Writing down a list of things to do, which we might forget tomorrow, extends our limited memory. Some of these advantages accrue to even a single individual: We use language personally, to organize our thoughts and to conceive strategies.  Even more important, we use writing to say things to others. Writing down important, memorable facts in a consistent, conventional manner, so that others can understand what we mean and vice versa, further amplifies the linguistic advantage. As a society, we value reading and writing skills because they let us interpret shared symbols and coordinate our actions. In advanced cultures' scholarship, entire curricula can be defined in terms of what Robert McHenry (Editor-in-Chief of Encyclopedia Britannica) calls "KnowingHow to Know"1  It is easiest to think of the organism's or human's search as being for a valuable object, sweet pieces of fruit in the jungle, or (in modern times) a grocer that sells them. But as language has played an increasingly important role in our society, searching for valuable written passages becomes an end unto itself. Especially as members of the academic community, we are likely to go to libraries seeking others' writings as part of our search. Here we find rows upon rows of books, each full of facts the author thought important, and endorsed by a librarian who has selected it. The authors are typically people far from our own time and place, using language similar but not identical to our own.  Of course the library contains many such books on many, many topics. We must Find Out About a topic of special interest, looking only for those things that are relevant to our search. This basic skill is a fundamental part of an academic's job:  ï  We look for references in order to write a term paper.  ï  We read a textbook, looking for help in answering an exercise.  ï  We comb through scientific journals to see if a question has already been answered.  We know that if we find the right reference, the right paper, the right paragraph, our job will be made much easier. Language has become not only the means of our search, but its object as well  wwwjustanother. com/howtoknow FINDING OUT ABOUT  Today we can also search the World Wide Web (WWW) for others' opinions of music, movies, or software. Of course these examples are much less of an "academic exercise"; Finding Out About such information commodities, and doing it consistently and well, is a skill on which the modern information society places high value indeed. But while the infrastructure forming the modern WWW is quite recent, the promise offered by truly connecting all the world's knowledge has been anticipated for some time, for example, by H. G. Wells [Wells, 1938].  Many of the FOA searching techniques we will discuss in this text have been designed to operate on vast collections of apparently "dead" linguistic objects: files full of old email messages, CD-ROMs full of manuals or literature, Web servers fiill of technical reports, and so on. But at their core, each of these collections is evidence of real, vital attempts to communicate. Typically an author (explicitly or implicitly) anticipates the interests of some imagined audience and produces text that is a balance between what the author wants to say and what he or she thinks the audience wants to hear. A textual corpus will contain many such documents, written by many different authors, in many styles and for many different purposes. A person searching through such a corpus comes with his or her own purposes and may well use language in a different way from any of the authors. But each individual linguistic expression - the authors' attempts to write, the searchers' attempts to express their questions and then read the authors' documents - must be appreciated for the word games [Wittgenstein, 1953] that they are. FOA is centrally concerned with meaning: the semantics of the words, sentences, questions, and documents involved. We cannot tell if a document is about a topic unless we understand (at least something of) the semantics of the document and the topic. This is the notion of about-ness most typical within the tradition of library science [Hutchins, 1978].  This means that our attempts to engineer good technical solutions must be informed by, and can contribute to, a broader philosophy of language. For examples it will turn out that FOA's concern with the semantics of entire documents is well complemented by techniques from computational linguistics, which have tended to focus on syntactic analysis of individual sentences. But even more exciting is the fact that the recent OVERVIEW       5  Questioner  Question answerer  Question  Answer  Assessment  FIGURE 1.1 The FOA Conversation Loop.  availability of new types of electronic artifacts - from email messages and WWW corpora to the browsing behaviors of millions of users all trying to FOA - brings an empirical grounding for new theories of language that may well be revolutionary.  At its core, the FOA process of browsing readers can be imagined to involve three phases:  1.  asking a question;  2.  constructing an answer; and  3.  assessing the answer.  This conversational loop is sketched in Figure 1.1.  Step 1. Asking a Question  The first step is initiated by people who (anticipating our interest in building a search engine) we'll call users, and their questions. We don't know a lot about these people, but we do know they are in a particular frame of mind, a special cognitive state; they may be aware^ of a specific  gap in their knowledge (or they be only vaguely puzzled), and they're motivated to fill it. They want to FOA ... some topic.  Supposing for a moment that we were there to ask, the users may not  even be able to characterize the topic, that is, to articulate their knowledge gap. More precisely, they may not be able to fully define characteristics of the "answer" they seek. A paradoxical feature of the FOA problem is  Meta-cognition about  ignorance FINDING OUT ABOUT  that if users knew their question, precisely, they might not even need the search engine we are designing: Forming a clearly posed question is often the hardest part of answering it! In any case, well call this somewhat befuddled but not uncommon cognitive state the users' information need.  While a bit confused about their particular question, the users are not without resources. First, they can typically take their ill-defined, internal cognitive state and turn it into an external expression of their question, in some language. We'll call their expression the query, and the language in which it is constructed the query language.  Step 2. Constructing an Answer  So much for the source of the question; whence the answer? If the question is being asked of a person, we must worry about equally complex characteristics of the answerer's cognitive state:  ï  Can they translate the user's ill-formed question into a better one?  ï  Do they know the answer themselves?  ï  Are they able to verbalize this answer?  ï  Can they give the answer in terms the user will understand?  ï  Can they provide the necessary background knowledge for the user to understand the answer itself?  We will refer to the question-answerer as the search engine, a computer program that algorithmically performs this task. Immediately each  of the concerns (just listed) regarding the human answerer's cognitive state translates into extremely ambitious demands we might make of our computer system.  Throughout most of this book, we will avoid such ambitious issues and instead consider a very restricted form of the FOA problem: We will assume that the search engine has available to it only a set of preexisting, "canned" passages of text and that its response is limited to identifying one or more of these passages and presenting them to the users; see Figure 1.2. We will call each of these passages a document and the entire set of documents the corpus. Especially when the corpus is very large (e.g., assume it contains millions or even billions of documents), selecting a very small set (say 10 to 20) of these as potentially good answers to OVERVIEW  Corpus FIGURE 1.2 Retrieval of Documents in Response to a Query  be retrieved will prove sufficiently difficult (and practically important) that we will focus on it for the first few chapters of this book. In the final chapters however, we will consider how this basic functionality can be extended towards tools for "Searching for an education" (cf. Section 8.3.9).  Step 3. Assessing the Answer  Imagine a special instance of the FOA problem: You are the user, waiting in line to ask a question of a professor. You're confused about a topic that is sure to be on the final exam. When you finally get your chance to ask your question, we'll assume that the professor does nothing but select the three or four preformed pearls of wisdom he or she thinks come closest to your need, delivers these "documents," and sends you on your way. "But wait!" you want to say. "That isn't what I meant" Or, "Let me ask it another way." Or, "That helps, but I still have this problem."  The third and equally important phase of the FOA process "closes the loop" between asker and answerer, whereby the user (asker) provides an assessment of how relevant they find the answer provided. If after your first question and the professor's initial answer you are summarily ushered out of the office, you have a perfect right to be angry because the FOA process has been violated. FOA is a dialog between asker and answerer; it does not end with the search engine's first delivery of an answer. This initial exchange is only the first iteration of an ongoing conversation by which asker and answerer mutually negotiate a satisfactory exchange. In the process, the asker may recognize elements of the answer he or she 8       FINDING OUT ABOUT  FIGURE 1.3 Assessment of the Retrieval  What FOA data can we observe?  seeks and be able to reexpress the information need in terms of threads taken from previous answers.  Because the question-answerer has been restricted to a simple set of documents, the asker's relevance feedback must be similarly constrained; for each of the documents retrieved by the search engine, the asker reacts by saying whether or not the document is relevant. Returning to the student/professor scenario, we can imagine this as the student saying "Thanks, that helps" after those pearls that do and remaining silent or saying, "Huh?" or "What does that have to do with anything?!" or "No, that's not what I meant!" otherwise. More precisely, relevance feedback gives askers the opportunity to provide more information with their reaction to each retrieved document - whether it is relevant (©), irrelevant (©), or neutral (#). This is shown as a Venn diagram-like labeling of the set of retrieved documents in Figure 1.3. We'll worry about just how to solicit and make use of relevance feedback judgments in Chapter 4.t
