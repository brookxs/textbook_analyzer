 8.5.7    Phrases and Proximity If a sequence of words is searched to appear in the text exactly as in the pattern (i.e., with the same separators) the problem is similar to that of exact search of a single pattern, by just forgetting the fact that there are many words. If any separator between words is to be allowed, it is possible to arrange it using an extended pattern or regular expression search. The best way to search a phrase element-wise is to search for the element which is less frequent or can be searched faster (both criteria normally match). For instance, longer patterns are better than shorter ones; allowing fewer errors is better than allowing more errors. Once such an element is found, the neighboring words are checked to see if a complete match is found. A similar algorithm can be used to search a proximity query.
