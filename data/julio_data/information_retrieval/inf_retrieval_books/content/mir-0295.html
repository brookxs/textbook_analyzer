 15.4.2    Multimedia Documents Prom the 5S perspective, we see that documents are made up of one or more streams, often with a structure imposed (e.g., a raster organization of a pixel stream represents a color image). Multimedia documents' streams usually must be synchronized in some way, and so it is promising that a new standard for handling this over the Web has been adopted [379]. At the same time, as discussed in Chapters 11 and 12, IR has been applied to various types of multimedia content. Thus, at Columbia University, a large image collection from the Web can be searched on content using visual queries [158]. IBM developed the Query By Image Content (QBIC) system for images and video [257] and has generously helped build a number of important image collections to preserve and increase access to key antiquities [300]. Similarly, the Carnegie Mellon University digital libraryI project, Informedia [146], has focused on video content analysis, word spotting, summarization, search, and in-context results presentation [146]. Better handling of multimedia is at the heart of future research on many types of documents in digital librarys [354]. Indeed, to properly handle the complexity of multimedia collections, very powerful representation, description, query and retrieval systems, such as those built upon logical inference [283], may be required.
