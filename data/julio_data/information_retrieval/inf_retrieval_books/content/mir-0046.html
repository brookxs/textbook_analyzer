 2.8.6    The Impact of Bayesian Network Models The classic Boolean model is based on a neat formalism but is not very effective for information retrieval. The classic vector model provides improved answer sets but lacks a more formal framework. Many attempts have been made in the past to combine the best features of each model. The extended Boolean model and the generalized vector space model are two well known examples. These past attempts are grounded in the belief that the combination of selected properties from distinct models is a promising approach towards improved retrieval. Bayesian network models constitute modern variants of probabilistic reasoning whose major strength (for information retrieval) is a framework which allows the neat combination of distinct evidential sources to support a relevance judgement (i.e., a numerical rank) on a given document. In this regard, belief networks seem more appropriate than previous approaches and more promising. Further, besides allowing the combination of Boolean and vector features, a belief network can be naturally extended to incorporate evidential information derived from past user sessions [674] and feedback cycles [332]. The inference network model has been successfully implemented in the Inquery retrieval system [122] and compares favorably with other retrieval systems. However, despite these promises, whether Bayesian networks will become popular and widely used for information retrieval remains to be seen.
