 13.4.3    User Interfaces There are two important aspects of the user interface of search engines: the query interface and the answer interface (see also Chapter 10), The basic query interface is a box where one or more words can be typed. Although a user would expect that a given sequence of words represents the same query in all search engines, it does not. For example, in AltaVista a sequence of words is a reference to the union of all the Web pages having at least one of those words, while in HotBot it is a reference to the Web pages having all the words. Another problem is that the logical view of the text is not known, that is, some search engines use stopwords, some do stemming, and some are not case sensitive (see Chapter 7). All search engines also provide a query interface for complex queries as well as a command language including Boolean operators and other features, such as phrase search, proximity search, and wild cards. Figures 13.5 and 13.6 show the query interfaces for complex queries for the three largest search engines. They provide several filtering functions. The results can be filtered by additional words that must be present or absent from the answer or in a particular field such as the URL or title, language, geographic region or Internet domain, date range, or inclusion of specific data types such as images or audio. The answer usually consists of a list of the ten top ranked Web pages. Figure 13.7 shows the three top documents for the main four search engines for the query searching and Web and engine. Each entry in this list includes some information about the document it represents. Typically, the information includes the URL, size, the date when the page was indexed, and a couple of lines with its content (title plus first lines or selected headings or sentences). Some search engines allow the user to change the number of pages returned in the list and the amount of information per page, but in most cases this is fixed or limited to a few choices. The order of the list is typically by relevance, but sorting by URL or date is also available in some engines. In addition, most search engines also have an option to find documents similar to each Web page in the answer. 378        SEARCHING THE WEB k ttte $1 rated search engine Return to fewer Options LwkFor Sweh for pages                      L                                , mustcontsin   **|    tlie words nsptt not contain -ªI   tfaewds limit roisito to After ** i   erim S^7t^ Jtem  -ª´*     Jlt;´ª   JSMme Returner v pmmkfm JSSSSflfiSLJ Words an/where.

The Web pages retrieved by the search engine in response to a user query are ranked, usually using statistics related to the terms in the query. In some cases this may not have any meaning, because relevance is not fully correlated with statistics about term occurrence within the collection. Some search engines also taking into account terms included in metatags or the title, or the popularity of a Web page to improve the ranking. This topic is covered next.
