 5.2.1    Query Expansion and Term Reweighting for the Vector Model The application of relevance feedback to the vector model considers that the term-weight vectors of the documents identified as relevant (to a given query) have similarities among themselves (i.e., relevant documents resemble each other). Further, it is assumed that non-relevant documents have term-weight vectors which are dissimilar from the ones for the relevant documents. The basic idea is to reformulate the query such that it gets closer to the term-weight vector space of the relevant documents. Let us define some additional terminology regarding the processing of a given query q as follows, Dr: set of relevant documents, as identified by the user, among the retrieved documents; Dn: set of non-relevant documents among the retrieved documents; Cr: set of relevant documents among all documents in the collection; USER RELEVANCE FEEDBACK         119 |Z)r|, |Dn|, \Cr\:   number of documents in the sets Dr, Dni and Cr, respectively; a,/?, 7: tuning constants. Consider first the unrealistic situation in which the complete set Cr of relevant documents to a given query q is known in advance. In such a situation, it can be demonstrated that the best query vector for distinguishing the relevant documents from the non-relevant documents is given by, The problem with this formulation is that the relevant documents which compose the set Cr are not known a priori. In fact, we are looking for them. The natural way to avoid this problem is to formulate an initial query and to incrementally change the initial query vector. This incremental change is accomplished by restricting the computation to the documents known to be relevant (according to the user judgement) at that point. There are three classic and similar ways to calculate the modified query qm as follows, Standard JRochio :    qm    = a q + ]P   dj VdjEDr Ide-Regular :    qm    = a q + (3   ^    dj   รณ 7 \fd3eDr Ide^Dec^Hi :    qm    = a q +  j3   ^    d3   -  7   maxnon_Teievani{d]) where maxnon-reievant(dj) is a reference to the highest ranked non-relevant document. Notice that now Dr and Dn stand for the sets of relevant and non-relevant documents (among the retrieved ones) according to the user judgement, respectively. In the original formulations, Rochio [678] fixed a = 1 and Ide [391] fixed a = ft = 7 = 1. The expressions above are modern variants. The current understanding is that the three techniques yield similar results (in the past, Ide Dec-Hi was considered slightly better). The Rochio formulation is basically a direct adaptation of equation 5.1 in which the terms of the original query are added in. The motivation is that in practice the original query q may contain important information. Usually, the information contained in the relevant documents is more important than the information provided by the non-relevant documents [698]. This suggests making the constant 7 smaller than the constant /3. An alternative approach is to set ~ to 0 which yields a positive feedback strategy. The main advantages of the above relevance feedback techniques are simplicity and good results. The simplicity is due to the fact that the modified term weights are computed directly from the set of retrieved documents.  The good 120       QUERY OPERATIONS results are observed experimentally and are due to the fact that the modified query vector does reflect a portion of the intended query semantics. The main disadvantage is that no optimality criterion is adopted.
