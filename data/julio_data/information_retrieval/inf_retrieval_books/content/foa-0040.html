 3.2.4 Herbert Simon's Explanation  Simon considered a very different model, focused on the author's activity of constructing a text. Simon's model is based on two assumptions. First, that new words - neologisms - introduced by the author and not previously used are introduced at some constant probability. Second, that the probability of a word having occurred exactly i times is proportional to the total number of occurrences of all words that have appeared exactly i times. These assumptions allow Simon to use the basic mathematics of "pure birth processes" to account for word frequency rankings.*  Simon was interested in models for the "associative" processes underlying authors' cognition, "... sampling earlier segments of the word sequence" [Simon, 1955, p. 434] as they compose. He acknowledged  * In the same paper, "On a class of skew distributions" [Simon, 1955], Simon gives similar accounts for the numbers of papers published by scientists, city populations, and distributions of biological taxa. 68      FINDING OUT ABOUT  that authors also use processes of "imitation: sampling segments of word sequences from other works of other authors, and, of course, from sequences he has heard." Simon imagined this model as potentially applying to three different distributions:  ï  the distribution of word frequencies in the whole historical sequence of words that constitute a language;  ï  the distribution of word frequencies in a continuous piece of prose; and  ï  the distribution of word frequencies in a sample of prose assembled from compositive sources.  He seems most engaged by the second of these alternatives, considering the activity of a particular author. (He uses James Joyce's Ulysses as an example.)  Obviously this word-based model provides a very different explanation of Zipf s law from Mandelbrot's and Miller's character-based ones. Simon was familiar with such models but argued [Simon, 1955, p. 435] that his own "averaging rather than [Miller's] maximizing assumptions" are more desirable. But as Miller notes, "The assumption of maximization can be replaced by the assumption of random spacing" [Miller, 1957, p. 313]. Worse, in terms of the empirical bottom line, Simon's equation does not fit available data as well.
