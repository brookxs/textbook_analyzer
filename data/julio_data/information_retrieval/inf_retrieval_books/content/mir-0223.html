 11.2.1    Multimedia Data Support In Commercial DBMSs Most current relational DBMSs support variable-length data types which can be used to represent multimedia data. The way these data are supported by commercial DBMSs is mostly non-standard in that each DBMS vendor uses different names for such data types and provides support for different operations on them. For example, the Oracle DBMS provides the VARCHAR2 data type to represent variable length, character strings. The maximum length of VARCHAR2 data is 4000 bytes. The RAW and LONG RAW data types are used for data that is not to be interpreted by Oracle. These data types can be used to store graphics, sounds, or unstructured objects. LOB data types can be used to store Large unstructured data OBjects up to four gigabytes in size. BLOBs are used to store unstructured Binary Large OBjects, whereas CLOBs are used to store Character Large OBject data. 330        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES The Sybase SQL server supports IMAGE and TEXT data types to store images and unstructured text, respectively, and provides a limited set of functions for their searching and manipulation. However, the support provided by the above mentioned data types is very limited in that the DBMS does not provide any interpretation of the data content. Moreover, operations that can be performed on such data by means of the built-in functions provided by the DBMS are very simple. As we have already remarked, most commercial relational DBMSs vendors are investing a lot of effort in extending the relational model with the capability of modeling complex objects, typical of the object-oriented context. Such efforts have given rise to the upcoming SQL3 standard. Prom a data modeling point of view, the major improvement provided by SQL3 with respect to its predecessor SQL-92, is the support for an extensible type system. Extensibility of the type system is achieved by providing constructs to define user-dependent abstract data types, in an object-oriented like manner. In SQL3, each type specification consists of both attribute and function specifications. A strong form of encapsulation is provided, in that attribute values can only be accessed by using some system functions. Moreover, user-defined functions can be either visible from any object or only visible in the object they refer to. Both single and multiple inheritance can be defined among user-defined types and dynamic late binding is provided [89]. SQL3 also provides three types of collection data types: sets, multisets, and lists. The elements of a collection must have compatible types. Several system-defined operations are provided to deal with collections. Besides the definition of user-dependent abstract data types, SQL3 provides a restricted form of object identifier that supports sharing and avoids data duplication. Although SQL3 has not yet been officially published, most commercial products have already implemented their proprietary versions of SQL3. An example in such direction is the data cartridges provided by Oracle for multimedia data handling, or the data blades supported by Illustra.f Oracle provides data cartridges for text, spatial data, image, audio and video data. To give a concrete example, OracleS provides a ConText cartridge, which is a text management solution combining data management capabilities of a traditional DBMS with advanced text retrieval and natural-language process technology. The ConText cartridge supports the most popular document formats, including ASCII, MS Word, and HTML. One of the most relevant feature of the ConText cartridge is its ability to find documents about a specific topic I thus providing a form of content-based retrieval). Content-based queries on text documents can be combined with traditional queries in the same SQL statement and can be efficiently executed due to the use of indexing techniques specific for texts. Such techniques are based on the notion of inverted files (see Chapter 8) which map a given word to the documents containing it, thus allowing a fast retrieval of all the documents containing a particular word. t  Ilhistni 'Aits acquired by Infoniiix in DATA MODELING        331 Illustra provides 3D and 2D spatial data blades for modeling spatial data. The supported data types include boxes, vectors, quadrangles, etc., and examples of supported operations are INTERSECT, CONTAINS, OVERLAPS, CENTER, and so on. Spatial data blades also implement R-trees for performing efficient spatial queries [330, 717]. The text data blade provides data types for representing unstructured text and performing content-based queries. For example, the method ContainWords can be used to search for all the documents containing a particular word. Moreover, Illustra supports a data blade which can be used to query images by content. The object-relational technology and its extensive type system is now starting to be widely used both in industrial and research projects. An example of this trend is the La Scala archive project, currently under development at the Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale of the University of Milano [254]. The goal of this project is the development of the multimedia archive of Teatro alia Scala, one of the best known musical temples of the world, using the Oracle technology and the related data cartridges. The system is organized around La Scala nights. Each night encompasses the phonic items, score, and other graphical and video items related to the performance. When a new performance has to be prepared, the musicians can easily access all the materials (such as CD-ROMs, video, photos, and scores) of previous editions of the same performance. Accessing such information has required the development of ad hoc cartridges to represent and query non-conventional data. For instance, we are currently developing a data cartridge that allows content-based queries on music scores. We apply pattern matching techniques to music scores to enable the user to sing a few bars into a microphone linked to the computer and see all the music scores containing a piece of music close to the one being sung. Users can then view the retrieved musical graphic scores, or excerpts from them, and simultaneously play the corresponding music. As an example of a data model suitable for a multimedia environment, in the following we consider the data model developed in the context of the MULTOS project [759].
