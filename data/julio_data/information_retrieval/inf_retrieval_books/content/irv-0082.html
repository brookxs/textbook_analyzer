 Composite measures  Dissatisfaction in the past with methods of measuring effectiveness by a pair of numbers (e.g. precision and recall) which may co-vary in a loosely specified way has led to attempts to invest composite measures. These are still based on the 'contingency' table but combine parts of it into a single number measure. Unfortunately many of these measures are rather ad hoc and cannot be justified in any rational way. The simplest example of this kind of measure is the sum of precision and recall  S = P + R  This is simply related to a measure suggested by Borko  BK = P + R - 1  More complicated ones are  Vickery's measure V can be shown to be a special case of a general measure which will be derived below.  Some single-number measures have derivations which can be justified in a rational manner. Some of them will be given individual attention later on. Suffice it here to point out that it is the model underlying the derivation of these measures that is important.
