 Bibliographic remarks  The early work of H.P. Luhn has been emphasised in this chapter. Therefore, the reader may like to consult the book by Schultz[44] which contains a selection of his papers. In particular, it contains his 1957 and 1958 papers cited in the text. Some other early papers which have had an impact on indexing are Maron and Kuhns[45], and its sequel in Maron[46]. The first paper contains an attempt to construct a probabilistic model for indexing. Batty[47] provides useful background information to the early work on automatic keyword classification. An interesting paper which seems to have been largely ignored in the IR literature is Simon[48]. Simon postulates a stochastic process which will generate a distribution for word frequencies similar to the Zipfian distribution. Doyle[49] examines the role of statistics in text analysis. A recent paper by Sparck Jones[50] compares many of the different approaches to index term weighting. A couple of state-of-the-art reports on automatic indexing are Stevens[51] and Sparck Jones[52]. Salton[53] has compiled a report containing a theory of indexing. Borko[54] has provided a convenient summary of some theoretical approaches to indexing. For an interesting attack on the use of statistical methods in indexing, see Ghose and Dhawle[55].
