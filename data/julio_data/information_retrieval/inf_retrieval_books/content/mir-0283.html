 14.3.2    OPACs and End Users Probably the greatest challenge for designers of OPACs is to create usable systems. OPACs are found in every type of library, and while users of research libraries might be expected to be knowledgeable about library practices in organizing and accessing information, elsewhere the end user could as easily be a schoolchild, college undergraduate, or patron of a local public library with little or no formal training in library use (what Borgman calls 'perpetual novices' [105]). The underlying record structure (the MARC record) is detailed and complex, and the organizational structures (LCSH, LC classification scheme) are far from intuitive. The most common type of searching in OPACs is subject searching, and failures by users in topical searching are well documented [484]. Common failures are null sets ('zero results'), or at the other extreme, information overload in which more references are retrieved than can easily be examined [484]. According to one study of transaction logs for the MELVYL catalog [252], 82% of in-library users had a zero retrieval for one or more searches. Interestingly, over 25% of users continued their search through ten or more tries, and another 25% did not appear to retrieve any useful information. Writing in 1986, Borgman [104] raised the question, 'Why are online catalogs hard to use?/ and in 1996, revisited the problem with kWhy are online catalogs still hard to use?' [105]. She argues the reason is that they do not incorporate knowledge about user behavior, and place too heavy a burden on the searcher for query specification. Greater contextual assistance for searchers has been suggested by a number of researchers [105, 252, 371].
