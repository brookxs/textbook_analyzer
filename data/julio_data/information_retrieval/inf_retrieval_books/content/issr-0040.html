 Cataloging and Indexing                                                                              57  3.2.1      Scope of Indexing  When performed manually, the process of reliably and consistently determining the bibliographic terms that represent the concepts in an item is extremely difficult. Problems arise from interaction of two sources: the author and the indexer. The vocabulary domain of the author may be different than that of the indexer, causing the indexer to misinterpret the emphasis and possibly even the concepts being presented. The indexer is not an expert on all areas and has different levels of knowledge in the different areas being presented in the item. This results in different quality levels of indexing. The indexer must determine when to stop the indexing process.  There are two factors involved in deciding on what level to index the concepts in an item: the exhaustivity and the specificity of indexing desired. Exhaustivity of indexing is the extent to which the different concepts in the item are indexed. For example, if two sentences of a 10-page item on microprocessors discusses on-board caches, should this concept be indexed? Specificity relates to the preciseness of the index terms used in indexing. For example, whether the term "processor" or the term "microcomputer" or the term "Pentium" should be used in the index of an item is based upon the specificity decision. Indexing an item only on the most important concept in it and using general index terms yields low exhaustivity and specificity. This approach requires a minimal number of index terms per item and reduces the cost of generating the index. For example, indexing this paragraph would only use the index term "indexing." High exhaustivity and specificity indexes almost every concept in the item using as many detailed terms as needed. Under these parameters this paragraph would have "indexing," "indexer knowledge," "exhaustivity" and "specificity" as index terms. Low exhaustivity has an adverse effect on both precision and recall. If the full text of the item is indexed, then low exhaustivity is used to index the abstract concepts not explicit in the item with the expectation that the typical query searches both the index and the full item index. Low specificity has an adverse effect on precision, but no effect to a potential increase in recall.  Another decision on indexing is what portions of an item should be indexed. The simplest case is to limit the indexing to the Title or Title and Abstract zones. This indexes the material that the author considers most important and reduces the costs associated with indexing an item. Unfortunately this leads to loss of both precision and recall.  Weighting of index terms is not common in manual indexing systems. Weighting is the process of assigning an importance to an index term's use in an item. The weight should represent the degree to which the concept associated with the index term is represented in the item. The weight should help in discriminating the extent to which the concept is discussed in items In the database. The manual process of assigning weights adds additional overhead on the indexer and requires a more complex data structure to store the weights.
