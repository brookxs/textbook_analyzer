 2.8.3    Belief Network Model The belief network model, introduced in 1996 by Ribeiro-Neto and Muntz [674], is also based on an epistemological interpretation of probabilities. However, it departs from the inference network model by adopting a clearly defined sample space. As a result, it yields a slightly different network topology which provides a separation between the document and the query portions of the network. This is the main difference between the two models and one which has theoretical implications. The Probability Space The probability space adopted was first introduced by Wong and Yao [830] and works as follows. All documents in the collection are indexed by index terms and the universe of discourse U is the set K of all index terms. Definition The set K = {i,..., kt} is the universe of discourse and defines the sample space for the belief network model Let u C K be a subset of K. To each subset u is associated a vector k such that gi(k) = 1 4=$- ki Ã„ u. The introduction of the vector k is useful to keep the notation compatible with the one which has been used throughout this chapter. Each index term is viewed as an elementary concept and AT as a concept space.   A concept u is a subset of K and might represent a document in the collection or a user query.   In a belief network, set relationships are specified using random variables as follows. Definition    7b each index term k% is associated a binary random variable which is also referred to as ki. The random variable kt is set to 1 to indicate that the index k% is a member of a concept/set represented by k. ALTERNATIVE PROBABILISTIC MODELS        57 This association of concepts with subsets is useful because it allows us to express the logical notions of conjunction, disjunction, negation, and implication as the more familiar set-theoretic notions of intersection, union, complementation, and inclusion. Documents and user queries can be defined as concepts in the sample space K as follows. Definition A document d3 in the collection is represented as a concept (i.e., a set) composed of the terms which are used to index dj. Analogously, a user query q is represented as a concept composed of the terms which are used to index q. A probability distribution P is defined over K as follows. Let c be a generic concept in the space K representing a document or user query. Then, P(c)    =    ^P(c|w)xP(U)                                                         (2.11) P(u)    =    ^- 1                                                                            (2.12) Equation 2.11 defines P(c) as the degree of coverage of the space K by c. Such a coverage is computed by contrasting each of the concepts in K with c (through P(c\u)) and by summing up the individual contributions. This sum is weighted by the probability P{u) with which u occurs in K. Since at the beginning the system has no knowledge of the probability with which a concept u occurs in the space K, we can assume that each u is equally likely which results in equation 2.12. Belief Network Model In the belief network model, the user query q is modeled as a network node to which is associated a binary random variable (as in the inference network model) which is also referred to as q. This variable is set to 1 whenever q completely covers the concept space K. Thus, when we assess P(q) we compute the degree of coverage of the space K by q. This is equivalent to assessing the degree of belief associated with the following proposition: Is it true that q completely covers all possible concepts in K? A document d3 is modeled as a network node with which is associated a binary random variable which is also referred to as d3. This variable is 1 to indicate that dj completely covers the concept space A". When we assess P(dj)% we compute the degree of coverage of the space K by dj. This is equivalent to assessing the degree of belief associated with the following proposition: Is it true that dj completely covers all possible concepts in K? According to the above formalism, the user query and the documents in the collection are modeled as subsets of index terms. Each of these subsets is interpreted as a concept embedded in the concept space K which works as a common sample space.   Furthermore, user queries and documents are modeled 58 MODELING Figure 2.10   Basic belief network model. identically. This is an important observation because it defines the topology of the belief network. Figure 2.10 illustrates our belief network model. As in the inference network model, a query q is modeled as a binary random variable which is pointed to by the index term nodes which compose the query concept. Documents are treated analogously to user queries (i.e., both are concepts in the space K). Thus, contrary to the inference network model, a document node is pointed to by the index term nodes which compose the document. This is the topological difference between the two models and one which has more implications than it seems at first glance. The ranking of a document dj relative to a given query q is interpreted as a concept matching relationship and reflects the degree of coverage provided to the concept dj by the concept q. Assumption In the belief network model, P(dj\q) is adopted as the rank of the document dj with respect to the query q. By the application of Bayes' theorem, we can write P{d3\q) = P(d3 A q)/P(q). Since P(q) is a constant for all documents in the collection, we can write P(dj\q) ~ P(dj A q) i.e., the rank assigned to a document dj is directly proportional to P(dj A q). This last probability is computed through the application of equation 2.11 which yields P(dj\q) In the belief network of Figure 2.10, instantiation of the index term variables logically separates the nodes q and d making them mutually independent (i.e., the document and query portions of the network are logically separated by inALTERNATIVE PROBABILISTIC MODELS stantiation of the index term nodes). Therefore, 59 which can be rewritten as P(k) (2.13) Vfc To complete the belief network we need to specify the conditional probabilities P(q\k) and P(dj\k). Distinct specifications of these probabilities allow the modeling of different ranking strategies (corresponding to different IR models). We now discuss how to specify these probabilities to subsume the vector model. For the vector model, the probabilities P{q\k) and P(d3\k) are specified as follows. Let, hi = k  |   (#(*?) = 1 A as before. Also, P(q\k)    = 0 9j(k)=0) if k = h A gt(q) = 1 otherwise P(q\k)    =    1-P(q\k) Further, define 0 P(dj\k)    =    1-P(dj\k) if k = ki A 9i(dj) = 1 otherwise Then, the ordering of the retrieved documents (i.e., the ranking) defined by P(dj\q) coincides with the ordering generated by the vector model as specified in section 2.5.3. Thus, the belief network model can be tuned to subsume the vector model which cannot be accomplished with the inference network model.
