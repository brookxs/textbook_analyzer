 Bibliographic remarks  There is now a vast literature on file structures although there are very few survey articles. Where possible I shall point to some of the more detailed discussions which emphasise an application in IR. Of course the chapter on file organisation in the Annual Review is a good source of references as well. Chapter 7 of Salton's latest book contains a useful introduction to file organisation techniques[34].  A general article on data structures of a more philosophical nature well worth reading is Mealey[32].  A description of the use of a sequential file in an on-line environment may be found in Negus and Hall[36]. The effectiveness and efficiency of an inverted file has been extensively compared with a file structure based on clustering by Murray[37]. Ein-Dor[38] has done a comprehensive comparison between an inverted file and a tree structured file. It is hard to find a discussion of an index-sequential file which makes special reference to the needs of document retrieval. Index-sequential organisation is now considered to be basic software which can be used to implement a variety of other file organisations. Nevertheless it is worth studying some of the aspects of its implementation. For this I recommend the paper by McDonell and Montgomery[39] who give a detailed description of an implementation for a mini-computer. Multi-lists and cellular multi-lists are fairly well covered by Lefkovitz[40]. Ring structures have been very popular in CAD and have been written up by Gray[4l]. Extensive use was made of a modified threaded list by van Rijsbergen[42] in his cluster-based retrieval experiments. The doubly chained tree has been adequately dealt with by Stanfel[21,22] and Patt[23].  Work on tree structures in IR goes back a long way as illustrated by the early papers by Salton[43] and Sussenguth[44]. Trees have always attracted much attention in computer science, mainly for the ability to reduce expected search times in data retrieval. One of the earliest papers on this topic is by Windley[45] but the most extensive discussion is still to be found in Knuth[28] where not only methods of construction are discussed but also techniques of reorganisation.  More recently a special kind of tree, called a trie, has attracted attention. This is a tree structure which has records stored at its terminal nodes, and discriminators at the internal nodes. A discriminator at a node is made up from the attributes of the records dominated by that node. Or as Knuth puts it: 'A trie is essentially a M-ary tree whose nodes are M-place vectors with components corresponding to digits or characters. Each node on level l represents the set of all keys that begin with a certain sequence of l characters; the node specifies an M-way branch depending on the (l + 1)st character.' Tries were invented by Fredkins[46], further considered by Sussenguth[44], and more recently studied by Burkhard[47], Rivest[48], and Bentley[49]. The use of tries in data retrieval where one is interested in either a match or mismatch is very similar to the construction of hierarchic document classification, where each node of the tree representing the hierarchy is also associated with a 'discriminator' used to direct the search for relevant documents (see for example Figure 5.3 in Chapter 5).  The use of hashing in document retrieval is dealt with in Higgins and Smith[50], and Chous[51].  It has become fashionable to refer to document collections which have been clustered as clustered files. I have gone to some pains to avoid the use of this terminology because of the conceptual difference that exists between a structure which is inherent in the data and can be discovered by clustering, and an organisation of the data to facilitate its manipulation inside a computer. Unfortunately this distinction becomes somewhat blurred when clustering techniques are used to generate a physical organisation of data. For example, the work by Bell et al.[52] is of this nature. Furthermore, it has recently become popular to cluster records simply to improve the efficiency of retrieval. Buckhard and Keller[53] base the design of a file structure on maximal complete subgraphs (or cliques). Hatfield and Gerald[54] have designed a paging algorithm for a virtual memory store based on clustering. Simon and Guiho[55] look at methods for preserving 'clusters' in the data when it is mapped onto a physical storage device.  Some of the work that has been largely ignored in this chapter, but which is nevertheless of importance when considering the implementation of a file structure, is concerned directly with the physical organisation of a storage device in terms of block sizes, etc. Unfortunately, general statements about this are rather hard to make because the organisation tends to depend on the hardware characteristics of the device and computer. Representative of work in this area is the paper by Lum et al.[56].
