 3.1 History and Objectives of Indexing  To understand the system design associated with creation and manipulation of the searchable data structures, it is necessary to understand the objectives of the indexing process. Reviewing the history of indexing shows the dependency of information processing capabilities on manual and then automatic processing systems. Through most of the 1980's the goals of commercial Information Retrieval Systems were constrained to facilitating the manual indexing paradigm. In the I990's, exponential growth in computer processing capabilities with a continuing decrease in cost of computer systems has allowed Information Retrieval Systems to implement the previously theoretical functions introducing, a new information retrieval paradigm.
