 15.5    Prototypes, Projects, and Interfaces Though numerous efforts in the IR, hypertext, multimedia, and library automation areas have been underway for years as precursors of today's digital library systems, one of the first new efforts aimed at understanding the requirements for digital librarys and constructing a prototype from scratch was the ENVISION project, launched in 1991 [269]. Based on discussions with experts in the field and a careful study of prospective users of the computer science collection to be built with the assistance of ACM, the ENVISION system was designed to extend the MARIAN search system [264] with novel visualization techniques [273, 360]. Careful analysis has shown its 2D approach to management of search results is easy to use and effective for a number of digital library activities [610]. The CORE project, another early effort, is an electronic library prototype on chemical journal articles. Its collection included, for each article, both scanned images and an SGML marked-up version, as well as indexes for full-text Boolean searching. It was undertaken by the American Chemical Society, Chemical Abstracts Service, OCLC, Bellcore, and Cornell University, along with other partners [237]. This project also was concerned with collection building as well as testing of a variety of interfaces that were designed based on user studies. One of the most visible project efforts is the Digital Libraries Initiative, initially supported by NSF, DARPA, and NASA [349]. Phase 1 provided funding for six large projects over the period 1994-1998. These projects spanned a wide 426        DIGITAL LIBRARIES range of major topics in developing the National Information Infrastructure (Nil) and addressed future technological problems. The Illinois project [777] focused on manually structured text documents in full systems with many users; the Berkeley project [775] emphasized automatically recognized image documents, also with large systems. The Santa Barbara [776] and Carnegie Mellon [146] projects investigated the ability to manipulate new media; Carnegie Mellon focused on segmenting and indexing video using speech recognition and program structure, and Santa Barbara concentrated on indexing maps using image processing and region metadata. Stanford [745] and Michigan [784] investigated the intermediaries to perform operations on large digital libraries; Stanford investigated interoperability of different search services, and Michigan concentrated on interacting software agents to provide services to users [710]. Since these projects have been described elsewhere in depth, it should suffice here to highlight some of the connections of those projects with the IR community. First, each project has included a component dealing with document collections. The Illinois project produced SGML versions of a number of journals while the Berkeley project concentrated on page images and other image classes. Santa Barbara adopted a spatial perspective, including satellite imagery, while Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) focused on video. Stanford built no collections, but rather afforded access to a number of information sources to demonstrate interoperability. At the University of Michigan, some of the emphasis was on having agents dynamically select documents from a distributed set of resources. Second, the digital libraryI projects all worked on search. Text retrieval, and using automatically constructed cross-vocabulary thesauri to help find search terms, was emphasized in Illinois. Image searching was studied at Berkeley and Santa Barbara while video searching was investigated at CMU. Michigan worked with agents for distributed search while Stanford explored the coupling of a variety of architectures and interfaces for retrieval. Finally, it is important to note that the digital libraryI efforts all spent time on interface issues. Stanford used animation and data flows to provide flexible manipulation and integration of services [192]. At Michigan, there were studies of the PAD+4- approach to 2D visualization [70]. Further discussion of interfaces can be found below in subsection 15.5.2. It should be noted that these projects only partially covered the 5S issues. Structures were not well studied, except slightly in connection with the Illinois work on SGML and the Berkeley work on databases. Scenarios were largely ignored, except in some of the interface investigations. Similarly, spaces were not investigated much, except in connection with the vocabulary transfer work at Illinois and the spatial collection and browsing work at Santa Barbara. Other projects in the broader international scene, some of which are discussed in the next section, may afford more thorough 5S coverage. Since the announcement of digital libraryL activities and interest related to digital libraries have increased dramatically. The six digital libraryI projects were highly visible and grew in scope; however, it was quickly realized that digital libraryI still needed additional direction and coherence.  During the initial funding period of the digital libraryI PROTOTYPES, PROJECTS, AND INTERFACES        427 program, additional workshops were created to develop consensus on the directions and boundaries with discussions from various communities. An important aspect that many people realized from the workshops is the importance of efforts in domains outside computer and information science to the advances in digital libraries research [324]. A follow-on program, Digital Libraries Initiative - Phase 2 (digital libraryI-2), jointly supported by NSF, DARPA, NASA, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the Library of Congress (LoC), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and others, was announced in the spring of 1998 focus less on technology research than digital libraryI, but, more importantly, supporting research across the information life cycle, from content creation, access, and use to preservation and archiving, moving towards the concept of digital libraries as human-centered systems. digital libraryI-2 will emphasize the study of interactions between digital libraries and humans, fuller understanding of and improving access to digital content and collections, and interoperability and integration toward flexible information environments at the level of individual, group, and institution [324, 216]. The program will involve people not only from science and engineering but also from arts and humanities.
