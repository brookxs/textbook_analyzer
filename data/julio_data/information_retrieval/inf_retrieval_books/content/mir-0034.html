 2.6.1    Fuzzy Set Model Representing documents and queries through sets of keywords yields descriptions which are only partially related to the real semantic contents of the respective documents and queries. As a result, the matching of a document to the query terms is approximate (or vague). This can be modeled by considering that each ALTERNATIVE SET THEORETIC MODELS        35 query term defines a fuzzy set and that each document has a degree of membership (usually smaller than 1) in this set. This interpretation of the retrieval process (in terms of concepts from fuzzy theory) is the basic foundation of the various fuzzy set models for information retrieval which have been proposed over the years. Instead of reviewing several of these models here, we focus on a particular one whose description fits well with the models already covered in this chapter. Thus, our discussion is based on the fuzzy set model for information retrieval proposed by Ogawa, Morita, and Kobayashi [616]. Before proceeding, we briefly introduce some fundamental concepts. Fuzzy Set Theory Fuzzy set theory [846] deals with the representation of classes whose boundaries are not well defined. The key idea is to associate a membership function with the elements of the class. This function takes values in the interval [0,1] with 0 corresponding to no membership in the class and 1 corresponding to full membership. Membership values between 0 and 1 indicate marginal elements of the class. Thus, membership in a fuzzy set is a notion intrinsically gradual instead of abrupt (as in conventional Boolean logic). Definition A fuzzy subset A of a universe of discourse U is characterized by a membership function \±a ' U ó* [0,1] which associates with each element u of U a number ^a{^) in the interval [0,1]. The three most commonly used operations on fuzzy sets are: the complement of a fuzzy set, the union of two or more fuzzy sets, and the intersection of two or more fuzzy sets. They are defined as follows. Definition Let U be the universe of discourse, A and B be two fuzzy subsets of U, and A be the complement of A relative to U. Also, let u be an element of U. Then, Fuzzy sets are useful for representing vagueness and imprecision and have been applied to various domains. In what follows, we discuss their application to information retrieval. Fuzzy Information Retrieval As discussed in Chapters 5 and 7, one additional approach to modeling the information retrieval process is to adopt a thesaurus (which defines terni re36        MODELING lationships). The basic idea is to expand the set of index terms in the query with related terms (obtained from the thesaurus) such that additional relevant documents (i.e., besides the ones which would be normally retrieved) can be retrieved by the user query. A thesaurus can also be used to model the information retrieval problem in terms of fuzzy sets as follows. A thesaurus can be constructed by defining a term-term correlation matrix c (called keyword connection matrix in [616]) whose rows and columns are associated to the index terms in the document collection. In this matrix lt;?, a normalized correlation factor qj between two terms ki and ki can be defined by where rii is the number of documents which contain the term fe$, n\ is the number of documents which contain the term ki, and n^i is the number of documents which contain both terms. Such a correlation metric is quite common and has been used extensively with clustering algorithms as detailed in Chapter 5. We can use the term correlation matrix c to define a fuzzy set associated to each index term fc$. In this fuzzy set, a document dj has a degree of membership HUj computed as ki g d3 which computes an algebraic sum (here implemented as the complement of a negated algebraic product) over all terms in the document dj. A document dj belongs to the fuzzy set associated to the term ki if its own terms are related to ki. Whenever there is at least one index term ki of dj which is strongly related to the index ki (i.e., c^i ~ 1), then /i^j ~ 1 and the index kz is a good fuzzy index for the document dj. In the case when all index terms of dj are only loosely related to ku the index ki is not a good fuzzy index for dj (i.e., \i^j ~ 0). The adoption of an algebraic sum over all terms in the document dj (instead of the classic max function) allows a smooth transition for the values of the \ix j factor. The user states his information need by providing a Boolean-like query expression. As also happens with the classic Boolean model (see the beginning of this chapter), this query is converted to its disjunctive normal form. For instance, the query [q = ka A ( V -ªfcc)] can be written in disjunctive normal form as [qdnf = (1,1,1) V (1,1,0) V (1,0,0)], where each of the components is a binary weighted vector associated to the tuple (ka, h,kc). These binary weighted vectors are the conjunctive components of Qdnf- Let cc% be a reference to the 2-th conjunctive component. Then, Qdnf = CCi    V   CÄ2   V    ...    V   CCp where p is the number of conjunctive components of qdnf-   The procedure to compute the documents relevant to a query is analogous to the procedure adopted ALTERNATIVE SET THEORETIC MODELS        37 A, CC2   + CC3 Figure 2.5    Fuzzy document sets for the query [q = ka  A   (fegt;   V Ä {1,2,3}, is a conjunctive component. Dq is the query fuzzy set. Each I, I by the classic Boolean model. The difference is that here we deal with fuzzy (instead of crispy or Boolean) sets. We proceed with an example. Consider again the query [q = ka A (fe V -ifcc)]. Let Da be the fuzzy set of documents associated to the index ka. This set is composed, for instance, by the documents dj which have a degree of membership /xaj greater than a predefined threshold K. Further, let Da be the complement of the set Da. The fuzzy set Da is associated to kai the negation of the index term ka. Analogously, we can define fuzzy sets D^ and Dc associated to the index terms fc and kC) respectively. Figure 2.5 illustrates this example. Since the sets are all fuzzy, a document dd might belong to the set Da, for instance, even if the text of the document d3 does not mention the index ka. The query fuzzy set Dq is a union of the fuzzy sets associated with the three conjunctive components of qdnf (which are referred to as cci, CC2, and CC3). The membership /iqj of a document dj in the fuzzy answer set Dq is computed as follows. 2=1 =      1 - (I- {laJ^bjVcj) X X (1 - flaJ(l - M6,j where fiij, i Ä {a, h, c}, is the membership of dj in the fuzzy set associated with k%. As already observed, the degree of membership in a disjunctive fuzzy set is computed here using an algebraic sum, instead of the more common max function. Further, the degree of membership in a conjunctive fuzzy set is computed here using an algebraic product, instead of the more common min function. This adoption of algebraic sums and products yields degrees of membership which 38        MODELING vary more smoothly than those computed using the min and max functions and thus seem more appropriate to an information retrieval system. This example illustrates how this fuzzy model ranks documents relative to the user query. The model uses a term-term correlation matrix to compute correlations between a document dj and its fuzzy index terms. Further, the model adopts algebraic sums and products (instead of max and min) to compute the overall degree of membership of a document dj in the fuzzy set defined by the user query. Ogawa, Morita, and Kobayashi [616] also discuss how to incorporate user relevance feedback into the model but such discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter. Fuzzy set models for information retrieval have been discussed mainly in the literature dedicated to fuzzy theory and are not popular among the information retrieval community. Further, the vast majority of the experiments with fuzzy set models has considered only small collections which make comparisons difficult to make at this time.
