 15.4    Document Models, Representations, and Access Without documents there would be no IR or digital librarys. Hence, it is appropriate to consider definitions of 'document' [709], and to develop suitable formalizations [508], as well as to articulate research concerns [505]. For efficiency purposes, especially when handling millions of documents and gigabytes, terabytes, or petabytes of space, compression is crucial [825]. While that is becoming more manageable, converting very large numbers of documents using high quality representations [151] can be prohibitively expensive, especially relative to the costs of retrieval, unless items are popular. All of these matters relate to the view of a document as a stream (along with one or more organizing structures); alternatively one can use scenarios to provide focus on the usage of documents. These problems shift, and sometimes partially disappear, when one considers the entire life cycle and social context of a document [124, 353] or when digital librarys become an integral part of automation efforts that deal with workflow and task support for one or more document collections.
