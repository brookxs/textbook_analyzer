 Explicit measures of effectiveness  I shall now argue for a specific form of [[Phi]]i and F, based on a model for the user. In other words, the form [[Phi]]i and F are partly determined by the user. We start by showing how the ordering on R x P in fact induces an ordering of intervals on each factor. From Figure 7.13 we have that (R3, P1) gt;= (R1, P2), (R3, P1) gt;= (R1, P1) and (R1, P2) gt;= (R1, P1). Therefore the increment (interval) R1R3 is preferred to the increment P1P2. But (R2, P2) gt;= (R4, P1), which gives P1 P2 is preferred to R2 R4. Hence R1 R3 gt;=1 R2, R4 where gt;=1 is the induced order relation on R. We now have a method of comparing each interval on R with a fixed interval on P.  Since we have assumed that effectiveness is determined by precision and recall we have committed ourselves to the importance of proportions of documents rather than absolute numbers. Consistent with this is the assumption of decreasing marginal effectiveness. Let me illustrate this with an example. Suppose the user is willing to sacrifice one unit of precision for an increase of one unit of recall, but will not sacrifice another unit of precision for a further unit increase in recall, i.e.  (R + 1, P - 1) gt; (R, P)  but  (R + 1, P) gt; (R + 2, P - 1)  We conclude that the interval between R + 1 and R exceeds the interval between P and P - 1 whereas the interval between R + 1 and R + 2 is smaller. Hence the marginal effectiveness of recall is decreasing. (A similar argument can be given for precision.) The implication of this for the shape of the curves of equal effectiveness is that they are convex towards the origin.  Finally, we incorporate into our measurement procedure the fact that users may attach different relative importance to precision and recall. What we want is therefore a parameter (ß) to characterise the measurement function in such a way that we can say: it measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches ß times as much importance to recall as precision. The simplest way I know of quantifying this is to specify the P/R ratio at which the user is willing to trade an increment in precision for an equal loss in recall.  Definition 6. The relative importance a user attaches to precision and recall is the P/R ratio at which [[partialdiff]]E/ [[partialdiff]]R = [[partialdiff]]E/ [[partialdiff]]P, where E = E(P, R) is the measure of effectiveness based on precision and recall.  Can we find a function satisfying all these conditions? If so, can we also interpret it in an intuitively simple way? The answer to both these questions is yes. It involves:  The scale functions are therefore, [[Phi]]1(P) = [[alpha]](1/P), and [[Phi]]2(R) = (1 - [[alpha]]) (1/R). The 'combination' function F is now chosen to satisfy definition 6 without violating the additive independence. We get:  We now have the effectiveness measure. In terms of P and R it will be:  To facilitate interpretation of the function, we transform according to [[alpha]] = 1/(ß[2] + 1), and find that [[partialdiff]]E/ [[partialdiff]]R = [[partialdiff]]E/ [[partialdiff]]P when P/R = ß. If A is the set of relevant documents and B the set of retrieval documents, then:  E now gives rise to the following special cases:  (1) When [[alpha]] = 1/2 (ß = 1) E = |A [[Delta]] B | / (|A | + |B |), a normalised symmetric difference between sets A and B (A [[Delta]] B = A [[union]] B - A [[intersection]] B). It corresponds to a user who attaches equal importance to precision and recall.  (2) E -gt; 1 - R when [[alpha]] -gt; 0 (ß -gt; *), which corresponds to a user who attaches no important to precision.  (3) E -gt; 1 - P when [[alpha]] -gt; 1 (ß -gt; 0), which corresponds to a user who attaches no importance to recall.  It is now a simple matter to show that certain other measures given in the literature are special cases of the general form E. By the representation theorem, the [[Phi]]i 's are uniquely determined up to a linear transformation, that is, [[Phi]]i['] = [[Theta]][[Phi]]i + [[gamma]]i would serve equally well as scale functions. If we now set [[Phi]]1['] = 2[[Phi]]1 - 1/2, [[Phi]]2['] = 2[[Phi]]2 - 1/2, and ß = 1 then we have:  which is the measure recommended by Heine[3].  One final example is the measure suggested by Vickery in 1965 which was documented by Cleverdon et al.[27]. Here we set:  which is Vickery's measure (apart from a scale factor of 100).  To summarise, we have shown that it is reasonable to assume that effectiveness in terms of precision and recall determines an additive conjoint structure. This guarantees the existence of an additively independent representation. We then found the representation satisfying some user requirements and also having special cases which are simple to interpret.  The analysis is not limited to the two factors precision and recall, it could equally well be carried out for say the pair fallout and recall. Furthermore, it is not necessary to restrict the model to two factors. If appropriate variables need to be incorporated the model readily extends to n factors. In fact, for more than two dimensions the Thomsen condition is not required for the representation theorem.
