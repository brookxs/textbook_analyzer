A Contiguous Word Phrase is two or more words that are treated as a single semantic unit. An example of a CWP is "United States of America." It is four words that specify a search term representing a  SEARCH STATEMENT                         SYSTEM OPERATION  "Venetian" ADJ "Blind"                         would   find    items   that   mention    a  Venetian Blind on a window but not items discussing a Blind Venetian  "United"     within     five     words     of   would   hit   on    "United   States   and "American"                                              American  interests," "United Airlines  and American Airlines" not on "United States of America and the American dream"  "Nuclear"  within  zero paragraphs  of   would find items that have "nuclear" "clean-up"                                                and "clean-up" in the same paragraph.  Figure 2.2 Use of Proximity  single specific semantic concept (a country) that can be used with any of the operators discussed above. Thus a query could specify "manufacturing" AND "United States of America" which returns any item that contains the word "manufacturing" and the contiguous words "United States of America."  A contiguous word phrase also acts like a special search operator that is similar to the proximity (Adjacency) operator but allows for additional specificity. If two terms are specified, the contiguous word phrase and the proximity operator using directional one word parameters or the Adjacent operator are identical. For contiguous word phrases of more than two terms the only way of creating an equivalent search statement using proximity and Boolean operators is via nested Adjacencies which are not found in most commercial systems. This is because Proximity and Boolean operators are binary operators but contiguous word phrases are an "N"ary operator where "N" is the number of words in the CWP.  Contiguous Word Phrases are called Literal Strings in WAIS and Exact Phrases in RetrievalWare. In WAIS multiple Adjacency (ADJ) operators are used to define a Literal String (e.g., "United" ADJ "States" ADJ "of ADJ "America").
