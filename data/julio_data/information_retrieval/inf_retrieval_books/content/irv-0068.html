 Computational details  I now turn to some of the more practical details of computing g(x) for each x when the variables xi are assumed to be stochastically dependent. The main aim of this section will be to demonstrate that the computations involved are feasible. The clearest way of doing this is to discuss the calculation of each 'object' EMIM, MST, and g(.) separately and in that order.
