 10.5.1    Boolean Queries In modern information access systems the matching process usually employs a statistical ranking algorithm. However, until recently most commercial full-text systems and most bibliographic systems supported only Boolean queries. Thus the focus of many information access studies has been on the problems users have in specifying Boolean queries. Unfortunately, studies have shown time and again that most users have great difficulty specifying queries in Boolean format and often misjudge what the results will be [111, 322, 558, 841]. Boolean queries are problematic for several reasons. Foremost among these is that most people find the basic syntax counter-intuitive. Many English-speaking users assume everyday semantics are associated with Boolean operators when expressed using the English words AND and OR, rather than their logical equivalents. To inexperienced users, using AND implies the widening of the scope of the query, because more kinds of information are being requested. For instance, 'dogs and cats' may imply a request for documents about dogs and documents about cats, rather than documents about both topics at once. "Tea or coffee' can imply a mutually exclusive choice in everyday language. This kind of conceptual problem is well documented [111, 322, 558, 841]. In addition, most query languages that incorporate Boolean operators also require the user to specify complex syntax for other kinds of connectors and for descriptive metadata. Most users are not familiar with the use of parentheses for nested evaluation, nor with the notions associated with operator precedence. By serving a massive audience possessing little query-specification experience, the designers of World Wide Web search engines have had to come up with more intuitive approaches to query specification. Rather than forcing users to specify complex combinations of ANDs and ORs, they allow users to choose from a selection of common simple ways of combining query terms, including "all the words' (place all terms in a conjunction) and 'any of the words1 (place all terms in a disjunction). Another Web-based solution is to allow syntactically-based query specification, but to provide a simpler or more intuitive syntax. The '-}-' prefix operator gained widespread use with the advent of its use as a mandatory specifier in the Altavista Web search engine. Unfortunately, users can be misled to think it is an infix AND rather than a prefix mandatory operator, and thus assume that 'cat + dog1 will only retrieve articles containing both terms (where in fact this query requires dog but allows cat to be optional). Another problem with pure Boolean systems is they do not rank the retrieved documents according to their degree of match to the query. In the pure Boolean framework a document either satisfies the query or it does not. Commercial systems usually resort to ordering documents according to some kind of descriptive metadata, usually in reverse chronological order. (Since these systems usually index timely data corresponding to newspaper and news wires, date of publication is often one of the most salient features of the document.) Web-based systems usually rank order the results of Boolean queries using statistical algorithms and Web-specific heuristics. 280        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION 10.5.2    From Command Lines to Forms and Menus Aside from conceptual misunderstandings of the logical meaning of AND and OR, another part of the problem with pure Boolean query specification in online bibliographic systems is the arbitrariness of the syntax and the contextlessness nature of the TTY-based interface in which they are predominantly available. Typically input is typed at a prompt and is of a form something like the following: COMMAND ATTRIBUTE value  {BOOLEAN-OPERATOR  ATTRIBUTE value}* e.g., FIND PA darwin AND TW species OR TW descent or FIND TW Mt St. Helens AND DATE 1981 (These examples are derived from the syntax of the telnet interface to the University of California Melvyl system [526].) The user must remember the commands and attribute names, which are easily forgotten between usages of the system [553]. Compounding this problem, despite the fact that the command languages for the two main online bibliographic systems at UC Berkeley have different but very similar syntaxes, after more than ten years one of the systems still reports an error if the author field is specified as PA instead of PN, as is done in the other system. This lack of flexibility in the syntax is characteristic of interfaces designed to suit the system rather than its users. The new Web-based version of Melvyl || provides form fillin and menu selection so the user no longer has to remember the names and types of attributes available. Users select metadata types from listboxes and attributes are shown explicitly, allowing selection as an alternative to specification. For example, the 'search type1 field is adjacent to an entry form in which users can enter keywords, and a choice between AND and NOT is provided adjacent to a list of the available document types (editorial, feature, etc.). Only the metadata associated with a given collection is shown in the context of search over that collection. (Unfortunately the system is restricted to searching over only one database at a time. It does however provide a mechanism for applying a previously executed search to a new database.) See Figure 10.9. The Web-based version of Melvyl also allows retention of context between searches, storing prior results in tables and hyper linking these results to lists containing the retrieved bibliographic information. Users can also modify any of the previously submitted queries by selecting a checkbox beside the record of the query. The graphical display makes explicit and immediate many of the powerful options of the system that most users would not learn using the command-line version of the interface. Bit-mapped displays are an improvement over command-line interface, but do not solve all the problems.
