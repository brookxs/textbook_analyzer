 15.8    Bibliographical Discussion As explained in section 15.1, there are many good sources of information about digital libraries. The best pair are the book by Lesk [501] and the online D-Lib Magazine [280]. Pointers to the latest information and sources can be found through online courseware [268]. New books will appear from MIT Press and other publishers. Large funding initiatives, programs, and projects (e.g., [216, 778, 349]) involving the US National Science Foundation (see e.g., the call for Digital Libraries Initiative - Phase 2, NSF 98-63, http://www.dli2.nsf.gov) and other sponsors, and becoming more and more international in nature (e.g., International Digital Libraries Collaborative, NSF 99-6, will lead to a continuing stream of reports on workshops (e.g., [266, 313, 314, 333, 833, 525]) and high quality research presentations at premiere events like the ACM Digital Libraries conferences (e.g. [50, 192, 382, 507, 548, 705, 791]).
