 3.3    Reference Collections In this section we discuss various reference collections which have been used throughout the years for the evaluation of information retrieval systems. We first discuss the TIPSTER/TREC collection which, due to its large size and thorough experimentation, is usually considered to be the reference test collection in information retrieval nowadays. Following that, we cover the CACM and ISI collections due to their historical importance in the area of information retrieval. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of the Cystic Fibrosis collection. It is a small collection whose example information requests were extensively studied by four groups of specialists before generation of the relevant document sets.
