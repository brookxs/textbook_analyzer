 4.6    Trends and Research Issues We reviewed in this chapter the main aspects of the query languages that retrieve information from textual databases. Our discussion covered from the most classic tools to the most novel capabilities that are emerging, from searching words to extended patterns, from the Boolean model to querying structures. Table 4.1 shows the different basic queries allowed in the different models. Although the probabilistic and the Bayesian belief network (BBN) models are based on word queries, they can incorporate set operations. We present in Figure 4.4 the types of operations we covered and how they can be structured (not all of them exist in all models and not ail of them have to be used to form a query). The figure shows, for instance, that we can form a query using Boolean operations over phrases (skipping structural queries), which TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES 115 Model	Queries allowed Boolean	word, set operations Vector	words Probabilistic	words BBN	words Table 4.1    Relationship between types of queries and models. can be formed by words and by regular expressions (skipping the ability to allow errors). natural language Boolean queries fuzzy Boolean structural queries proximity basic queries pattern matching words keywords and context substrings prefixes suffixes regular expressions extended patterns Figure 4.4    The types of queries covered and how they are structured. The area of query languages for text databases is definitely moving towards higher flexibility. While text models are moving towards the goal of achieving a better understanding of the user needs (by providing relevance feedback, for instance), the query languages are allowing more and more power in the specification of the query. While extended patterns and searching allowing errors permit us to find patterns without complete knowledge of what is wanted, querying on the structure of the text (and not only on its content) provides greater expressiveness and increased functionality. Another important research topic is visual query languages. Visual metaphors can help non-experienced users to pose complex Boolean queries. Also, a visual query language can include the structure of the document. This topic is related to user interfaces arid visualization and is covered in Chapter 10. 116        QUERY LANGUAGES
