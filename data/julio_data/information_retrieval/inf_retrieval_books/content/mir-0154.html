 8.6.3    Pattern Matching Using Indices We end this section by explaining how the indexing techniques we presented for simple searching of words can in fact be extended to search for more complex patterns. Inverted Files As inverted files are word-oriented, other types of queries such as suffix or substring queries, searching allowing errors and regular expressions, are solved by a sequential (i.e., online) search over the vocabulary. This is not too bad since the size of the vocabulary is small with respect to the text size. After either type of search, a list of vocabulary words that matched the query is obtained. All their lists of occurrences are now merged to retrieve a list of documents and (if required) the matching text positions. If block addressing is used and the positions are required or the blocks do not coincide with the retrieval unit, the search must be completed with a sequential search over the blocks. Notice that an inverted index is word-oriented. Because of that it is not surprising that it is not able to efficiently find approximate matches or regular expressions that span many words. This is a restriction of this scheme. Variations that are not subject to this restriction have been proposed for languages which do not have a clear concept of word, like Finnish. They collect text samples or n-grarns, which are fixed-length strings picked at regular text intervals. Searching is in genera! more powerful but more expensive. In a full-inverted index, search times for simple words allowing errors on 250 Mb of text took out reference machine from 0.6 to 0,85 seconds, while very complex expressions on extended patterns took from 0.8 to 3 seconds. As a comparison, the same collection cut in blocks of 1 Mb size takes more than 8 seconds for an approximate search with one error and more than 20 for two errors. PATTERN MATCHING        221 Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays If the suffix tree indexes all text positions it can search for words, prefixes, suffixes and substrings with the same search algorithm and cost described for word search. However, indexing all positions makes the index 10 to 20 times the text size for suffix trees. Range queries are easily solved too, by just searching both extremes in the trie and then collecting all the leaves which lie in the middle. In this case the cost is the height of the tree, which is O(logn) on average (excluding the tasks of collecting and sorting the leaves). Regular expressions can be searched in the suffix tree. The algorithm simply simulates sequential searching of the regular expression. It begins at the root, since any possible match starts there too. For each child of the current node labeled by the character c, it assumes that the next text character is c and recursively enters into that subtree. This is done for each of the children of the current node. The search stops only when the automaton has no transition to follow. It has been shown that for random text only O(nQ;polylog(n)) nodes are traversed (for 0 lt; a lt; 1 dependent on the regular expression). Hence, the search time is sublinear for regular expressions without the restriction that they must occur inside a word. Extended patterns can be searched in the same way by taking them as regular expressions. Unrestricted approximate string matching is also possible using the same idea. We present a simplified version here. Imagine that the search is online and traverse the tree recursively as before. Since all suffixes start at the root, any match starts at the root too, and therefore do not allow the match to start later. The search will automatically stop at depth m -f- k at most (since at that point more than k errors have occurred). This implies constant search time if n is large enough (albeit exponential on m and k). Other problems such as approximate search of extended patterns can be solved in the same way, using the appropriate online algorithm. Suffix trees are able to perform other complex searches that we have not considered in our query language (see Chapter 4). These are specialized operations which are useful in specific areas. Some examples are: find the longest substring in the text that appears more than once, find the most common substring of a fixed size, etc. If a suffix array indexes all text positions, any algorithm that works on suffix trees at C(n) cost will work on suffix arrays at O(C(n) log n) cost. This is because the operations performed on the suffix tree consist of descending to a child node, which is done in O(l) time. This operation can be simulated in the suffix array in O(logn) time by binary searching the new boundaries (each suffix tree node corresponds to a string, which can be mapped to the suffix array interval holding ail suffixes starting with that string). Some patterns can be searched directly in the suffix array in O(logn) total search time without simulating the suffix tree. These are: word, prefix, suffix and subword search, as well as range search. However, again, indexing all text positions normally makes the suffix array 222        INDEXING AND SEARCHING size four times or more the text size. A different alternative for suffix arrays is to index only word beginnings and to use a vocabulary supra-index, using the same search algorithms used for the inverted lists.
