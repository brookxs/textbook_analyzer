 1.3.4  index Database Search  When an item is determined to be of interest, a user may want to save it for future reference.   This is in effect filing it.   In an information system this is  accomplished via the index process. In this process the user can logically store an item in a file along with additional index terms and descriptive text the user wants to associate with the item. It is also possible to have index records that do not reference an item, but contain all the substantive information in the index itself. In this case the user is reading items and extracting the information of interest, never needing to go back to the original item. A good analogy to an index file is the card catalog in a library. Another perspective is to consider Index Files as structured databases whose records can optionally reference items in the Document Database. The Index Database Search Process (see Figure 1.4) provides the capability to create indexes and search them. The user may search the index and retrieve the index and/or the document It references- The system also provides the capability to search the index and  then search the items referenced by the index records that Introduction to Information Retrieval Systems                                              19  satisfied the index portion of the query. This is called a combined file search. In an ideal system the index record could reference portions of items versus the total item.  There are two classes of index files: Public and Private Index files. Every user can have one or more Private Index files leading to a very large number of files. Each Private Index file references only a small subset of the total number of items in the Document Database. Public Index files are maintained by professional library services personnel and typically index every item in the Document Database. There is a small number of Public Index files. These files have access lists (i.e., lists of users and their privileges) that allow anyone to search or retrieve data. Private Index files typically have very limited access lists.  To assist the users in generating indexes, especially the professional indexers, the system provides a process called Automatic File Build shown in Figure 1.4 (also called Information Extraction). This capability processes selected incoming documents and automatically determine potential indexing for the item. The rules that govern which documents are processed for extraction of index information and the index term extraction process are stored in Automatic File Build Profiles. When an item is processed it results in creation of Candidate Index Records. As a minimum, certain citation data can be determined and extracted as part of this process assisting in creation of Public Index Files. Examples of this information are author(s), date of publication, source, and references. More complex data, such as countries an item is about or corporations referenced, have high rates of identification. The placement in an index file facilitates normalizing the terminology, assisting the user in finding items. It also provides a basis for programs that analyze the contents of systems trying to identify new information relationships (i.e., data mining). For more abstract concepts the extraction technology is not accurate and comprehensive enough to allow the created index records to automatically update the index files. Instead the candidate index record, along with the item it references, are stored in a file for review and edit by a user prior to actual update of an index file.  The capability to create Private and Public Index Files is frequently implemented via a structured Database Management System. This has introduced new challenges in developing the theory and algorithms that allow a single integrated perspective on the information in the system. For example, how to use the single instance information in index fields and free text to provide a single system value of how the index/referenced item combination satisfies the user's search statement. Usually the issue is avoided by treating the aspects of the search that apply to the structured records as a first level constraint identifying a set of items that satisfy that portion of the query. The resultant items are then searched using the rest of the query and the functions associated with information systems. The evaluation of relevance is based only on this later step. An example of how this limits the user is if part of the index is a field called "Country." This certainly allows the user to constrain his results to only those countries of interest (e.g., Peru or Mexico).   But because the relevance function is only associated with the portion 20                                                                                                Chapter 1  of the query associated with the item, there is no way for the user to ensure that Peru items have more importance to the retrieval than Mexican items.
