 4.2.1    Single-Word Queries The most elementary query that can be formulated in a text retrieval system is a word. Text documents are assumed to be essentially long sequences of words. Although some models present a more general view, virtually all models allow us KEYWORD-BASED QUERYING         101 to see the text in this perspective and to search words. Some models are also able to see the internal division of words into letters. These latter models permit the searching of other types of patterns, which are covered in section 4.3. The set of words retrieved by these extended queries can then be fed into the word-treating machinery, say to perform thesaurus expansion or for ranking purposes. A word is normally defined in a rather simple way. The alphabet is split into 'letters' and 'separators,' and a word is a sequence of letters surrounded by separators. More complex models allow us to specify that some characters are not letters but do not split a word, e.g. the hyphen in 'on-line.' It is good practice to leave the choice of what is a letter and what is a separator to the manager of the text database. The division of the text into words is not arbitrary, since words carry a lot of meaning in natural language. Because of that, many models (such as the vector model) are completely structured on the concept of words, and words are the only type of queries allowed (moreover, some systems only allow a small set of words to be extracted from the documents). The result of word queries is the set of documents containing at least one of the words of the query. Further, the resulting documents are ranked according to a degree of similarity to the query. To support ranking, two common statistics on word occurrences inside texts are commonly used: 'term frequency' which counts the number of times a word appears inside a document and 'inverse document frequency' which counts the number of documents in which a word appears. See Chapter 2 for more details. Additionally, the exact positions where a word appears in the text may be required for instance, by an interface which highlights each occurrence of that word.
