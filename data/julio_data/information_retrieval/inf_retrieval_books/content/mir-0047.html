 2.9    Structured Text Retrieval Models Consider a user with a superior visual memory. Such a user might then recall that the specific document he is interested in contains a page in which the string 'atomic holocaust appears in italic in the text surrounding a Figure whose label contains the word 'earth.' With a classic information retrieval model, this query could be expressed as ['atomic holocaust' and 'earth'] which retrieves all the documents containing both strings. Clearly, however, this answer contains many more documents than desired by this user. In this particular case, the user would like to express his query through a richer expression such as same-page (near ("atomic holocausts Figure (label ("earth')))) which conveys the details in his visual recollection. Further, the user might be interested in an advanced interface which simplifies the task of specifying this (now complex) query. This example illustrates the appeal of a query language which allows us to combine the specification of strings (or patterns) with the 62        MODELING specification of structural components of the document. Retrieval models which combine information on text content with information on the document structure are called structured text retrieval models. For a query such as the one illustrated above, a structured text retrieval system searches for all the documents which satisfy the query. Thus, there is no notion of relevance attached to the retrieval task. In this sense, the current structured text retrieval models are data (instead of information) retrieval models. However, the retrieval system could search for documents which match the query conditions only partially. In this situation, the matching would be approximate and some ranking would have to be used for ordering the approximate answers. Thus, a structured text retrieval algorithm can be seen as an information retrieval algorithm for which the issue of appropriate ranking is not well established. In fact, this is an actual, interesting, and open research problem. At the end of the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, various structured text retrieval models have appeared in the literature. Usually, the more expressive the model, the less efficient is its query evaluation strategy. Thus, selection of a structured model for a given application must be exercised with care. A good policy is to select the most efficient model which supports the functionality required by the application in view. Here, we do not survey all the structured text retrieval models. Instead, we briefly discuss the main features of two of them, namely, a model based on non-overlapping lists and a model based on proximal nodes. These two models should provide a good overview of the main issues and tradeoffs in structured text retrieval. We use the term match point to refer to the position in the text of a sequence of words which matches (or satisfies) the user query. Thus, if the user specifies the simple query ['atomic holocaust in Hiroshima'] and this string appears in three positions in the text of a document dj, we say that the document dj contains three match points. Further, we use the term region to refer to a contiguous portion of the text and the term node to refer to a structural component of the document such as a chapter, a section, a subsection, etc. Thus, a node is a region with predefined topological properties which are known both to the author of the document and to the user who searches the document system.
