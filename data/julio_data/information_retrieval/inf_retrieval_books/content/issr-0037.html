 3.1.1 History  Indexing  (originally  called   Cataloging)   is  the  oldest  technique  for  identifying the contents of items to assist in their retrieval. The objective of cataloging is to give access points to a collection that are expected and most useful to the users of the information. The basic information required on an item, what is the item and what it is about, has not changed over the centuries. As early as the third-millennium, in Babylon, libraries of cuneiform tablets were arranged by subject (Hyman-89). Up to the 19th Century there was little advancement in cataloging, only changes in the methods used to represent the basic information (Norris-69). In the late 1800s subject indexing became hierarchical (e.g., Dewey Decimal System). In 1963 the Library of Congress initiated a study on the computerization of bibliographic surrogates. From 1966 - 1968 the Library of Congress ran its MARC I pilot project. MARC (MAchine Readable Cataloging) standardizes the structure, contents and coding of bibliographic records.    The Cataloging and Indexing                                                                              53  system became operational in 1969 (Avram-75). The earliest commercial cataloging system is DIALOG, which was developed by Lockheed Corporation in 1965 for NASA. It became commercial in 1978 with three government files of indexes to technical publications. By 1988, when it was sold to Knight-Ridder, DIALOG contained over 320 index databases used by over 91,000 subscribers in 86 countries (Harper-81).  Indexing (cataloging), until recently, was accomplished by creating a bibliographic citation in a structured file that references the original text. These files contain citation information about the item, keywording the subject(s) of the item and, in some systems a constrained length free text field used for an abstract/summary. The indexing process is typically performed by professional indexers associated with library organizations. Throughout the history of libraries, this has been the most important and most difficult processing step. Most items are retrieved based upon what the item is about. The user's ability to find items on a particular subject is limited by the indexer creating index terms for that subject. But libraries and library indexing have always assumed the availability of the library staff to act if needed as a human intermediary for users having problems in locating information. For users looking for well-defined data (e.g., people by name and titles) have good success by themselves. But when users are searching for topics they fail on 70% of single query requests and 45% of the time in ever finding the data they need. But when the users consult with a librarian the failure rates drop to 10% (Nordlie-99.) Thus library based indexing was never under significant pressure to invent user interfaces, support material and augmented search engines that would assure users could find the material they needed. They could rely on human interaction to resolve the more complex information needs.  The initial introduction of computers to assist the cataloguing function did not change its basic operation of a human indexer determining those terms to assign to a particular item. The standardization of data structures (e.g., MARC format) did allow sharing of the indexes between libraries. It reduced the manual overhead associated with maintaining a card catalog. By not having to make physical copies of the index card for every subject index term, it also encouraged inclusion of additional index terms. But the process still required the indexer to enter index terms that are redundant with the words in the referenced item. The user, instead of searching through physical cards in a card catalog, now performed a search on a computer and electronically displayed the card equivalents.  In the 1990s, the significant reduction in cost of processing power and memory in modem computers, along with access to the full text of an item from the publishing stages in electronic form, allow use of the full text of an item as an alternative to the indexer-generated subject index. The searchable availability of the text of items has changed the role of indexers and allowed introduction of new techniques to facilitate the user in locating information of interest. The indexer is no longer required to enter index terms that are redundant with words in the text of an item. The searcher is no longer presented a list of potential item of interest, but is additionally informed of the likelihood that each item satisfies his search goal.
