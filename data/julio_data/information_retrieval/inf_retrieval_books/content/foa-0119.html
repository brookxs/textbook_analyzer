 6.2.2 Hierarchic Containment  One of the most common features of all document types is that as larger and larger portions are aggregated, an explicit hierarchic structure is used to organize the text. For example, this textbook is broken into chapters, which are broken into sections and subsections, and so on. This is basically a containment relationship, with shorter passages aggregated to form larger ones, but with short textual rubrics providing useful summaries of the themes of the smaller units. Typical atomic units of text can be a few sentences [Salton et al, 1993; Salton et al.5 1994], but typically they are paragraphs [Hearst and Plaunt, 1993],  A provocative picture of how the containment relation can be exploited is shown from Salton et aUs analysis of encyclopedia text in Figure 6.6. This shows the encyclopedia text ordered sequentially around a ring. In the top figure, individual pages of the encyclopedia are treated as separate documents, and in the bottom figure larger sections are aggregated. In both cases, links between documents are created when their similarity 202       FINDING OUT ABOUT  Award to M.

As Chapter 3 explained in detail, a vector space representation of document content is very sensitive to length. Salton investigated the use of inclusion to aggregate text into larger units (in the bottom of Figure 6.6) and various "global" versus "local" weighting schemes to manipulate the effects of length normalization. Note also how co-reference to similar topical themes can be seen at different scales within the containment hierarchy.  When considering constituent passages of the same document* it becomes possible to ask how much the topic of the prose changes as it goes from one passage to the next. Hearst [Hearst and Plaunt, 1993] analyzed how similarity (usingTF-IDFweightingand cosine similarity) varies across passages.9 The result is the wave of Figure 6.7. Also shown in this figure are vertical bars where a human judge has determined that a topical shift has occurred.  * www.siixis.berkeley.edu/heaj^/tb-exaniple.htEQl 204      FINDING OUT ABOUT  FR8S13-0157 AP; Groups See!

Reproduced with permission of Addison-Wesley  Having isolated individual passages as part of retrieval, it becomes important to show the user this additional level of analysis as part of the retrieval of the "documents " Figure 6.8 shows topical tiling, another visualization technique Hearst developed to highlight shifts in topical focus from one passage to the next. By increasing the resolution of document analysis, users can see which passages match particular keywords or combinations of keywords in their query.  Containment relations among documents may also be useful in supporting queries of widely varying generality (cf. Section 4.3.4). If a user issues a very broad query, it may mean he or she seeks documents with an equally broad overview or level of treatment. One reasonable hypothesis would be that broader queries should correspond to the retrieval of large sections and narrower queries to smaller sections, but only if the assumption that documents in general obey something like a uniform level of treatment. Such an assumption would not be unreasonable for the encyclopedia text considered by Salton et ai, because we expect (and encyclopedia editors attempt to ensure) that there is some document about every topic.

People don't go to court unless they disagree, and so what judges must write about are contentious legal issues defining the borders of legal disputes. As courts work out a legal issue (for example, the intellectual property status of software or whether genes can be patented), we can expect many opinions to cover very similar topical ground.
