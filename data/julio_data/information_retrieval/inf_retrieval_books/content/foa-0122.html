 6.2.5 Beyond Unary About (k) Predicates  Our discussion of FOA has generally assumed that we are attempting to find the topic or topics that a document is about. In the language of logic, we can talk about this as applying a unary predicate About(k). That is, the determination that a document is about keyword k depends 210       FINDING OUT ABOUT  on only one argument, a single keyword. But no piece of writing deals with only a single topic, at least for more than a moment. Good writing connects topics. It discusses a relation among those topics.  Within the paragraph-size textual passages that have been our focus, this relational aspect of language has not been too troubling. But it should make us especially interested in the transitions in topical focus as we move from one paragraph to the next within the same document. Passage-level analysis like this was mentioned earlier (cf. Section 6.2.2).  As we move to larger documents, an additional source of information is citations from one to another. Assuming that we have characterized the topical area of each document independently, an analysis of the citations, placed by one author relating another document to the author's topic, is an explicit indication of the relationships between these topics.  All three levels of analysis รณ within-paragraph relations among topics, paragraph-to-paragraph topical progression, and interdocument relations reflected by citations - are some of the clues we can exploit when suggesting potential browsing directions for users trying to FOA.
