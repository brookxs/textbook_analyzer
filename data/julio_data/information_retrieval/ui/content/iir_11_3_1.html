    Deriving a ranking function for query terms Given a query , we wish to order returned documents by descending . Under the BIM, this is modeled as ordering by . Rather than estimating this probability directly, because we are interested only in the ranking of documents, we work with some other quantities which are easier to compute and which give the same ordering of documents. In particular, we can rank documents by their odds of relevance (as the odds of relevance is monotonic with the probability of relevance). This makes things easier, because we can ignore the common denominator in Rxq-bayes, giving: (66)  The left term in the rightmost expression of EquationÂ 66 is a constant for a given query. Since we are only ranking documents, there is thus no need for us to estimate it. The right-hand term does, however, require estimation, and this initially appears to be difficult: How can we accurately estimate the probability of an entire term incidence vector occurring? It is at this point that we make the Naive Bayes conditional independence assumption that the presence or absence of a word in a document is independent of the presence or absence of any other word (given the query): (67)   (68)    (69)       Let us make an additional simplifying assumption that terms not occurring in the query are equally likely to occur in relevant and nonrelevant documents: that is, if then . (This assumption can be changed, as when doing relevance feedback in Section 11.3.4 .) Then we need only consider terms in the products that appear in the query, and so, (70)  We can manipulate this expression by including the query terms found in the document into the right product, but simultaneously dividing through by them in the left product, so the value is unchanged. Then we have: (71)    Retrieval Status Value  (72)  So everything comes down to computing the . Define : (73)      odds ratio   7.1
