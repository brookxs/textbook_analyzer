 8.5.2    Knuth-Morris-Pratt The KMP algorithm was the first with linear worst-case behavior, although on average it is not much faster than BF. This algorithm also slides a window over the text, However, it does not try all window positions as BF does. Instead, it reuses information from previous checks. After the window is checked, whether it matched the pattern or not, a number of pattern letters were compared to the text window, and they all matched except possibly the last one compared. Hence, when the window has to be shifted, there is a prefix of the pattern that matched the text. The algorithm takes advantage of this information to avoid trying window positions which can be deduced not to match. The pattern is preprocessed in O(m) time and space to build a table called next The next table at position j says which is the longest proper prefix of Pi..j-i which is also a suffix and the characters following prefix and suffix are different. Hence j ó next[j] ¶+1 window positions can be safely skipped if the characters up to j ó 1 matched, and the j-th did not. For instance, when searching the word 'abracadabra/ if a text window matched up to 'abracab,' five positions can be safely skipped since next[7] = 1. Figure 8.14 shows an example. The crucial observation is that this information depends only on the pattern, because if the text in the window matched up to position j ó 1, then that text is equal to the pattern. The algorithm moves a window over the text and a pointer inside the window. Each time a character matches, the pointer is advanced (a match is reported if the pointer reaches the end of the window). Each time a character is not matched, the window is shifted forward in the text, to the position given by next but the pointer position in the text does not change. Since at each text comparison the window or the pointer advance by at least one position, the algorithm performs at most 2n comparisons (and at least n). The Aho-Corasick algorithm can be regarded as an extension of KMP in matching a set of patterns. The patterns are arranged in a trie-like data structure. Each trie node represents having matched a prefix of some pattern(s). The next function is replaced by a more general set of failure transitions. Those transitions go between nodes of the trie. A transition leaving from a node representing the prefix x leads to a node representing a prefix t/, such that y is the longest prefix in the set of patterns which is also a proper suffix of x. Figure 8.15 illustrates this.

On the left, an illustration of the next function. Notice that after matching 'abracada' we do not try to match the last 'a' with the first one since what follows cannot be a 'b.' On the right, a search example. Grayed areas show the prefix information reused. Figure 8.15    Aho-Corasick trie example for the set 'hello,' 'elbow' and 'eleven' showing only one of all the failure transitions. This trie, together with its failure transitions, is built in O(m) time and space (where m is the total length of all the patterns). Its search time is O{n) no matter how many patterns are searched. Much as KMP, it makes at most 2n inspections.
