 Form of retrieval function  The previous section was rather abstract and left the connection of the various probabilities with IR rather open. Although it is reasonable for us to want to calculate P(relevance/document) it is not at all clear as to how this should be done or whether the inversion through Bayes' Theorem is the best way of getting at it. Nevertheless, we will proceed assuming that P(x/wi) is the appropriate function to estimate. This function is of course a joint probability function and the interaction between the components of x may be arbitrarily complex. To derive a workable decision rule a simplifying assumption about P(x/wi) will have to be made. The conventional mathematically convenient way of simplifying P(x/wi) is to assume the component variables xi of x to be stochastically independent. Technically this amounts to making the major assumption  P(x/wi) = P(x1/wi) P(x2/wi) ... P(xn/wi) A1  Later I shall show how this stringent assumption may be relaxed. We also for the moment ignore the fact that assuming independence conditional on both w1 and w2 separately has implications about the dependence conditional on w1 [[logicalor]] w2.  Let us now take the simplified form of P(x/wi) and work out what the decision rule will look like. First we define some variables  pi = Prob (xi = 1/w1)  qi = Prob (xi = 1/w2).  In words pi(qi) is the probability that if the document is relevant (non-relevant) that the ith index term will be present. The corresponding probabilities for absence are calculated by subtracting from 1, i.e. 1 - pi = Prob (xi = 0/w1). The likelihood functions which enter into D3 will now look as follows  To appreciate how these expressions work, the reader should check that P((0,1,1,0,0,1)/w1) = (1 - p1)p2p3(1 - p4)(1 - p5)p6. Substituting for P(x/wi) in D3 and taking logs, the decision rule will be transformed into a linear discriminant function.  where the constants ai, bi and e are obvious.  and  The importance of writing it this way, apart from its simplicity, is that for each document x to calculate g(x) we simply add the coefficients ci for those index terms that are present, i.e. for those ci for which xi = 1. The ci are often looked up as weights; Robertson and Sparck Jones[1] call ci a relevance weight, and Salton calls exp(ci) the term relevance. I shall simply refer to it as a coefficient or a weight. Hence the name weighting function for g(x).  The constant C which has been assumed the same for all documents x will of course vary from query to query, but it can be interpreted as the cut-off applied to the retrieval function. The only part that can be varied with respect to a given query is the cost function, and it is this variation which will allow us to retrieve more or less documents. To see this let us assume that l11 = l22 = 0 and that we have some choice in setting the ratio l21/l11 by picking a value for the relative importance we attach to missing a relevant document compared with retrieving a non-relevant one. In this way we can generate a ranking, each rank position corresponding to a different ratio l21/l12.  Let us now turn to the other part of g(x), namely ci and let us try and interpret it in terms of the conventional 'contingency' table.  There will be one such table for each index term; I have shown it for the index term i although the subscript i has not been used in the cells. If we have complete information about the relevant and non-relevant documents in the collection then we can estimate pi by r/R and qi by (n - r)/(N - R). Therefore g(x) can be rewritten as follows:  This is in fact the weighting formula F4 used by Robertson and Sparck Jones1 in their so called retrospective experiments. For later convenience let us set  There are a number of ways of looking at Ki. The most interesting interpretation of Ki is to say that it measures the extent to which the ith term can discriminate between the relevant and non-relevant documents.  Typically the 'weight' Ki(N,r,n,R) is estimated from a contingency table in which N is not the total number of documents in the system but instead is some subset specifically chosen to enable Ki to be estimated. Later I will use the above interpretation of Ki to motivate another function similar to Ki to measure the discrimination power of an index term.
