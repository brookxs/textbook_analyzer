Linkages are used to correlate related attributes associated with concepts discussed in an item. This process of creating term linkages at index creation time is called precoordination. When index terms are not coordinated at index time, the coordination occurs at search time. This is called postcoordination, that is coordinating terms after (post) the indexing process. Postcoordination is implemented by "AND"ing index terms together, which only finds indexes that have ail of the search terms.  Factors that must be determined in the linkage process are the number of terms that can be related, any ordering constraints on the linked terms, and any additional descriptors are associated with the index terms (Vickery-70). The range of the number of index terms that can be linked is not a significant implementation issue and primarily affects the design of the indexer's user interface. When multiple terms are being used, the possibility exists to have relationships between the terms. For example, the capability to link the source of a problem, the problem and who is affected by the problem may be desired. Each term must be caveated with one of these three categories along with linking the terms together into an instance of the relationships describing one semantic concept. The order of the terms is one technique for providing additional role descriptor information on the index terms. Use of the order of the index terms to implicitly define additional term descriptor information limits the number of index terms that can have a role descriptor. If order is not used, modifiers may be associated with each term linked to define its role. This technique allows any number of terms to have the associated role descriptor. Figure 3.2 shows the different types of linkages. It assumes that an item discusses the drilling of oil wells in Mexico by CITGO and the introduction of oil refineries in Peru by the U.S. When the linked capability is added, the system does not erroneously relate Peru and Mexico since they are not in the same set of linked items. It still does not have the ability to discriminate between which country is introducing oil refineries into the other country. Introducing roles in the last two examples of Figure 3.2 removes this ambiguity. Positional roles treat the data as a vector allowing only one value per position. Thus if the example is expanded so that the U.S. was introducing oil refineries in Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, then the positional role technique would require three entries, where the only difference would be in the value in the "affected country" position. When modifiers are used, only one entry would be required and all three countries would be listed with three "MODIFIERS.
