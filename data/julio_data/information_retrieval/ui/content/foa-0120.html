 6.2.3 Argument Relations  A central purpose of many documents is to persuade. Especially interesting, then, are relations among documents that reveal the arguments relating among the documents [Sitter and Maier, 1992]. The law provides several interesting examples, as shown in Figure 6.10 (taken from Rose, 1994, Figure 7.4). Rose enumerates four relations often found in legal documents, from simple reference to more elaborate logical relations such as exception.  While less explicit than within legal documents, educational materials also have implicit or explicit prerequisite relationships assumed by a text's author. Figure 6.11 shows dependencies among this book's chapters. In interdisciplinary papers, it is common to have several introductory sections, providing background for experts in one field who may not have the requisite background in another. When taken across many texts, such a prerequisite structure imposes a lattice, which can be exploited to help a reader/browsing user find just those components of the document that are most important to them. 206      FINDING OUT ABOUT  Link Type Example  contains, contained-in refers-to, referred-to-by subject-to, governs excepts, excepted-by despite, ignored-by (Chapter 1 contains ß101) "The works specified in ßß102 and 103..."
