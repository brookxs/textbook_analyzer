 13.8.1    Web Query Languages Up to this point, queries have been based on the content of each page. However, queries can also include the link structure connecting Web pages. For example, we would like to search for all the Web pages that contain at least one image and are reachable from a given site following at most three links. To be able to pose this type of query, different data models have been used. The most important are a labeled graph model to represent Web pages (nodes) and hyperlinks (edges) between Web pages, and a semi-structured data model to represent the content of Wreb pages. In the latter model, the data schema is not usually known, may change over time, may be large and descriptive, etc. [2, 129]. Although some models and languages for querying hypertext were proposed before the Web appeared [563, 72, 184], the first generation of Web query languages were aimed at combining content with structure (see also Chapter 4). These languages combine patterns that appear within the documents with graph queries describing link structure (using path regular expressions). They include W3QL [450], WebSQL [556, 33], WebLog [476], and WQL [511]. The second generation of languages, called Web data manipulation languages, maintain the emphasis on semi-structured data. However, they extend the previous languages by providing access to the structure of Web pages (the model also includes the internal structure) and by allowing the creation of new structures as a result of a query. Languages in this category include STRUQL [253], FLORID [373], and WebOQL [32]. All the languages mentioned are meant to be used by programs, not final users. Nevertheless, there are some examples of query interfaces for these languages. Web query languages have been extended to other Web tasks, such as extracting and integrating information from Web pages, and constructing and restructuring Web sites. More details about Web query languages can be found in the excellent survey by Florescu, Levy, and Mendelzon [258]. TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        393
