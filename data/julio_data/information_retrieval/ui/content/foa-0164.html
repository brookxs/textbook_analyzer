 7.7 Other Learning Applications and Issues  This chapter has focused primarily on applications of classification techniques that are among the most successful with machine learning. There are, however, a wide range of other ways that adaptive mechanisms have been incorporated within the FOA context [Bono, 1972]. For example, Gordon has applied genetic algorithm optimization to the construction of effective queries [Gordon, 1988]. The success of social collaborative filtering, where adaptation in response to the activities of one user is extrapolated to other users [Shardaanand and Miaes, 1995], promises to become an important part of the WWW industry (as recently demonstrated by Microsoft's purchase of Firefly, for example). Learning to extract structured, database-like relations from the vast WWW of unstructured documents is another important new direction [Howe and Dreilinger, 1997; Craven et al, 1998 ]. Here we mention several other ways that adaptation mechanisms can be exploited and some new problems arising from this dynamism.
