 6.2 Hypertext, Imtradociraient Links  Since the very first papyrus scrolls were used to capture written language, it has become natural to conceive of text as a single, linear, and continuous  Of course, the fact that one happens to be positive values and the other negative is completely circumstantial! 200      FINDING OUT ABOUT  thread, authored and then read as a single stream. But as books became longer, tables of contents were prepended, indices were appended, and the opportunities for traversing the text in fundamentally nonlinear ways became more common. We are becoming interested in other kinds of documents, many of which bring their own special structures and writing conventions, for example, the abstract paragraph, introductions, and conclusions of longer papers and the "methods" sections in scientific papers. In news reporting, spiral exposition is often used; a news item is summarized in the first paragraph, then treated in more detail in the paragraphs that fit on page 1 or "above the fold" of the newspaper, and in still more detail in the body of the article.  The attempt to analyze, support, and create such nonlinear hypertext relations among documents began long before the WWW made hypertext links commonplace; Vannevar Bush's "As We May Think"7 article (published in 1945!) [Bush, 1945] and Ted Nelson's revolutionary Xanadus project [Nelson, 1987] are often mentioned as seminal works. Mice and graphical interfaces made clicking on one textual passage, to jump to another, second nature. Hypertext conferences focusing on these new issues began in the mid-1980s and have taken on new energy as the HTTP protocols and HTML authoring languages made it easy to support many kinds of intra- and interdocument relations [Conklin, 1987; Conklin and Begman, 1988; Agosti et al., 1992; Agosti and Marchetti, 1992; Bruza and Weide, 1992; Egan et al., 1991]. In the process, many types of linkages between documents have been proposed. The following sections mention some of the most common and useful, sometimes using this FOA text (self-referentially!) as examples.
