 9.4 Summary  Text search techniques using text scanning have played an important role in the development of Information Retrieval Systems. In the 1970s and 1980s they were essential tools for compensating for the insufficient computer power and for handling some of the more difficult search capabilities such as imbedded character strings and fuzzy searches. They currently play an important role in word processor systems (e.g., the Find function) and in Information Retrieval Systems for locating offensive terms (e.g., imbedded character strings) in the dictionary. The need for specialized hardware text search units to directly search the data on secondary storage has diminished with the growth of processing power of computers.
