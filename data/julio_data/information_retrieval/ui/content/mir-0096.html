 5.6    Bibliographic Discussion Query expansion methods have been studied for a long time. While the success of expansion methods throughout the years has been debatable, more recently researchers have reached the consensus that query expansion is a useful and little explored (commercially) technique. Useful because its modern variants can be used to consistently improve the retrieval performance with general collections. Little explored because few commercial systems (and Web search engines) take advantage of it. Early work suggesting the expansion of a user query with closely related terms was done by Maron and Kuhns in 1960 [547]. The classic technique for combining query expansion with term reweighting in the vector model was studied by Rocchio in 1965 (using the Smart system [695] as a testbed) and published later on [678], Ide continued the studies of Rocchio and proposed variations to the term reweighting formula [391]. The probabilistic model was introduced by Robertson and Sparck Jones [677] in 1976. A thorough and entertaining discussion of this model can be found in the book by van Rijsbergen [785]. Croft and Harper [199] suggested that the initial search should use a distinct computation. In 1983, Croft [198] proposed to extend the probabilistic formula to include within-document frequencies and introduced the C and K parameters. Since the probabilistic model does not provide means of expanding the query, query expansion has to be done separately. In 1978, Harper and van Rijsbergen [345] used a term-term clustering technique based on a maximum spanning tree to select terms for probabilistic query expansion. Two years later, they also introduced a new relevance weighting scheme, called EMIM [344], to be used with their query expansion technique. In 1981, Wu and Salton [835] used relevance feedback to reweight terms (using a probabilistic formula) extracted from relevant documents and used these terms to expand the query. Empirical results showed improvements in retrieval performance. Our discussion on user relevance feedback for the vector and probabilistic models in section 5.2 is based on four sources: a nice paper by Salton and Buckley [696], the book by van Rijsbergen [785], the book by Salton and McGill [698], and two book chapters by Harman [340, 339]. Regarding automatic query expansion, Lesk [500] tried variations of term-term clustering in the Smart system without positive results. Following that, Sparck Jones and Barber [413] and Minker, Wilson and Zimmerman [562] also observed no improvements with query expansion based on term-term global clustering. These early research results left the impression that query expansion based on global analysis is not an effective technique. However, more recent results show that this is not the case. In fact, the research results obtained by Vorhees [793], by Crouch and Yang [200], and by Qiu and Prei [655] indicate that query expansion based on global analysis can consistently yield improved retrieval performance. Our discussion on query expansion through local clustering is based on early work by Attar and Fraenkel [35] from 1977.   The idea of local context BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        139 analysis is much more recent and was introduced by Xu and Croft [838] in 1996. The discussion on query expansion using a global similarity thesaurus is based on the work by Qiu and Prei [655]. Finally, the discussion on query expansion using a global statistical thesaurus is based on the work of Crouch and Yang [200] which is influenced by the term discrimination value theory introduced by Salton, Yang, and Yu [699] early in 1975. Since query expansion frequently is based on some form of clustering, our discussion covered a few clustering algorithms. However, our aim was not to provide a thorough review of clustering algorithms for information retrieval. Such a review can be found in the work of Rasmussen [668].
