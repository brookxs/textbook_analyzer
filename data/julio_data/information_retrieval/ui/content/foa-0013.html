 1.4.3 Document Proxies  Do you remember the library's original card catalogs, those wooden, beautifully constructed cabinets full of rows and rows of drawers, each full of carefully typed index cards? The card catalog contained proxies abridged representations of documents, acting as their surrogate - for the books it indexed. No one expected the full text of the books to actually be found in the drawers.  Computerized card catalogs are only capable of supporting a similar function. They do allow more extensive indexing and efficient retrieval, from terminals that might be accessed far from the library building. At the heart of this system is a text search engine capable of matching features of a query against book titles J Just like with the original index cards, however, retrieval is limited to some proxy of the indexed work, a bibliographic citation, or perhaps even an abstract. The text of ultimate interest - in a book, magazine, or journal - remains physically quite distinct from the search engine used to find it.  As computer storage capacities and network communication rates have exploded, it has become increasingly common to find retrieval systems capable of presenting the full text of retrieved items. In the modern context, proxies extend beyond the bibliographic citation information and subject headings we associate with card catalogs and include a OVERVIEW       21  document's title, an article's abstract, a judicial opinion's headnote, or a book's table of contents.  The distinction between the search engine retrieving documents and retrieving proxies remains important, however, for at least two reasons. First, the radically changing technical capabilities of libraries (and computers and networks more generally) can create conceptual confusion about just what the search engine is doing. While it has been possible for a decade or more to get the full text of published journal articles through commercial systems such as DIALOG and Lexis/Nexis, free access to these through your public library would have been almost unheard of until quite recently. In fact, most libraries did not even try to index individual articles in their periodical collections. Changing technical capacities, changes in the application of intellectual property laws, changes in the library's role, and resulting changes in the publishing industry are radically altering the traditional balance. Even when all new publications are easily available electronically, the issue of retrospectively capturing previously published books and journals remains unresolved.  Looking far into the future and assuming no technical, economic, or legal barriers to a complete rendering of any document in our corpus, there is still an important reason to consider document proxies. Recall that FOA is a process we are attempting to support and that retrieving sets of documents to show users is a step we expect to repeat many times. Proxies are abridged versions of the documents that are easier for browsing users to quickly scan and react to (i.e., provide relevance feedback) than if they had to read the entire document. If a document's title is accurate (if its abstract is well written, if its bibliographic citation is complete), this proxy may provide enough information for users to decide if it seems relevant J
