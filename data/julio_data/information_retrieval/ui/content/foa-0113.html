 6.1.2 Time Scale  Obviously bibliographic references can only go back in time, but just how far back in time a citing author reaches also tells us something. For typical journal publications, the typical time scale of references is on the order of years. A large fraction of this time has been, to date, sensitive to the production schedules of scientific journals. As the time between publication of an author's words and a reader's browsing has shrunk (e.g., in fields like physics, where the Los Alamos preprints Server4 has become a dominant mechanism of dissemination), much of the time difference is now due exclusively to delays associated with peer review, revision, etc. This delay between the time an author is finished with a document and when it reaches its public obviously provides a lower bound for citation lag, the time between a document's publication date and its reference by another paper's bibliography.  But independent of production schedules, there are wide varieties in how far back citations typically reach. Price sees a deep connection between the social processes underlying various scientific disciplines. First, he distinguishes between two gross types of citation, normal aging and the immediacy effect: "a special hyperactivity of the rather recent literature" [Price, 1986, p. 164]. He also defined Price's index to be the fraction of documents published that are cited within five years.  Price then uses the width of the interval to distinguish between "hard" and "soft" sciences, even "nonsciences," all based on the width of the research front within which most citations are typically made. He sees his Price's index as "corresponding very well with what we intuit as hard science, soft science and non-science as we descend the scale" (p. 168). Using biological metaphors, with different disciplines compared to different kinds of organisms:  ... pathological cases apart, it would seem that the [Price] index provides a good diagnostic for the extent to which a subject  4 xxx.lanl.gov/ciiipJlg/ INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      191  is attempting, so to speak, to grow from the skin rather than from the body. With a low index one has a humanistic type of metabolism which the scholar has to digest all that has gone before, let it mature gently in the cellar of his wisdom, and then distill forth new words of wisdom about the same sorts of questions. In hard science the positiveness of the knowledge and its short term permanence enable one to move through the packed down past while still a student and then to emerge at the research front where interaction with one's peers is as important as the store-house of conventional wisdom. The thinner the skin of science the more orderly and crystalline the growth and the more rapid the process, (pp. 177-8)  Price also infers prescriptions from these statistics for editors of journals who are in a controlling position to influence a field:  I regard the value of this work as being not only diagnostic, but also prescriptive, so let us look in closing at what suggestions it makes for the technology of scientific information. At the personal level of the scientific writer and the editor and publisher of journals, it tells that one might well be as careful about references as we are about titles, authorships, and proper presentation of  data___For a research paper it should be exceptional to allow  an author to eschew interaction with colleagues by citing too few references, and if he cited too many, perhaps he is writing a review paper rather than a research contribution. Similarly, if you want to make the field firm and tight and hard and crystalline you have to play with your peers and keep on the ball by citing their recent work. (p. 178)
