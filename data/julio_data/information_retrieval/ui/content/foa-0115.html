 6.1.4 Citations and Arguments  Expository documents are arguments: attempts to convince an audience that some set of propositions are true.

Perhaps the most structured kinds of documents are mathematical papers. Mathematical arguments typically depend on, indeed are defined by, theorem proving, which connects new propositions to previously established results. Even in the case of mathematical papers, however, it is interesting to observe the crucial role natural language text continues to play in providing a context for formal theoretical results. Readers can be persuaded that assumptions are reasonable, that mathematical definitions capture intuitive relationships, etc. Citations in a mathematical paper typically point to papers containing theorems that were used as part of the current proof.  In a scientific paper, the form of the argument often has to do with the discipline. There is often data to present, methodology to describe, and so on. Many of the citations are typically gathered in a section relating the current piece of work to prior literature. This prior literature may be referenced for at least two, very different, purposes. Most typically the prior work is used much as theorems in mathematical papers: to establish a result from which the current work proceeds. The current author points to the work of a prior author as providing validation for a proposition they both believe to be true. Another potential reason for citation is the opposite. In this case, the current author is interested in debating a position put forward by the cited work.  This polarity, reflecting whether the cited work and its conclusions are positively or negatively correlated with those in the citing work, will be termed the polarity of the citation. Here legal documents provide a good example for what might be possible in scientific writing. Every INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      195  law student learns proper legal syntax for codifying references as they learn to write legal briefs, the structured memos provided to judges that are often incorporated into the ultimate opinion [Harvard Law Review Association, 1995]. One feature of legal briefs is the special syntax used to refer to statutory law (e.g., 17 U.S.C 101 refers to a section of the U.S. Code) or case law (e.g., West Pub. Co. v. Mead Data Cent., Inc., 616 RSupp 1571) in a conventional fashion. A more interesting aspect of legal brief style is the explicit syntactic marking of the relation of the cited case to the argument being made in the brief: Reference to a supporting legal precedent is marked by cf., while potentially antagonistic arguments are marked with but cf.!  Note the importance of the syntactic localization of both the source and destination of a citation pointer to the two documents' semantic purposes. Localization helps to anchor the author's purpose in using the citation to the document's larger argument. Most papers make many points and attempt to establish a number of propositions. The ability to point to particular conclusions within the cited paper is therefore important. The citing paper's argument structure is simultaneously being extended, and so reference to a prior argument at a particular location in the current argument can be more persuasive than if all cites aren't localized.    ?35 4,  One reason citation has been less exploited in FOA applications than it might otherwise be is due to the expense of obtaining this data. In the context of the WWW, however, it turns out that the indices built by Web crawlers can be quite easily extended to capture information on cited pages, which can be easily inverted to maintain information on citing pages as well (cf. Section 8.1).
