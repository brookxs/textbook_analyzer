 10.4    Starting Points Search interfaces must provide users with good ways to get started. An empty screen or a blank entry form does not provide clues to help a user decide how to start the search process. Users usually do not begin by creating a long, detailed expression of their information need. Studies show that users tend to start out with very short queries, inspect the results, and then modify those queries in an incremental feedback cycle [22]. The initial query can be seen as a kind of 'testing the water' to see what kinds of results are returned and get an idea of how to reformulate the query [804, 65]. Thus, one task of an information access interface is to help users select the sources and collections to search on. For example, there are many different information sources associated with cancer, and there are many different kinds of information a user might like to know about cancer. Guiding the user to the right set of starting points can help with the initial problem formulation. Traditional bibliographic search assumes that the user begins by looking through a list of names of sources and choosing which collections to search on, while Web search engines obliterate the distinctions between sources and plunge the user into the middle of a Web site with little information about the relationship of the search hit to the rest of the collection. In neither case is the interface to the available sources particularly helpful. In this section we will discuss four main types of starting points: lists, overviews, examples, and automated source selection.
