 1.3.3  Document Database Search  The Document Database Search Process (see Figure 1.4) provides the capability for a query to search against all items received by the system. The Document Database Search process is composed of the search process, user entered queries (typically ad hoc queries) and the document database which contains all items that have been received, processed and stored by the system. It is the retrospective search source for the system. If the user is on-line, the Selective Dissemination of Information system delivers to the user items of interest as soon as they are processed into the system. Any search for information that has already been processed into the system can be considered a "retrospective" search for information. This does not preclude the search to have search statements constraining it to items received in the last few hours. But typically the searches span far greater time periods. Each query is processed against the total document database. Queries differ from profiles in that they are typically short and focused on a specific area of interest. The Document Database can be very large, hundreds of millions of items or more. Typically items in the Document Database do not change (i.e., are not edited) once received. The value of much information quickly decreases over time. These facts are often used to partition the database by time and allow for archiving by the time partitions. Some user interfaces force the user to indicate searches against items received older than a specified time, making use of the partitions of the Document database. The documents in the Mail files are also in the document database, since they logically are input to both processes.
