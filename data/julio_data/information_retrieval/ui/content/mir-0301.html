 15.5.1    International Range of Efforts digital library efforts, accessible over the Internet, can now lead to worldwide access. Since each nation wishes to share the highlights of its history, culture, and accomplishments with the rest of the world, developing a digital library can be very helpful [86]. Indeed, we see many nations with active digital library programs [270], and there are many others underway or emerging. One of the largest efforts is the European ERCIM program [239], This is enhanced by the large eLib initiative in the UK [778]. There are good results from activities in New Zealand [601] and Australia [389]. In Singapore, billions are being invested in developing networked connectivity and digital libraries as part of educational innovation programs [729]. For information on other nations, see the online table pointing to various national projects associated with a recent special issue on this topic [270], As mentioned briefly above, many nations around the world have priceless antiquities that can be more widely appreciated through digital librarys [300]. Whether in pilot mode or as a commercial product, IBM Digital Library [390], with its emphasis on rights management, has been designed and used to help in this regard. These projects all require multimedia and multilingual support, as discussed earlier. Different scenarios of use are appropriate in different cultures, and different structures and spaces are needed for various types of collections. Indeed, many international collections aim for global coverage, but with other criteria defining their focus. Thus, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (Ndigital libraryTD) [594] is open to all universities, as well as other supporting organizations, with the aim of providing increased access to scholarly 428        DIGITAL LIBRARIES resources as a direct result of improving the skills and education of graduate students, who directly submit their works to the digital library.
