 13.7.2    Some Examples Now we give a couple of search examples. One problem with full-text retrieval is that although many queries can be effective, many others are a total deception. The main reason is that a set of words does not capture all the semantics of a document. There is too much contextual information (that can be explicit or even implicit) lost at indexing time, which is essential for proper understanding. For example, suppose that we want to learn an oriental game such as Shogi or Go. For the first case, searching for Shogi will quickly give us good Web pages where we can find what Shogi is (a variant of chess) and its rules. However, for Go the task is complicated, because unlike Shogi, Go is not a unique word in English (in particular, because uppercase letters are converted to lowercase letters, see Chapter 7). The problem of having more than one meaning for a word is called polysem,y. We can add more terms to the query, such as game and Japanese but still we are out of luck, as the pages found are almost all about Japanese games written in English where the common verb go is used. Another common problem comes from synonyms. If we are searching for a certain word, but a relevant page uses a synonym, we will not find it. The following example (taken from [152]) better explains the polysemy problem, where the ambiguity comes from the same language. Suppose that we want to find the running speed of the jaguar, a big South American cat. A first naive search in AltaVista would be jaguar speed. The results are pages that talk about the Jaguar car, an Atari video game, a US football team, a local network server, etc. The first page about the animal is ranked 183 and is a fable, without information about the speed. In a second try, we add the term cat. The answers are about the Clans Nova Cat and Smoke Jaguar, LMG Enterprises, fine cars, etc.    Only the page ranked FINDING THE NEEdigital libraryE IN THE HAYSTACK        391 25 has some information on jaguars but not the speed. Suppose we try Yahoo!. We look at 'Science:Biology:Zoology:Animals:Cats:Wild_Cats' and 'Science: Biology :Animal_Beliavior.' No information about jaguars there.
