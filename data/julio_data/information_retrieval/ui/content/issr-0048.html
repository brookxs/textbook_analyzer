Each data structure has a set of associated capabilities that provide an insight into the objectives of the implementers by its selection. From an Information Retrieval System perspective, the two aspects of a data structure that are important are its ability to represent concepts and their relationships and how well it supports location of those concepts. This chapter discusses the major logical data structures that are used in information retrieval systems. The implementation of a data structure (e.g., as an object, linked list, array, hashed file) is discussed only as an example. A description of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) is included in Section 8. HMMs are starting to be used as a new approach for searching for information.
