 12.4.2    Feature Extraction and Lower-bounding Having decided on the Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure, the next step is to find some features that can lower-bound it. We would like a set of features that first, preserve/lower-bound the distance, and second, carry much information about the corresponding time series (so that the false alarms are few). The second requirement suggests that we use 'good' features, that have much discriminatory power. In the stock price example, a 'bad' feature would be, e.g., the first day's value: the reason being that two stocks might have similar first-day values, yet they may differ significantly from then on. Conversely, two otherwise similar sequences may agree everywhere, except for the first day's values. At the other extreme, we could use the values of all 365 days as features. However, although this would perfectly match the actual distance, it would lead to the 'dimensionality curse' problem. Clearly, we need some better features. Applying the second step of the GEMINI algorithm, we ask the feature-extracting question: 'If we are allowed to use only one feature from each sequence, what would this feature be?' A natural answer is the average. By the same token, additional features could be the average of the first half, of the second half, of the first quarter, etc. Or, in a more systematic way, we could use the coefficients of the Fourier transform, and, for our case, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). For a signal x = [xl], i = 0,..., n -~ 1, let Xp denote the n-point DFT coefficient at the F-th frequency ) The third step of the GEMINI methodology is to show that the distance in feature space lower-bounds the actual distance. The solution is provided by ParsevaFs theorem, which states that the DFT preserves the energy of a signal, as well as the distances between two signals: )                                                                     (12.4) 354        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING where X and Y are Fourier transforms of x and y respectively. Thus, if we keep the first /(/ lt; n) coefficients of the DFT as the features, we lower-bound the actual distance: £ \XF - YF\2 F=0 F=0 n-1 i=0 and finally Vfeature^), ?($))    lt;   VV)                                        (12-5) because we ignore positive terms from equation 12.2. Thus, there will be no false dismissals, according to lemma 12.1. Notice that the GEMINI approach can be applied with any orthonormal transform, such as, the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), the wavelet transform etc., because they all preserve the distance between the original and the transformed space. In fact, our response time will improve with the ability of the transform to concentrate the energy: the fewer the coefficients that contain most of the energy, the more accurate our estimate for the actual distance, the fewer the false alarms, and the faster our response time. Thus, the performance results presented next are just pessimistic bounds; better transforms will achieve even better response times. In addition to being readily available, (e.g., in 'Mathematical bS,' 'maple,1 inatlab' etc.), the DFT concentrates the energy in the first few coefficients, for a large class of signals, the colored noises. These signals have a skewed energy spectrum (O(F~~b), as follows: ï  For 6 = 2, we have the so-called random walks or brown noise, which model successfully stock movements and exchange rates (e.g., [541]). ï  With even more skewed spectrum (b gt; 2), we have the black noises [712]. Such signals model successfully, for example, the water level of rivers and the rainfall patterns as they vary over time [541]. ï  With 6 = 1, we have the pink noise.   BirkhofFs theory [712] claims that interesting' signals, such as musical scores and other works of art, consist of pink noise, whose energy spectrum follows OIF"1). The argument of the theory is that white noise with O(F∞) energy spectrum is completely unpredictable, while brown noise with O(F~2) energy spectrum is too predictable and therefore "boring." The energy spectrum of pink noise lies in between.

As an illustration of the above observations, Figure 12.4(a) plots the movement of the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the US dollar starting 7 August 1990 (3000 measurements); Figure 12.4(b) shows the amplitude of the Fourier coefficients as a function of the frequency F, as well as the 1/F line, in a logarithmic-logarithmic plot. Notice that, since it is successfully modeled as a random walk, the amplitude of the Fourier coefficients follow the 1/F line. The above data set is available through anonymous ftp from sfi.santafe.edu. In addition to ID signals (stock price movements and exchange rates), it is believed that several families of real n-D signals belong to the family of 'colored noises', with skewed spectrum. For example, 2D signals, like photographs, are far from white noise, exhibiting a few strong coefficients in the lower spatial frequencies. The JPEG image compression standard exploits this phenomenon, effectively ignoring the high frequency components of the discrete cosine transform, which is closely related to the Fourier transform. If the image consisted of white noise, no compression would be possible at all.
