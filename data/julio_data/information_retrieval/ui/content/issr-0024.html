 2.2        Browse Capabilities  Once the search is complete, Browse capabilities provide the user with the capability to determine which items are of interest and select those to be displayed. There are two ways of displaying a summary of the items that are associated with a query: line item status and data visualization. From these summary displays, the user can select the specific items and zones within the items for display. The system also allows for easy transitioning between the summary displays and review of specific items. If searches resulted in high precision, then the importance of the browse capabilities would be lessened. Since searches return many items that are not relevant to the user's information need, browse capabilities can assist the user in focusing on items that have the highest likelihood in meeting his need.
