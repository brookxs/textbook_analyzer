 2.11    Trends and Research issues There are three main types of products and systems which can benefit directly from research in models for information retrieval: library systems, specialized retrieval systems, and the Web. Regarding library systems, there is currently much interest in cognitive and behavioral issues oriented particularly at a better understanding of which criteria the users adopt to judge relevance. Prom the point of view of the computer scientist, a main question is how this knowledge about the user affects the ranking strategies and the user interface implemented by the system. A related issue is the investigation of how models other than the Boolean model (which is still largely adopted by most large commercial library systems) affect the user of a library. A specialized retrieval system is one which is developed with a particular application in mind. For instance, the LEXIS-NEXIS retrieval system (see Chapter 14), which provides access to a very large collection of legal and business documents, is a good example of a specialized retrieval system. In such a system, a key problem is how to retrieve (almost) all documents which might be relevant to the user information need without also retrieving a large number of unrelated documents. In this context, sophisticated ranking algorithms are highly desirable. Since ranking based on single evidential sources is unlikely to provide the appropriate answers, research on approaches for combining several evidential sources seems highly relevant (as demonstrated at the various TREC conferences, see Chapter 3 for details). In the Web, the scenario is quite distinct and unique. In fact, the user of the Web frequently does not know what he wants or has great difficulty in properly formulating his request. Thus, research in advanced user interfaces is highly desirable. From the point of view of the ranking engine, an interesting problem is to study how the paradigm adopted for the user interface affects the ranking. Furthermore, it is now well established that the indexes maintained by the various Web search engines are almost disjoint (e.g., the ten most popular search engines have indexes whose intersection corresponds to less than 2% of the total number of pages indexed). In this scenario, research on meta-search engines (i.e., engines which work by fusing the rankings generated by other search engines) seems highly promising.
