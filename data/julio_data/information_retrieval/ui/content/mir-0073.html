 4.2.4    Natural Language Pushing the fuzzy Boolean model even further, the distinction between AND and OR can be completely blurred, so that a query becomes simply an enumeration of words and context queries. All the documents matching a portion of the user query are retrieved. Higher ranking is assigned to those documents matching more parts of the query. The negation can be handled by letting the user express t  Notice that the same problem arises in the relational calculus, which is shown similar to the relational algebra only when "unsafe' expressions are avoided.   Unsafe expressions are those that make direct or indirect reference to a universe of elements, as NOT does. 104        QUERY LANGUAGES that some words are not desired, so that the documents containing them are penalized in the ranking computation. A threshold may be selected so that the documents with very low weights are not retrieved. Under this scheme we have completely eliminated any reference to Boolean operations and entered into the field of natural language queries. In fact, one can consider that Boolean queries are a simplified abstraction of natural language queries. A number of new issues arise once this model is used, especially those related to the proper way to rank an element with respect to a query. The search criterion can be re-expressed using a different model, where documents and queries are considered just as a vector of 'term weights' (with one coordinate per interesting keyword or even per existing text word) and queries are considered in exactly the same way (context queries are not considered in this case). Therefore, the query is now internally converted into a vector of term weights and the aim is to retrieve all the vectors (documents) which are close to the query (where closeness has to be defined in the model). This allows many interesting possibilities, for instance a complete document can be used as a query (since it is also a vector), which naturally leads to the use of relevance feedback techniques (i.e., the user can select a document from the result and submit it as a new query to retrieve documents similar to the selected one). The algorithms for this model are totally different from those based on searching patterns (it is even possible that not every text word needs to be searched but only a small set of hopefully representative keywords extracted from each document). Natural language querying is also covered in Chapter 14.
