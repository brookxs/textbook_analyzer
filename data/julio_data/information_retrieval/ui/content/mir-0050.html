 2.10    Models for Browsing As already observed, the user might not be interested in posing a specific query to the system. Instead, he might be willing to invest some time in exploring the document space looking for interesting references.

However, in general, the goal of a searching task is clearer in the mind of the user than the goal of a browsing task. As is obvious, this is not a distinction which is valid in all scenarios.

We distinguish three types of browsing namely, flat, structure guided, and hypertext.
