 10.5 Video Retrieval  The ability to support content based access to video promises access to video mail (Jones et al., 1997), video taped meetings (Kubala et al. 1999), surveillance video, and broadcast television.  For example, Maybury, Merlino, and 250  Chapter 10  Morey (1997) report on the ability to create "personalcasts" from news broadcasts via the Broadcast News Navigator (BNN) system. BNN is a web-based tool that automatically captures, annotates, segments, summarizes and visualizes stones from broadcast news video. What QBIC is to static stock imagery, BNN is to broadcast news video. BNN integrates text, speech, and image processing technologies to perform multistream analysis of video to support content-based search and retrieval. BNN addresses the problem of time-consuming, manual video acquisition/annotation techniques that frequently result in inconsistent, error-full or incomplete video catalogues.  Figure 10.5 illustrates BNN's video query page. From this web page, the user can select to search among thirty national or local news sources, specify an absolute or relative date range, search closed captions or speech transcriptions, run a pre-specified profile, search on text keywords, or search on concepts that express topics or so-called named entities such as people, organizations, and locations. In Figure 10.5a the user has selected to search all news video sources for a 2 week period (27 February to 12 March, 2000) using free text as well as person and location tags. As displayed in Figure 10.5b, BNN automatically generates a custom query web page which includes menus of people and location names from content extracted over the relevant time period to ease query formulation by the user. In Figure 10.5b, the user has selected "George Bush" and "George W. Bush" from the people menu, "New York" and "New York City" from the location menu, and the key words "presidential primary". Because BNN incorporates the Alembic natural language                      information                       extraction                       system  (www.mitre.org/resources/centers/it/g063/nl-index.htmn the retrieved results include only stories that contain the person "Bush" as opposed to stories about brush or shrub and the state or city "New York".

Detailed Content-based Query Figure 10.5. Broadcast News Navigator Query by Content  Figure 10.6 illustrates the kind of results BNN returns. Figures 6a and 6b display a "story skim" in which a keyframe together with the three most frequently occurring named entities are displayed for each relevant story. Figure 10.6a shows skims of those stories related to "Bush" whereas 6b shows "Gore" stories. When the user selects the first 5 March story (2nd row, far right) in Figure 10.6b, the display shown in Figure 10.6c is generated. In Figure 10.6c, when the user selects the closed caption button next to this story, the closed caption/transcribed text displays as shown detailing the number of delegates each candidate has won to date. In this manner the user can directly access dozens of news stations with a single query and can rapidly perform detailed and comparative analyses.  In addition to this direct access method, BNN also supports simple browsing of stories during particular time intervals or from particular sources. A useful facility in this regard is the ability to display a graph of named entity frequency over time. In addition, the user can automatically data mine the named entities in the analyzed stories using the "search for correlations" link shown on the left panel in Figure 3 0.6.  To evaluate the effectiveness of BNN, Merlino and Maybury (1999) report an empirical study of the optimal presentation of multimedia summaries of broadcast news with the belief that different mixes can improve user precision, recall, timeliness, and perceived quality of interaction. In that study, the authors empirically investigated the most effective presentations for both retrieval (i.e., finding relevant documents) and comprehension (i.e., answer a question) using twenty users who 252  Chapter 10  Figure 10.6a: "George Bush" Stories  Figure 10.6b.

The authors found that using BNN users could improve their retrieval performance by looking at only the 3 most frequent named entities (i.e., people, organizations, and locations) in the story (as in Figure 10.6b) rather than looking at the story details (as in Figure 10.6c). BNN enabled users to find video content about six times as fast as they could if searching with simple keywords. A key reason for this enhanced performance is BBN's automated segmentation of news programs into individual stories using cross media cues such as visual changes, speaker changes, and topic changes. Evaluation revealed the importance of quality source material and the need to enhance the selection of keyframes.  The topic detection and tracking initiative (TDT) for broadcast news and newswire sources (Wayne 1998) aims to explore algorithms that perform story segmentation (detection of story boundaries), topic tracking (detection of stories that discuss a topic, for each given target topic) and topic detection (detection of stories that discuss an arbitrary topic, for all topics). Whereas BNN focuses on story segmentation, subsequent research on the Geospatial News on Demand Environment (GeoNODE) addresses topic detection and tracking. GeoNODE (Hyland et al. 1999) presents news in a geospatial and temporal context. An analyst cam navigate the information space through indexed access into multiple types of information sources ´ from broadcast video, on-line newspapers, to specialist 254  Chapter 10  archives. GeoNODE incorporates information extraction, data mining/correlation and visualization components. Figure 10.7 illustrates the ability of GeoNODE to automatically nominate and animate topics from sources such as North American broadcast news and a Spanish web newspaper thereby directing analysis to the relevant documents having the right topic, the right time, and the right place. Figure  10.7  displays the GeoNODE time line of stories relevant to a given query across primary sources such as major CNN and MS-NBC programs. In contrast, Figure  10.8  cartographically encodes frequencies of documents that mention a location using color coded countries (higher color saturation of a country means more mentions) and yellow circles plotted on specific locations (the more documents that mention that location the larger the circle). For example, in the map in Figure 10.8 in the zoomed in portion on the left, North and South America are dark brown indicating high reporting frequency across sources whereas Africa has fewer reports and thus lighter color. Concentrations of larger yellow circles are situated in major cities in North and South America (e.g. note that large circles appear in most South American country capitals).    This enables the user to retrieve documents with specific geospatial mentions directly.   In preliminary evaluations with a corpus of 65,000 documents with 100 manually identified topics (covering 6941  of the documents), GeoNODE identified over 80% of the human defined topics and detected 83% of stories within topics with a misclassification error of .2%, results comparable to TDT initiative results.       .1..  i.i.

Progress will depend upon the establishment of multimedia corpora, common evaluation tasks, and machine learning strategies to create high performance extraction and analysis systems.
