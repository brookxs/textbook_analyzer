 10.6.2    Query Term Hits Within Document Content In systems in which the user can view the full text of a retrieved document, it is often useful to highlight the occurrences of the terms or descriptors that match those of the user's query. It can also be useful for the system to scroll the view of the document to the first passage that contains one or more of the query terms, and highlight the matched terms in a contrasting color or reverse video. This display is thought to help draw the user's attention to the parts of the document most likely to be relevant to the query. Highlighting of query terms lias been found time and again to be a useful feature for information access interfaces [481], [542, p.31]. Color highlighting has also recently been found to be useful for scanning lists of bibliographic records [52]. 290        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Jjfc yi#i^!http//w mm   tuiuimm    help    feebmok.

KWIC A facility related to highlighting is the key word-in-context (KWIC) document surrogate. Sentence fragments, full sentences, or groups of sentences that contain query terms are extracted from the full text and presented for viewing along with other kinds of surrogate information (such as document title and abstract). Note that a KWIC listing is different than an abstract. An abstract summarizes the main topics of the document but might not contain references to the terms within the query. A KWIC extract shows sentences that summarize the ways the query terms are used within the document. This display can show not only which subsets of query terms occur in the retrieved documents, but also the context they appeal in with respect to one another. Tradeoff decisions must be made between how many lines of text to show and which lines to display, It is not known which contexts are best selected for viewing but results from text summarization research suggest that the best fragments to show art8 those that appear near the beginning of the document and that routaiu the largest subset of query terms [464]. If users have specified which CONTEXT        291 terms are more important than others, then those fragments containing important terms should be shown before those that contain only less important terms. However, to help retain coherence of the excerpts, selected sentences should be shown in order of their occurrence in the original document, independent of how many search terms they contain. The KWIC facility is usually not shown in Web search result display, most likely because the system must have a copy of the original document available from which to extract the sentences containing the search terms. Web search engines typically only retain the index without term position information. Systems that index individual Web sites can show KWIC information in the document list display. TileBars A more compact form of query term hit display is made available through the TileBars interface. The user enters a query in a faceted format, with one topic per line. After the system retrieves documents (using a quorum or statistical ranking algorithm), a graphical bar is displayed next to the title of each document showing the degree of match for each facet. TileBars thus illustrate at a glance which passages in each article contain which topics - and moreover, how frequently each topic is mentioned (darker squares represent more frequent matches). Each document is represented by a rectangular bar. Figure 10.15 shows an example. The bar is subdivided into rows that correspond to the query facets. The top row of each TileBar corresponds to 'osteoporosis/ the second row to 'prevention,' and the third row to 'research.1 The bar is also subdivided into columns, where each column refers to a passage within the document. Hits that overlap within the same passage are more likely to indicate a relevant document than hits that are widely dispersed throughout the document [356]. The patterns are meant to indicate whether terms from a facet occur as a main topic throughout the document, as a subtopic, or are just mentioned in passing. The darkness of each square corresponds to the number of times the query occurs in that segment of text; the darker the square the greater the number of hits. White indicates no hits on the query term. Thus, the user can quickly see if some subset of the terms overlap in the same segment of the document. (The segments for this version of the interface are fixed blocks of 100 tokens each.) The first document can be seen to have considerable overlap among the topics of interest towards the middle, but not at the beginning or the end (the actual end is cut off). Thus it most likely discusses topics in addition to research into osteoporosis. The second through fourth documents, which are considerably shorter, also have overlap among all terms of interest, and so are also probably of interest to the user. (The titles help to verify this.) The next three documents are all long, and from the TileBars we can tell they discuss research and prevention, but do not even touch on osteoporosis, and so probably are not of interest. Because the TileBars interface-* allows the user to specify the query in terms 292        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION User Query {Enter wtttds for different topk	son different Unas.)

When the user displays a document with query term hits, the user can quickly ascertain what proportion of search topics appear in a passage based only on how many different highlight colors are visible. Most systems that use highlighting use only a single color to bring attention to all of the search terms. It would be difficult for users to specify in advance which patterns of term hits they are interested in. Instead, TileBars allows users to scan graphic representations and recognize which documents are and are not of interest. It may be the case that TileBars may be most useful for helping users discard mislead-ingly interesting documents, but only preliminary studies have been conducted to date. Passages can correspond to paragraphs or sections, fixed sized units of arbitrary length, or to automatically determined multiparagraph segments [355]. SeeSoft The SeeSoft visualization [232] represents text in a manner resembling columns of newspaper text, with one line' of text on each horizontal line of the strip. (See Figure 10.16.) The representation is compact and aesthetically pleasing. Graphics are used to abstract away the details, providing an overview showing the amount and shape of the text. Color highlighting is used to pick out various attributes, such as where a particular word appears in the text. Details of a smaller portion of the display can be viewed via a pop-up window; the overview CONTEXT        293 shows more of the text but in less detail. Figure 10.16 An example of the SeeSoft visualization for showing locations of characters within a text [232]. SeeSoft was originally designed for software development, in which a line of text is a meaningful unit of information. (Programmers tend to place each individual programming statement on one line of text.) Thus SeeSoft shows attributes relevant to the programming domain, such as which lines of code were modified by which programmer, and how often particular lines have been modified, and how many days have elapsed since the lines were last modified. The SeeSoft developers then experimented with applying this idea to the display of text, although this has not been integrated into an information access system. Color highlighting is used to show which characters appear where in a book of fiction, and which passages of the Bible contain references to particular people and items. Note the use of the abstraction of an entire line to stand for a single word such as a character's name (even though though this might obscure a tightly interwoven conversation between two characters).
