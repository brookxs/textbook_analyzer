 8.5.6    Practical Comparison Figure 8.20 shows a practical comparison between string matching algorithms run on our reference machine. The values are correct within b% of accuracy with a 9f/4 confidence interval. We tested English text from the TREC collection, DNA (corresponding to Ii.iiiflueiizae*) and random text uniformly generated over 64 letters. The patterns were randomly selected from the text except for random PATTERN MATCHING        215 text, where they were randomly generated. We tested over 10 Mb of text and measured CPU time. We tested short patterns on English and random text and long patterns on DNA, which are the typical cases. We first analyze the case of random text, where except for very short patterns the clear winners are BNDM (the bit-parallel implementation of BDM) and the BMS (Sunday) algorithm. The more classical Boyer-Moore and BDM algorithms are also very close. Among the algorithms that do not improve with the pattern length, Shift-Or is the fastest, and KMP is much slower than the naive algorithm. The picture is similar for English text, except that we have included the Agrep software in this comparison, which worked well only on English text. Agrep turns out to be much faster than others. This is not because of using a special algorithm (it uses a BM-family algorithm) but because the code is carefully optimized. This shows the importance of careful coding as well as using good algorithms, especially in text searching where a few operations per text character are performed. Longer patterns are shown for a DNA text. BNDM is the fastest for moderate patterns, but since it does not improve with the length after m gt; w, the classical BDM finally obtains better times. They are much better than the Boyer-Moore family because the alphabet is small and the suffix automaton technique makes better use of the information on the pattern. We have not shown the case of extended patterns, that is, where flexibility plays a role. For this case, BNDM is normally the fastest when it can be applied (e.g., it supports classes of characters but not wild cards), otherwise Shift-Or is the best option. Shift-Or is also the best option when the text must be accessed sequentially and it is not possible to skip characters.
