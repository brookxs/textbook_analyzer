 Precision and recall, and others  We now leave the speculations about relevance and return to the promised detailed discussion of the measurement of effectiveness. Relevance will once again be assumed to have its broader meaning of 'aboutness' and 'appropriateness', that is, a document is ultimately determined to be relevant or not by the user. Effectiveness is purely a measure of the ability of the system to satisfy the user in terms of the relevance of documents retrieved. Initially, I shall concentrate on measuring effectiveness by precision and recall; a similar analysis could be given for any pair of equivalent measures.  It is helpful at this point to introduce the famous 'contingency' table which is not really a contingency table at all.  A large number of measures of effectiveness can be derived from this table. To list but a few:  ( | . | is the counting measure)  There is a functional relationship between all three involving a parameter called generality (G) which is a measure of the density of relevant documents in the collection. The relationship is:  For each request submitted to a retrieval system one of these tables can be constructed. Based on each one of these tables a precision-recall value can be calculated. If the output of the retrieval strategy depends on a parameter, such as rank position or co-ordination level (the number of terms a query has in common with a document), it can be varied to give a different table for each value of the parameter and hence a different precision-recall value. If [[lambda]] is the parameter, then P[[lambda]] denotes precision, R[[lambda]] recall, and a precision-recall value will be denoted by the ordered pair (R[[lambda]] , P[[lambda]] ). The set of ordered pairs makes up the precision-recall graph. Geometrically when the points have been joined up in some way they make up the precision-recall curve. The performance of each request is usually given by a precision-recall curve (see Figure 7.1). To measure the overall performance of a system, the set of surves, one for each request, is combined in some way to produce an average curve.  * For a derivation of this relation from Bayes' Theorem, the reader should consult the author's recent paper on retrieval effectiveness[10].
