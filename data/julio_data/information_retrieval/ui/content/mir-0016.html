 1.5.1    Book Topics The four parts which compose this book are subdivided into eight topics as illustrated in Figure 1.4. These eight topics are as follows. The topic Retrieval Models  Evaluation discusses the traditional models of searching text for useful information and the procedures for evaluating an information retrieval system. The topic Improvements on Retrieval discusses techniques for transforming the query and the text of the documents with the aim of improving retrieval. The topic Efficient Processing discusses indexing and searching approaches for speeding up the retrieval. These three topics compose the first part on Text IR. The topic Interfaces  Visualization covers the interaction of the user with the information retrieval system. The focus is on interfaces which facilitate the process of specifying a query and provide a good visualization of the results. The topic Multimedia Modeling  Searching discusses the utilization of multimedia data with information retrieval systems. The focus is on modeling, indexing, and searching multimedia data such as voice, images, and other binary data. text m.

Techniques developed for the first two applications support the deployment of the latter. The eight topics distinguished above generate the 14 chapters, besides this introduction, which compose this book and which we now briefly introduce.
