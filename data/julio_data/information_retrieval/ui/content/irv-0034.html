 Logical or physical organisation and data independence  There is one important distinction that must be made at the outset when discussing file structures. And that is the difference between the logical and physical organisation of the data. On the whole a file structure will specify the logical structure of the data, that is the relationships that will exist between data items independently of the way in which these relationships may actually be realised within any computer. It is this logical aspect that we will concentrate on. The physical organisation is much more concerned with optimising the use of the storage medium when a particular logical structure is stored on, or in it. Typically for every unit of physical store there will be a number of units of the logical structure (probably records) to be stored in it. For example, if we were to store a tree structure on a magnetic disk, the physical organisation would be concerned with the best way of packing the nodes of the tree on the disk given the access characteristics of the disk.  The work on data bases has been very much concerned with a concept called data independence. The aim of this work is to enable programs to be written independently of the logical structure of the data they would interact with. The independence takes the following form, should the file structure overnight be changed from an inverted to a serial file the program should remain unaffected. This independence is achieved by interposing a data model between the user and the data base. The user sees the data model rather than the data base, and all his programs communicate with the model. The user therefore has no interest in the structure of the file.  There is a school of thought that says that says that applications in library automation and information retrieval should follow this path as well[6,7]. And so it should. Unfortunately, there is still much debate about what a good data model should look like. Furthermore, operational implementations of some of the more advanced theoretical systems do not exist yet. So any suggestion that an IR system might be implemented through a data base package should still seem premature. Also, the scale of the problems in IR is such that efficient implementation of the application still demands close scrutiny of the file structure to be used.  Nevertheless, it is worth taking seriously the trend away from user knowledge of file structures, a trend that has been stimulated considerably by attempts to construct a theory of data[8,9]. There are a number of proposals for dealing with data at an abstract level. The best known of these by now is the one put forward by Codd[8], which has become known as the relational model. In it data are described by n-tuples of attribute values. More formally if the data is described by relations, a relation on a set of domains D1, . . . , Dn can be represented by a set of ordered n-tuples each of the form (d1, . . . , dn) where di [[propersubset]] Di. As it is rather difficult to cope with general relations, various levels (three in fact) of normalisation have been introduced restricting the kind of relations allowed.  A second approach is the hierarchical approach. It is used in many existing data base systems. This approach works as one might expect: data is represented in the form of hierarchies. Although it is more restrictive than the relational approach it often seems to be the natural way to proceed. It can be argued that in many applications a hierarchic structure is a good approximation to the natural structure in the data, and that the resulting loss in precision of representation is worth the gain in efficiency and simplicity of representation.  The third approach is the network approach associated with the proposals by the Data Base Task Group of CODASYL. Here data items are linked into a network in which any given link between two items exists because it satisfies some condition on the attributes of those items, for example, they share an attribute. It is more general than the hierarchic approach in the sense that a node can have any number of immediate superiors. It is also equivalent to the relational approach in descriptive power.  The whole field of data base structures is still very much in a state of flux. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed very thoroughly in Date[10], who also gives excellent annotated citations to the current literature. There is also a recent Computing Survey[ll] which reviews the current state of the art. There have been some very early proponents of the relational approach in IR, as early as 1967 Maron[12] and Levien[13] discussed the design and implementation of an IR system via relations, be it binary ones. Also Prywes and Smith in their review chapter in the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology more recently recommended the DBTG proposals as ways of implementing IR systems[7].  Lurking in the background of any discussion of file structures nowadays is always the question whether data base technology will overtake all. Thus it may be that any application in the field of library automation and information retrieval will be implemented through the use of some appropriate data base package. This is certainly a possibility but not likely to happen in the near future. There are several reasons. One is that data base systems are general purpose systems whereas automated library and retrieval systems are special purpose. Normally one pays a price for generality and in this case it is still too great. Secondly, there now is a considerable investment in providing special purpose systems (for example, MARC)[14] and this is not written off very easily. Nevertheless a trend towards increasing use of data-base technology exists and is well illustrated by the increased prominence given to it in the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology.
