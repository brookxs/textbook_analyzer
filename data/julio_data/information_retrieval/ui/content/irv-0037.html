 Sequential files  A sequential file is the most primitive of all file structures. It has no directory and no linking pointers. The records are generally organised in lexicographic order on the value of some key. In other words, a particular attribute is chosen whose value will determine the order of the records. Sometimes when the attribute value is constant for a large number of records a second key is chosen to give an order when the first key fails to discriminate.  The implementation of this file structure requires the use of a sorting routine.  Its main advantages are:  (1) it is easy to implement;  (2) it provides fast access to the next record using lexicographic order.  Its disadvantages:  (1) it is difficult to update - inserting a new record may require moving a large proportion of the file;  (2) random access is extremely slow.  Sometimes a file is considered to be sequentially organised despite the fact that it is not ordered according to any key. Perhaps the date of acquisition is considered to be the key value, the newest entries are added to the end of the file and therefore pose no difficulty to updating.
