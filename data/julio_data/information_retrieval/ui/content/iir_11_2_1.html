    The 1/0 loss case We assume a ranked retrieval setup as in Section 6.3 , where there is a collection of documents, the user issues a query, and an ordered list of documents is returned. We also assume a binary notion of relevance as in Chapter 8 . For a query and a document in the collection, let be an indicator random variable that says whether is relevant with respect to a given query . That is, it takes on a value of 1 when the document is relevant and 0 otherwise. In context we will often write just for . Using a probabilistic model, the obvious order in which to present documents to the user is to rank documents by their estimated probability of relevance with respect to the information need: . This is the basis of the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) (vanÂ Rijsbergen, 1979, 113-114): ``If a reference retrieval system's response to each request is a ranking of the documents in the collection in order of decreasing probability of relevance to the user who submitted the request, where the probabilities are estimated as accurately as possible on the basis of whatever data have been made available to the system for this purpose, the overall effectiveness of the system to its user will be the best that is obtainable on the basis of those data.'' accuracy  1/0 loss     Bayes Optimal Decision Rule  (61)  Theorem. The PRP is optimal, in the sense that it minimizes the expected loss (also known as the Bayes risk ) under 1/0 loss. End theorem. The proof can be found in Ripley (1996). However, it requires that all probabilities are known correctly. This is never the case in practice. Nevertheless, the PRP still provides a very useful foundation for developing models of IR.
