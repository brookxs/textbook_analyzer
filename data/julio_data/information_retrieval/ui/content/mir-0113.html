 6.5.4    HyTime The Hypermedia/Time-based Structuring Language {HyTime) is a standard (ISO/IEC 10744) defined for multimedia documents markup.    HyTime is an SGML architecture that specifies the generic hypermedia structure of documents. 160        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES Following the guiding principle of SGML, HyTime-defined structure is independent of any presentation of the encoded document. As an architecture, HyTime allows DTDs to be written for individual document models that use HyTime constructs, specifying how these document sets tailor the composition of these constructs for their particular representational needs. The standard also provides several metaDTDs, facilitating the design of new multimedia markup languages. The hypermedia concepts directly represented by HyTime include ï  complex locating of document objects, ï  relationships (hyperlinks) between document objects, and ï  numeric, measured associations between document objects. The HyTime architecture has three parts: the base linking and addressing architecture, the scheduling architecture (derived from the base architecture), and the rendition architecture (which is an application of the scheduling architecture). The base architecture addresses the syntax and semantics of hyperlinks. For most simple hypermedia presentations, this should be enough. The scheduling module of HyTime defines the abstract representation of arbitrarily complex hypermedia structures, including music and interactive presentations. Its basic mechanism is a simple one: the sequencing of object containers along axes measured in temporal or spatial units. The rendition module is essentially an application of the scheduling architecture that defines a general mechanism for defining the creation of new schedules from existing schedules by applying special "rendition rules' of different types. HyTime does not directly specify graphical interfaces, user navigation, user interaction, or the placement of media on time lines and screen displays. These aspects of document processing are rendered from the HyTime constructs in a manner specified by mechanisms such as style sheets, as is done with SGML documents. One application of HyTime, is the Standard Music Description Language (SMdigital library). SDML is an architecture for the representation of music information, either alone, or in conjunction with other media, also supporting multimedia time sequencing information. Another application is the Metafile for Interactive Documents (MID). MID is a common interchange structure, based on SGML and HyTime. that takes data from various authoring systems and structures it for display on dissimilar presentation systems, with minimal human intervention.
