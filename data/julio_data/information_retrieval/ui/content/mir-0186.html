 10.3.3    Earlier Interface Studies The bulk of the literature on studies of human-computer information seeking behavior concerns information intermediaries using online systems consisting of bibliographic records (e.g., [546, 707, 104]), sometimes with costs assessed per time unit. Unfortunately, many of the assumptions behind those studies do not reflect the conditions of modern information access [335, 222]. The differences include the following: ï  The text being searched now is often full text rather than bibliographic citations.   Because users have access to full text, rather than document surrogates, it is more likely that simple queries will find relevant answers directly as part of the search process. ï  Modern systems use statistical ranking (which is more effective when abstracts and full text are available than when only titles and citations are available) whereas most studies were performed on Boolean systems. ï  Much of modern searching is done by end users, many new to online searching, rather than professional intermediaries, which were the focus of many of the earlier studies. ï  Tens of thousands of sources are now available online on networked information systems, and many are tightly coupled via hyperlinks, as opposed to being stored in separate collections owned by separate services.   Earlier studies generally used systems in which moving from one collection to another required prior knowledge of the collections and considerable time and effort to switch. A near miss is much more useful in this hyperlinked environment than in earlier systems, since hyperlinks allow users to navigate from the near miss directly to the source containing information of interest. In a card catalog environment, where documents are represented as isolated units, a near miss consists of finding a book in the general area of interest and then going to the bookshelf in the library to look for related books, or obtaining copies of many issues of a journal and scanning for related articles. ï  Finally, most users have access to bit-mapped displays allowing for direct manipulation, or at least form fiUin. Most earlier studies arid bibliographic systems were implemented on TTY displays, which require command-line based syntax and do a poor job of retaining context. STARTING POINTS        267 Despite these significant differences, some general information seeking strategies have been identified that seem to transfer across systems. Additionally, although modern systems have remedied many of the problems of earlier online public access catalogs, they also introduce new problems of their own.
