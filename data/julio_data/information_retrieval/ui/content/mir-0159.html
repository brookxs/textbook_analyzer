 8.9    Trends and Research Issues In this chapter we covered extensively the current techniques of dealing with text retrieval. We first covered indices and then online searching. We then reviewed set manipulation, complex pattern matching and finally considered compression techniques. Figure 8.25 summarizes the tradeoff between the space needed for the index and the time to search one single word.

BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        227 Probably the most adequate indexing technique in practice is the inverted file. As we have shown throughout the chapter, many hidden details in other structures make them harder to use and less efficient in practice, as well as less flexible for dealing with new types of queries. These structures, however, still find application in restricted areas such as genetic databases (for suffix trees and arrays, for the relatively small texts used and their need to pose specialized queries) or some office systems (for signature files, because the text is rarely queried in fact). The main trends in indexing and searching textual databases today are ï  Text collections are becoming huge. This poses more demanding requirements at all levels, and solutions previously affordable are not any more.   On the other hand, the speed of the processors and the relative slowness of external devices have changed what a few years ago were reasonable options (e.g., it is better to keep a text compressed because reading less text from disk and decompressing in main memory pays off). ï  Searching is becoming more complex.   As the text databases grow and become more heterogeneous and error-prone, enhanced query facilities are required, such as exploiting the text structure or allowing errors in the text. Good support for extended queries is becoming important in the evaluation of a text retrieval system. ï  Compression is becoming a star in the field. Because of the changes mentioned in the time cost of processors and external devices, and because of new developments in the area, text retrieval and compression are no longer regarded as disjoint activities.   Direct indexing and searching on compressed text provides better (sometimes much better) time performance and less space overhead at the same time. Other techniques such as block addressing trade space for processor time.
