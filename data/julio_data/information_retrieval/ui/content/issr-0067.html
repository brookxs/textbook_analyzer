 4.9 Summary  Data structures provide the implementation basis of search techniques in Information Retrieval Systems. They may be searching the text directly, as in use of signature and possibly PAT trees, or providing the structure to hold the searchable data structure created by processing the text in items. The most important data structure to understand is the inverted file system. It has the greatest applicability in information systems. The use of n-grams has also found successes in a limited number of commercial systems. Even though n-grams have demonstrated successes in finding information, it is not a structure that lends itself to representing the concepts in an item. There is no association of an n-gram with a semantic unit (e.g., a word or word stem). Judging the relative importance (ranking) of items is much harder to accomplish under this data structure and the algorithmic options are very limited.  PAT and Signature data file structures have found successful implementations in certain bounded search domains. Both of these techniques encounter significant problems in handling very large databases of textual items. The Hypertext data structure is the newest structure to be considered from an Information Retrieval System perspective. It certainly can be mathematically mapped to linked lists and networks. But the model of how dependencies between items as hyperlinks are resolved is just being considered. The future high usage of this structure in information systems make its understanding important in finding relevant information on the Internet. Marchionini and Shneiderman believe that hypertext will be used in conjunction with full text search tools (Marchionini-88).  The stemming discussed in this chapter has the greatest effect on the human resources it takes to find relevant information. Stemming can increase the ability of the system to find relevant item by generalizing many words to a single representation. But this process reduces precision. Enough information has not been gathered to practically trade off the value of the increase in recall versus the decrease in precision for different degrees of stemming.
