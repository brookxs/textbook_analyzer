 1.2.2    Logical View of the Documents Due to historical reasons, documents in a collection are frequently represented through a set of index terms or keywords. Such keywords might be extracted directly from the text of the document or might be specified by a human subject (as frequently done in the information sciences arena). No matter whether these representative keywords are derived automatically or generated by a specialist, they provide a logical view of the document For a precise definition of the concept of a document and its characteristics, see Chapter 6. Modern computers are making it possible to represent a document by its full set of words. In this case, we say that the retrieval system adopts a full text logical view (or representation) of the documents. With very large collections, however, even modern computers might have to reduce the set of representative keywords. This can be accomplished through the elimination of stopwords (such as articles and connectives), the use of stemming (which reduces distinct words to their common grammatical root), and the identification of noun groups (which eliminates adjectives, adverbs, and verbs). Further, compression might be employed. These operations are called text operations (or transformations) and are covered in detail in Chapter 7. Text operations reduce the complexity of the document representation and allow moving the logical view from that of a full text to that of a set of index terms. The full text is clearly the most complete logical view of a document but its usage usually implies higher computational costs. A small set of categories (generated by a human specialist) provides the most concise logical view of a document but its usage might lead to retrieval of poor quality. Several intermediate logical views (of a document) might be adopted by an information retrieval system as illustrated in Figure 1.2. Besides adopting any of the intermediate representations, the retrieval system might also recognize the internal structure normally present in a document (e.g., chapters, sections, subsections, etc.). This INTRODUCTION Figure 1.2    Logical view of a document: from full text to a set of index terms. information on the structure of the document might be quite useful and is required by structured text retrieval models such as those discussed in Chapter 2. As illustrated in Figure 1.2, we view the issue of logically representing a document as a continuum in which the logical view of a document might shift (smoothly) from a full text representation to a higher level representation specified by a human subject.
