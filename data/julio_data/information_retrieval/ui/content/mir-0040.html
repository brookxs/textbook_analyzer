 2.8    Alternative Probabilistic Models One alternative which has always been considered naturally appealing for quantifying document relevance is the usage of probability theory and its main streams. One such stream which is gaming increased attention concerns the Bayesian belief networks which we now discuss. Bayesian (belief) networks are useful because they provide a clean formalism for combining distinct sources of evidence (past queries, past feedback cycles, and distinct query formulations) in support of the rank for a given document. This combination of distinct evidential sources can be used to improve retrieval performance (i.e., to improve the 'quality' of the ranked list of retrieved documents) as has been demonstrated in the work of Turtle and Croft [771]. In this chapter we discuss two models for information retrieval based on Bayesian networks. The first model is called inference network and provides the theoretical basis for the retrieval engine in the Inquery system [122]. Its success has attracted attention to the use of Bayesian networks with information retrieval systems. The second model is called belief network and generalizes the first model. At the end, we briefly compare the two models. Our discussion below uses a style which is quite distinct from that employed by Turtle and Croft in their original writings. Particularly, we pay more attention to probabilistic argumentation during the development of the model. We make a conscious effort of consistently going back to the Bayesian formalism for motivating the major design decisions. It is our view that such an explanation strategy allows for a more precise argumentation which facilitates the task of grasping the subtleties involved. Before proceeding, we briefly introduce Bayesian networks.
