 8.2.4 User as Portal  How could we possibly know so much about the story or argument an author is attempting to get across?! Or about just what question a user has in mind, and why they want the answer?! In fact, more and more evidence is making itself available to make just such determinations. Virtually every author now composes using a word processor, and even if they are only interested in ultimately producing a paper document, it generally carries with it much of the intra- and interdocument structure discussed in Chapter 6. Further, it may be possible to infer even more of their thinking if the process of word processing is allowed to leave a trace with the document*  Similarly, browsers retain more and more state (i.e., permanent changes to the local computer's files that exist after the browser program is no longer running) all the time.

Less obvious to most users are the cookies left by WWW servers on the user's client, to better identify when they come to visit.  The point is that there are actually fairly rich streams of information available about both author and user, above and beyond the query and document text with which we have been primarily concerned in this book. Of course, there are some computations over these two data sets that can be done a priori, before any search commences. But the more interesting computations are those that can only be done on the occasion of a particular query. A sketch of this perspective is shown in Figure 8.5, with the user and his active seeking behaviors creating a portal through which corpora can interact.  Here we propose that in fact each user's query, each bit of relevance feedback, and each move from one document to another effectively create the opportunity to juxtapose two corpora in ways that, until that moment, had never been analyzed in that way before.
