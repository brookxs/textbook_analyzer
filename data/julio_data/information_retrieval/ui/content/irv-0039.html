 Index-sequential files  An index-sequential file is an inverted file in which for every keyword Ki , we have ni = hi = 1 and a11 lt;a21 . . . lt;am1. This situation can only arise if each record has just one unique keyword, or one unique attribute-value. In practice therefore, this set of records may be order sequentially by a key. Each key value appears in the directory with the associated address of its record. An obvious interpretation of a key of this kind would be the record number. In our example none of the attributes would do the job except the record number. Diagrammatically the index-sequential file would therefore appear as shown in Figure 4.4. I have deliberately written Ri instead of Ki to emphasise the nature of the key.  In the literature an index-sequential file is usually thought of as a sequential file with a hierarchy of indices. This does not contradict the previous definition, it merely describes the way in which the directory is implemented. It is not surprising therefore that the indexes ('index' = 'directory' here) are often oriented to the characteristics of the storage medium. For example (see Figure 4.5) there might be three levels of indexing: track, cylinder and master. Each entry in the track index will contain enough information to locate the start of the track, and the key of the last record in the track which is also normally the highest value on that track. There is a track index for each cylinder. Each entry in the cylinder index gives the last record on each cylinder and the address of the track index for that cylinder. If the cylinder index itself is stored on tracks, then the master index will give the highest key referenced for each track of the cylinder index and the starting address of that track.  No mention has been made of the possibility of overflow during an updating process. Normally provision is made in the directory to administer an overflow area. This of course increases the number of book-keeping entries in each entry of the index.
