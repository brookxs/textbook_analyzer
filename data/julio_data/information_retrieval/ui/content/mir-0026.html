 2.4    A Formal Characterization of IR Models We have argued that the fundamental premises which form the basis for a ranking algorithm determine the IR model. Throughout this chapter, we will discuss different sets of such premises. However, before doing so, we should state clearly what exactly an IR model is. Our characterization is as follows. Definition An information retrieval model is a quadruple [D,Q, T, R{qi,dj)J where (1)  D is a set composed of logical views (or representations) for the documents in the collection. (2)  Q is a set composed of logical views (or representations) for the user information needs. Such representations are called queries. (3)  Tis a framework for modeling document representations, queries, and their relationships. (4)  R{qi,dj) is a ranking function which associates a real number with a query qt Ã„ Q and a document representation dj G D.  Such ranking defines an ordering among the documents with regard to the query qi. To build a model, we think first of representations for the documents and for the user information need. Given these representations, we then conceive the framework in which they can be modeled. This framework should also provide the intuition for constructing a ranking function. For instance, for the classic Boolean model, the framework is composed of sets of documents and the standard operations on sets. For the classic vector model, the framework is composed of a 24        MODELING t-dimensional vectorial space and standard linear algebra operations on vectors. For the classic probabilistic model, the framework is composed of sets, standard probability operations, and the Bayes' theorem. In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss the various IR models shown in Figure 2.1. Throughout the discussion, we do not explicitly instantiate the components D, Q, T, and R(qu dj) of each model. Such components should be quite clear from the discussion and can be easily inferred.
