 1.3.4    Practical Issues Electronic commerce is a major trend on the Web nowadays and one which has benefited millions of people. In an electronic transaction, the buyer usually has to submit to the vendor some form of credit information which can be used for charging for the product or service. In its most common form, such information consists of a credit card number. However, since transmitting credit card numbers over the Internet is not a safe procedure, such data is usually transmitted over a fax line. This implies that, at least in the beginning, the transaction between a new user and a vendor requires executing an off-line procedure of several steps before the actual transaction can take place. This situation can be improved if the data is encrypted for security. In fact, some institutions and companies already provide some form of encryption or automatic authentication for security reasons. However, security is not the only concern. Another issue of major interest is privacy. Frequently, people are willing to exchange information as long as it does not become public. The reasons are many but the most common one is to protect oneself against misuse of private information by third parties. Thus, privacy is another issue which affects the deployment of the Web and which has not been properly addressed yet. Two other very important issues are copyright and patent rights. It is far THE RETRIEVAL PROCESS        9 from clear how the wide spread of data on the Web affects copyright and patent laws in the various countries. This is important because it affects the business of building up and deploying large digital libraries. For instance, is a site which supervises all the information it posts acting as a publisher? And if so, is it responsible for a misuse of the information it posts (even if it is not the source)? Additionally, other practical issues of interest include scanning, optical character recognition (OCR), and cross-language retrieval (in which the query is in one language but the documents retrieved are in another language). In this book, however, we do not cover practical issues in detail because it is not our main focus. The reader interested in details of practical issues is referred to the interesting book by Lesk [501].
