 3.2    Retrieval Performance Evaluation When considering retrieval performance evaluation, we should first consider the retrieval task that is to be evaluated. For instance, the retrieval task could consist simply of a query processed in batch mode (i.e., the user submits a query and receives an answer back) or of a whole interactive session (i.e., the user specifies his information need through a series of interactive steps with the system). Further, the retrieval task could also comprise a combination of these two strategies. Batch and interactive query tasks are quite distinct processes and thus their evaluations are also distinct. In fact, in an interactive session, user effort, characteristics of the interface design, guidance provided by the system, and duration of the session are critical aspects which should be observed and measured. In a batch session, none of these aspects is nearly as important as the quality of the answer set generated. Besides the nature of the query request, one has also to consider the setting where the evaluation will take place and the type of interface used. Regarding the setting, evaluation of experiments performed in a laboratory might be quite distinct from evaluation of experiments carried out in a real life situation. Regarding the type of interface, while early bibliographic systems (which still dominate the commercial market as discussed in Chapter 14) present the user with interfaces which normally operate in batch mode, newer systems (which are been popularized by the high quality graphic displays available nowadays) usually present the user with complex interfaces which often operate interactively. Retrieval performance evaluation in the early days of computer-based information retrieval systems focused primarily on laboratory experiments designed for batch interfaces. In the 1990s, a lot more attention has been paid to the evaluation of real life experiments. Despite this tendency, laboratory experimentation is still dominant. Two main reasons are the repeatability and the scalability provided by the closed setting of a laboratory. RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION        75 In this book, we focus mainly on experiments performed in laboratories. In this chapter in particular we discuss solely the evaluation of systems which operate in batch mode. Evaluation of systems which operate interactively is briefly discussed in Chapter 10.
