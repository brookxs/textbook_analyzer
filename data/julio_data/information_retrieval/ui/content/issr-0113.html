 8.4 Summary  Information visualization is not a new concept. The well known saying that ua picture is worth a thousand words" is part of our daily life. Everything from advertisements to briefings make use of visual aides to significantly increase the amount of information presented and provide maximum impact on the audience. The significant amount of "noise" (non-relevant items) in interactions with information systems requires use of user interface aides to maximize the information being presented to the user. Pure textual interfaces provide no capabilities for aggregation of data, allowing a user to see an overview of the results of a search. Viewing the results of a search using a hierarchical paradigm allows higher levels of abstraction showing overall results of searches before the details consume the display.  Visualization techniques attempt to represent aggregate information using a metaphor (e.g., peaks, valleys, cityscapes) to highlight the major concepts of the aggregation and relationships between them. This allows the user to put into perspective the total information before pursuing the details. It also allows major pruning of areas of non-relevant information. A close analogy is when searching on "fields" in the index at a library, the book shelves on horticulture would be ignored if magnetic fields was the information need. By having the data visualized constrained by the users search, the display is focused on the user's areas of interest. Relationships between data and effectiveness of the search become obvious to the user before the details of individual items hide the higher level relationships.  Cognitive engineering suggests that alternative representations are needed to take maximum advantage of different physilogical and cultural experiences of the user. Colors are useless to a color blind user. A person who grew up on a farm living in the country may have more trouble understanding a "city-scape" than a New York city resident. Using visual cues that a person has developed over his life-experience can facilitate the mapping of the visual metphor to the information it is representing.  As the algorthms and automatic search expansion techniques become more complex, use of visualization will take on additional responsibilities in clarifying to the user, not only what information is being retrieved, but the relationship between the search statement and the items. Showng relationships between items has had limited use in systems and been focused on data mining type efforts. The growth of hypertext linkages will require new visualization tools to present the network relationships between linked items and assist the user in navigating this new structure. Information Visualization                                                                          219  The technical limiter to the use of information visualization is no longer the understanding of useful visual techniques nor the ability of computers to display the techniques. The issue is the computational overhead in calculating the relationships between items based upon a dynamically created subset of an information space. To collect the information to display a "city-scape" display from the results of a search requires:  identifying the sbset of items that is relevant to the search statement applying a threshold to determine the subset to process for visualization  calculating the pairwise similarity between all of the indicated items and clustering the results  determining the theme or subject of the clusters  determining the strength of the relationships between the clusters  creating the information visualization for the results.  Not only does the user expect to see the aggregate level clustered, but the user expects to be able to expand upon any particular cluster and see the results also displayed using a visualization technique. Thus at each level, the precision of the clustering process increases. The user expects to interact with the system and see the results of the search in near real time processing (e.g., anthing more than 20 seconds is delayed response).  There are two major processing issues in developing the information visualization display. The first is in the third step of calculating the pairwise similarities of all of the items. The second major issue is in the increased precision expected as the user moves from the higher to lower levels of information visualization. This requires an additional level of precision that will likely need natural language processing to achieve. The indexes for items and the algorithms proposed to determine similarity between a query and the items may need adjustments to optimize their performance in locating and organizing the results from a search for the information visualization process.
