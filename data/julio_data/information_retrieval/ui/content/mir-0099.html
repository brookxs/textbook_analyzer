 6.2    Metadata Most documents and text collections have associated with them what is known as metadata. Metadata is information on the organization of the data, the various data domains, and the relationship between them. In short, metadata is 'data about the data."  For instance, in a database management system, the schema METADATA        143 specifies some of the metadata, namely, the name of the relations, the fields or attributes of each relation, the domain of each attribute, etc. Common forms of metadata associated with text include the author, the date of publication, the source of the publication, the document length (in pages, words, bytes, etc.), and the document genre (book, article, memo, etc.). For example, the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [807] proposes 15 fields to describe a document. Following Marchionini [542], we refer to this kind of information as Descriptive Metadata, metadata that is external to the meaning of the document, and pertains more to how it was created. Another type of metadata characterizes the subject matter that can be found within the document's contents. We will refer to this as Semantic Metadata. Semantic Metadata is associated with a wide number of documents and its availability is increasing. All books published within the USA are assigned Library of Congress subject codes, and many journals require author-assigned key terms that are selected from a closed vocabulary of relevant terms. For example, biomedical articles that appear within the MEdigital libraryINE (see Chapter 3) system are assigned topical metadata pertaining to disease, anatomy, Pharmaceuticals, and so on. To standardize semantic terms, many areas use specific ontologies, which are hierarchical taxonomies of terms describing certain knowledge topics. An important metadata format is the Machine Readable Cataloging Record (MARC) which is the most used format for library records. MARC has several fields for the different attributes of a bibliographic entry such as title, author, etc. Specific uses of MARC are given in Chapter 14. In the USA, a particular version of MARC is used: USMARC, which is an implementation of ANSI/NISO Z39.2, the American National Standard for Bibliographic Information Interchange. The USMARC format documents contain the definitions and content for the fields that have to be used in records structured according to Z39.2. This standard is maintained by the Library of Congress of the USA. With the increase of data in the Web, there are many initiatives to add metadata information to Web documents. In the Web, metadata can be used for many purposes. Some of them are cataloging (BibTeX is a popular format for this case), content rating (for example, to protect children from reading some type of documents), intellectual property rights, digital signatures (for authentication), privacy levels (who should and who should not have access to a document), applications to electronic commerce, etc. The new standard for Web metadata is the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which provides interoperability between applications. This framework allows the description of Wreb resources to facilitate automated processing of the information. It does not assume any particular application or semantic domain. It consists of a description of nodes and attached attribute/value pairs. Nodes can be any WTeb resource, that is, any Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which includes the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Attributes are properties of nodes, and their values are text strings or other nodes (Web resources or metadata instances). To describe the semantics, values from, for example, the Dublin Core library metadata URL can be used. Other predefined vocabularies for authoring metadata are expected, in particular for content rating and for digital signatures.   In addition, currently. 144        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES there are many Web projects on ontologies for different application domains (see also Chapters 13 and 15). Metadata is also useful for metadescriptions of nontextual objects. For example, a set of keywords that describe an image. These keywords can later be used to search for the image using classic text information retrieval techniques (on the metadescriptions).
