 13.5.1    Web Directories The best and oldest example of a Web directory is Yahoo! [839], which is likely the most used searching tool.   Other large Web directories include eBLAST, LookSmart, Magellan, and NewHoo. Some of them are hybrids, because they also provide searches in the whole Web. Most search engines also provide subject categories nowadays, including AltaVista Categories, AOL Netfind, Excite Channels, HotBot, Infoseek, Lycos Subjects, and WebCrawler Select, are specific to some areas. For example, there are Web sites focused on business, news, BROWSING 385 Web directory	URL	Web sites	Categories eBLAST	www.eblast.com	125	_ LookSmart	www.looksmart.com	300	24 Lycos Subjects	a2z.lycos.com	50	Magellan	www.mckinley.com	60 NewHoo	www. lie who o. com	100	23 Netscape	www.netscape.com	-	Search.com	www.search.com	-	Snap	www.snap.com	-	Yahoo!	www.yahoo.com	750 Table 13.3    URLs, Web pages indexed and categories (both in thousands) of some Web directories (beginning of 1998).

Web directories are also called catalogs, yellow pages, or subject directories. Table 13.3 gives the URLs of the most important Web directories (not including the search engines already listed in section 13.4). Directories are hierarchical taxonomies that classify human knowledge. Table 13.4 shows the first level of the taxonomies used by Web directories (the number of first level categories ranges from 12 to 26). Some subcategories are also available in the main page of Web directories, adding around 70 more topics. The largest directory, Yahoo!, has close to one million pages classified, followed by LookSmart, which has about 24,000 categories in total.  Yahoo!  also offers 386        SEARCHING THE WEB 14 regional or country specialized directories in other languages including Chinese, Danish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish. In most cases, pages have to be submitted to the Web directory, where they are reviewed, and, if accepted, classified in one or more categories of the hierarchy. Although the taxonomy can be seen as a tree, there are cross references, so it is really a directed acyclic graph. The main advantage of this technique is that if we find what we are looking-for, the answer will be useful in most cases. On the other hand, the main disadvantage is that the classification is not specialized enough and that not all Web pages are classified. The last problem becomes worse every day as the Web grows. The efforts to do automatic classification, by using clustering or other techniques, are very old. However, up to now, natural language processing is not 100% effective in extracting relevant terms from a document. Thus, classification is done manually by a limited number of people. This is a potential problem with users having a different notion of categories than the manmade categorization. Web directories also allow the user to perform a search on the taxonomy descriptors or in the W7eb pages pointed to by the taxonomy. In fact, as the number of classified Wreb pages is small, we can even afford to have a copy of all pages. In that case they must be updated frequently, which may pose performance and temporal validity problems. In addition, most Web directories also send the query to a search engine (through a strategic alliance) and allow the whole Wreb to be searched.
