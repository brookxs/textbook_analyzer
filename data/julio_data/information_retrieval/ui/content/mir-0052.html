 2.10.2    Structure Guided Browsing To facilitate the task of browsing, the documents might be organized in a structure such as a directory. Directories are hierarchies of classes which group documents covering related topics. Such hierarchies of classes have been used to classify document collections for many centuries now. Thus, it seems natural to adapt them for use with modern browsing interfaces. In this case, we say that the user performs a structure guided type of browsing. The same idea can be applied to a single document. For example, if we are browsing an electronic book, a first level of content could be the chapters, the second level, all sections, and so on. The last level would be the text itself (flat). A good user interface could go down or up those levels in a focused manner, assisting the user with the task of keeping track of the context. Besides the structure which directs the browsing task, the interface can also include facilities such as a history map which identifies classes recently visited. This might be quite useful for dealing with very large structures - an issue discussed in Chapters 10 and 13. When searching, the occurrences can also be displayed showing just the structure (for example, using the table of contents). This allows us to see the occurrences in a global context instead of in a page of text that may have no indication of wThere we are.
