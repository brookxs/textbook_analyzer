 4.1    Introduction We cover in this chapter the different kinds of queries normally posed to text retrieval systems. This is in part dependent on the retrieval model the system adopts, i.e., a full-text system will not answer the same kinds of queries as those answered by a system based on keyword ranking (as Web search engines) or on a hypertext model. In Chapter 8 we explain how the user queries are solved, while in this chapter we show which queries can be formulated. The type of query the user might formulate is largely dependent on the underlying information retrieval model. The different models for text retrieval systems are covered in Chapter 2. As in previous chapters, we want to distinguish between information retrieval and data retrieval, as we use this dichotomy to classify different query languages. We have chosen to distinguish first languages that allow the answer to be ranked, that is, languages for information retrieval. As covered in Chapter 2, for the basic information retrieval models, keyword-based retrieval is the main type of querying task. For query languages not aimed at information retrieval, the concept of ranking cannot be easily defined, so we consider them as languages for data retrieval. Furthermore, some query languages are not intended for final users and can be viewed as languages that a higher level software package should use to query an on-line database or a CD-ROM archive. In that case, we talk about protocols rather than query languages. Depending on the user experience, a different query language will be used. For example, if the user knows exactly what he wants, the retrieval task is easier and ranking may not even be needed. An important issue is that most query languages try to use the content (i.e., the semantics) and the structure of the text (i.e., the text syntax) to find relevant documents. In that sense, the system may fail to find the relevant answers (see Chapter 3). For this reason, a number of techniques meant to enhance the usefulness of the queries exist. Examples include the expansion of a word to the set of its synonyms or the use of a thesaurus and stemming to 99 100        QUERY LANGUAGES put together all the derivatives of the same word. Moreover, some words which are very frequent and do not carry meaning (such as 'the'), called stopwords, may be removed. This subject is covered in Chapter 7. Here we assume that all the query preprocessing has already been done. Although these operations are usually done for information retrieval, many of them can also be useful in a data retrieval context. When we want to emphasize the difference between words that can be retrieved by a query and those which cannot, we call the former 'keywords.' Orthogonal to the kind of queries that can be asked is the subject of the retrieval unit the information system adopts. The retrieval unit is the basic element which can be retrieved as an answer to a query (normally a set of such basic elements is retrieved, sometimes ranked by relevance or other criterion). The retrieval unit can be a file, a document, a Web page, a paragraph, or some other structural unit which contains an answer to the search query. Prom this point on, we will simply call those retrieval units 'documents,' although as explained this can have different meanings (see also Chapter 2). This chapter is organized as follows. We first show the queries that can be formulated with keyword-based query languages. They are aimed at information retrieval, including simple words and phrases as well as Boolean operators which manipulate sets of documents. In the second section we cover pattern matching, which includes more complex queries and is generally aimed at complementing keyword searching with more powerful data retrieval capabilities. Third, we cover querying on the structure of the text, which is more dependent on the particular text model. Finally, we finish with some standard protocols used on the Internet and by CD-ROM publishers.
