    Improving classifier performance For any particular application, there is usually significant room for improving classifier effectiveness through exploiting features specific to the domain or document collection. Often documents will contain zones which are especially useful for classification. Often there will be particular subvocabularies which demand special treatment for optimal classification effectiveness.   Subsections Large and difficult category taxonomies Features for text Document zones in text classification Upweighting document zones. Separate feature spaces for document zones.
