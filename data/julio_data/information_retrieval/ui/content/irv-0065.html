 Estimation of parameters  The use of a weighting function of the kind derived above in actual retrieval requires the estimation of pertinent parameters. I shall here deal with the estimation of ti and ri for the non-linear case, obviously the linear case will follow by analogy. To show what is involved let me given an example of the estimation process using simple maximum likelihood estimates. The basis for our estimates is the following 2-by-2 table.  Here I have adopted a labelling scheme for the cells in which [x] means the number of occurrences in the cell labelled x. Ignoring for the moment the nature of the set on which this table is based; our estimates might be as follows:  In general we would have two tables of this kind when setting up our function g(x), one for estimating the parameters associated with P(x/w1) and one for P(x/w2). In the limit we would have complete knowledge of which documents in the collection were relevant and which were not. Were we to calculate the estimates for this limiting case, this would only be useful in showing what the upper bound to our retrieval would be under this particular model. More realistically, we would have a sample of documents, probably small (not nesessarily random), for which the relevance status of each document was known. This small set would then be the source data for any 2-by-2 tables we might wish to construct. The estimates therefore would be biased in an unavoidable way.  The estimates shown above are examples of point estimates. There are a number of ways of arriving at an appropriate rule for point estimation. Unfortunately the best form of estimation rule is still an open problem[14]. In fact, some statisticians believe that point estimation should not be attempted at all[15]. However in the context of IR it is hard to see how one can avoid making point estimates. One major objection to any point estimation rule is that in deriving it some 'arbitrary' assumptions are made. Fortunately in IR there is some chance of justifying these assumptions by pointing to experimental data gathered from retrieval systems, thereby removing some of the arbitrariness.  Two basic assumptions made in deriving any estimation rule through Bayesian decision theory are:  (1) the form of the prior distribution on the parameter space, i.e. in our case the assumed  probability distribution on the possible values of the binomial parameter; and  (2) the form of the loss function used to measure the error made in estimating the  parameter.  Once these two assumptions are made explicit by defining the form of the distribution and loss function, then, together with Bayes' Principle which seeks to minimise the posterior conditional expected loss given the observations, we can derive a number of different estimation rules. The statistical literature is not much help when deciding which rule is to be preferred. For details the reader should consult van Rijsbergen[2] where further references to the statistical literature are given. The important rules of estimating a proportion p all come in the form  where x is the number of successes in n trials, and a and b are parameters dictated by the particular combination of prior and loss function. Thus we have a whole class of estimation rules. For example when a=b=0 we have the usual estimate x/n, and when a=b=[1]/2 we have a rule attributed to Sir Harold Jeffreys by Good[16]. This latter rule is in fact the rule used by Robertson and Sparck Jones[1] in their estimates. Each setting of a and b can be justified in terms of the reasonableness of the resulting prior distribution. Since what is found reasonable by one man is not necessarily so for another, the ultimate choice must rest on performance in an experimental test. Fortunately in IR we are in a unique position to do this kind of test.  One important reason for having estimation rules different from the simple x/n, is that this is rather unrealistic for small samples. Consider the case of one sample (n = 1) and the trial result x = 0 (or x = 1) which would result in the estimate for p as p = 0 (or p = 1). This is clearly ridiculous, since in most cases we would already know with high probability that  0 lt; p lt; 1. To overcome this difficulty we might try and incorporate this prior knowledge in a distribution on the possible values of the parameter we are trying to estimate. Once we have accepted the feasibility of this and have specified the way in which estimation error is to be measured, Bayes' Principle (or some other principle) will usually lead to a rule different from x/n.  This is really as much as I wish to say about estimation rules, and therefore I shall not push the technical discussion on this points any further; the interested reader should consult the readily accessible statistical literature.
