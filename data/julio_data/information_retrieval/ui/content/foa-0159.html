 7.5.5 Hierarchic Classification  In many areas of careful scholarship, classification labels are not merely members of a big set, but rather they are organized hierarchically into 278       FINDING OUT ABOUT  Pr( belief)  UseNet                   pr( belief | UseNet)  alt                                Pr( belief | alt)  alt.religion                       Pr( belief | alt.religion)  q    ,        h   v    y       alt.religion.scientology    Pr( belief j alt.religion.scientology)  FIGURE 7.10 Hierarchic Classification  systems of BT/NT hypernymy (cf. Section 6.3). For example, the U.S. Patent Office has 400 top-level classifications with 135,000 subclasses [Larkey, 1998b]. These classes are part of a hierarchic tree going down 15 levels. A simple example suggested by Mitchell and others' use of the UseNet newsgroup hierarchy [Mitchell, 1997; McCallum et al., 1998] is shown in Figure 7.10. Here the probability of the keyword BELIEFS is conditionalized with respect to a series of increasingly specific newsgroups.
