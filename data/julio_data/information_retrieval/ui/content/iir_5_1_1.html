    Heaps' law: Estimating the number of terms  Heaps' law.Vocabulary size as a function of collection size (number of tokens) for Reuters-RCV1. For these data, the dashed line is the best least-squares fit. Thus, and . A better way of getting a handle on is Heaps' law , which estimates vocabulary size as a function of collection size: (1)       5.1     (2)  The parameter is quite variable because vocabulary growth depends a lot on the nature of the collection and how it is processed. Case-folding and stemming reduce the growth rate of the vocabulary, whereas including numbers and spelling errors increase it. Regardless of the values of the parameters for a particular collection, Heaps' law suggests that (i) the dictionary size continues to increase with more documents in the collection, rather than a maximum vocabulary size being reached, and (ii) the size of the dictionary is quite large for large collections. These two hypotheses have been empirically shown to be true of large text collections (Section 5.4 ). So dictionary compression is important for an effective information retrieval system.
