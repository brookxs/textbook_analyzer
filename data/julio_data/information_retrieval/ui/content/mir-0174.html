 9.3.5    Web Issues Information retrieval on the World Wide Web is covered extensively in Chapter 13. For completeness, we briefly mention here how parallel and distributed information retrieval applies to the Web. The most direct application is to gather all of the documents on the Web into a single, large document collection. The parallel and distributed techniques described above can then be used directly as if the Web were any other large document collection. This is the approach currently taken by most of the popular Web search services. Alternatively, we can exploit the distributed system of computers that make up the Web and spread the work of collecting, organizing, and searching all of the documents. This is the approach taken by the Harvest system [108]. Harvest comprises a number of components for gathering, summarizing, replicating, distributing, and searching documents. User queries are processed by brokers, which collect and refine information from gatherers and other brokers. The information at a particular broker is typically related to a restricted set of topics, allowing users to direct their queries to the most appropriate brokers. A central broker registry helps users find the best brokers for their queries (see Figure 13.4). TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        255
