 6.5.3    Graphics and Virtual Reality There are many formats proposed for three-dimensional graphics. Although this topic is not fully relevant to information retrieval, we include some information here for the sake of completeness. Our emphasis here is on the Web. The Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) standard (ISO 8632) is defined for the open interchange of structured graphical objects and their associated attributes. CGM specifies a two-dimensional data interchange standard which allows graphical data to be stored and exchanged between graphics devices, applications, and computer systems in a device-independent manner. It is a structured format that can represent vector graphics (for example, polylines or ellipses), raster graphics, and text. Although initially CGM was a vector graphics format, it has been extended to include raster capabilities and provides a very useful format for combined raster and vector images. A metafile is a collection of elements. These elements may be the geometric components of the picture, such as polyline or polygon; the appearance of these components; or how to interpret a particular metafile or a particular picture. The CGM standard specifies which elements are allowed to occur in which positions in a metafile. The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML, ISO/IEC 14772-1) is a file format for describing interactive 3D objects and wrorlds and is a subset of the Silicon Graphics Openlnventor file format. VRML is also intended to be a universal interchange format for integrated 3D graphics and multimedia. VRML may be used in a variety of application areas such as engineering and scientific visualization, multimedia presentations, entertainment and educational titles, Web pages, and shared virtual worlds. VRML has become the de facto standard modeling language for the Web.
