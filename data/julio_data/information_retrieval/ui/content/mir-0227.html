 11.3.2    Conditions on Multimedia Data Multimedia query languages should provide predicates for expressing conditions on the attributes, the content, and the structure of multimedia objects.   In general, query predicates can be classified into three different groups: ï  Attribute predicates concern the attributes (i.e., the structured content) of multimedia objects. ï  Structural predicates concern the structure of the data being considered. ï  Semantic predicates concern the semantic and unstructured content of the data involved. By the term attribute predicates we mean predicates against traditional attributes, i.e., attributes for which an exact value is supplied for each object. Examples of attributes are the speaker of an audio object, the size of an object, or its type. By querying these predicates, the system applies an exact-match retrieval, using the same techniques as traditional DBMSs. Structural predicates concern the structure of multimedia objects. Such predicates can be answered by using some form of metadata [99, 442; and 336        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES information about the database schema. With respect to traditional databases, structural queries play a fundamental role in multimedia query processing, due to the complex structure of multimedia objects. An example of use of a structural predicate is the query: 'Find all multimedia objects containing at least one image and a video clip.' On the other hand, semantic predicates concern the semantic content of the queried data, depending on the features that have been extracted and stored for each multimedia object. An example of a semantic query is 'Find all the objects containing the word OFFICE.' Note that the word 'OFFICE' may appear either in a textual component of the object or as a text attribute of some image components. The query 'Find all the red houses' is a query on the image content. This query can be executed only if color and shape are features that have been previously extracted from images. Current systems support semantic predicates only with respect to specific features, such as the color, the shape, the texture, and sometimes the motion. For example, QBIC allows the retrieval of images with similar shapes or similar textures with respect to the object example specified in the query [257]. More innovative approaches include the Name-it project, whose aim is to process a video clip and automatically associate spoken or typed names with their corresponding faces [708]. The main difference between attribute predicates and semantic predicates is that, in the latter case, an exact match cannot be applied. This means that there is no guarantee that the objects retrieved by this type of predicate are 1009? correct or precise. In general, the result of a query involving semantic predicates is a set of objects, each of which has an associated degree of relevance with respect to the query. The user can subsequently select the better matches and submit the query again. Structural and semantic predicates can also refer to spatial or temporal properties of multimedia objects. Spatial semantic predicates specify conditions about the relative positions of a set of objects in an image or a video. Examples of spatial semantic predicates are: contain, intersect, is contained in, is adjacent to. Temporal semantic predicates are mainly related to continuous media, like audio and video. They allow one to express temporal relationships among the various frames of a single audio or video. For example, the query ¶"Fiuci all the objects that contain an audio component, where the hint of the discussion is first policy, and then economy' is a temporal audio query. From the point of view of structural predicates, spatial and temporal predicates can be used to specify temporal synchronization properties and spatial layout properties for the presentation of multimedia objects [87, 88]. For instance, in the query: 'Find all the objects containing an image overlapping the associated text', a spatial structural predicate Is used to impose a condition on the spatial layout of the retrieved objects. Analogously, the query: 'Find all the objects in which a jingle is played for the duration of an linage display1 is an example of a structural temporal query. Note, moreover, that temporal and spatial predicates can be combined to express more articulated requirements. An example Is the query: "Find all the objects in which the logo of a car company QUERY LANGUAGES        337 is displayed and, when it disappears, a graphic showing the increases in the company sales is shown in the same position where the logo was,' Due to the complex structure of multimedia objects, all the previous types of predicates can refer either to the whole object or, if the underlying data model supports complex object representation, to some subcomponents of the object. In the last case, the query language must also be able to navigate the object structure. A typical example in this direction is represented by path expressions in object-oriented systems [89].
