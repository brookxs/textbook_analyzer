 6.3    Text With the advent of the computer, it was necessary to code text in binary digits. The first coding schemes were EBCDIC and ASCII, which used seven bits to code each possible symbol. Later, ASCII was standardized to eight bits (ISO-Latin), to accommodate several languages, including accents and other diacritical marks. Nevertheless, ASCII is not suitable for oriental languages such as Chinese or Japanese Kanji, where each symbol might represent a concept and therefore thousands of them exist. For this case, a 16-bit code exists called Unicode (ISO 10616) [783]. In this section we cover different characteristics of text. First, the possible formats of text, ASCII being the simplest format. Second, how the information content of text can be measured, followed by different models for it. Finally, we mention briefly how we can measure similarity between strings or pieces of text.
