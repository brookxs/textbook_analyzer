 Multi-lists  A multi-list is really only a slightly modified inverted file. There is one list per keyword, i.e. hi = 1. The records containing a particular keyword Ki are chained together to form the Ki-list and the start of the Ki-list is given in the directory, as illustrated in Figure 4.6. Since there is no K3-list, the field reserved for its pointer could well have been omitted. So could any blank pointer field, so long as no ambiguity arises as to which pointer belongs to which keyword. One way of ensuring this, particularly if the data values (attribute-values) are fixed format, is to have the pointer not pointing to the beginning of the record but pointing to the location of the next pointer in the chain.  The multi-list is designed to overcome the difficulties of updating an inverted file. The addresses in the directory of an inverted file are normally kept in record-number order. But, when the time comes to add a new record to the file, this sequence must be maintained, and inserting the new address can be expensive. No such problem arises with the multi-list, we update the appropriate K-lists by simply chaining in the new record. The penalty we pay for this is of course the increase in search time. This is in fact typical of many of the file structures. Inherent in their design is a trade-off between search time and update time.
