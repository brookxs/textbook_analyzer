 8.5.1    Brute Force The brute-force (BF) algorithm is the simplest possible one. It consists of merely trying all possible pattern positions in the text. For each such position, it verifies whether the pattern matches at that position. See Figure 8.13. Since there are O(n) text positions and each one is examined at O(m) worst-case cost, the worst-case of brute-force searching is 0(mn). However, its average 210        INDEXING AND SEARCHING case is O(n) (since on random text a mismatch is found after (9(1) comparisons on average). This algorithm does not need any pattern preprocessing. Many algorithms use a modification of this scheme. There is a window of length m which is slid over the text. It is checked whether the text in the window is equal to the pattern (if it is, the window position is reported as a match). Then, the window is shifted forward. The algorithms mainly differ in the way they check and shift the window.
