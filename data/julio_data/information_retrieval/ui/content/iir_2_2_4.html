    Stemming and lemmatization For grammatical reasons, documents are going to use different forms of a word, such as organize, organizes, and organizing. Additionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as democracy, democratic, and democratization. In many situations, it seems as if it would be useful for a search for one of these words to return documents that contain another word in the set. The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. For instance: am, are, is be car, cars, car's, cars' car the boy's cars are different colors the boy car be differ color  Stemming  Lemmatization  lemma saw s see saw The most common algorithm for stemming English, and one that has repeatedly been shown to be empirically very effective, is Porter's algorithm (Porter, 1980). The entire algorithm is too long and intricate to present here, but we will indicate its general nature. Porter's algorithm consists of 5 phases of word reductions, applied sequentially. Within each phase there are various conventions to select rules, such as selecting the rule from each rule group that applies to the longest suffix. In the first phase, this convention is used with the following rule group: Many of the later rules use a concept of the measure of a word, which loosely checks the number of syllables to see whether a word is long enough that it is reasonable to regard the matching portion of a rule as a suffix rather than as part of the stem of a word. For example, the rule: ( )    EMENT     replacement replac cement c http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/  Figure 2.8: A comparison of three stemming algorithms on a sample text. Other stemmers exist, including the older, one-pass Lovins stemmer (Lovins, 1968), and newer entrants like the Paice/Husk stemmer (Paice, 1990); see: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eibe/stemmers/ http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/stemming/ 2.8 Rather than using a stemmer, you can use a lemmatizer , a tool from Natural Language Processing which does full morphological analysis to accurately identify the lemma for each word. Doing full morphological analysis produces at most very modest benefits for retrieval. It is hard to say more, because either form of normalization tends not to improve English information retrieval performance in aggregate - at least not by very much. While it helps a lot for some queries, it equally hurts performance a lot for others. Stemming increases recall while harming precision. As an example of what can go wrong, note that the Porter stemmer stems all of the following words: operate operating operates operation operative operatives operational operate operational and research operating and system operative and dentistry operate system The situation is different for languages with much more morphology (such as Spanish, German, and Finnish). Results in the European CLEF evaluations have repeatedly shown quite large gains from the use of stemmers (and compound splitting for languages like German); see the references in Section 2.5 . Exercises. Are the following statements true or false? In a Boolean retrieval system, stemming never lowers precision. In a Boolean retrieval system, stemming never lowers recall. Stemming increases the size of the vocabulary. Stemming should be invoked at indexing time but not while processing a query. Suggest what normalized form should be used for these words (including the word itself as a possibility): 'Cos Shi'ite cont'd Hawai'i O'Rourke The following pairs of words are stemmed to the same form by the Porter stemmer.

Applying just this rule group, what will the following words be stemmed to? circus canaries boss What rule should be added to correctly stem pony? The stemming for ponies and pony might seem strange.
