 4.4.4 RAVeCompile  RAVeCompile processes the votes recorded by interactive RAVE, creating a relevance assessment file and some statistics about each query and subject. The first step is to map the four-valued relevance assessments into the Boolean relevant/nonrelevant discriminations typically used by standard IR evaluation techniques. RAVeCompile lets the experimenter configure a simple predicate of the following form:  5 = a ï NPoss + b ¶ NRel + c ï NCrit NVote = NPoss + NRel + NCrit  RelP = (NVote gt; Quorum) A (5 * NVote gt; MinAvg) where  s = weighted aggregate score across relevance levels a = weight assigned to votes of "possibly relevant" b = weight assigned to votes of "relevant" c = weight assigned to votes of "critically relevant" NVote = total number of active votes collected for (q, d) pair Quorum = minimum number of votes required for (q, d) to be  considered relevant  MinAvg = minimum weighted sum required for (q, d) to be considered relevant  In one set of experiments [Belew and Hatton, 1996], the data used two predicates constructed in this fashion. These are: 146      FINDING OUT ABOUT  ï  permissive: if (two or more POSSIBLE votes) or (at least one RELEVANT vote)  ï  stringent: if (two or more RELEVANT votes) or (at least one CRITICAL vote)
