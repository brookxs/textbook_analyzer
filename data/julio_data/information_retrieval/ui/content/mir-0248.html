 13.1    Introduction The World Wide Web dates from the end of the 1980s [85] and no one could have imagined its current impact. The boom in the use of the Web and its exponential growth are now well known. Just the amount of textual data available is estimated to be in the order of one terabyte. In addition, other media, such as images, audio, and video, are also available. Thus, the Web can be seen as a very large, unstructured but ubiquitous database. This triggers the need for efficient tools to manage, retrieve, and filter information from this database. This problem is also becoming important in large intranets, where we want to extract or infer new information to support a decision process, a task called data mining. As mentioned in Chapter 1, we make the important distinction between data and information retrieval. We are interested in the latter case, in which the user searches for data that fulfills his information need. We focus on text, because although there are techniques to search for images and other non-textual data, they cannot be applied (yet) on a large scale. We also emphasize syntactic search. That is, we search for Web documents that have user-specified words or patterns in their text. As discussed in Chapter 2, such words or patterns may or may not reflect the intrinsic semantics of the text. An alternative approach to syntactic search is to do a natural language analysis of the text. Although the techniques to preprocess natural language and extract the text semantics are not new, they are not yet very effective and they are also too costly for large amounts of data. In addition, in most cases they are only effective with well structured text, a thesaurus, and other contextual information. There are basically three different forms of searching the Web, Two of them are well known and are frequently used. The first is to use search engines that index a portion of the Web documents as a full-text database. The second is to use Web directories, which classify selected Web documents by subject. The third and not yet fully available, is to search the Web exploiting its hyperlinkf f We will use hyperlink or link to denote a pointer (anchor) from a Web page to another Web page. 367 368        SEARCHING THE WEB structure. We cover all three forms of Web search here. We first discuss the challenges of searching the Web, followed by some Web statistics and models which can be used to understand the complexity of the problem. Next, we discuss in detail the main tools used today to search the Web. The discussion includes search engines, Web directories, hybrid systems, user interfaces, and searching examples. We continue with new query languages that exploit the graphical structure of the Web. Finally, we survey current trends and research issues. As Web research is a very dynamic field, we may have missed some important work, for which we apologize in advance.
