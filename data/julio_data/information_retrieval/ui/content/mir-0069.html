 4.2    Keyword-Based Querying A query is the formulation of a user information need. In its simplest form, a query is composed of keywords and the documents containing such keywords are searched for. Keyword-based queries are popular because they are intuitive, easy to express, and allow for fast ranking. Thus, a query can be (and in many cases is) simply a word, although it can in general be a more complex combination of operations involving several words. In the rest of this chapter we will refer to single-word and multiple-word queries as basic queries.   Patterns, which are covered in section 4.3, are also considered as basic queries.
