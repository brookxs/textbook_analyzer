 15.6.1    Protocols and Federation In the 1980s it became clear that as library catalog systems proliferated, and library patrons sought support for finding items not locally available through inter-library loan or remote cataloging search, some protocol was needed for searching remote bibliographic collections. The national standard Z39.50, which later became an international standard as well, led to intensive development of implementations and subsequent extensive utilization [515]. One example of widespread utilization was the WAIS system (based on Z39.50), very popular before the World Wide Web emerged. Ongoing development of Z39.50 has continued, including its application to digital librarys, as demonstrated in the CIMI project described earlier, where a number of different clients and server implementations all worked together. Also mentioned earlier is the NCSTRL effort, starting with CS technical reports, in which the Dienst protocol was developed [210]. This is a 'lighter' protocol than Z39.50, designed to support federated searching of digital librarys, but also connected to the centralized preprint service (CoRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Dienst seems suitable for electronic theses and dissertations as well as technical reports, and so it has been considered in regard to Ndigital libraryTD. These protocols assume that each server and client will be changed to use the protocol. A less intrusive approach, but one harder to implement and enforce, is to have some mechanism to translate from a special server or gateway system to/from each of the information sources of interest. The STARTS protocol [316] was proposed to move in this direction, but competition among search services on the Internet is so severe that acceptance seems unlikely.   Though 430        DIGITAL LIBRARIES this is unfortunate, simple federated schemes have been implemented in the digital libraryI projects at Stanford and Illinois, and a simple one is in use in Ndigital libraryTD. Yet, even more important than new protocols for digital library federated search is agreement on metadata schemes, which does seem feasible.
