 11.5    Bibiographic Discussion As we have seen, due to their complex nature, the object-oriented paradigm seems the right approach to model multimedia data.    Details about object-oriented database models and architectures can be found in [89].   The object database standard, as defined by the Object Database Management Group, is presented in [150]. On the research side, several models have been proposed for multimedia BIBIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        343 data. Such proposals range from data models suitable for a particular media type, like data models for videos [211, 238, 297, 621], data models for images [170] or models for spatial data [623], to general-purpose multimedia data models [169, 296, 397, 545, 759, 827]. Issues related to the definition and the classification of metadata in the multimedia context are extensively discussed in [99, 442]. Among the systems supporting similarity-based queries, we recall QBIC [257], Name-It [708], QBE [418], Probe [623], and PICQUERY [418]. For additional details about video and image multimedia databases we refer the reader to [405] and [438], respectively. Details about modeling and architectural aspects of the MULTOS system can be found in [759].
