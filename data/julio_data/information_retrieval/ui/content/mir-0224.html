 11.2.2    The MULTOS Data Model MULTOS (KIULTimedia Office Server) is a multimedia document^ server with advanced document retrieval capabilities, developed in the context of an ESPRIT project in the area of Office Systems [759]. MULTOS is based on a client/server architecture. Three different types of document servers are supported: current servers^ dynamic servers, and archive servers, which differ in storage capacity and document retrieval speed. Such servers support filing and retrieval of multimedia objects based on document collections, document types, document attributes, document text, and images. |  As MULTOS deals with office services, in the following we use the words object and document agt;, svnonvnious. 332        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES The MULTOS data model allows the representation of high level concepts present in the documents contained in the database, the grouping of documents into classes of documents having similar content and structure, and the expression of conditions on free text. Each document is described by a logical structure, a layout structure, and a conceptual structure. The logical structure determines arrangements of logical document components (e.g., title, introduction, chapter, section, etc.). The layout structure deals with the layout of the document content and it contains components such as pages, frames, etc. The conceptual structure allows a semantic-oriented description of the document content as opposed to the syntax-oriented description provided by the logical and layout structure. The conceptual structure has been added to provide support for document retrieval by content. MULTOS provides a formal model, based on a data structuring tool available in semantic data models, to define the document conceptual structure. The logical and layout structures are defined according to the ODA document representation [398]. Documents having similar conceptual structures are grouped into conceptual types. In order to handle types in an effective manner, conceptual types are maintained in a hierarchy of generalization, where a subtype inherits from its supertypes the conceptual structure and can then refine it. Types can be strong or weak. A strong type completely specifies the structure of its instances. A weak type, on the other hand, partially specifies the structure of its instances. Moreover, components of unspecified type (called spring component types) can appear in a document definition. Example 1 The conceptual structure of the type Generic .Letter is shown in Figure 11.1. The node Letter_Body is a spring conceptual component. The complete conceptual structure in Figure 11.2 corresponds to the type BusinessJProductJLetter. This type has been obtained from Generic. Letter by specialization of Letter JBody into a complex conceptual component, defined as an aggregation of five conceptual components. According to the conceptual model the document ^peBusiness_Prodnct_Letter is linked to the document type GenericXetter by an kis-a' relationship. In this example, the iJt' symbol attached to the Receiver component means that it is multivalued. Notice also that the Name and the Address appear in two subtrees having as roots the conceptual components Receiver and Sender, respectively. For document retrieval, conceptual types play the role of the database schema which enables the use of efficient access structures. Moreover, conceptual types are the basis for formulating queries at an abstract level. MULTOS also provides a sophisticated approach to deal with image data. First, an image analysis process is performed, consisting of two phases: low level image analysis and high level image analysis. During the low level image analysis phase, the basic objects composing a given image and their relative positions are identified. The high level image analysis phase deals with image interpretation according to the Dempster-Shaffer theory of evidence [60, 312;.

At the end of the image analysis process, images are described in terms of the objects recognized, with associated belief and plausibility values, and the classes to which they belong. The information is then exploited in image access. Image access information is stored in an image header, associated with the image file. Access structures are then built for a fast access to image headers. Two types of index are constructed: ï  Object index. For each object a list is maintained. Each element of the lists is a pair (BI,IMH), where IMH is a pointer to the header of the image containing the object, and BI is the associated belief interval, representing the probability that the image considered really contains the object. ï  Cluster index. For each image class, a list of pairs (MFJMH) is maintained.  IMH is a pointer to an image header corresponding to an image with a non-null degree of membership to the class, and MF is the value of the membership degree.  The membership degree of an image to a given class is computed by comparing the image interpretation resulting from the analysis phase, with the class description, using techniques analogous to the ones used in text IR systems [698] (see Chapter 6). 334        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES
