 MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS       165  53.3 Connections between MDS and LSI  Bartell et al. [Bartell et al., 1994a] have shown that any time the basis of MDS is S, a positive semidefinite matrix of d observations of t variables (cf. Equation 5.15), the LSI decomposition together with inner product similarities provides an optimal MDS scaling. That is, under reasonable conditions MDS and LSI arrive at identical results.  This correspondence is more than a mathematical curiosity. MDS allows generalization of the scaling to any other source of documentdocument similarity information! There are many possible sources of information regarding ways to analyze the similarity of a number of documents; bibliometric information is one practical alternative already mentioned. MDS is potentially important because it allows us to go beyond the set of static features of the corpus, to consider the unending stream of relevance feedback generated by browsing users. Chapter 4 discussed users' relevance feedback assessments in detail. Recall that one of the critical features of relevance feedback information is that it is nonmetric. MDS allows us to define optimal scalings directly from nonmetric relevance feedback data.
