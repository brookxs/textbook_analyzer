 13.3.2    Modeling the Web Can we model the document characteristics of the whole Web? Yes, as has already been discussed partially in Chapter 6. The Heaps' and Zipf's laws are also valid in the Web. In particular, the vocabulary grows faster (larger 3) and the word distribution should be more biased (larger 0). However, there are no experiments on large Web collections to measure these parameters. 372        SEARCHING THE WEB Language	Funredes	Alis Tech.

Crovella, 1998). Right: Right tail distribution for different file types (from Crovella and Bestavros, 1996). All logarithms are in base 10. An additional model is related to the distribution of document sizes. According to this model, the document sizes are self-similar [201], that is, they have a large variance (a similar behavior appears in Web traffic). This can be modeled by two different distributions. The main body of the distribution follows a logarithmic normal distribution, such that the probability of finding a document of size x bytes is given by P(x) 1 -/x)2/2ct2 where the average (/i) and standard deviation (a) are 9.357 and 1.318, respectively [59;. Figure 13.2 (left) shows the size distribution of the experimental data. SEARCH ENGINES        373 The right tail of the distribution is iheavy-tailed.' That is, the majority of documents are small, but there is a non-trivial number of large documents. This is intuitive for image or video files, but it is also true for HTML pages. A good fit is obtained with the Pareto distribution where x is measured in bytes and k and a are parameters of the distribution [59] (see Figure 13.2 (right)). For text files, a is about 1.36, being smaller for images and other binary formats [201, 819]. Taking all Web documents into account, we get a = 1.1 and k = 9.3 Kb [58]. That is, 9.3 Kb is the cut point between both distributions, and 93% of all the files have a size below this value. In fact, for less than 50 Kb, images are the typical files, from 50 to 300 Kb we have an increasing number of audio files, and over that to several megabytes, video files are more frequent. The parameters of these distributions were obtained from a sample of more than 54,000 Web pages requested by several users in a period of two months of 1995. Recent data collected in 1998 show that the size distributions have the same form, but parameters change [58]. Related information can be found on Web benchmarks such as WebSpec96 and the Sun/Inktomi Inkbench [395].
