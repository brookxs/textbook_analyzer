 2.12    Bibliographic Discussion Early in 1960, Maron and Kuhns [547] had already discussed the issues of relevance and probabilistic indexing in information retrieval.  Twenty-three years 70        MODELING later, Salton and McGill wrote a book [698] which became a classic in the field. The book provides a thorough coverage of the three classic models in information retrieval namely, the Boolean, the vector, and the probabilistic models. Another landmark reference is the book by van Rijsbergen [785] which, besides also covering the three classic models, presents a thorough and enjoyable discussion on the probabilistic model. The book edited by Prakes and Baeza-Yates [275] presents several data structures and algorithms for IR and is more recent. Further, it includes a discussion of ranking algorithms by Harman [340] which provides interesting insights into the history of information retrieval from 1960 to 1990. Boolean operations and their implementation are covered in [803]. The inadequacy of Boolean queries for information retrieval was characterized early on by Verhoeff, Goffman, and Belzer [786]. The issue of adapting the Boolean formalism to operate with other frameworks received great attention. Book-stein discusses the problems related with merging Boolean and weighted retrieval systems [101] and the implications of Boolean structure for probabilistic retrieval [103]. Losee and Bookstein [522] cover the usage of Boolean queries with probabilistic retrieval. Anick et al. [21] propose an interface based on natural language for Boolean retrieval. A thesaurus-based Boolean retrieval system is proposed in [493]. The vector model is maybe the most popular model among the research community in information retrieval. Much of this popularity is due to the long-term research of Salton and his associates [697, 704]. Most of this research revolved around the SMART retrieval system developed at Cornell University [695, 842, 696]. Term weighting for the vector model has also been investigated thoroughly. Simple term weighting was used early on by Salton and Lesk [697]. Sparck Jones introduced the idf factor [409, 410] and Salton and Yang verified its effectiveness for improving retrieval [704]. Yu and Salton [842] further studied the effects of term weighting in the final ranking. Salton and Buckley [696] summarize 20 years of experiments in term weighting with the SMART system. Raghavan and Wong [665] provide a critical analysis of the vector model. The probabilistic model was introduced by Robertson and Sparck Jones [677] and is thoroughly discussed in [785]. Experimental studies with the model were conducted by Sparck Jones [411, 412] which used feedback from the user to estimate the initial probabilities. Croft and Harper [199] proposed a method to estimate these probabilities without feedback from the user. Croft [198] later on added within-document frequency weights into the model. Fuhr discusses probabilistic indexing through polynomial retrieval functions [281, 284]. Cooper, Gey, and Dabney [186] and later on Gey [295] propose the use of logistic regression with probabilistic retrieval. Lee and Kantor [494] study the effect of inconsistent expert judgements on probabilistic retrieval. Puhr [282] reviews various variants of the classic probabilistic model. Cooper [187], in a seminal paper, raises troubling questions on the utilization of the probabilistic ranking principle in information retrieval. The inference network model was introduced by Turtle and Croft [772, 771] in 1990. Haines and Croft [332] discuss the utilization of inference networks for user relevance feedback (see Chapter 5).   Callan, Lu, and Croft [139] use an BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        71 inference network to search distributed document collections. Callan [138], in his turn, discusses the application of inference networks to information filtering. The belief network model, due to Ribeiro-Neto and Muntz [674], generalizes the inference network model. The extended Boolean model was introduced by Salton, Fox, and Wu [703]. Lee, Kim, Kim, and Lee [496] discuss the evaluation of Boolean operators with the extended Boolean model, while properties of the model are discussed in [495]. The generalized vector space model was introduced in 1985 by Wong, Ziarko, and Wong [832, 831]. Latent semantic indexing was introduced in 1988 by Furnas, Deerwester, Dumais, Landauer, Harshman, Streeter, and Lochbaum [287]. In a subsequent paper, Bartell, Cottrell, and Belew [62] show that latent semantic indexing can be interpreted as a special case of multidimensional scaling. Regarding neural network models for information retrieval, our discussion in this book is based mainly on the work by Wilkinson and Hingston [815]. But we also benefited from the writings of Kwok on the subject and related topics [466, 467, 469, 468]. The fuzzy set model (for information retrieval) covered in this book is due to Ogawa, Morita, and Kobayashi [616]. The utilization of fuzzy theory in information retrieval goes back to the 1970s with the work of Radecki [658, 659, 660, 661], of Sachs [691], and of Tahani [755]. Bookstein [102] proposes the utilization of fuzzy operators to deal with weighted Boolean searches. Kraft and Buel [461] utilize fuzzy sets to generalize a Boolean system. Miyamoto, Miyake, and Nakayama [567] discuss the generation of a pseudothesaurus using co-occurrences and fuzzy operators. Subsequently, Miyamoto and Nakayama [568] discuss the utilization of this thesaurus with information retrieval systems. Our discussion on structured text is based on the survey by [41]. Another survey of interest (an older one though) is the work by MacLeod [533]. Burkowski [132, 133] proposed a model based on non-overlapping regions. Clarke, Cormack, and Burkowski [173] extended this model with overlapping capabilities. The model based on proximal nodes was proposed by Navarro and Baeza-Yates [589, 590]. In [534], MacLeod introduced a model based on a single hierarchy which also associates attributes with nodes in the hierarchy (for database-like querying) and hypertext links with pairs of nodes. Kilpelainen and Mannila [439] discuss the retrieval from hierarchical texts through the specification of partial patterns. In [183], Consens and Milo discuss algebras for querying text regions. A classic reference on hypertexts is the book by Nielsen [604], Another popular reference is the book by Shneiderman and Kearsley [727]. Conklin [181] presents an introductory survey of the area. The Communications of the ACM dedicated an special edition [177] to hypermedia which discusses in detail the Dexter model รณ a reference standard on the terminology and semantics of basic hypermedia concepts. A subsequent edition [178] was dedicated to the presentation of various models for supporting the design of hypermedia applications.
