 1.1  Definition of Information Retrieval System  An Information Retrieval System is a system that is capable of storage, retrieval, and maintenance of information. Information in this context can be composed of text (including numeric and date data), images, audio, video and other multi-media objects. Although the form of an object in an Information Retrieval System is diverse, the text aspect has been the only data type that lent itself to fall functional processing. The other data types have been treated as highly informative sources, but are primarily linked for retrieval based upon search of the text. Techniques are beginning to emerge to search these other media types (e.g., EXCALIBUR's Visual RetrievaiWare, VIRAGE video indexer). The focus of this book is on research and implementation of search, retrieval and representation of textual and multimedia sources. Commercial development of pattern matching against other data types is starting to be a common function integrated within the total information system. In some systems the text may only be an identifier to display another associated data type that holds the substantive information desired by the system's users (e.g., using closed captioning to locate video of interest.) The term uuser" in this book represents an end user of the information system who has minimal knowledge of computers and technical fields in general.  The term "item" is used to represent the smallest complete unit that is processed and manipulated by the system. The definition of item varies by how a specific source treats information. A complete document, such as a book, newspaper or magazine could be an item. At other times each chapter, or article may be defined as an item. As sources vary and systems include more complex processing, an item may address even lower levels of abstraction such as a contiguous passage of text or a paragraph. For readability, throughout this book the terms "item" and "document" are not in this rigorous definition, but used Introduction to Information Retrieval Systems  interchangeably. Whichever is used, they represent the concept of an item. For most of the book it is best to consider an item as text. But in reality an item may be a combination of many modals of information. For example a video news program could be considered an item. It is composed of text in the form of closed captioning, audio text provided by the speakers, and the video images being displayed. There are multiple "tracks" of information possible in a single item. They are typically correlated by time. Where the text discusses multimedia information retrieval keep this expanded model in mind.  An Information Retrieval System consists of a software program that facilitates a user in finding the information the user needs. The system may use standard computer hardware or specialized hardware to support the search subftmction and to convert non-textual sources to a searchable media (e.g., transcription of audio to text). The gauge of success of an information system is how well it can minimize the overhead for a user to find the needed information. Overhead from a user's perspective is the time required to find the information needed, excluding the time for actually reading the relevant data. Thus search composition, search execution, and reading non-relevant items are all aspects of information retrieval overhead.  The first Information Retrieval Systems originated with the need to organize information in central repositories (e.g., libraries) (Hyman-82). Catalogues were created to facilitate the identification and retrieval of items. Chapter 3 reviews the history of cataloging and indexing. Original definitions focused on "documents" for information retrieval (or their surrogates) rather than the multi-media integrated information that is now available (Minker-77, Minker77.)  As computers became commercially available, they were obvious candidates for the storage and retrieval of text. Early introduction of Database Management Systems provided an ideal platform for electronic manipulation of the indexes to information (Rather-77). Libraries followed the paradigm of their catalogs and references by migrating the format and organization of their hardcopy information references into structured databases. These remain as a primary mechanism for researching sources of needed information and play a major role in available Information Retrieval Systems. Academic research that was pursued through the 1980s was constrained by the paradigm of the indexed structure associated with libraries and the lack of computer power to handle large (gigabyte) text databases. The Military and other Government entities have always had a requirement to store and search large textual databases. As a result they began many independent developments of textual Information Retrieval Systems. Given the large quantities of data they needed to process, they pursued both research and development of specialized hardware and unique software solutions incorporating Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) products where possible. The Government has been the major fending source of research into Information Retrieval Systems. With the advent of inexpensive powerful personnel computer processing systems and   high   speed,   large  capacity  secondary  storage  products,   it   has  become Chapter  commercially feasible to provide large textual information databases for the average user. The introduction and exponential growth of the Internet along with its initial WAIS (Wide Area Information Servers) capability and more recently advanced search servers (e.g., INFOSEEK, EXCITE) has provided a new avenue for access to terabytes of information (over 800 million indexable pages Lawrence-99.) The algorithms and techniques to optimize the processing and access of large quantities of textual data were once the sole domain of segments of the Government, a few industries, and academics. They have now become a needed capability for large quantities of the population with significant research and development being done by the private sector. Additionally the volumes of nontextual information are also becoming searchable using specialized search capabilities. Images across the Internet are searchable from many web sites such as WEBSEEK, DITTO.COM, ALTAVISTA/IMAGES. News organizations such as the BBC are processing the audio news they have produced and are making historical audio news searchable via the audio transcribed versions of the news. Major video organizations such as Disney are using video indexing to assist in finding specific images in their previously produced videos to use in future videos or incorporate in advertising. With exponential growth of multi-media on the Internet capabilities such as these are becoming common place. Information Retrieval exploitation of multi-media is still in its infancy with significant theoretical and practical knowledge missing.
