 7.4.1 Modeling Documents  The general framework of empirical Bayesian estimation is broad and powerful enough that it has been applied in many contexts. The hard 270      FINDING OUT ABOUT  work comes, however, in specifying just how the parametric model Â© is to be constructed from a set of individual parameters 0; and how these can be estimated from the training data. Principled approaches to the text classification problem require specification of explicit models of how documents are generated. Two models of the event space underlying our construction of hypothetical documents have been proposed [McCallum and Nigam, 1998], and we consider each of these below.  One critical, simplifying assumption shared by both models is that the features occur independently in the documents. As we have discussed a number of times, any such naive Bayesian model will miss a great many of the interactions arising among real words in real documents. It is somewhat curious, then, that such naive classifiers do as well as they do [Domingos and Pazzani, 1997].  Multivariate Bernoulli  Arguably the simplest model captures only the presence or absence of words in the document. That is, the document is modeled as the composition of k keywords drawn from the Vocab as so many independent Bernoulli trials. We imagine that a document d is constructed by repeatOrdered              edly selecting |d| words for each position in the document.^ sequence                   jf we associate a biased coin with each keyword k, we can decompose the desired model 0 into two sets of parameters:  6c = Pr(c)                                     (7.10)  eck = Pr(k\c)                                 (7.11)  i.e., the prior probability of each class c and the probability that a keyword is present given that we know a document containing it is in class c. Then the naive Bayesian assumption allows us to assume that the keywords occur at each positional location independently of one another:  eck                               (7.12)  Jt=i ADAPTIVE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL       271  Multinomial  An alternative model of document generation is as repeated draws from an urn of words containing all the keywords in the Vocab. This gives rise to a multinomial model that is sensitive to the frequency fa of keywords' occurrence in dy rather than just their presence or absence:*  gfdk  f]   -f-            (7.13)
