 5.3.1    Query Expansion Through Local Clustering Adoption of clustering techniques for query expansion is a basic approach which has been attempted since the early years of information retrieval. The standard approach is to build global structures such as association matrices which quantify term correlations (for instance, number of documents in which two given terms co-occur) and to use correlated terms for query expansion. The main problem with this strategy is that there is not consistent evidence that global structures can be used effectively to improve retrieval performance with general collections. One main reason seems to be that global structures do not adapt well to the local context defined by the current query. One approach to deal with this effect is to devise strategies which aim at optimizing the current search. Such strategies are based on local clustering and are now discussed. Our discussion is based on the original work by Attar and Praenkel which appeared in 1977. We first define basic terminology as follows. Definition Let V(s) be a non-empty subset of words which are grammatical variants of each other. A canonical form s ofV(s) is called a stem. For instance, if V(s)={polish,polishing,polished} then $=polish. For a detailed discussion on stemming algorithms see Chapter 7. While stems are adopted in our discussion, the ideas below are also valid for non-stemmed keywords. We proceed with a characterization of the local nature of the strategies covered here. Definition For a given query q, the set D\ of documents retrieved is called the local document set Further, the set V/ of all distinct words in the local document set is called the local vocabulary. The set of all distinct stems derived from the set Vi is referred to as Si. We operate solely on the documents retrieved for the current query. Since it is frequently necessary to access the text of such documents, the application of local strategies to the Web is unlikely at this time. In fact, at a client machine, retrieving the text of 100 Web documents for local analysis would take too long, reducing drastically the interactive nature of Web interfaces and the satisfaction of the users. Further, at the search engine site, analyzing the text of 100 Web documents would represent an extra spending of CPU time which is not cost effective at this time (because search engines depend on processing a high number of queries per unit of time for economic survival). However, local strategies might be quite useful in the environment of intranets such as, for instance, the collection of documents issued by a large business company. Further, local strategies might also be of great assistance for searching information in specialized document collections (for instance, medical document collections). Local feedback strategies are based on expanding the query with terms correlated to the query terms. Such correlated terms are those present in local dusters built from the local document set.   Thus, before we discuss local AUTOMATIC LOCAL ANALYSIS        125 query expansion, we discuss strategies for building local clusters. Three types of clusters are covered: association clusters, metric clusters, and scalar clusters. Association Clusters An association cluster is based on the co-occurrence of stems (or terms) inside documents. The idea is that stems which co-occur frequently inside documents have a synonymity association. Association clusters are generated as follows. Definition The frequency of a stem Si in a document dj, dj G Di, is referred to as fs,L,j- Let m=(mij) be an association matrix with \Si\ rows and \Di\ columns, where mlJ=fs%j. Let fhl be the transpose of m. The matrix s=mfht is a local stem-stem association matrix. Each element su^v in s expresses a correlation cu,v between the stems $u and sv namely, The correlation factor cUiV quantifies the absolute frequencies of co-occurrence and is said to be unnormalized. Thus, if we adopt su,v = cu,v                                                                                                      (5.6) then the association matrix s is said to be unnormalized.  An alternative is to normalize the correlation factor. For instance, if we adopt then the association matrix s is said to be normalized. The adoption of normalization yields quite distinct associations as discussed below. Given a local association matrix s, we can use it to build local association clusters as follows. Definition Consider the u-th row in the association matrix s (i.e., the row with all the associations for the stem su). Let Su(n) be a function which takes the u-th row and returns the set of n largest values sUiV1 where v varies over the set of local stems and v ^ u.  Then Su(n) defines a local association cluster around the stem su. If su,v is given by equation 5.6, the association cluster is said to be unnormalized. If su^v is given by equation 5.7f the association cluster is said to be normalized. Given a query q, we are normally interested in finding clusters only for the \q\ query terms. Further, it is desirable to keep the size of such clusters small This means that such clusters can be computed efficiently at query time. 126        QUERY OPERATIONS Despite the fact that the above clustering procedure adopts stems, it can equally be applied to non-stemmed keywords. The procedure remains unchanged except for the usage of keywords instead of stems. Keyword-based local clustering is equally worthwhile trying because there is controversy over the advantages of using a stemmed vocabulary, as discussed in Chapter 7. Metric Clusters Association clusters are based on the frequency of co-occurrence of pairs of terms in documents and do not take into account where the terms occur in a document. Since two terms which occur in the same sentence seem more correlated than two terms which occur far apart in a document, it might be worthwhile to factor in the distance between two terms in the computation of their correlation factor. Metric clusters are based on this idea. Definition Let the distance r(kt,kj) between two keywords kt and k3 be given by the number of words between them in a same document. If k2 and k3 are in distinct documents we take r(ki,kj) = oo. A local stem-stem metric correlation matrix s is defined as follows. Each element su,v of s expresses a metric correlation cu,v between the stems su and sv namely; In this expression, as already defined, V(su) and V(sv) indicate the sets of keywords which have su and sv as their respective stems. Variations of the above expression for cu,L. have been reported in the literature (such as l/r2(ki, kj)) but the differences in experimental results are not remarkable. The correlation factor cu^v quantifies absolute inverse distances and is said to be unnormalized. Thus, if we adopt then the association matrix s is said to be unnormalized.  An alternative is to normalize the correlation factor. For instance, if we adopt (5.9) u'v     |V'(M| x \V(sv)\ then the association matrix sis said to be normalized. Given a local metric matrix s*. we can use it to build local metric clusters as follows. Definition     Consider the u-th row in the metric correlation matrix s (i.e., the row with all the associations for tht stern su).   Let Su(n) be a function which AUTOMATIC LOCAL ANALYSIS         127 takes the u-th row and returns the set of n largest values su^v, where v varies over the set of local stems and v ^ u. Then Su(n) defines a local metric cluster around the stem su. If su,v is given by equation 5.8, the metric cluster is said to be unnormalized. If su^v is given by equation 5.9, the metric cluster is said to be normalized. ScaSar Clusters One additional form of deriving a synonymity relationship between two local stems (or terms) su and sv is by comparing the sets Su(n) and Sv(n). The idea is that two stems with similar neighborhoods have some synonymity relationship. In this case we say that the relationship is indirect or induced by the neighborhood. One way of quantifying such neighborhood relationships is to arrange all correlation values su^ in a vector su, to arrange all correlation values sVil in another vector svi and to compare these vectors through a scalar measure. For instance, the cosine of the angle between the two vectors is a popular scalar similarity measure. Definition Let su = (su,i, su$-gt; ï ï ï 1 su,n) and sv = (sw,i, sL,,2, ï - ï, Sy,n) be two vectors of correlation values for the stems su and sv. Further, let s = {su%v) be a scalar association matrix.  Then, each su^v can be defined as \SU\  X  Kl The correlation matrix sis said to be induced by the neighborhood. Using it. a scalar cluster is then defined as follows. Definition Let Su(n) be a function which returns the set of n largest values su,v, v y£ u7 defined according to equation 5.10. Then, Su{n) defines a scalar cluster around the stem su. Interactive Search Formulation Stems (or terms) that belong to clusters associated to the query stems (or terms) can be used to expand the original query. Such stems are called neighbors (of the query stems) and are characterized as follows. A stem su which belongs to a cluster (of size n) associated to another stem sv (i.e., su G Sv(n)) is said to be a neighbor of sv. Sometimes, su is also called a searchonym of sv but here we opt for using the terminology neighbor. While neighbor sterns are said to have a synonymity relationship, they are not necessarily synonyms in the grammatical sense. Often, neighbor steins represent distinct keywords which are though correlated by the current query context. The local aspect of this correlation is reflected in the fact that the documents and stems considered in the correlation matrix are all local (i.e., dj E Alt; su Ä V}). 128        QUERY OPERATIONS Figure 5.1    Stem su as a neighbor of the stem sv. Figure 5.1 illustrates a stem (or term) su which is located within a neighborhood Sv(n) associated with the stem (or term) sv. In its broad meaning, neighbor stems are an important product of the local clustering process since they can be used for extending a search formulation in a promising unexpected direction, rather than merely complementing it with missing synonyms. Consider the problem of expanding a given user query q with neighbor stems (or terms). One possibility is to expand the query as follows. For each stem sv Ä q, select m neighbor stems from the cluster Sv(n) (which might be of type association, metric, or scalar) and add them to the query. Hopefully, the additional neighbor stems will retrieve new relevant documents. To cover a broader neighborhood, the set Sv(n) might be composed of stems obtained using correlation factors (i.e., cUilgt;) normalized and unnormalized. The qualitative interpretation is that an unnormalized cluster tends to group stems whose ties are due to their large frequencies, while a normalized cluster tends to group stems which are more rare. Thus, the union of the two clusters provides a better representation of the possible correlations. Besides the merging of normalized and unnormalized clusters, one can also use information about correlated stems to improve the search. For instance, as before, let two stems $u and sv be correlated with a correlation factor cu,v. If cu,v is larger than a predefined threshold then a neighbor stem of su can also be interpreted as a neighbor stem of sv and vice versa. This provides greater flexibility, particularly with Boolean queries. To illustrate, consider the expression (su -f sv) where the + symbol stands for disjunction- Let su* be a neighbor stem of su. Then, one can try both (sugt; + sv) and (su-t-su') as synonym search expressions, because of the correlation given by cu^v. AUTOMATIC LOCAL ANALYSIS         129 Experimental results reported in the literature usually support the hypothesis of the usefulness of local clustering methods. Furthermore, metric clusters seem to perform better than purely association clusters. This strengthens the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the association of two terms and the distance between them. We emphasize that all the qualitative arguments in this section are explicitly based on the fact that all the clusters are local (i.e., derived solely from the documents retrieved for the current query). In a global context, clusters are derived from all the documents in the collection which implies that our qualitative argumentation might not stand. The main reason is that correlations valid in the whole corpora might not be valid for the current query.
