 6.5    Multimedia Multimedia usually stands for applications that handle different types of digital data originating from distinct types of media. The most common types of media in multimedia applications are text, sound, images, and video (which is an animated sequence of images). The digital data originating from each of these four MULTIMEDIA        157 types of media is quite distinct in volume, format, and processing requirements (for instance, video and audio impose real time constraints on their processing). As an immediate consequence, different types of formats are necessary for storing each type of media. In this section we cover formats and standard languages for multimedia applications. In contrast with text formats, most formats for multimedia are partially binary and hence can only be processed by a computer. Also, the presentation style is almost completely defined, perhaps with the exception of some spatial or temporal attributes.
