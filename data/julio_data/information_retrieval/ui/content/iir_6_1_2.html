    Learning weights   machine-learned relevance 15  We are provided with a set of training examples, each of which is a tuple consisting of a query and a document , together with a relevance judgment for on . In the simplest form, each relevance judgments is either Relevant or Non-relevant. More sophisticated implementations of the methodology make use of more nuanced judgments. The weights are then ``learned'' from these examples, in order that the learned scores approximate the relevance judgments in the training examples. For weighted zone scoring, the process may be viewed as learning a linear function of the Boolean match scores contributed by the various zones. The expensive component of this methodology is the labor-intensive assembly of user-generated relevance judgments from which to learn the weights, especially in a collection that changes frequently (such as the Web). We now detail a simple example that illustrates how we can reduce the problem of learning the weights to a simple optimization problem. We now consider a simple case of weighted zone scoring, where each document has a title zone and a body zone. Given a query and a document , we use the given Boolean match function to compute Boolean variables and , depending on whether the title (respectively, body) zone of matches query . For instance, the algorithm in Figure 6.4 uses an AND of the query terms for this Boolean function. We will compute a score between 0 and 1 for each (document, query) pair using and by using a constant , as follows:  (14)   training examples      Relevant Non-relevant 6.5 Figure 6.5: An illustration of training examples.
