 1.6    How to Use this Book Although several people have contributed chapters for this book, it is really a textbook. The contents and the structure of the book have been carefully designed by the two main authors who also authored or coauthored nine of the 15 chapters in the book. Further, all the contributed chapters have been judiciously edited and integrated into a unifying framework that provides uniformity in structure and style, a common glossary, a common bibliography, and appropriate cross-references. At the end of each chapter, a discussion on research issues, trends, and selected bibliography is included. This discussion should be useful for graduate students as well as for researchers. Furthermore, the book is complemented by a Web page with additional information and resources.
