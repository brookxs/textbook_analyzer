 2.8.4    Comparison of Bayesian Network Models There is a close resemblance between the belief network model and the inference network model. However, this resemblance hides important differences between the two models. First, the belief network model is based on a set-theoretic view 60        MODELING of the IR ranking problem and adopts a clearly defined sample space. The inference network model takes a purely epistemological view of the IR problem which is more difficult to grasp (because, for instance, the sample space is not clearly defined). Second, the belief network model provides a separation between the document and the query portions of the network which facilitates the modeling of additional evidential sources such as past queries and past relevance information. Third, as a result of this document-query space separation, the belief network model is able to reproduce any ranking strategy generated by the inference network model while the converse is not true. To see that the belief network ranking subsumes any ranking generated by an inference network, compare equations 2.6 and 2.13. The key distinction is between the terms P(d3\k) and P(k\d3). For the latter, instantiation of the document node dj separates the index term nodes making them mutually independent. Thus, the joint probability P(k\d3) can always be computed as the product of the individual probabilities P(kl\dj). However, the computation of P(dj\k) might be non-decomposable in a product of term-based probabilities. As a result, P(d3\k) can express any probability function denned with P{k\d3) while the converse is not true. One should not infer from the above comparison that the inference network model is not a good model. On the contrary, it has been shown in the literature that the inference network model allows top retrieval performance to be accomplished with general collections. Further, it is the retrieval model used by the Inquery system. The point of the comparison is that, from a theoretical point of view, the belief network model is more general. Also, it provides a separation between the document space and the query space which simplifies the modeling task.
