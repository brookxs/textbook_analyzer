 10.3    The Information Access Process A person engaged in an information seeking process has one or more goals in mind and uses a search system as a tool to help achieve those goals. Goals requiring information access can range quite widely, from finding a plumber to keeping informed about a business competitor, from writing a publishable scholarly article to investigating an allegation of fraud. Information access tasks are used to achieve these goals. These tasks span the spectrum from asking specific questions to exhaustively researching a topic. Other tasks fall between these two extremes. A study of business analysts [614] found three main kinds of information seeking tasks: monitoring a well known topic over time (such as researching competitors' activities each quarter), following a plan or stereotyped series of searches to achieve a particular goal (such as keeping up to date on good business practices), and exploring a topic in an undirected fashion (m when getting to know an unfamiliar industry). Although the goals differ, there is a common core revolving around the information seeking component, which is our focus here.
