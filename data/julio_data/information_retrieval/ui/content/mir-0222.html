 11.2    Data Modeling As we have already remarked, the complex nature of multimedia data may benefit from the use of DBMS functions for data representation and querying. However, the integration of multimedia data in a traditional DBMS is not an easy task. Indeed, traditional DBMSs are mainly targeted to support conventional data. Multimedia data is inherently different from conventional data. The main difference is that information about the content of multimedia data are usually not encoded into attributes provided by the data schema (structured data). Rather, text, image, video, and audio data are typically unstructured. Therefore, specific methods to identify and represent content features and semantic structures of multimedia data are needed. Another distinguishing feature of multimedia data is its large storage requirements. One single image usually requires several Kbytes of storage, whereas a single second of video can require several Mbytes of storage. Moreover, the content of multimedia data is difficult to analyze and compare, in order to be actively used during query processing. Addressing data modeling issues in the framework of Multimedia IR systems entails two main tasks. First, a data model should be defined by which the user can specify the data to be stored into the system. Such a data model should have the ability of an integrated support for both conventional and multimedia data types and should provide methods to analyze, retrieve, and query such data. Second, the system should provide a model for the internal representation of multimedia data. The definition of such a model is crucial for the efficiency of query processing. As far as the first aspect is concerned, a promising technology with respect to the modeling requirements of multimedia data is the object-oriented one [89]. The richness of the data model provided by OODBMSs makes them more suitable than relational DBMSs for modeling both multimedia data types and their semantic relationships. Moreover, the concept of class can be naturally used to define ad hoc data types for multimedia data in that a class is characterized by both a set of attributes and a set of operations that can be performed on these attributes. Classes can, moreover, be related into inheritance hierarchies, thus allowing the definition of a multimedia class as a specialization of one or more superclasses. However, the performance of OODBMs in terms of storage techniques, query processing, and transaction management is not comparable to that of relational DBMSs. Another drawback of OODBMs is that they are highly non-standard. Indeed, even though a standard language has been defined by the Object Database Management Group (ODMG), very few systems support it. For all the above reasons, a lot of effort lias been devoted to the extension of the relational model with capabilities for modeling complex objects, typical of the object-oriented context. The goal of the so-called object-relational technology is to extend the relational model with the ability of representing complex data types by maintaining, at the same time, the performance and the simplicity of relational DBMSs and related query languages. The possibility of defining abstract data types inside the relational model allows one to define ad hoc data types for multimedia data. For instance, such data typ**s ran provide support for DATA MODELING        329 content-dependent queries. In the following section, we will give some examples of such extensions. The second problem related to data modeling is how multimedia data are represented inside the system. Due to the particular nature of multimedia data, it is not sufBcient to describe it through a set of attributes as usually done with traditional data. Rather, some information should be extracted from the objects and used during query processing. The extracted information is typically represented as a set of features; each multimedia object is therefore internally represented as a list of features, each of which represents a point in a multidimensional space. Multi-at tribute access methods can then be used to index and search for them (see Chapter 12). Features can be assigned to multimedia objects either manually by the user, or automatically by the system. In general, a hybrid approach is used, by which the system determines some of the values and the user corrects or augments them. In both cases, values assigned to some specific features, such as the shape of an image or the style of an audio object, are assigned to the object by comparing the object with some previously classified objects. For instance, to establish whether an image represents a car or a house, the shape of the image is compared with the shapes of already classified cars and houses before taking a decision. Finally, it is important to recall that feature extraction cannot be precise. Therefore, a weight is usually assigned to each feature value representing the uncertainty of assigning such a value to that feature. For example, if we are 80% sure that a shape is a square, we can store this value together with the recognized shape. From the previous discussion, it follows that data modeling in a Multimedia IR system is an articulated activity that must take into account both the complex structure of data and the need of representing features extracted from multimedia objects. In the following, we give a brief overview of some proposals to model multimedia data. We start by reviewing the support for multimedia data provided by commercial DBMSs. Then, as an example of a research proposal we survey the data model developed in the context of the MULTOS project.
