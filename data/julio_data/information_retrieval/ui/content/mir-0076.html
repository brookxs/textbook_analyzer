 4.4.1    Fixed Structure The structure allowed in texts was traditionally quite restrictive. The documents had a fixed set of fields, much like a filled form. Each field had some text inside. Some fields were not present in all documents. Only rarely could the fields appear in any order or repeat across a document. A document could not have text not classified under any field. Fields were not allowed to nest or overlap. The retrieval activity allowed on them was restricted to specifying that a given basic pattern was to be found only in a given field. Most current commercial systems use this model. This model is reasonable when the text collection has a fixed structure. For instance, a mail archive could be regarded as a set of mails, where each mail has a sender, a receiver, a date, a subject, and a body field. The user can thus search for the mails sent to a given person with 'football' in the subject field. However, the model is inadequate to represent the hierarchical structure present in an HTML document, for instance. If the division of the text into fields is rigid enough, the content of some fields can even be interpreted not as text but as numbers, dates, etc. thereby allowing different queries to be posed on them (e.g., month ranges in dates). It is not hard to see that this idea leads naturally to the relational model, each field corresponding to a column in the database table. Looking at the database as a text allows us to query the textual fields with much more power than is common in relational database systems. On the other hand, relational databases may make better use of their knowledge on the data types involved to build specialized and more efficient indices. A number of approaches towards combining these trends have been proposed in recent years, their main problem being that they do not achieve optimal performance because the text is usually stored together with other types of data. Nevertheless, there are several proposals that extend SQL (Structured Query Language) to allow full-text retrieval. Among them we can mention proposals by leading relational database vendors such as Oracle and Sybase, as well as SFQL, which is covered in section 4.5.
