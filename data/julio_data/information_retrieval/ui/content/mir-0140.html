 8.3.1    Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays Inverted indices assume that the text can be seen as a sequence of words. This restricts somewhat the kinds of queries that can be answered. Other queries such as phrases are expensive to solve. Moreover, the concept of word does not exist in some applications such as genetic databases. In this section we present suffix arrays. Suffix arrays are a space efficient implementation of suffix trees. This type of index allows us to answer efficiently more complex queries. Its main drawbacks are its costly construction process, that the text must be readily available at query time, and that the results are not delivered in text position order. This structure can be used to index only words (without stopwords) as the inverted index as well as to index any text character. This makes it suitable for a wider spectrum of applications, such as genetic databases. However, for word-based applications, inverted files perform better unless complex queries are an important issue. This index sees the text as one long string. Each position in the text is considered as a text suffix (i.e., a string that goes from that text position to the end of the text). It is not difficult to see that two suffixes starting at different positions are lexicographically different (assume that a character smaller than all the rest is placed at the end of the text). Each suffix is thus uniquely identified by its position. Not all text positions need to be indexed. Index points are selected from the text, which point to the beginning of the text positions which will be retrievable. For instance, it is possible to index only word beginnings to have a functionality similar to inverted indices. Those elements which are not index points are not retrievable (as in an inverted index it is not possible to retrieve the middle of a word). Figure 8.5 illustrates this. Structure In essence, a suffix tree is a trie data structure built over all the suffixes of the text. The pointers to the suffixes are stored at the leaf nodes. To improve space utilization, this trie is compacted into a Patricia tree. This involves compressing unary paths, i.e. paths where each node has just one child. An indication of the next character position to consider is stored at the nodes which root a compressed path. Once unary paths are not present the tree has O(n) nodes instead of the worst-case O(n2) of the trie (see Figure 8.6). 200        INDEXING AND SEARCHING This is a text. A text has many words.

Suffix Trie Suffix Tree Text Figure 8.6    The suffix trie and suffix tree for the sample text. The problem with this structure is its space. Depending on the implementation, each node of the trie takes 12 to 24 bytes, and therefore even if only word beginnings are indexed, a space overhead of 120% to 240% over the text size is produced. Suffix arrays provide essentially the same functionality as suffix trees with much less space requirements. If the leaves of the suffix tree are traversed in left-to-right order (top to bottom in our figures), all the suffixes of the text are retrieved in lexicographical order. A suffix array is simply an array containing all the pointers to the text suffixes listed in lexicographical order, as shown in Figure 8,7. Since they store one pointer per indexed suffix, the space requirements OTHER INDICES FOR TEXT        201 1	6	9	11	17	19	24	28	33	40	46	50	55	60 This	is	a	text.	A	text	has	many	words.

One out of three entries are sampled, keeping their first four characters. The pointers (arrows) are in fact unnecessary. are almost the same as those for inverted indices (disregarding compression techniques), i.e. close to 40% overhead over the text size. Suffix arrays are designed to allow binary searches done by comparing the contents of each pointer. If the suffix array is large (the usual case), this binary search can perform poorly because of the number of random disk accesses. To remedy this situation, the use of supra-indices over the suffix array has been proposed. The simplest supra-index is no more than a sampling of one out of b suffix array entries, where for each sample the first Â£ suffix characters are stored in the supra-index. This supra-index is then used as a first step of the search to reduce external accesses. Figure 8.8 shows an example. This supra-index does not in fact need to take samples at fixed intervals, nor to take samples of the same length. For word-indexing suffix arrays it has been suggested that a new sample could be taken each time the first word of the suffix changes, and to store the word instead of I characters. This is exactly the same as having a vocabulary of the text plus pointers to the array. In fact, the only important difference between this structure and an inverted index is that the occurrences of each word in an inverted index are sorted by text position, while in a suffix array they are sorted lexicographically by the text following the word. Figure 8.9 illustrates this relationship. The extra space requirements of supra-indices are modest. In particular, it is clear that the space requirements of the suffix array with a vocabulary supra-index are exactly the same as for inverted indices (except for compression, as we see later). 202       INDEXING AND SEARCHING 1	6	9	11	17	19	24	28	33	40	46	50	55	60 This	is	a	text.

Searching If a suffix tree on the text can be afforded, many basic patterns such as words, prefixes, and phrases can be searched in O(m) time by a simple trie search. However, suffix trees are not practical for large texts, as explained. Suffix arrays, on the other hand, can perform the same search operations in O(logn) time by doing a binary search instead of a trie search. This is achieved as follows: the search pattern originates two 'limiting patterns5 Pi and P2, so that we want any suffix S such that Pi lt; S lt; iV We binary search both limiting patterns in the suffix array. Then, all the elements lying between both positions point to exactly those suffixes that start like the original pattern (i.e., to the pattern positions in the text). For instance, in our example of figure 8.9, in order to find the word 'text1 we search, for 'text' and ktexu\ obtaining the portion of the array that contains the pointers 19 and 11. Ail these queries retrieve a subtree of the suffix tree or an interval of the suffix array. The results have to be collected later, which may imply sorting them in ascending text order. This is a complication of suffix trees or arrays with respect to inverted indices. Simple phrase searching is a good case for these indices. A simple phrase of words can be searched as if it was a simple pattern. This is because the suffix tree/array sorts with respect to the complete suffixes and not only their first word. A proximity search, on the other hand, has to be solved element-wise. The matches for each element must be collected and sorted and then they have to be intersected as for inverted files. The binary search performed on suffix arrays, unfortunately, is done on disk, where the accesses to (random) text positions force a seek operation which spans the disk tracks containing the text. Since a random seek is O(n) in'size, this makes the search cost O(n logn) time. Supra-indices are used as a first step in any binary search operation to alleviate this problem. To avoid performing O(log n) random accesses to the ivxt on disk (and to the suffix array on disk), the search starts in the supra-index, which usually fits in main memory (text samples OTHER INDICES FOR TEXT        203 included). After this search is completed, the suffix array block which is between the two selected samples is brought into memory and the binary search is completed (performing random accesses to the text on disk). This reduces disk search times to close to 25% of the original time. Modified binary search techniques that sacrifice the exact partition in the middle of the array taking into account the current disk head position allow a further reduction from 40% to 60%. Search times in a 250 Mb text in our reference machine are close to 1 second for a simple word or phrase, while the part corresponding to the accesses to the text sums up 0.6 seconds. The use of supra-indices should put the total time close to 0.3 seconds. Note that the times, although high for simple words, do not degrade for long phrases as with inverted indices. Construction in Main Memory A suffix tree for a text of n characters can be built in O(n) time. The algorithm, however, performs poorly if the suffix tree does not fit in main memory, which is especially stringent because of the large space requirements of the suffix trees. We do not cover the linear algorithm here because it is quite complex and only of theoretical interest. We concentrate on direct suffix array construction. Since the suffix array is no more than the set of pointers lexicographically sorted, the pointers are collected in ascending text order and then just sorted by the text they point to. Note that in order to compare two suffix array entries the corresponding text positions must be accessed. These accesses are basically random. Hence, both the suffix array and the text must be in main memory. This algorithm costs O(n log n) string comparisons. An algorithm to build the suffix array in O(nlogn) character comparisons follows. All the suffixes are bucket-sorted in O(n) time according to the first letter only. Then, each bucket is bucket-sorted again, now according to their first two letters. At iteration i, the suffixes begin already sorted by their 22""1 first letters and end up sorted by their first 2% letters. As at each iteration the total cost of all the bucket sorts is O(n), the total time is O(nlogn), and the average is O(n log log n) (since O(logn) comparisons are necessary on average to distinguish two suffixes of a text). This algorithm accesses the text only in the first stage (bucket sort for the first letter). In order to sort the strings in the i-th iteration, notice that since all suffixes are sorted by their first 2i~"1 letters, to sort the text positions To... and IL, in the suffix array (assuming that they are in the same bucket, i.e., they share their first 2i~1 letters), it is enough to determine the relative order between text positions Ta+2*~i and T^*-1 m the current stage of the search. This can be done in constant time by storing the reverse permutation. We do not enter here into further detail. Construction of Suffix Arrays for Large Texts There is still the problem that large text databases will not fit in main memory. It could be possible to apply an external memory sorting algorithm. However, 204        INDEXING AND SEARCHING each comparison involves accessing the text at random positions on the disk. This will severely degrade the performance of the sorting process. We explain an algorithm especially designed for large texts. Split the text into blocks that can be sorted in main memory. Then, for each block, build its suffix array in main memory and merge it with the rest of the array already built for the previous text. That is: Ã¯  build the suffix array for the first block, Ã¯  build the suffix array for the second block, Ã¯  merge both suffix arrays, Ã¯  build the suffix array for the third block, Ã¯  merge the new suffix array with the previous one, Ã¯  build the suffix array for the fourth block, Ã¯  merge the new suffix array with the previous one, Ã¯  ... and so on. The difficult part is how to merge a large suffix array (already built) with the small suffix array (just built). The merge needs to compare text positions which are spread in a large text, so the problem persists. The solution is to first determine how many elements of the large array are to be placed between each pair of elements in the small array, and later use that information to merge the arrays without accessing the text. Hence, the information that we need is how many suffixes of the large text lie between each pair of positions of the small suffix array. We compute counters that store this information. The counters are computed without using the large suffix array. The text corresponding to the large array is sequentially read into main memory. Each suffix of that text is searched in the small suffix array (in main memory). Once we find the inter-element position where the suffix lies, we just increment the appropriate counter. Figure 8.10 illustrates this process. We analyze this algorithm now. If there is O(M) main memory to index, then there will be O(nfAl) text blocks. Each block is merged against an array of size O(n), where all the O(n) suffixes of the large text are binary searched in the small suffix array. This gives a total CPU complexity of O(n2 log(M)/M). Notice that this same algorithm can be used for index maintenance. If a new text of size n' is added to the database, it can be split into blocks as before and merged block-wise into the current suffix array. This will take O(nn'\og{M)/M). To delete some text it suffices to perform an O(n) pass over the array eliminating all the text positions which lie in the deleted areas. As can be seen, the construction process is in practice more costly for suffix arrays than for inverted files. The construction of the supra-index consists of a fast final sequential pass over the suffix array. Indexing times for 250 Mb of text are close to 0.8 Mb/niin on the reference machine. This is five to ten times slower than the construction of inverted indices.
