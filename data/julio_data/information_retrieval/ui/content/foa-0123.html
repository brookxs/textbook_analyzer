 63 Keyword Structures  Most of what we have said about the Index relation (e.g., as part of the vector space model) assumes that keywords are simply a set of features.  But beyond simply providing access to the retrieval of documents, the fact that keywords are meaning-fill objects in their own right means that  we can analyze relationships among keywords directly.  Thesauri are structured representations of relations among keywords. Common relations represented in thesauri include:  ï  broader term/narrower term (BT/NT); these capture hierarchic relations, generally between a kind of semantics* sometimes a partwhole relation.  ï  related term (RT), capturing synonym or quasi-synonym relationships.  ï  use for (UF), capturing a preferred, conventional, or authoritative term over possible alternatives. INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      211  One of the most extensive examples of such a representation is the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) thesaurus, part of the National Library of Medicine's extensive PubMed system. Figure 6.14 shows the term LYMPHOMA within the MeSH thesaurus.* Example hierarchic BT/NT relations are shown as indentation. Because this thesaurus allows a single keyword to fit in multiple places in the hierarchy (e.g., treating LYMPHOMA as a kind of NEOPLASM as well as a kind of IMMHN"OLOGIC DISEASE), this browser shows the term as part of three separate paths; note that the children (narrower terms) of LYMPHOMA are repeated in each location.
