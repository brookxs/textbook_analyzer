 2.8.5    Computational Costs of Bayesian Networks In the inference network model, according to equation 2.6, only the states which have a single document active node are considered. Thus, the cost of computing the ranking is linear on the number of documents in the collection. As with conventional collections, index structures such as inverted files (see Chapter 8) are used to restrict the ranking computation to those documents which have terms in common with the query. Thus, the cost of computing an inference network ranking has the same complexity as the cost of computing a vectorial ranking. In the belief network model, according to equation 2.13, the only states (of the roots nodes) considered (for computing the rank of a document d3) are the ones in which the active nodes are exactly those associated with the query terms. Thus, again, the cost of computing the ranking is linear on the number of documents in the collection. If index structures are used, the cost of computing a belief network ranking has the same complexity as the cost of computing a vectorial ranking. STRUCTURED TEXT RETRIEVAL MODELS        61 Therefore, the Bayesian network models discussed here do not impose significant additional costs for ranking computation. This is so because the networks presented do not include cycles, which implies that belief propagation can be done in a time proportional to the number of nodes in the network.
