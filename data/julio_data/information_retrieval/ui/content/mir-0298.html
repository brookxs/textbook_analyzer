 15.4.5    Federated Search Federated search work has often been prompted by challenging application requirements. For example, to allow computer science technical reports from around the world to become accessible with minimal investment and maximal local control, the NSF-funded Wide Area TEchnical Report Service (WATERS) initiative was launched [279]. This was then integrated with an effort begun earlier with DARPA funding, the Computer Science Technical Report (CSTR) project [260], leading to a hybrid effort, the Networked CS Technical Reference (previously, Report) Library (NCSTRL) [471]. At the heart of NC-STRL is a simple search system, a well-thought-out open federated digital library protocol and the Dienst reference implementation, developed at Cornell University [210]. While this system was custom-built with little dependence on other software, its type of operation could be constructed more rapidly atop various supports like CORBA [788]. Federated search has had an interesting history, with workers adopting a variety of approaches. First, there are those interested in collecting the required information, often through Web crawling of various sorts [715]. Second, there are those focusing on intelligent search [27]. One example is work emphasizing picking the best sites to search [126]. These efforts often assume some integrated information organization across the distributed Internet information space [393]. Third, there is work on fusion of results. This can be viewed in the abstract, regardless of whether the various collections are nearby or distributed, with the target of improving retrieval by culling from a number of good sources [76]. One approach adopts a probabilistic inference network model [139]. Another views the problem as database merging [791]. Alternatively, one can assume that there are a number of search engines distributed to cover the collection, that must be used intelligently [292]. Fourth, there are commercial solutions, including through special Web services [223]. Probably the most visible is the patented, powerful yet elegant, approach by Infoseek Corporation [394]. Finally, there is a new line of work to develop comprehensive and realistic architectures for federated search [219, 218]. The long-term challenge is to segment the collection and/or its indexes so that most searches only look at a small number of the most useful sources of information, yet recall is kept high. Ultimately, however, there are rich types of use of digital library content, once one of these approaches to search is carried out.
