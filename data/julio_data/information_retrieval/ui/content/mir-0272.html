 13.9    Trends and Research Issues The future of the Web might surprise us, considering that its massive use started less than five years ago. There are many distinct trends and each one opens up new and particular research problems. What follows is a compilation of the major trends as we have perceived them. ï  Modeling: Special IR models tailored for the Web are needed [308, 155, 652].  As we have seen, Web user queries are different.  We also have the pull/push dichotomy: Will we search for information or will the information reach us? In both cases we need better search paradigms and better information filtering [782]. ï  Querying: Further work on combining structure and content in the queries is needed as well as new visual metaphors to pose those queries and visualize the answers [44]. Future query languages may include concept-based search and natural language processing, as well as searching by example (this implies document clustering and categorization on the Web [810,120, 157]). ï  Distributed architectures:   New distributed schemes to traverse and search the Web must be devised to cope with its growth.  This will have an impact on current crawling and indexing techniques, as well as caching 394        SEARCHING THE WEB techniques for the Web. Which will be the bottleneck in the future? Server capacity or network bandwidth? Æ Ranking: Better ranking schemes are needed, exploiting both content and structure (internal to a page and hyperlinks); in particular, combining and comparing query-dependent and independent techniques. One problem related to advertisements is that search engines may rank some pages higher due to reasons that are not based on the real relevance of a page (this is called the search engine persuasion problem in [543]). 9 Indexing: Which is the best logical view for the text? What should be indexed? How to exploit better text compression schemes to achieve fast searching and get lower network traffic? How to compress efficiently word lists, URL tables, etc. and update them without significant run-time penalty? Many implementation details must be improved. ï  Dynamic pages: A large number of Web pages are created on demand and current techniques are not able to search on those dynamic pages. This is called the hidden Web. Æ Duplicated data: Better mechanisms to detect and eliminate repeated Web pages (or pages that are syntactically very similar) are needed. Initial approaches are based on resemblance measures using document fingerprints [121, 120]. This is related to an important problem in databases: finding similar objects. ï  Multimedia:  Searching for non-textual objects will gain importance in the near future. There are already some research results in the literature [579, 80, 136]. ï  User interfaces: Better user interfaces are clearly needed.  The output should also be improved, for example allowing better extraction of the main content of a page or the formulation of content-based queries [766]. ï  Browsing:   More tools will appear, exploiting links, popularity of Web pages, content similarity, collaboration, 3D, and virtual reality [384, 638, 385, 421].  An important trend would be to unify further searching with browsing. An important issue to be settled in the future is a standard protocol to query search engines. One proposal for such a protocol is STARTS [316], which could allow us to choose the best sources for querying, evaluate the query at these sources, and merge the query results. This protocol would make it easier to build metasearchers, but at the same time that is one of the reasons for not having a standard. In that way, metasearchers cannot profit from the work done by search engines and Web directories. This is a particular case of the federated searching problem from heterogeneous sources as it is called in the database community [656]. This is a problem already studied in the case of the Web, including discovery and ranking of sources [161, 845, 319]. These issues are also very important for digital libraries [649] (see also Chapter 15) and visualization issues [15]. A related topic is metadata standards for the Web (see Chapter 6) BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        395 and their limitations [544]. XML helps [436, 213, 306], but semantic integration is still needed. Hyperlinks can also be used to infer information about the Web. Although this is not exactly searching the Web, this is an important trend called Web mining. Traditionally, Web mining had been focused on text mining, that is, extracting information from Web pages. However, the hyperlink structure can be exploited to obtain useful information. For example, the ParaSite system [736] uses hyperlink information to find pages that have moved, related pages, and personal Web pages. HITS, already mentioned in Section 13.4.4, has also been used to find communities and similar pages [444, 298]. Other results on exploiting hyperlink structure can be found in [639, 543, 154]. Farther improvements in this problem include Web document clustering [810, 120, 162] (already mentioned), connectivity services (for example, asking which Web pages point to a given page [92]), automatic link generation [320], extracting information [100, 115], etc. Another trend is intranet applications. Many companies do not want their private networks to be public. However, for business reasons they want to allow Web users to search inside their intranets obtaining partial information. This idea leads to the concept of portals for which there are already several commercial products. New models to see Web sites as databases and/or information systems are also important.
