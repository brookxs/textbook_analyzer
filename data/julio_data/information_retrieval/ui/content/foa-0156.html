 7.5.2  Boolean Predicates  A different approach to the text classification task has been proposed by Cohen in his RIPPER system [Cohen, 1996a; Cohen, 1996b]. The space of hypothesis considered by RIPPER is a set of Boolean rules composed over a space of keywords. A simple example is shown in Figure 7.6, which extends the obvious definition of IRELAND to include documents that mention violent IRA activities. Like decision lists, RIPPER's rule sets are easier for human experts to interpret than a large system of Bayesian probabilities.  RIPPER is an example of a "covering" learning algorithm; cf. Figure 7.7. This means that it iteratively forms conjunctions of Boolean predicates that "cover" some of the positive instances of a Boolean classification while excluding all the negative instances. In the next iteration, the positive instances, which were covered previously, are removed from the training set, and a new conjunctive clause is formed, which again covers some more positive instances while excluding all negative ones. Ultimately, then, the rule set will be in disjunctive normal form (DNF).  RIPPER also includes optimizations to simplify rules by removing conditions that do not affect performance and by picking conditions 274      FINDING OUT ABOUT  +¶ Positive training instance ó Negative training instance © Seed  FIGURE 7.7 Covering Algorithms  that provide the most information gain [Quinlan, 1993]. Finally, Cohen adapted these rule learning techniques to the text domain by adding "set-valued attributes." These special attributes collapse a document's representation to be simply the set of words it contains. RIPPER's rules can then include tests for sets of words, rather than having to test the presence or absence of each word individually.
