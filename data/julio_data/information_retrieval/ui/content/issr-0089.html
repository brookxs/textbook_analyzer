 6.2.2 Automatic Term Clustering  There are many techniques for the automatic generation of term clusters to create statistical thesauri. They all use as their basis the concept that the more frequently two terms co-occur in the same items, the more likely they are about the same concept. They differ by the completeness with which terms are correlated. The more complete the correlation, the higher the time and computational overhead to create the clusters. The most complete process computes the strength of the relationships between all combinations of the "n" unique words with an overhead of O(n2). Other techniques start with an arbitrary set of clusters and iterate on the assignment of terms to these clusters. The simplest case employs one pass of the data in creation of the clusters. When the number of clusters created is very large, the initial clusters may be used as a starting point to generate more abstract clusters creating a hierarchy.  The steps described in Section 6.1 apply to the automatic generation of thesauri. The basis for automatic generation of a thesaurus is a set of items that represents the vocabulary to be included in the thesaurus. Selection of this set of items is the first step of determining the domain for the thesaurus. The processing tokens (words) in the set of items are the attributes to be used to create the clusters. Implementation of the other steps differs based upon the algorithms being applied. In the following sections a term is usually restricted to be included in only one class. It is also possible to use a threshold instead of choosing the highest value, allowing a term to be assigned to all of the classes that it could be included in above the threshold. The automated method of clustering documents is based upon the polythetic clustering (Van Rijsbergen-79) where each cluster is defined by a set of words and phrases. Inclusion of an item in a cluster is based upon the similarity of the item's words and phrases to those of other items in the cluster.
