 2.1.6 Numeric and Date Ranges  Term masking is useful when applied to words, but does not work for finding ranges of numbers or numeric dates. To find numbers larger than "125," using a term "125*" will not find any number except those that begin with the  SEARCH STATEMENT                    SYSTEM OPERATION  multiSnational                                          Matches"multi-national,"  "multinational," "multinational" but does not match "multi national" since it is two processing tokens.  *computer*                                              Matches,"minicomputer"  "microcomputer" or "computer"  comput*                                                  Matches  "computers,"     "computing,"  "computes"  *comput*                                                 Matches          "microcomputers"  "minicomputing," "compute"  Figure 2.3 Term Masking 34                                                                                                Chapter 2  digits "125." Systems, as part of their normalization process, characterizes words as numbers or dates. This allows for specialized numeric or date range processing against those words. A user could enter inclusive (e.g., "125-425" or "4/2/935/2/95" for numbers and dates) to infinite ranges ("gt;125," "lt;=233," representing "Greater Than" or "Less Than or Equal") as part of a query.
