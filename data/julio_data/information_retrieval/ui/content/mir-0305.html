 15.6.2    Metadata In the broadest sense, metadata can describe not only documents but also collections and whole digital librarys along with their services [50]. In a sense, this reflects movement toward holistic treatment like 5S. Yet in most digital library discussions, metadata just refers to a description of a digital object. This is precisely the role played by library catalog records. Hence, cataloging schemes like MARC are a starting point for many metadata descriptions [514]. While MARC has been widely used, it usually involves working with binary records which must be converted for interchange. One alternative is to encode MARC records using some readable coding scheme, like SGML [293]. Another concern with MARC is that there are a number of national versions with slight differences, as well as differences in cataloging practices that yield the MARC records. USMARC is one such version. It is very important in the digital library field, and can be encoded using SGML, or easily converted to simpler metadata schemes like the 'Dublin Core' [513]. Other 'crosswalks' exist between Dublin Core (DC), MARC, and schemes like GILS, proposed for a Government Information Locator Service [598]. A mapping also exists between DC and the Z39.50 protocol discussed in the previous section [503]. DC is a simple scheme, with 15 core elements that can be used to describe any digital object. What is of real import is that it has been widely accepted. That is because there have been years of discussion and development, focused around international workshops [806, 620, 560, 833, 333]. The core elements include seven that describe content (Title, Subject, Description, Source, Language, Relation, and Coverage). There are four elements that deal with intellectual property issues (Creator, Publisher, Contributor, and Rights). Finally, to deal with instances of abstract digital objects, there are four other types (Data, Type, Format, and Identifier). Since digital objects and their metadata often have to be interchanged across systems, the problem of packaging arises. The Warwick Framework, which evolved out of the same type of discussions leading to DC, deals with packages and connections between packages [472]. In general, such discussion about metadata is crucial to allow the move from traditional libraries (with their complex and expensive cataloging), past the Web (with its general lack of cataloging and metadata), to a reasonable environment wherein metadata is available for all sorts of digital objects (suitable to allow the organization of vast collections in digital librarys [734]). Because the Web has need of such organization, this has become an interest of its coordinating body, the WWW Consortium [84]. In 1996, as concern increased about protecting children from exposure to objectionable materials, TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        431 metadata schemes became connected with censoring and filtering requirements. The problem was renamed for the more general case, in keeping with Harvest's treatment of 'resource discovery,' to 'resource description.' The Resource Description Framework (RDF) thus became an area of study for the Consortium [753]. It should be noted that RDF can lead to header information inside digital objects, including those coded in SGML or HTML, as well as XML (see Chapter 6 for more details). In the more general case, however, RDF is essentially a scheme for annotating digital objects, so alternatively the descriptions can be stored separately from those objects. These options bring us back to the Warwick Framework where there may be multiple containers, sometimes connected through indirection, of packages of metadata, like MARC or DC. We see that digital librarys can be complex collections with various structuring mechanisms for managing data and descriptions of that data, the so-called metadata. However, coding may combine data with metadata, as is specified in the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) [670]. This reminds us of the complexities that arise when combining streams and structures, where there are many equivalent representations. We also see that for digital library standards to be useful, such as appears to be the case for DC, the structures involved must be relatively simple, and have well understood related scenarios of use. While this now appears to work for data interchange, further work is required for interoperability, i.e., interchange through the streams involved in protocols.
