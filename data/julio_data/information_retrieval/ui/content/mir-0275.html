 14.1    Introduction Despite the image sometimes presented of libraries as archaic collections of dusty books accessed through a card catalog, libraries were among the earliest institutions to make use of information retrieval systems. This early adoption took two main forms: searching remote electronic databases provided by commercial vendors in order to provide reference services to patrons, and the creation and searching of catalog records for materials held within the library. Each of these applications followed different developmental paths resulting in different products and functionality. According to Hildreth [372], Proceeding along different paths, the developmental histories of online public access catalogs (OPACs) and conventional information retrieval (IR) systems differed in three respects: origins of systems development, file and database content, and intended users, (p.10) Initial development of information retrieval systems was carried out by government laboratories in support of research in science and technology, based on bibliographic databases containing largely textual information, with trained search intermediaries as the intended users, OPACs were developed initially inhouse by large, usually academic, library systems, and later by commercial vendors of turnkey systems, f They used standardized record formats, generally the MARC record with minimal subject information (title, a few subject headings, and a classification number); and unlike commercial IR systems, they were intended from the outset for end users (library patrons). These factors led to significant differences between commercial IR systems and OPACs. f "Turnkey systems1 include software (and often hardware) and are usually developed with a specific library type and size in mind; within the constraints of the system, some customizing to suit the particular library is often possible. 397 398        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS Developed independently of each other, information retrieval systems and OPACs are quite different in character and use, and will be treated separately in this chapter. For these applications, a brief history, overview of current trends, some sample records and search examples will be given, and profiles of well-known systems will be presented. (Topics related to the use of IR systems in libraries, through Reference and Technical Services departments, and the techniques by which reference librarians perform the reference function, are beyond the scope of this chapter.) An important recent phenomenon, the digital library (see Chapter 15), has the potential to integrate information retrieval functions in the library under a common interface, eliminating the distinction between locally held and remote resources. Some examples of libraries which have attempted this integration will be discussed.
