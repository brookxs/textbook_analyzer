 Basic terminology  Given a set of 'attributes' A and a set of 'values' V, then a record R is a subset of the cartesian product A x V in which each attribute has one and only one value. Thus R is a set of ordered pairs of the form (an attribute, its value). For example, the record for a document which has been processed by an automatic content analysis algorithm would be  R = {(K1, x1), (K2, x2), . . . (Km, xm)}  The Ki 's are keywords functioning as attributes and the value xi can be thought of as a numerical weight. Frequently documents are simply characterised by the absence or presence of keywords, in which case we write  R = {Kt1, Kt2, . . . , Kti}  where Kti is present if xti = 1 and is absent otherwise.  Records are collected into logical units called files. They enable one to refer to a set of records by name, the file name. The records within a file are often organised according to relationships between the records. This logical organisation has become known as a file structure (or data structure).  It is difficult in describing file structures to keep the logical features separate from the physical ones. The latter are characteristics forced upon us by the recording media (e.g. tape, disk). Some features can be defined abstractly (with little gain) but are more easily understood when illustrated concretely. One such feature is a field. In any implementation of a record, the attribute values are usually positional, that is the identity of an attribute is given by the position of its attribute value within the record. Therefore the data within a record is registered sequentially and has a definite beginning and end. The record is said to be divided into fields and the nth field carries the nth attribute value. Pictorially we have an example of a record with associated fields in Figure 4.1.  The fields are not necessarily constant in length. To find the value of the attribute K4, we first find the address of the record R (which is actually the address of the start of the record) and read the data in the 4th field.  In the same picture I have also shown some fields labelled Pi. They are addresses of other records, and are commonly called pointers. Now we have extended the definition of a record to a set of attribute-value pairs and pointers. Each pointer is usually associated with a particular attribute-value pair. For example, (see Figure 4.2) pointers could be used to link all records for which the value x1 (of attribute K1) is a, similarly for x2 equal to b, etc.  To indicate that a record is the last record pointed to in a list of records we use the null pointer [[logicaland]]. The pointer associated with attribute K in record R will be called a K-pointer. An attribute (keyword) that is used in this way to organise a file is called a key.  The unify the discussion of file structures we need some further concepts. Following Hsiao and Harary again, we define a list L of records with respect to a keyword K, or more briefly a K-list as a set of records containing K such that:  (1) the K-pointers are distinct;  (2) each non-null K-pointer in L gives the address of a record within L;  (3) there is a unique record in L not pointed to by any record containing K; it is called the beginning of the list; and  (4) there is a unique record in L containing the null K-pointer; it is the end of the list.  (Hsiao and Harary state condition (2) slightly differently so that no two K-lists have a record in common; this only appears to complicate things.)  From our previous example:  K1-list : R1, R2, R5  K2-list : R2, R4  K4-list : R1, R2, R3  Finally, we need the definition of a directory of a file. Let F be a file whose records contain just m different keywords K1, K2, . . . , Km. Let ni be the number of records containing the keyword Ki, and hi be the number of Ki-lists in F. Furthermore, we denote by aij the beginning address of the jth Ki-list. Then the directory is the set of sequences  (Ki, ni, hi, ai1, ai2, . . . aihi) i = 1, 2, . . . m  We are now in a position to give a unified treatment of sequential files, inverted files, index-sequential files and multi-list files.
