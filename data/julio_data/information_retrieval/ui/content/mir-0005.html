 1.1.3    Focus of the Book Despite the great increase in interest in information retrieval, modern textbooks on IR with a broad (and extensive) coverage of the various topics in the field are still difficult to find. In an attempt to partially fulfill this gap, this book presents an overall view of research in IR from a computer scientist's perspective. This means that the focus of the book is on computer algorithms and techniques used in information retrieval systems. A rather distinct viewpoint is taken by librarians and information science researchers, who adopt a human-centered interpretation of the IR problem. In this interpretation, the focus is on trying to understand how people interpret and use information as opposed to how to structure, store, and retrieve information automatically. While most of this book is dedicated to the computer scientist's viewpoint of the IR problem, the human-centered viewpoint is discussed to some extent in the last two chapters. We put great emphasis on the integration of the different areas which are closed related to the information retrieval problem and thus, should be treated together. For that reason, besides covering text retrieval, library systems, user interfaces, and the Web, this book also discusses visualization, multimedia retrieval, and digital libraries.
