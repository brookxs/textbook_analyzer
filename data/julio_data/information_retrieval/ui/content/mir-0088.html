 5.2.4    Evaluation of Relevance Feedback Strategies Consider the modified query vector qm generated by the Rochio formula and assume that we want to evaluate its retrieval performance. A simplistic approach is to retrieve a set of documents using qm, to rank them using the vector formula, and to measure recall-precision figures relative to the set of relevant documents (provided by the experts) for the original query vector q. In general, the results siiow spectacular improvements. Unfortunately, a significant part of this improvement results from the higher ranks assigned to the set R of documents AUTOMATIC LOCAL ANALYSIS        123 already identified as relevant during the feedback process [275]. Since the user has seen these documents already (and pointed them as relevants), such evaluation is unrealistic. Further, it masks any real gains in retrieval performance due to documents not seen by the user yet. A more realistic approach is to evaluate the retrieval performance of the modified query vector qm considering only the residual collection i.e., the set of all documents minus the set of feedback documents provided by the user. Because highly ranked documents are removed from the collection, the recall-precision figures for qm tend to be lower than the figures for the original query vector q. This is not a limitation because our main purpose is to compare the performance of distinct relevance feedback strategies (and not to compare the performance before and after feedback). Thus, as a basic rule of thumb, any experimentation involving relevance feedback strategies should always evaluate recall-precision figures relative to the residual collection.
