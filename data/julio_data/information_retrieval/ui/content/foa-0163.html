 284      FINDING OUT ABOUT  7.6.3 Adapting to "Spatial" Context  In order to test InfoSpiders, agents were allowed to breed in a controlled test environment previously used by Steier [Steier and Belew, 1994a; Steier, 1994]: a portion of the Encyclopedia Britannica. The advantage is that we can make use of readily available relevant sets of articles associated with a large number of queries. The subset corresponds to the HUMAN SOCIETY topic, roughly one-tenth of the entire encyclopedia. Links to other parts of the EB are removed, along with any terminal documents produced as a result. The final environment is made of N = 19,427 pages, organized in a hypertext graph (the EB is already in HTML format). Of these pages, 7859 are full articles constituting the Micropcedia. These, together with 10,585 Index pages (containing links to articles and pointed to by links in articles), form a graph with many connected components. The remaining 983 nodes form a hierarchical topical tree, called Propcedia. These nodes contain topic titles and links to children nodes, ancestor nodes, and articles. Micropaedia articles also have links to Propaedia nodes. Propaedia and index pages are included in the search set to ensure a connected graph and to be faithful to the EB information architecture - an actual subset of the Web.  Now consider two agents, A and Bgt; born at the same time and attempting to satisfy the same query, but in different "places" within this hypergraph of EB document pages.  As Table 7.1 shows, the original query words were displaced from their top positions and replaced by new terms. For example, PBTVAT and ALLEVI had relatively low weights, while FOUMDAT appeared to have the highest correlation with relevance feedback at this time.  As and B's keyword vectors are shown in Table 7.2. In the course of the evolution leading to A and B through their ancestors, some query terms were lost from both genotypes. A was a third-generation agent; its parent lost ALLEVI through a mutation in favor of HULL. At A's birth, PRIVAT was mutated into TH. B was a second-generation agent; at its birth, both ALLEVI and PBJVAT were replaced by HULL and ADDAM, respectively, via mutation and crossover. These keyword vectors demonstrate how environmental features correlated with relevance were internalized into the agents* behaviors.  The difference between A and B can be attributed to their evolutionary adaptation to spatially local context. A and B were born at documents ADAPTIVE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL       285  TABLE 7.1 Part of the Word Feedback List and Weights at Time 550  Rank New k Ik  1 ï FOIINDAT 0.335  2  RED 0.310  3 ï MISSION 0.249  4  SOCIAL 0.223  5  CROSS 0.197  6  HULL 0.184  7  HOUS 0.183  8  ORGAN 0.161  15  SERVIC 0.114  16  ACTIV 0.112  23  TH 0.094  30  PUBLIC 0.087  32  ADDAM 0.079  37  HUMAN 0.075  41  PRIVAT 0.067  44  ALLEVI 0.065  Note: Stars mark new terms not present in the original query. Note that TH does not correspond to the article the, which is a noise word and thus is removed from all documents; rather, it corresponds to the th. used for ordinal numbers and often associated with centuries.
