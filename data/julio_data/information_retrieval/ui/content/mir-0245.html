 12.7    Trends and Research Issues In this chapter wre focused on how to accelerate queries by content on image databases and, more general, on multimedia databases. Target queries are, e.g., "find images with a color distribution of a sunset photography or, 'find companies whose stock price moves similarly to a given company's stock." The method expects a distance function Tgt;() (given by domain experts), which should measure the dissimilarity between two images or objects O\* 02-We mainly examined whole match, range queries (that is, 'queries by example" where the user specifies the ideal object and asks for all objects that are within distance e from the ideal object). Extensions to other types of queries (nearest neighbors, all pairs and subpattern match) are briefly discussed. We focused on the GEMINI approach, which combines two ideas: ï The first Is to devise a kquick-and-dirty" test, which will eliminate several 362 MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING (a) (b) Figure 12.10    A collection of documents, after FastMap in 3-D space: (a) the whole collection and (b) magnification of the dashed box. non-qualifying objects. To achieve that, we should extract / numerical features from each object, which should somehow describe the object (for example, the first few DFT coefficients for a time sequence, or for a grayscale image). The key question to ask is 'If we are allowed to use only one numerical feature to describe each data object, what should this feature be?' ï The second idea is to further accelerate the search, by organizing these f-dimensional points using state-of-the art spatial access methods [400], like the i?*~trees. These methods typically group neighboring points together, thus managing to discard large unpromising portions of the address space early. The above two ideas achieve fast searching. Moreover, we need to consider the condition under which the above method will be not only fast, but also correct in the sense that it will not miss any qualifying object. Notice that false alarms are acceptable, because they can be discarded, in the obvious way. The answer is provided by the lower-bounding lemma, which intuitively states that the mapping J-() of objects to /-D points should make things look closer. In the rest of the chapter, we discussed how to apply GEMINI for a variety of environments, like ID time sequences and 2D color images. As discussed in the bibliographic notes, GEMINI has been applied to multiple other settings, like tumor-like shapes, time sequences with the time-warping distance function, 2D medical images, and so on. Moreover, it is one of the main reasons behind a strong recent interest on high-dimensionality index structures. With respect to future trends, probably the most notable and most challenging trend is data mining in multimedia and mixed-media data sets. For example, given a collection of medical records, with demographic data, text data BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        363 (like history), 2D images (like X-rays), and ID signals (electrocardiograms), we want to find correlations, clusters, patterns, and outliers. Successful detection of such patterns is the basis for forecasting, for hypothesis formation, anomaly detection, and several other knowledge discovery operations. GEMINI, insisting on turning every data type into a feature vector, should prove extremely useful: the reason is that it opens the door for off-the-shelf statistical and machine learning packages, which typically expect a set of vectors as input. Typical such packages are the 'Principal Component Analysis' (PCA, also known as 'Latent Semantic Indexing' (LSI), 'Karhunen-Loeve Transform' (KLT), and 'Singular Value Decomposition' (SVD)), Artificial Neural Networks, tree classifiers, to name a few.
