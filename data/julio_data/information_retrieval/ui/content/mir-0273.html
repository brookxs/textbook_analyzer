 13.10    Bibliographic Discussion There are hundreds of books about the Web. Many of them include some information about searching the Web and tips for users. A recent book edited by Abrams includes a chapter on searching the Web [3]. Other sources are [682]. the special numbers of Scientific American on the Internet (March 1997) and IEEE's Internet Computing on Search Technologies (July/August 1998). For details about crawlers and other software agents see [166, 817]. In addition, the best source for references to the Web is the Web itself. To start with, there are many Web sites devoted to Inform and rate search engines and Web directories. Among them we can distinguish Search Engine Watch [749] and Search Engine Showdown [609]. A survey about Web characterizations is given by Pitkow [641] and a good directory to Web characteristics is [217]. Other Web pages provide pointers and references related to searching the Web, in particular the World Wide Web Consortium (www.w3.org), the World Wide Web journal (w3j . com) and WWW conferences. These and other pointers are available in the Web page of this book (see Chapter 1).
