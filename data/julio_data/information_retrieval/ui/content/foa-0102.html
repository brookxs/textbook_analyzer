 5.5 Probabilistic Retrieval  It should be clear by now that there are few logical grounds on which we could irrefutably prove that any document is relevant to any query. Our best hope is to retrieve relevant documents with high probability; i.e., we 168      FINDING OUT ABOUT  can only know about uncertainly. Beginning in the early 1970s, the most seminal thinkers within IR have attempted to connect fundamental concepts like "relevance" from within IR to probability theory (see [Cooper, 1971; Cooper, 1973; Bookstein and Swanson, 1974; Cooper and Maron, 1978; Cooper, 1983] and other references throughout this section). As typical search engines moved past simpler Boolean retrieval to ranked retrievals [Cooper, 1988], and more recently as representational languages like Bayesian networks have become widespread within artificial intelligence (cf. Section 5.5.7), a probabilistic foundation for FOA has become an increasingly central concern. The derivation of the basic components of the Bayesian decision models presented here follows van Rijsbergen, p. 115 quite closely; the lecture notes on probabilistic IR2 developed by Nobert Fuhr provide a similar treatment of this background.
