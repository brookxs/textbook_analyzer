 14.2.4    'Natural Language' Searching To ensure their place in the market, database vendors continually develop new features that they feel will be of value to their client group, as well as add new database products. In general, these new features are augmentations to the existing Boolean search engine รณ removal of duplicates, sophisticated ranking or sorting within the retrieved set. However, about five years ago several of the major database vendors announced they were adding 'natural language' search functionality to their systems. WESTLAW (a legal resources vendor) introduced its WIN system, DIALOG offered TARGET, and LEXIS-NEXIS announced a system called FREESTYLE [758, 653]. WIN and FREESTYLE accept a natural language query; TARGET requires the searcher to eliminate terms that are not useful for searching. All three systems provide ranked lists of retrieved documents. The 'natural language' systems are offered as auxiliary modules to standard Boolean searching, and are not intended to replace it. A sample TARGET search is shown in Figure 14.7. In this search in BIOSIS, the searcher is first provided with a series of instructions on dealing with phrases, synonyms, etc. The searcher enters a series of search terms {up to 25) at the k?* prompt, in this case 'komodo dragon food ONLINE PUBLIC ACCESS CATALOGS (OPACS)        407 ? target Input search, terms separated by spaces (e.g., DOG CAT FOOD). You can enhance your TARGET search with the following options: - PHRASES are enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'DOG FOOD') - SYNONYMS are enclosed in parentheses (e.g., (DOG CANINE)) - SPELLING variations are indicated with a ? (e.g., DOG? to search DOG, DOGS) - Terms that MUST be present are flagged with an asterisk (e.g., DOG *F0OD) Q = QUIT  H = HELP ? komodo dragon food diet nutrition Your TARGET search request will retrieve up to 50 of the statistically most relevant records.

By default the search is limited to the most recent two years of the file, and the 50 highest scoring records are available for display in ranked order. In this example no restrictions are made on the search terms but as the on-screen instructions indicate, Boolean logic can be imposed on the search terms, resulting in a Boolean search with ranked output.
