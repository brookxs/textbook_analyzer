 7.2 Building Hypotheses about Documents  We will talk about competing "hypotheses/' for example, rules that successfully separate our spam email from our family's email. If only very simple hypotheses are to be considered, a relatively small amount of data ADAPTIVE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL       259  can be used to select between them. For example, if our hypothesis is that spam email always contains the phrase $$$$ BIG MONEY $$$$$, a small amount of training data is sufficient to confirm or disconfirm this rule [Sahami et al., 1998]. But if we wish to consider elaborate discrimination rules, for example, including many keywords and/or date information, it takes much more data to tease apart all the alternatives. The volume of training data available, then, provides a very real constraint on how complex the hypotheses we can consider can be and how statistically reliable we expect rules to perform on unseen test data.
