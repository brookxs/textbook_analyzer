 5.4.2 Clustering Algorithms  Because of its widespread application, clustering is one of the most wellstudied problems within statistics and computer science [Jain and Dubes, 1988; Griffiths et al., 1986]. It can be stated in generic terms, in terms of an arbitrary similarity measure between items to be clustered. Especially in iterative applications of clustering, the relative frequency of various clustering techniques matters. The art, therefore, in applying a clustering method in a particular application depends greatly on the particular features of items to be clustered and the number of partitions within which these items are to be clustered. W. Willett has provided an excellent survey of applications of clustering applied to various aspects of the FOA task [Willett, 1988]. More recently, Zamir has considered clusterings of document "snippets" (roughly the same as the paragraph units proposed in Section 2.3) rather than on complete documents [Zamir and Etzioni, 1998].  The most typical clustering method for application within the FOA context is single-link hierarchical clustering. This is considered an agglomerative technique, because it begins with each data point considered to be in its own cluster and then iteratively asks which two clusters should be combined.^  The most typical method for performing this task builds a minimum spanning tree (MST), iteratively merging the two documents that are closest together and then including the merged nodes. The result is a tree from the finally merged root to each of the documents as a leaf. Alternatively, the complete set of interdocument similarity measures can be progressively "filtered" by a gradually increasing threshold, which is used to define whether two documents are considered connected by an edge. We can then ask for certain properties of the emerging graph, for example, stopping when all components become connected. To keep things simple and focused on robust assumptions [van Rijsbergen, p. 59], O(n2) algorithms are assumed.  One early motivation for clustering algorithms was efficient disk access: If documents were preclustered appropriately, it would be likely MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS       167  that a "page" of disk memory containing one document matching a query might also contain other elements of the same cluster. That is, an efficient physical disk allocation algorithm might try to ensure that clustered documents were written to the same block.  This example suggests how MST representations of the documents might also support efficient query/document matching algorithms. In brief, the MST can be interpreted as a "decision tree," with a query beginning at the root and comparing itself to a candidate representation (e.g., centroid) of each cluster.  The cluster hypothesis suggests that if a document that is similar to the query is relevant, then other documents similar to it are likely to also be relevant. By clustering neighboring documents, nearest neighbor documents should also be retrieved. But as Cutting et al. note, for a partitioning cluster to be useful in this application k must be very near JV [Cutting et al., 1992]. We do not want to retrieve more than a linear constant of other documents when we retrieve one.  ScatterGather is an intereseting example of how partitional clustering can be applied in a provocative way [Cutting et al., 1992; Hearst and Pedersen, 1992]. Beginning with a clustering of the entire corpus, initial queries are posed by selecting some of the clusters. Documents identified as members of these clusters form a new subcorpus; clustering is applied across these, and so on. Evaluating the utility of such a novel browsing pattern is difficult, but the ability of the ScatterGather interface (as well as a similar effort applied to the MacOS interface called Piles [Rose et al, 1993] to improve retrieval effectiveness is quite clear. A problematic feature of the ScatterGather procedure is its sensitivity to the selection of initial "buckshot" random seeds. But Cutting doesn't necessarily see this as a bug:  Indeed, the lack of determinism might be interpreted as a feature, since the user then had the option of discarding an unrevealing partition in favor of a fresh re-clustering.
