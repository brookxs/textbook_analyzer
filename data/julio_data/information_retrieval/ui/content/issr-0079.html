 5.2.3 Bayesian Model  One way of overcoming the restrictions inherent in a vector model is to use a Bayesian approach to maintaining information on processing tokens. The Bayesian model provides a conceptually simple yet complete model for information systems. In its most general definition, the Bayesian approach is based upon conditional probabilities (e.g., Probability of Event 1 given Event 2 occurred). This general concept can be applied to the search function as well as to creating the index to the database. The objective of information systems is to return relevant items. Thus the general case, using the Bayesian formula, is P(REL/DOQ , Query,) which is interpreted as the probability of relevance (REL) to a search statement given a particular document and query. Interpretation of this process is discussed in detail in Chapter 7. In addition to search, Bayesian formulas can be used in determining the weights associated with a particular processing token in an item. The objective of creating the index to an item is to represent the semantic information in the item. A Bayesian network can be used to determine the final set of processing tokens (called topics) and their weights. Figure 5.6 shows a simple view of the process where Tj represents the relevance of topic "i" in a particular item and Pj represents a statistic associated with the event of processing token "j" being present in the item.  Figure 5.6 Bayesian Term Weighting Automatic Indexing                                                                                   123  The "m" topics would be stored as the final index to the item. The statistics associated with the processing token are typically frequency of occurrence. But they can also incorporate proximity factors that are useful in items that discuss multiple topics. There is one major assumption made in this model:  Assumption of Binary Independence : the topics and the processing token statistics are independent of each other. The existence of one topic is not related to the existence of the other topics. The existence of one processing token is not related to the existence of other processing tokens.  In most cases this assumption is not true. Some topics are related to other topics and some processing tokens related to other processing tokens. For example, the topics of "Politics" and "Economics" are in some instances related to each other (e.g., an item discussing Congress debating laws associated with balance of trade) and in many other instances totally unrelated. The same type of example would apply to processing tokens. There are two approaches to handling this problem. The first is to assume that there are dependencies, but that the errors introduced by assuming the mutual independence do not noticeably effect the determination of relevance of an item nor its relative rank associated with other retrieved items. This is the most common approach used in system implementations. A second approach can extend the network to additional layers to handle interdependencies. Thus an additional layer of Independent Topics (ITs) can be placed above the Topic layer and a layer of Independent Processing Tokens (IPs) can be placed above the processing token layer. Figure 5.7 shows the extended Bayesian network. Extending the network creates new processing tokens for those cases where there are dependencies between processing tokens. The new set of Independent Processing Tokens can then be used to define the attributes associated with the set of topics selected to represent the semantics of an item. To compensate for dependencies between topics the final layer of Independent Topics is created. The degree to which each layer is created depends upon the error that could be introduced by allowing for dependencies between Topics or Processing Tokens. Although this approach is the most mathematically correct, it suffers from losing a level of precision by reducing the number of concepts available to define the semantics of an item.
