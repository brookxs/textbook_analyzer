 5.2.2 Formal Notions of Similarity  Two features of the FOA problem can help us to focus on what is known as the Minkowski metric [Luenberger, 1969; Jain and Dubes, 1988]. First, the result of our calculations will be a real-valued weight associating a keyword with a document or query, and we can assume that this is a continuous quantity. Further, we can make the somewhat more questionable assumption that these weights make "natural" use of zero, and so index weights also fall on what is known as a "ratio" scale. With these two assumptions, the Minkowski metrics are defined as:  /NKw                     \ lll  Sim(q, d) = I ]T \wqk - wdk\L 1                     (5.9)  where L gt; 1. The most common version is the 1=2 norm, and we will use it here. The L = 1 ("Manhattan distance") and L = oo ("sup" norm, where E^ is replaced with max) are also seen often.  A metric is a scalar function over pairs of points in the vector space. Minkowski metrics satisfy three critical properties:  Sim(x, y) gt; 0                                              (5.10)  Sim(x, y) = Sim(yy x)                                  (5.11)  Sim(x, x) = ||x ||                                          (5.12)  gt; arg max Simix, y)                     (5.13)  The measure Sim(x, x) of a vector with itself is what we typically think of as the length of the vector, or more precisely, its norm* \\x\\.  Two other important features of metric spaces follow from these axioms:  1.  Sim(x, y) lt; || x|! Ã¯ \\y\\          (Cauchy-Schwarz inequality)  2.  || x + y || lt; ji x (|+ [I y ||            (triangle inequality)
