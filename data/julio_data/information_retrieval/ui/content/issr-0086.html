 6 Document and Term Clustering  6.1     Introduction to Clustering  6.2    Thesaurus Generation  6.3    Item Clustering  6.4    Hierarchy of Clusters  6.5     Summary  Chapter 5 introduced indexing associated with representation of the semantics of an item. In all of the techniques discussed in Chapter 5, our information database can be viewed as being composed of a number of independent items indexed by a series of index terms. This model lends itself to two types of clustering: clustering index terms to create a statistical thesaurus and clustering items to create document clusters. In the first case clustering is used to increase recall by expanding searches with related terms. In document clustering the search can retrieve items similar to an item of interest, even if the query would not have retrieved the item. The clustering process is not precise and care must be taken on use of clustering techniques to minimize the negative impact misuse can have. These issues are discussed in Section 6.1 along with some general guidelines of clustering.  Section 6.2 discusses a variety of specific techniques to create thesaurus clusters. The techniques can be categorized as those that use the complete database to perform the clustering and those that start with some initial structure. Section 6.3 looks at the same techniques as they apply to item (document) clustering. A class of clustering algorithms creates a hierarchical output. The hierarchy of clusters usually reflects more abstract concepts in the higher levels and more detailed specific items in the lower levels. Given the large data sets in information retrieval systems, it is essential to optimize the clustering process in terms of time and required processing power. Hierarchical clustering and its associated performance improvements are described in Section 6.4.
