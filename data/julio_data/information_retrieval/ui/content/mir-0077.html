 4.4.2    Hypertext Hypertexts probably represent the maximum freedom with respect to structuring power. A hypertext is a directed graph where the nodes hold some text and the links represent connections between nodes or between positions inside the nodes (see Chapter 2). Hypertexts have received a lot of attention since the explosion of the Web, which is indeed a gigantic hypertext-like database spread across the world. However, retrieval from a hypertext began as a merely navigational activity. That is. the user had to manually traverse the hypertext nodes following links to search what he wanted. It was not possible to query the hypertext based on its structure. Even in the Web one can search by the text contents of the nodes, but not by their structural connectivity. STRUCTURAL QUERIES        109 An interesting proposal to combine browsing and searching on the Web is WebGlimpse. It allows classical navigation plus the ability to search by content in the neighborhood of the current node. Currently, some query tools have appeared that achieve the goal of querying hypertexts based on their content and their structure. This problem is covered in detail in Chapter 13.
