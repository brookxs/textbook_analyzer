 15.7    Trends and Research Issues There are many remaining challenges in the digital library field. While TEI provides guidance in complex encoding situations, and has been advocated by the University of Michigan for electronic theses and dissertations, it is unclear how far the rest of the scholarly community will move towards the thorough markup and description of digital objects that characterize humanistic study [670]. Though such markup is valuable to support context-dependent queries as well as electronic document preservation, it will only be generally feasible when there are less expensive tools and more efficient methods for adding in such markup and description, which may occur as XML usage expands. Then, too, the IR community must provide guidance regarding automatic indexing of marked up documents, metadata, full-text, multimedia streams, and complex hypermedia networks so that the rich and varied content of digital librarys can be searched. On a grander scale are the problems of handling worldwide digital librarys, in the context of varying collection principles, enormous difference in response time between local and remote servers, and the needs of users for different views [474]. Thus, one type of scenario might deal with searching all dissertations worldwide, another might be concerned with finding recent results from a particular research group, a third might consider only freely available works in a particular specialty area, a fourth might deal with seeking the new works recently highly rated by a distributed group of close friends, and yet another might involve the most 432        DIGITAL LIBRARIES readable overviews in an unknown area. Other key research challenges have been highlighted in various workshops aimed at establishing an agenda for investigation [525]. Of central concern is covering the range from personal to global digital librarys, the so-called 'scaling' problem. At the same time, the problem of interoperability must be faced [624]. As argued earlier, we view the solution to these problems to be the acknowledgement of the role of 5S in the digital library arena and the focus of research and development on treating streams, structures, spaces, scenarios, and societies as first class objects and building blocks for digital librarys. We will continue to explore this approach in future work, and believe that, to the extent that integrated support for 5S is developed, real progress will be made towards the next generation of digital libraries.
