 13.5.2    Combining Searching with Browsing Usually, users either browse following hypertext links or they search a Web site (or the whole Web). Currently, in Web directories, a search can be reduced to a subtree of the taxonomy. However, the search may miss related pages that are not in that part of the taxonomy. Some search engines find similar pages using common words, but often this is not effective. WebGlimpse is a tool that tries to solve these problems by combining browsing with searching [539]. WebGlimpse attaches a small search box to the bottom of every HTML page, and allows the search to cover the neighborhood of that page or the whole site, without having to stop browsing. This is equivalent to following hypertext links that are constructed on the fly through a neighborhood search. WebGlimpse can be useful in building indices for personal Web pages or collections of favorite URLs. First, WebGlimpse indexes a Web site (or a collection of specific documents) and computes neighborhoods according to user specifications. As a result. WebGlimpse adds the search boxes to selected pages, collects remote pages that are relevant, and caches those pages locally. Later, the users can search in the neighborhood of a page using the search boxes. As the name suggests, WebGlimpse uses Glimpse as its search engine [540], The neighborhood of a Web page is defined as the set of Web pages that are reachable by a path of hypertext links within a maximum predefined distance. This distance can be set differently for local and remote pages. For example, it METASEARCHERS        387 can be unlimited locally, but be only three at any remote site. The neighborhood can also include all the subdirectories of the directory where the Web page is. The result is a graph of all the neighborhoods of the Web site or collection, and for each Web page, a file with all the Web pages in its neighborhood. When searching, any query in the whole index can be intersected with a neighborhood list, obtaining the relevant Web pages. A nice addition to WebGlimpse would be to visualize the neighborhoods. This problem is the topic of the next section.
