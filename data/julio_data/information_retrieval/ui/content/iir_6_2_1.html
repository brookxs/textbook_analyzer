    Inverse document frequency collection frequency,  Instead, it is more commonplace to use for this purpose the document frequency , defined to be the number of documents in the collection that contain a term . This is because in trying to discriminate between documents for the purpose of scoring it is better to use a document-level statistic (such as the number of documents containing a term) than to use a collection-wide statistic for the term. Figure 6.7: Collection frequency (cf) and document frequency (df) behave differently, as in this example from the Reuters collection. 6.7 How is the document frequency df of a term used to scale its weight? Denoting as usual the total number of documents in a collection by , we define the inverse document frequency of a term as follows:  (21)  Thus the idf of a rare term is high, whereas the idf of a frequent term is likely to be low. Figure 6.8 gives an example of idf's in the Reuters collection of 806,791 documents; in this example logarithms are to the base 10. In fact, as we will see in Exercise 6.2.2 , the precise base of the logarithm is not material to ranking. We will give on page 11.3.3 a justification of the particular form in EquationÂ 21.
