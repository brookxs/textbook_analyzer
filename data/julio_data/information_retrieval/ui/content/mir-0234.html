 12.2    Background รณ Spatial Access Methods As mentioned earlier, the idea is to map objects into points in /-D space, and to use multiattribute access methods (also referred to as spatial access methods or SAMs)  to cluster them and to search for them. Thus, a brief introduction to multidimensional indexing methods (or spatial access methods) is in order. The prevailing methods form three classes: (1) R*-trees and the rest of the R-tree family,   (2) linear quadtrees, and (3) grid-files. Several of these methods explode exponentially with the dimensionality, eventually reducing to sequential scanning. For linear quadtrees, the effort is proportional to the hypersurface of the query region [244]; the hypersurface grows exponentially with the dimensionality. Grid files face similar problems, since they require a directory that grows exponentially with the dimensionality. The R-tree-based methods seem to be most robust for higher dimensions, provided that the fanout of the R-tree nodes remains gt; 2. Below, we give a brief description of the R-tree method and its variants, since it is one of the typical representatives of spatial access methods. The R-tree represents a spatial object by its minimum bounding rectangle (MBR). Data rectangles are grouped to form parent nodes, which are recursively grouped, to form grandparent nodes and, eventually, a tree hierarchy. The MBR of a parent node completely contains the MBRs of its children; MBRs are allowed to overlap. Nodes of the tree correspond to disk pages. Disk pages, or 'disk blocks', are consecutive byte positions on the surface of the disk that are typically fetched with one disk access. The goal of the insertion, split, and deletion routines is to give trees that will have good clustering, with few, tight parent MBRs. Figure 12.1 illustrates data rectangles (in black), organized in an R-tree with fanout 3. Figure 12.2 shows the file structure for the same R-tree, where nodes correspond to disk pages. A range query specifies a region of interest, requiring all the data regions that Intersect it. To answer this query, we first retrieve a superset of the qualifying data regions: we compute the MBR of the query region, and then we recursively descend the R-tree, excluding the branches whose MBRs do not intersect the query MBR. Thus, the R-tree will give us quickly the data regions whose MBR intersects the MBR of the query region. The retrieved data regions will be further examined for intersection with the query region. Algorithms for additional operations (nearest neighbor queries, spatial joins, insertions, and deletions) are more complicated and are still under research (see the Bibliographic Discussion). The original R-tree paper inspired much follow-up work, as described in 348        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING -------1 T ii Figure 12.1 Data (dark rectangles) organized in an R-tree with fanout = 3.

It is important to highlight, however, that any spatial access method can be used (like i?*-trees, X-trees, SR-trees, and so on).
