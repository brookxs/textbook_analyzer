book1_ch01_2_2	no label	Factors Factors Factors Let’s begin our review of arithmetic by recalling the meaning of multiplication for whole numbers (the counting numbers and zero). Multiplication Multiplication is a description of repeated addition. In the addition 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 the number 7 is repeated as an addend* 4 times. Therefore, we say we have four times seven and describe it by writing 4  ·  7 The raised dot between the numbers 4 and 7 indicates multiplication. The dot directs us to multiply the two numbers that it separates. In algebra, the dot is preferred over the symbol × to denote multiplication because the letter x is often used to represent a number. Thus, 4  ·  7 = 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 Factors and Products In a multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are called factors. The result of a multiplication is called the product. For example, in the multiplication 4  ·  7 = 28 the numbers 4 and 7 are factors, and the number 28 is the product. We say that 4 and 7 are factors of 28. (They are not the only factors of 28. Can you think of others?)Now we know thatThis indicates that a first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number with no remainder. For example, since 4  ·  7 = 28 both 4 and 7 are factors of 28 since both 4 and 7 divide into 28 with no remainder. 
book1_ch01_2_3	no label	Exponential Notation Exponential Notation Exponential Notation Quite often, a particular number will be repeated as a factor in a multiplication. For example, in the multiplication 7  ·  7  ·  7  ·  7 the number 7 is repeated as a factor 4 times. We describe this by writing 74 . Thus, 7  ·  7  ·  7  ·  7 = 74 The repeated factor is the lower number (the base), and the number recording how many times the factor is repeated is the higher number (the superscript). The superscript number is called an exponent. Exponent An exponent is a number that records how many times the number to which it is attached occurs as a factor in a multiplication.

Prime Number A whole number greater than 1 whose only whole number factors are itself and 1 is called a prime number. The first seven prime numbers are2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17The number 1 is not considered to be a prime number, and the number 2 is the first and only even prime number.Many numbers have factors other than themselves and 1. For example, the factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 (since each of these whole numbers and only these whole numbers divide into 28 without a remainder). Composite Numbers A whole number that is composed of factors other than itself and 1 is called a composite number. Composite numbers are not prime numbers.Some composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15.

We will use them soon in our study of fractions. We will now, however, be introduced to an important mathematical principle. The Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic Except for the order of the factors, every whole number, other than 1, can be factored in one and only one way as a product of prime numbers. Prime Factorization When a number is factored so that all its factors are prime numbers, the factorization is called the prime factorization of the number.

When a fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction that has the smallest numerator and denominator in the collection of equivalent fractions, it is said to be reduced to lowest terms. The conversion process is called reducing a fraction. We can reduce a fraction to lowest terms by Expressing the numerator and denominator as a product of prime numbers. (Find the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. See Section (Section 1.3) for this technique.) Divide the numerator and denominator by all common factors. (This technique is commonly called “cancelling.”) 
book1_ch01_5_5	no label	Raising a Fraction to Higher Terms Raising a Fraction to Higher Terms Raising a Fraction to Higher Terms Equally important as reducing fractions is raising fractions to higher terms. Raising a fraction to higher terms is the process of constructing an equivalent fraction that has higher values in the numerator and denominator. The higher, equivalent fraction is constructed by multiplying the original fraction by 1.Notice that and are equivalent, that is Also, This observation helps us suggest the following method for raising a fraction to higher terms. Raising a Fraction to Higher Terms A fraction can be raised to higher terms by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number. For example, can be raised to by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 8, that is, multiplying by 1 in the form How did we know to choose 8 as the proper factor? Since we wish to convert 4 to 32 by multiplying it by some number, we know that 4 must be a factor of 32. This means that 4 divides into 32. In fact, 32÷4 = 8. We divided the original denominator into the new, specified denominator to obtain the proper factor for the multiplication.

Variable A letter or symbol that represents any member of a collection of two or more numbers is called a variable. Constant A letter or symbol that represents a specific number, known or unknown is called a constant. In the following examples, the letter x is a variable since it can be any member of the collection of numbers {35, 25, 10} . The letter h is a constant since it can assume only the value 5890. Example 2.1.  Suppose that the streets on your way from home to school have speed limits of 35 mph, 25 mph, and 10 mph. In algebra we can let the letter x represent our speed as we travel from home to school. The maximum value of x depends on what section of street we are on. The letter x can assume any one of the various values 35,25,10. Example 2.2.  Suppose that in writing a term paper for a geography class we need to specify the height of Mount Kilimanjaro. If we do not happen to know the height of the mountain, we can represent it (at least temporarily) on our paper with the letter h . Later, we look up the height in a reference book and find it to be 5890 meters. The letter h can assume only the one value, 5890, and no others. The value of h is constant.

book1_ch02_3_2	no label	The Real Number Line The Real Number Line The Real Number Line Real Number Line In our study of algebra, we will use several collections of numbers. The real number line allows us to visually display the numbers in which we are interested. A line is composed of infinitely many points. To each point we can associate a unique number, and with each number we can associate a particular point. Coordinate The number associated with a point on the number line is called the coordinate of the point. Graph The point on a line that is associated with a particular number is called the graph of that number. We construct the real number line as follows: Construction of the Real Number Line Draw a horizontal line. Choose any point on the line and label it 0. This point is called the origin. Choose a convenient length. This length is called "1 unit." Starting at 0, mark this length off in both directions, being careful to have the lengths look like they are about the same. We now define a real number. Real Number A real number is any number that is the coordinate of a point on the real number line. Positive and Negative Real Numbers The collection of these infinitely many numbers is called the collection of real numbers. The real numbers whose graphs are to the right of 0 are called the positive real numbers. The real numbers whose graphs appear to the left of 0 are called the negative real numbers. The number 0 is neither positive nor negative. 
book1_ch02_3_3	no label	The Real Numbers The Real Numbers The Real Numbers The collection of real numbers has many subcollections. The subcollections that are of most interest to us are listed below along with their notations and graphs. Natural Numbers The natural numbers (N) :   {1, 2,3, …} Whole Numbers The whole numbers (W) :   {0, 1, 2,3, …} Notice that every natural number is a whole number. Integers The integers (Z) :   {…,  − 3, −  2, − 1,0,1, 2, 3, …} Notice that every whole number is an integer. Rational Numbers The rational numbers (Q) : Rational numbers are real numbers that can be written in the form a / b , where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0 . Fractions Rational numbers are commonly called fractions. Division by 1 Since b can equal 1, every integer is a rational number: . Division by 0 Recall that 10 / 2 = 5 since 2⋅5 = 10 . However, if 10 / 0 = x , then 0⋅x = 10 . But 0⋅x = 0 , not 10. This suggests that no quotient exists. Now consider 0 / 0 = x . If 0 / 0 = x , then 0⋅x = 0 . But this means that x could be any number, that is, 0 / 0 = 4 since 0⋅4 = 0 , or 0 / 0 = 28 since 0⋅28 = 0 . This suggests that the quotient is indeterminant. x / 0 Is Undefined or Indeterminant Division by 0 is undefined or indeterminant.Do not divide by 0. Rational numbers have decimal representations that either terminate or do not terminate but contain a repeating block of digits. Some examples are: Some rational numbers are graphed below. Irrational Numbers The irrational numbers (I r) : Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as the quotient of two integers. They are numbers whose decimal representations are nonterminating and nonrepeating. Some examples are Notice that the collections of rational numbers and irrational numbers have no numbers in common. When graphed on the number line, the rational and irrational numbers account for every point on the number line. Thus each point on the number line has a coordinate that is either a rational or an irrational number. In summary, we have

Hence, 3 times 4.We know that algebra is generalized arithmetic. We can now make an important generalization. When a number a is added repeatedly n times, we have Then, using multiplication as a description for repeated addition, we can replace For example: Example 2.47.  x + x + x + x can be written as 4x since x is repeatedly added 4 times. x + x + x + x = 4x Example 2.48.  r + r can be written as 2r since r is repeatedly added 2 times. r + r = 2r The distributive property involves both multiplication and addition. Let’s rewrite 4(a + b). We proceed by reading 4(a + b) as a multiplication: 4 times the quantity (a + b) . This directs us to write Now we use the commutative property of addition to collect all the a ' s together and all the b ' s together.

A natural question is “Is there a description for repeated multiplication?” The answer is yes. The notation that describes repeated multiplication is exponential notation. Factors In multiplication, the numbers being multiplied together are called factors. In repeated multiplication, all the factors are the same. In nonrepeated multiplication, none of the factors are the same. For example, Example 2.52.  Exponential notation is used to show repeated multiplication of the same factor. The notation consists of using a superscript on the factor that is repeated. The superscript is called an exponent. Exponential Notation If x is any real number and n is a natural number, thenAn exponent records the number of identical factors in a multiplication. Note that the definition for exponential notation only has meaning for natural number exponents. We will extend this notation to include other numbers as exponents later.

A natural question is "Why are geometric terms appearing in the exponent expression?" The answer for x 3 is this: x 3 means x⋅x⋅x . In geometry, the volume of a rectangular box is found by multiplying the length by the width by the depth. A cube has the same length on each side. If we represent this length by the letter x then the volume of the cube is x⋅x⋅x , which, of course, is described by x 3 . (Can you think of why x 2 is read as x squared?)

book1_ch03_2_2	no label	Positive and Negative Numbers Positive and Negative Numbers Positive and Negative Numbers When we studied the number line in Section Section 2.3 we noted that Each point on the number line corresponds to a real number, and each real number is located at a unique point on the number line. Positive and Negative Numbers Each real number has a sign inherently associated with it. A real number is said to be a positive number if it is located to the right of 0 on the number line. It is a negative number if it is located to the left of 0 on the number line. THE NOTATION OF SIGNED NUMBERS A number is denoted as positive if it is directly preceded by a " + " sign or no sign at all.A number is denoted as negative if it is directly preceded by a " − " sign. The " + " and " – " signs now have two meanings: + can denote the operation of addition or a positive number. − can denote the operation of subtraction or a negative number. Read the "-" Sign as "Negative" To avoid any confusion between "sign" and "operation," it is preferable to read the sign of a number as "positive" or "negative." 
book1_ch03_2_5	no label	Opposites Opposites Opposites Opposites On the number line, each real number has an image on the opposite side of 0. For this reason we say that each real number has an opposite. Opposites are the same distance from zero but have opposite signs. The opposite of a real number is denoted by placing a negative sign directly in front of the number. Thus, if a is any real number, then − a is its opposite. Notice that the letter a is a variable. Thus, " a " need not be positive, and " − a " need not be negative. If a is a real number, − a is opposite a on the number line and a is opposite − a on the number line. − ( − a ) is opposite − a on the number line. This implies that − ( − a ) = a . This property of opposites suggests the double-negative property for real numbers. THE DOUBLE-NEGATIVE PROPERTY If a is a real number, then − ( − a ) = a 
book1_ch03_3_2	no label	Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Absolute Value—Geometric Approach The absolute value of a number a , denoted | a | , is the distance from a to 0 on the number line. Absolute value speaks to the question of "how far," and not "which way." The phrase how far implies length, and length is always a nonnegative (zero or positive) quantity. Thus, the absolute value of a number is a nonnegative number. This is shown in the following examples: Example 3.9.  | 4 | = 4 Example 3.10.  | − 4 | = 4 Example 3.11.  | 0 | = 0 Example 3.12.  − | 5 | = − 5 .The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of 5." The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence, negative the absolute value of 5 is − 5 . Example 3.13.  − | − 3 | = − 3 .The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of − 3 ." The absolute value of − 3 is 3. Hence, negative the absolute value of − 3 is − ( 3 ) = − 3 . 
book1_ch03_3_3	no label	Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value The problems in the first example may help to suggest the following algebraic definition of absolute value. The definition is interpreted below. Examples follow the interpretation. Absolute Value—Algebraic Approach The absolute value of a number a is The algebraic definition takes into account the fact that the number a could be either positive or zero ( ≥ 0 ) or negative ( < 0 ) . If the number a is positive or zero ( ≥ 0 ) , the first part of the definition applies. The first part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed in the absolute bars is a nonnegative number, the absolute value of the number is the number itself. If the number a is negative ( < 0 ) , the second part of the definition applies. The second part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a negative number, the absolute value of the number is the opposite of the number. The opposite of a negative number is a positive number.

We perform this addition on the number line as follows. We begin at 0, the origin.Since 2 is positive, we move 2 units to the right.Since 3 is positive, we move 3 more units to the right.We are now located at 5.Thus, 2 + 3 = 5 . Summarizing, we have (2 positive units) + (3 positive units) = (5 positive units) Now let us add the two negative numbers − 2 and − 3 . We perform this addition on the number line as follows. We begin at 0, the origin.Since − 2 is negative, we move 2 units to the left.Since − 3 is negative, we move 3 more units to the left.We are now located at − 5 . Thus, ( − 2) + ( − 3) = − 5 . Summarizing, we have (2 negative units) + (3 negative units) = (5 negative units) These two examples suggest that Adding Numbers with the Same Sign To add two real numbers that have the same sign, add the absolute values of the numbers and associate the common sign with the sum.

These two numbers have unlike signs. This type of addition can also be illustrated using the number line. We begin at 0, the origin.Since 2 is positive, we move 2 units to the right.Since − 6 is negative, we move, from the 2, 6 units to the left.We are now located at − 4 . A rule for adding two numbers that have unlike signs is suggested by noting that if the signs are disregarded, 4 can be obtained from 2 and 6 by subtracting 2 from 6. But 2 and 6 are precisely the absolute values of 2 and − 6 . Also, notice that the sign of the number with the larger absolute value is negative and that the sign of the resulting sum is negative. Adding Numbers with Unlike Signs To add two real numbers that have unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and associate the sign of the number with the larger absolute value with this difference.

Then, we move 2 units to the left to get to 3. (This reminds us of addition with a negative number.) This illustration suggests that 5 − 2 is the same as 5 + ( − 2) .This leads us directly to the definition of subtraction.

Multiply: 3⋅5 . 3⋅5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 . This suggests that (positive number)⋅(positive number) = positive number . More briefly, ( + )( + ) = + . Now consider the product of a positive number and a negative number. Multiply: (3)( − 5) . (3)( − 5) means ( − 5) + ( − 5) + ( − 5) = − 15 . This suggests that (positive number)⋅(negative number) = negative number More briefly, ( + )( – ) = – . By the commutative property of multiplication, we get (negative number)⋅(positive number) = negative number More briefly, ( – )( + ) = – .

Such numbers can be expressed more conveniently by writing them as part of a power of 10. To see how this is done, let us start with a somewhat smaller number such as 2480. Notice that Scientific Form The last form is called the scientific form of the number. There is one nonzero digit to the left of the decimal point and the absolute value of the exponent on 10 records the number of places the original decimal point was moved to the left. There is one nonzero digit to the left of the decimal point and the absolute value of the exponent of 10 records the number of places the original decimal point was moved to the right. Scientific Notation Numbers written in scientific form are also said to be written using scientific notation. In scientific notation, a number is written as the product of a number between and including 1 and 10 (1 is included,10 is not) and some power of 10. Writing a Number in Scientific Notation To write a number in scientific notation: Move the decimal point so that there is one nonzero digit to its left.

book1_ch03_8_8	no label	Working with Numbers in Scientific Notation Working with Numbers in Scientific Notation Working with Numbers in Scientific Notation Multiplying Numbers Using Scientific Notation There are many occasions (particularly in the sciences) when it is necessary to find the product of two numbers written in scientific notation. This is accomplished by using two of the basic rules of algebra. Suppose we wish to find (a × 10 n )(b × 10 m ) . Since the only operation is multiplication, we can use the commutative property of multiplication to rearrange the numbers. (a × 10 n )(b × 10 m ) = (a × b)( 10 n × 10 m ) Then, by the rules of exponents, 10 n × 10 m = 10 n + m . Thus, (a × 10 n )(b × 10 m ) = (a × b) × 10 n + m The product of (a × b) may not be between 1 and 10, so (a × b) × 10 n + m may not be in scientific form. The decimal point in (a × b) may have to be moved. An example of this situation is in Sample Set C, problem 2.

An important concept that all students of algebra must be aware of is the difference between terms and factors.

book1_ch04_4_3	no label	Classification of Polynomials Classification of Polynomials Classification of Polynomials Polynomials can be classified using two criteria: the number of terms and degree of the polynomial. Table 4.1. Number of Terms Name Example Comment One Monomial 4x 2 mono means “one” in Greek. Two Binomial 4x 2 − 7x bi means “two” in Latin. Three Trinomial 4x 2 − 7x + 3 tri means “three” in Greek. Four or more Polynomial 4x 3 − 7x 2 + 3x − 1 poly means “many” in Greek. Degree of a Term Containing One Variable The degree of a term containing only one variable is the value of the exponent of the variable. Exponents appearing on numbers do not affect the degree of the term. We consider only the exponent of the variable. For example: Example 4.43.  5x 3 is a monomial of degree 3. Example 4.44.  60a 5 is a monomial of degree 5. Example 4.45.  21b 2 is a monomial of degree 2. Example 4.46.  8 is a monomial of degree 0. We say that a nonzero number is a term of 0 degree since it could be written as 8x 0 . Since x 0 = 1(x ≠ 0) , 8x 0 = 8 . The exponent on the variable is 0 so it must be of degree 0. (By convention, the number 0 has no degree.) Example 4.47.  4x is a monomial of the first degree. 4x could be written as 4x 1 . The exponent on the variable is 1 so it must be of the first degree. Degree of a Term Containing Several Variables The degree of a term containing more than one variable is the sum of the exponents of the variables, as shown below. Example 4.48.  4x 2 y 5 is a monomial of degree 2 + 5 = 7 . This is a 7th degree monomial. Example 4.49.  37a b 2 c 6 d 3 is a monomial of degree 1 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 12 . This is a 12th degree monomial. Example 4.50.  5x y is a monomial of degree 1 + 1 = 2 . This is a 2nd degree monomial. Degree of a Polynomial The degree of a polynomial is the degree of the term of highest degree; for example: Example 4.51.  2x 3 + 6x − 1 is a trinomial of degree 3. The first term, 2x 3 , is the term of the highest degree. Therefore, its degree is the degree of the polynomial. Example 4.52.  7y − 10y 4 is a binomial of degree 4. Example 4.53.  a − 4 + 5a 2 is a trinomial of degree 2. Example 4.54.  2x 6 + 9x 4 − x 7 − 8x 3 + x − 9 is a polynomial of degree 7. Example 4.55.  4x 3 y 5 − 2x y 3 is a binomial of degree 8. The degree of the first term is 8. Example 4.56.  3x + 10 is a binomial of degree 1. Linear Quadratic Cubic Polynomials of the first degree are called linear polynomials.Polynomials of the second degree are called quadratic polynomials.Polynomials of the third degree are called cubic polynomials.Polynomials of the fourth degree are called fourth degree polynomials.Polynomials of the n th degree are called n th degree polynomials. Nonzero constants are polynomials of the 0th degree. Some examples of these polynomials follow: Example 4.57.  4x − 9 is a linear polynomial. Example 4.58.  3x 2 + 5x − 7 is a quadratic polynomial. Example 4.59.  8y − 2x 3 is a cubic polynomial. Example 4.60.  16a 2 − 32a 5 − 64 is a 5th degree polynomial. Example 4.61.  x 12 − y 12 is a 12th degree polynomial. Example 4.62.  7x 5 y 7 z 3 − 2x 4 y 7 z + x 3 y 7 is a 15th degree polynomial. The first term is of degree 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 . Example 4.63.  43 is a 0th degree polynomial.

book1_ch05_7_9	no label	Compound Inequalities Compound Inequalities Compound Inequalities Compound Inequality Another type of inequality is the compound inequality. A compound inequality is of the form: a < x < b There are actually two statements here. The first statement is a < x . The next statement is x < b . When we read this statement we say " a is less than x ," then continue saying "and x is less than b ." Just by looking at the inequality we can see that the number x is between the numbers a and b . The compound inequality a < x < b indicates "betweenness." Without changing the meaning, the statement a < x can be read x > a . (Surely, if the number a is less than the number x , the number x must be greater than the number a .) Thus, we can read a < x < b as " x is greater than a and at the same time is less than b ." For example: 4 < x < 9 .The letter x is some number strictly between 4 and 9. Hence, x is greater than 4 and, at the same time, less than 9. The numbers 4 and 9 are not included so we use open circles at these points. − 2 < z < 0 .The z stands for some number between − 2 and 0. Hence, z is greater than − 2 but also less than 0. 1 < x + 6 < 8 .The expression x + 6 represents some number strictly between 1 and 8. Hence, x + 6 represents some number strictly greater than 1, but less than 8. .The term represents some number between and including and . Hence, represents some number greater than or equal to to but less than or equal to . Consider problem 3 above, 1 < x + 6 < 8 . The statement says that the quantity x + 6 is between 1 and 8. This statement will be true for only certain values of x . For example, if x = 1 , the statement is true since 1 < 1 + 6 < 8 . However, if x = 4.9 , the statement is false since 1 < 4.9 + 6 < 8 is clearly not true. The first of the inequalities is satisfied since 1 is less than 10.9 , but the second inequality is not satisfied since 10.9 is not less than 8. We would like to know for exactly which values of x the statement 1 < x + 6 < 8 is true. We proceed by using the properties discussed earlier in this section, but now we must apply the rules to all three parts rather than just the two parts in a regular inequality.

A solution is not completely known until the values of both variables are specified. Independent and Dependent Variables Recall that, in an equation, any variable whose value can be freely assigned is said to be an independent variable. Any variable whose value is determined once the other value or values have been assigned is said to be a dependent variable. If, in a linear equation, the independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y , and a solution to the equation is x = a and y = b , the solution is written as the ORDERED PAIR      (a, b) Ordered Pair In an ordered pair, (a, b) , the first component, a , gives the value of the independent variable, and the second component, b , gives the value of the dependent variable. We can use ordered pairs to show some solutions to the equation y = 6x − 7 . Example 5.60.  (0, − 7) .If x = 0 and y = − 7 , we get a true statement upon substitution and computataion.

Divide each term of the product by the known factor a. Thus, b and c are the required terms of the other factor.

book1_ch07_2_2	no label	Graphs Graphs Graphs We have, thus far in our study of algebra, developed and used several methods for obtaining solutions to linear equations in both one and two variables. Quite often it is helpful to obtain a picture of the solutions to an equation. These pictures are called graphs and they can reveal information that may not be evident from the equation alone. The Graph of an Equation The geometric representation (picture) of the solutions to an equation is called the graph of the equation. 
book1_ch07_2_3	no label	Axes, Coordinate Systems, and Dimension Axes, Coordinate Systems, and Dimension Axes, Coordinate Systems, and Dimension Axis The basic structure of the graph is the axis. It is with respect to the axis that all solutions to an equation are located. The most fundamental type of axis is the number line. The Number Line is an Axis We have the following general rules regarding axes. Number of Variables and Number of Axes An equation in one variable requires one axis. An equation in two variables requires two axes. An equation in three variables requires three axes. ... An equation in n variables requires n axes. We shall always draw an axis as a straight line, and if more than one axis is required, we shall draw them so they are all mutually perpendicular (the lines forming the axes will be at 90° angles to one another). Coordinate System A system of axes constructed for graphing an equation is called a coordinate system. The Phrase, Graphing an Equation The phrase graphing an equation is used frequently and should be interpreted as meaning geometrically locating the solutions to an equation. Relating the Number of Variables and the Number of Axes We will not start actually graphing equations until Section Section 7.3, but in the following examples we will relate the number of variables in an equation to the number of axes in the coordinate system. 1. One-Dimensional Graphs: If we wish to graph the equation 5x + 2 = 17 , we would need to construct a coordinate system consisting of a single axis (a single number line) since the equation consists of only one variable. We label the axis with the variable that appears in the equation. We might interpret an equation in one variable as giving information in one-dimensional space. Since we live in three-dimensional space, one-dimensional space might be hard to imagine. Objects in one-dimensional space would have only length, no width or depth. 2. Two-Dimensional Graphs: To graph an equation in two variables such as y = 2x–3 , we would need to construct a coordinate system consisting of two mutually perpendicular number lines (axes). We call the intersection of the two axes the origin and label it with a 0. The two axes are simply number lines; one drawn horizontally, one drawn vertically. Recall that an equation in two variables requires a solution to be a pair of numbers. The solutions can be written as ordered pairs (x,y) . Since the equation y = 2x–3 involves the variables x and y , we label one axis x and the other axis y . In mathematics it is customary to label the horizontal axis with the independent variable and the vertical axis with the dependent variable. We might interpret equations in two variables as giving information in two-dimensional space. Objects in two-dimensional space would have length and width, but no depth. 3. Three-Dimensional Graphs: An equation in three variables, such as 3x 2 –4y 2 + 5z = 0 , requires three mutually perpendicular axes, one for each variable. We would construct the following coordinate system and graph. We might interpret equations in three variables as giving information about three-dimensional space. 4. Four-Dimensional Graphs: To graph an equation in four variables, such as 3x–2y + 8x–5w = –7 , would require four mutually perpendicular number lines. These graphs are left to the imagination. We might interpret equations in four variables as giving information in four-dimensional space. Four-dimensional objects would have length, width, depth, and some other dimension. Black Holes These other spaces are hard for us to imagine, but the existence of “black holes” makes the possibility of other universes of one-, two-, four-, or n-dimensions not entirely unlikely. Although it may be difficult for us “3-D” people to travel around in another dimensional space, at least we could be pretty sure that our mathematics would still work (since it is not restricted to only three dimensions)! 
book1_ch07_2_4	no label	Graphing in One Dimension Graphing in One Dimension Graphing in One Dimension Graphing a linear equation in one variable involves solving the equation, then locating the solution on the axis (number line), and marking a point at this location. We have observed that graphs may reveal information that may not be evident from the original equation. The graphs of linear equations in one variable do not yield much, if any, information, but they serve as a foundation to graphs of higher dimension (graphs of two variables and three variables).

book1_ch07_3_2	no label	The Plane The Plane The Plane Ordered Pairs We are now interested in studying graphs of linear equations in two variables. We know that solutions to equations in two variables consist of a pair of values, one value for each variable. We have called these pairs of values ordered pairs. Since we have a pair of values to graph, we must have a pair of axes (number lines) upon which the values can be located. Origin We draw the axes so they are perpendicular to each other and so that they intersect each other at their 0 ' s . This point is called the origin. Rectangular Coordinate System These two lines form what is called a rectangular coordinate system. They also determine a plane. x y-plane   A plane is a flat surface, and a result from geometry states that through any two intersecting lines (the axes) exactly one plane (flat surface) may be passed. If we are dealing with a linear equation in the two variables x and y , we sometimes say we are graphing the equation using a rectangular coordinate system, or that we are graphing the equation in the x y-plane . Quadrant Notice that the two intersecting coordinate axes divide the plane into four equal regions. Since there are four regions, we call each one a quadrant and number them counterclockwise using Roman numerals. Recall that when we first studied the number line we observed the following: For each real number there exists a unique point on the number line, and for each point on the number line we can associate a unique real number. We have a similar situation for the plane. For each ordered pair (a, b) , there exists a unique point in the plane, and to each point in the plane we can associate a unique ordered pair (a, b) of real numbers.

The first number in the ordered pair expresses the point’s horizontal distance and direction (left or right) from the origin. The second number expresses the point’s vertical distance and direction (up or down) from the origin. The Coordinates Determine Distance and Direction A positive number means a direction to the right or up. A negative number means a direction to the left or down.

book1_ch07_4_2	no label	Solutions and Lines Solutions and Lines Solutions and Lines We know that solutions to linear equations in two variables can be expressed as ordered pairs. Hence, the solutions can be represented by point in the plane. We also know that the phrase “graph the equation” means to locate the solution to the given equation in the plane. Consider the equation y − 2x = − 3 . We’ll graph six solutions (ordered pairs) to this equation on the coordinates system below. We’ll find the solutions by choosing x-values (from − 1 to  + 4 ), substituting them into the equation y − 2x = − 3 , and then solving to obtain the corresponding y-values . We can keep track of the ordered pairs by using a table. y − 2x = − 3 Table 7.8. If x = Then y = Ordered Pairs − 1 − 5 ( − 1,  − 5 ) 0 − 3 ( 0,  − 3 ) 1 − 1 ( 1,  − 1 ) 2 1 ( 2, 1 ) 3 3 ( 3, 3 ) 4 5 ( 4, 5 ) We have plotted only six solutions to the equation y − 2x = − 3 . There are, as we know, infinitely many solutions. By observing the six points we have plotted, we can speculate as to the location of all the other points. The six points we plotted seem to lie on a straight line. This would lead us to believe that all the other points (solutions) also lie on that same line. Indeed, this is true. In fact, this is precisely why first-degree equations are called linear equations. Linear Equations Produce Straight Lines 
book1_ch07_4_3	no label	General Form of a Linear Equation General Form of a Linear Equation General Form of a Linear Equation General Form of a Linear Equation in Two Variables There is a standard form in which linear equations in two variables are written. Suppose that a , b , and c are any real numbers and that a and b cannot both be zero at the same time. Then, the linear equation in two variables a x + b y = c is said to be in general form. We must stipulate that a and b cannot both equal zero at the same time, for if they were we would have 0x + 0y = c 0 = c This statement is true only if c = 0 . If c were to be any other number, we would get a false statement. Now, we have the following: The graphing of all ordered pairs that solve a linear equation in two variables produces a straight line. This implies, The graph of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line. From these statements we can conclude, If an ordered pair is a solution to a linear equations in two variables, then it lies on the graph of the equation. Also, Any point (ordered pairs) that lies on the graph of a linear equation in two variables is a solution to that equation.

Since a straight line is determined by only two points, we need only find two solutions to the equation (although a third point is helpful as a check). Intercepts When a linear equation in two variables is given in general from, a x + b y = c , often the two most convenient points (solutions) to fine are called the Intercepts: these are the points at which the line intercepts the coordinate axes. Of course, a horizontal or vertical line intercepts only one axis, so this method does not apply. Horizontal and vertical lines are easily recognized as they contain only one variable. (See Sample Set C .) y-Intercept  The point at which the line crosses the y-axis is called the y-intercept . The x-value at this point is zero (since the point is neither to the left nor right of the origin). x-Intercept  The point at which the line crosses the x-axis is called the x-intercept  and the y-value at that point is zero. The y-intercept can be found by substituting the value 0 for x into the equation and solving for y . The x-intercept can be found by substituting the value 0 for y into the equation and solving for x . Intercept Method Since we are graphing an equation by finding the intercepts, we call this method the intercept method

Actually, any two points will do. We chose to use the intercepts because they are usually the easiest to work with. In the next example, we will graph two equations using points other than the intercepts. We’ll use three points, the extra point serving as a check. 
book1_ch07_4_10	no label	Slanted, Horizontal, and Vertical Lines Slanted, Horizontal, and Vertical Lines Slanted, Horizontal, and Vertical Lines In all the graphs we have observed so far, the lines have been slanted. This will always be the case when both variables appear in the equation. If only one variable appears in the equation, then the line will be either vertical or horizontal. To see why, let’s consider a specific case: Using the general form of a line, a x + b y = c , we can produce an equation with exactly one variable by choosing a = 0 , b = 5 , and c = 15 . The equation a x + b y = c then becomes 0x + 5y = 15 Since 0⋅( any number ) = 0 , the term 0x is 0 for any number that is chosen for x . Thus, 0x + 5y = 15 becomes 0 + 5y = 15 But, 0 is the additive identity and 0 + 5y = 5y . 5y = 15 Then, solving for y we get y = 3 This is an equation in which exactly one variable appears. This means that regardless of which number we choose for x , the corresponding y-value is 3. Since the y-value is always the same as we move from left-to-right through the x-values , the height of the line above the x-axis is always the same (in this case, 3 units). This type of line must be horizontal. An argument similar to the one above will show that if the only variable that appears is x , we can expect to get a vertical line.

When this equation is solved for y , the resulting form is called the slope-intercept form. Let's generate this new form. This equation is of the form y = m x + b if we replace with m and constant with b . (Note: The fact that we let is unfortunate and occurs beacuse of the letters we have chosen to use in the general form. The letter b occurs on both sides of the equal sign and may not represent the same value at all. This problem is one of the historical convention and, fortunately, does not occur very often.)

book1_ch07_5_11	no label	The Formula for the Slope of a Line The Formula for the Slope of a Line The Formula for the Slope of a Line We have observed that the slope is a measure of the steepness of a line. We wish to develop a formula for measuring this steepness. It seems reasonable to develop a slope formula that produces the following results: Steepness of line 1 > steepness of line 2. Consider a line on which we select any two points. We’ll denote these points with the ordered pairs (x 1,  y 1  ) and (x 2,  y 2  ) . The subscripts help us to identify the points. (x 1,  y 1  ) is the first point. Subscript 1 indicates the first point. (x 2,  y 2  ) is the second point. Subscript 2 indicates the second point. The difference in x values (x 2 − x 1 ) gives us the horizontal change, and the difference in y values (y 2 − y 1 ) gives us the vertical change. If the line is very steep, then when going from the first point to the second point, we would expect a large vertical change compared to the horizontal change. If the line is not very steep, then when going from the first point to the second point, we would expect a small vertical change compared to the horizontal change. We are comparing changes. We see that we are comparing This is a comparison and is therefore a ratio. Ratios can be expressed as fractions. Thus, a measure of the steepness of a line can be expressed as a ratio. The slope of a line is defined as the ratio Mathematically, we can write these changes as Finding the Slope of a Line The slope of a nonvertical line passing through the points (x 1,  y 1  ) and (x 2,  y 2  ) is found by the formula

When an equation is written in the slope-intercept form, y = m x + b , there are also efficient ways of constructing the graph. One way, but less efficient, is to choose two or three x-values and compute to find the corresponding y-values . However, computations are tedious, time consuming, and can lead to errors.

Now, however, suppose we're given some geometric information about the line and we wish to construct the corresponding equation. We wish to find the equation of a line. We know that the formula for the slope of a line is We can find the equation of a line using the slope formula in either of two ways: Example 7.40.  If we’re given the slope, m , and any point (x, y 1 ) on the line, we can substitute this information into the formula for slope.Let (x, y 1 ) be the known point on the line and let (x,y) be any other point on the line. Then Since this equation was derived using a point and the slope of a line, it is called the point-slope form of a line. Example 7.41.  If we are given the slope, m , y-intercept, (0,b) , we can substitute this information into the formula for slope.Let (0,b) be the y-intercept and (x,y) be any other point on the line. Then, Since this equation was derived using the slope and the intercept, it was called the slope-intercept form of a line. We summarize these two derivations as follows. Forms of the Equation of a Line We can find the equation of a line if we’re given either of the following sets of information: The slope, m, and the y-intercept, (0,b), by substituting these values into This is the slope-intercept form. The slope, m, and any point, (x 1 ,y 1 ), by substituting these values into This is the point-slope form. Notice that both forms rely on knowing the slope. If we are given two points on the line we may still find the equation of the line passing through them by first finding the slope of the line, then using the point-slope form. It is customary to use either the slope-intercept form or the general form for the final form of the line. We will use the slope-intercept form as the final form.

We now wish to determine the location of the solutions to linear inequalities in two variables. Linear inequalities in two variables are inequalities of the forms: Half-Planes A straight line drawn through the plane divides the plane into two half-planes. Boundary Line The straight line is called the boundary line. Solution to an Inequality in Two Variables Recall that when working with linear equations in two variables, we observed that ordered pairs that produced true statements when substituted into an equation were called solutions to that equation. We can make a similar statement for inequalities in two variables. We say that an inequality in two variables has a solution when a pair of values has been found such that when these values are substituted into the inequality a true statement results. The Location of Solutions in the Plane As with equations, solutions to linear inequalities have particular locations in the plane. All solutions to a linear inequality in two variables are located in one and only in one entire half-plane. For example, consider the inequality 2x + 3y ≤ 6 All the solutions to the inequality 2x + 3y ≤ 6 lie in the shaded half-plane.

book1_ch07_8_3	no label	Method of Graphing Method of Graphing Method of Graphing The method of graphing linear inequalities in two variables is as follows: Graph the boundary line (consider the inequality as an equation, that is, replace the inequality sign with an equal sign). If the inequality is ≤ or ≥ , draw the boundary line solid. This means that points on the line are solutions and are part of the graph. If the inequality is < or > , draw the boundary line dotted. This means that points on the line are not solutions and are not part of the graph. Determine which half-plane to shade by choosing a test point. If, when substituted, the test point yields a true statement, shade the half-plane containing it. If, when substituted, the test point yields a false statement, shade the half-plane on the opposite side of the boundary line.

The expression , where a and b are any two whole numbers and b ≠ 0, is called a fraction. The top number, a , is called the numerator, and the bottom number, b , is called the denominator. Simple Algebraic Fraction We define a simple algebraic fraction in a similar manner. Rather than restrict­ing ourselves only to numbers, we use polynomials for the numerator and denomi­nator. Another term for a simple algebraic fraction is a rational expression. A rational expression is an expression of the form , where P and Q are both polyno­mials and Q never represents the zero polynomial. Rational Expression A rational expression is an algebraic expression that can be written as the quotient of two polynomials. Examples 1–4 are rational expressions: Example 8.1.  is a rational expression: P is x + 9 and Q is x – 7. Example 8.2.  is a rational expression: P is x 3 + 5x 2 – 12x + 1 and Q is x 4 – 10. Example 8.3.  is a rational expression: P is 3 and Q is 8. Example 8.4.  4x – 5 is a rational expression since 4x – 5 can be written as : P is 4x – 5 and Q is 1. Example 8.5.  is not a rational expression since is not a polynomial. In the rational expression , P is called the numerator and Q is called the denominator. Domain of a Rational Expression Since division by zero is not defined, we must be careful to note the values for which the rational expression is valid. The collection of values for which the rational expression is defined is called the domain of the rational expression. (Recall our study of the domain of an equation in Section Section 4.8.) Finding the Domain of a Rational Expression To find the domain of a rational expression we must ask, "What values, if any, of the variable will make the denominator zero?" To find these values, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve. If any zero-producing values are obtained, they are not included in the domain. All other real numbers are included in the domain (unless some have been excluded for particular situational reasons). 
book1_ch08_2_3	no label	Zero-Factor Property Zero-Factor Property Zero-Factor Property Sometimes to find the domain of a rational expression, it is necessary to factor the denominator and use the zero-factor property of real numbers. Zero-factor Property If two real numbers a and b are multiplied together and the resulting product is 0, then at least one of the factors must be zero, that is, either a = 0, b = 0, or both a = 0 and b = 0. The following examples illustrate the use of the zero-factor property. Example 8.6.  What value will produce zero in the expression 4x ? By the zero-factor property, if 4x = 0, then x = 0. Example 8.7.  What value will produce zero in the expression 8(x – 6)? By the zero-factor property, if 8(x – 6) = 0, then Thus, 8(x – 6) = 0 when x = 6. Example 8.8.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression (x – 3)(x + 5)? By the zero-factor property, if (x – 3)(x + 5) = 0, then Thus, (x – 3)(x + 5) = 0 when x = 3 or x = – 5. Example 8.9.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression x 2 + 6x + 8? We must factor x 2 + 6x + 8 to put it into the zero-factor property form. x 2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4) Now, (x + 2)(x + 4) = 0 when Thus, x 2 + 6x + 8 = 0 when x = – 2 or x = – 4. Example 8.10.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression 6x 2 – 19x – 7? We must factor 6x 2 – 19x – 7 to put it into the zero-factor property form. 6x 2 – 19x – 7 = (3x + 1)(2x – 7) Now, (3x + 1)(2x – 7) = 0 when Thus, 6x 2 – 19x – 7 = 0 when or .

This same property holds for rational expressions and negative signs. This property is often quite helpful in simplifying a rational expression (as we shall need to do in subsequent sections). If either the numerator or denominator of a fraction or a fraction itself is immediately preceded by a negative sign, it is usually most convenient to place the negative sign in the numerator for later operations.

For example, the rational expression can be reduced to the simpler expression for all x except x = 2,4 . From our discussion of equality of fractions in Section Section 8.2, we know that when a d = b c . This fact allows us to deduce that, if since a k b = a b k (recall the commutative property of multiplication). But this fact means that if a factor (in this case, k ) is common to both the numerator and denominator of a fraction, we may remove it without changing the value of the fraction. Cancelling The process of removing common factors is commonly called cancelling.

Using the fact that , and that 1 is the multiplicative identity, it follows that if is a rational expression, then This equation asserts that a rational expression can be transformed into an equivalent rational expression by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number. Process of Building Rational Expressions This process is known as the process of building rational expressions and it is exactly the opposite of reducing rational expressions. The process is shown in these examples: Example 8.50.  can be built to since Example 8.51.  can be built to since Example 8.52.  can be built to since Example 8.53.  can be built to since Suppose we're given a rational expression and wish to build it into a rational expression with denominator Q b 2 , that is, Since we changed the denominator, we must certainly change the numerator in the same way. To determine how to change the numerator we need to know how the denominator was changed. Since one rational expression is built into another equivalent expression by multiplication by 1, the first denominator must have been multiplied by some quantity. Observation of tells us that Q was multiplied by b 2 . Hence, we must multiply the numerator P by b 2 . Thus, Quite often a simple comparison of the original denominator with the new denominator will tell us the factor being used. However, there will be times when the factor is unclear by simple observation. We need a method for finding the factor. Observe the following examples; then try to speculate on the method. Example 8.54.  The original denominator 4 was multiplied by 5 to yield 20. What arithmetic process will yield 5 using 4 and 20? Example 8.55.  The original denominator 10 was multiplied by y to yield 10y . Example 8.56.  The original denominator 2a 3 b was multiplied by 8a 2 b 2 to yield 16a 5 b 3 . Example 8.57.  The original denominator ( a + 1 ) 2 was multiplied by 4( a − 2 ) to yield 4 ( a + 1 ) 2 ( a − 2 ) . To determine the quantity that the original denominator was multiplied by to yield the new denominator, we ask, "What did I multiply the original denominator by to get the new denominator?" We find this factor by dividing the original denominator into the new denominator. It is precisely this quantity that we multiply the numerator by to build the rational expression.

The most convenient new denominator is the least common denominator (LCD) of the given fractions. 
book1_ch08_5_6	no label	The Least Common Denominator (LCD) The Least Common Denominator (LCD) The Least Common Denominator (LCD) In arithmetic, the least common denominator is the smallest (least) quantity that each of the given denominators will divide into without a remainder. For algebraic expressions, the LCD is the polynomial of least degree divisible by each denominator. Some examples are shown below. Example 8.65.  The LCD is 12 since 12 is the smallest number that 4, 6, and 12 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.66.  The LCD is 24 since 24 is the smallest number that 3, 6, 8, and 12 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.67.  The LCD is x 2 since x 2 is the smallest quantity that x and x 2 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.68.  The LCD is 24a 2 b 3 since 24a 2 b 3 is the smallest quantity that 6a 2 b and 8a b 3 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.69.  The LCD is ( y − 6 ) 3 ( y − 1 ) since ( y − 6 ) 3   ·  ( y − 1 ) is the smallest quantity that y − 6, ( y − 6 ) 3 and y − 1 will divide into without a remainder. We’ll now propose and demonstrate a method for obtaining the LCD. Method for Obtaining the LCD Factor each denominator. Use exponents for repeated factors. It is usually not necessary to factor numerical quantities. Write down each different factor that appears. If a factor appears more than once, use only the factor with the highest exponent.

book1_ch10_5_2	no label	The Logic Behind The Method The Logic Behind The Method The Logic Behind The Method Suppose we wish to solve the quadratic equation x 2 − 3x − 1 = 0. Since the equation is not of the form x 2 = K, we cannot use extraction of roots. Next, we try factoring, but after a few trials we see that x 2 − 3x − 1 is not factorable. We need another method for solving quadratic equations.The method we shall study is based on perfect square trinomials and extraction of roots. The method is called solving quadratic equations by completing the square. Consider the equation x 2 + 6x + 5 = 0. This quadratic equation could be solved by factoring, but we’ll use the method of completing the square. We will explain the method in detail after we look at this example. First we’ll rewrite the equation as x 2 + 6x = − 5 Then, we’ll add 9 to each side. We get x 2 + 6x + 9 = − 5 + 9 The left side factors as a perfect square trinomial. ( x + 3 ) 2 = 4 We can solve this by extraction of roots. Notice that when the roots are rational numbers, the equation is factorable.The big question is, “How did we know to add 9 to each side of the equation?” We can convert any quadratic trinomial appearing in an equation into a perfect square trinomial if we know what number to add to both sides. We can determine that particular number by observing the following situation: Consider the square of the binomial and the resulting perfect square trinomial ( x + p ) 2 = x 2 + 2p x + p 2 Notice that the constant term (the number we are looking for) can be obtained from the linear term 2p x. If we take one half the coefficient of and square it, we get the constant term p 2 . This is true for every perfect square trinomial with leading coefficient 1. In a perfect square trinomial with leading coefficient 1, the constant term is the square of one half the coefficient of the linear term. Study these examples to see what constant term will make the given binomial into a perfect square trinomial. Example 10.26.  x 2 + 6x.   The constant must be the square of one half the coefficient of x. Since the coefficient of x is 6, we haveThe constant is 9. x 2 + 6x + 9 = ( x + 3 ) 2 This is a perfect square trinomial. Example 10.27.  a 2 + 10a.   The constant must be the square of one half the coefficient of a.

Take one half of the coefficient of the linear term, square it, then add it to both sides of the equation. The trinomial on the left is now a perfect square trinomial and can be factored as ( ) 2 .

It is similar to the method of elimination by substitution in that the process eliminates one equation and one variable. The method of elimination by addition makes use of the following two properties. If A , B , and C are algebraic expressions such that a x + ( − a x ) = 0 Property 1 states that if we add the left sides of two equations together and the right sides of the same two equations together, the resulting sums will be equal. We call this adding equations. Property 2 states that the sum of two opposites is zero.

How can the number of nothing be a number? Is zero nothing, or is it something? Well, before this starts to sound like a Zen koan, let’s look at how we use the numeral “0.” Arab and Indian scholars were the first to use zero to develop the place-value number system that we use today. When we write a number, we use only the ten numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. These numerals can stand for ones, tens, hundreds, or whatever depending on their position in the number. In order for this to work, we have to have a way to mark an empty place in a number, or the place values won’t come out right. This is what the numeral “0” does. Think of it as an empty container, signifying that that place is empty. For example, the number 302 has 3 hundreds, no tens, and 2 ones. So is zero a number? Well, that is a matter of definition, but in mathematics we tend to call it a duck if it acts like a duck, or at least if it’s behavior is mostly duck-like. The number zero obeys most of the same rules of arithmetic that ordinary numbers do, so we call it a number. It is a rather special number, though, because it doesn’t quite obey all the same laws as other numbers—you can’t divide by zero, for example. Note for math purists: In the strict axiomatic field development of the real numbers, both 0 and 1 are singled out for special treatment. Zero is the additive identity, because adding zero to a number does not change the number. Similarly, 1 is the multiplicative identity because multiplying a number by 1 does not change it.     Even more abstract than zero is the idea of negative numbers. If, in addition to not having any sheep, the farmer owes someone 3 sheep, you could say that the number of sheep that the farmer owns is negative 3. It took longer for the idea of negative numbers to be accepted, but eventually they came to be seen as something we could call “numbers.” The expanded set of numbers that we get by including negative versions of the counting numbers is called the integers.

Well, do you have a checking account? Having less than zero means that you have to add some to it just to get it up to zero. And if you take more out of it, it will be even further less than zero, meaning that you will have to add even more just to get it up to zero. The strict mathematical definition goes something like this: For every real number n, there exists its opposite, denoted – n, such that the sum of n and – n is zero, or n + (– n) = 0 Note that the negative sign in front of a number is part of the symbol for that number: The symbol “–3” is one object—it stands for “negative three,” the name of the number that is three units less than zero. The number zero is its own opposite, and zero is considered to be neither negative nor positive. Read the discussion of subtraction for more about the meanings of the symbol “–.”     The next generalization that we can make is to include the idea of fractions. While it is unlikely that a farmer owns a fractional number of sheep, many other things in real life are measured in fractions, like a half-cup of sugar. If we add fractions to the set of integers, we get the set of rational numbers.

Think of it as the denomination—it tells you what size fraction we are talking about: fourths, fifths, etc.   The top of the fraction is called the numerator. It tells you how many fourths, fifths, or whatever.   RESTRICTION: The denominator cannot be zero! (But the numerator can) If the numerator is zero, then the whole fraction is just equal to zero. If I have zero thirds or zero fourths, than I don’t have anything. However, it makes no sense at all to talk about a fraction measured in “zeroths.” Fractions can be numbers smaller than 1, like 1/2 or 3/4 (called proper fractions), or they can be numbers bigger than 1 (called improper fractions), like two-and-a-half, which we could also write as 5/2 All integers can also be thought of as rational numbers, with a denominator of 1: This means that all the previous sets of numbers (natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers) are subsets of the rational numbers. Now it might seem as though the set of rational numbers would cover every possible case, but that is not so. There are numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction, and these numbers are called irrational because they are not rational.

After all, if I measure a length with a ruler, it is going to come out to some fraction—maybe 2 and 3/4 inches. Suppose I then measure it with more precision. I will get something like 2 and 5/8 inches, or maybe 2 and 23/32 inches. It seems that however close I look it is going to be some fraction. However, this is not always the case. Imagine a line segment exactly one unit long:     Now draw another line one unit long, perpendicular to the first one, like this:     Now draw the diagonal connecting the two ends: Congratulations! You have just drawn a length that cannot be measured by any rational number. According to the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of this diagonal is the square root of 2; that is, the number which when multiplied by itself gives 2. According to my calculator, But my calculator only stops at eleven decimal places because it can hold no more. This number actually goes on forever past the decimal point, without the pattern ever terminating or repeating. This is because if the pattern ever stopped or repeated, you could write the number as a fraction—and it can be proven that the square root of 2 can never be written as for any choice of integers for a and b. The proof of this was considered quite shocking when it was first demonstrated by the followers of Pythagoras 26 centuries ago.

The points are ordered so that points to the right are greater than points to the left: Every real number corresponds to a distance on the number line, starting at the center (zero). Negative numbers represent distances to the left of zero, and positive numbers are distances to the right. The arrows on the end indicate that it keeps going forever in both directions.

In short: If a number is positive (or zero), the absolute value function does nothing to it: If a number is negative, the absolute value function makes it positive: WARNING: If there is arithmetic to do inside the absolute value sign, you must do it before taking the absolute value—the absolute value function acts on the result of whatever is inside it.

We view a negative number as a displacement to the left on the number line, so we follow the same procedure as before but when we add a negative number we take that many steps to the left instead of the right. Examples:  2 + (–3) = –1 First we move two steps to the right, and then three steps to the left: (–2) + 3 = 1 We move two steps to the left, and then three steps to the right:  (–2) + (–3) = –5 Two steps to the left, and then three more steps to the left:   From these examples, we can make the following observations: 1.      If we add two positive numbers together, the result will be positive 2.      If we add two negative numbers together, the result will be negative 3.      If we add a positive and a negative number together, the result could be positive or negative, depending on which number represents the biggest step.

Subtraction is binary (acts on two numbers), but negation is unary (acts on only one number).           Calculators have two different keys to perform these functions. The key with a plain minus sign is only for subtraction:   Negation is performed by a key that looks like one of these: Remember that subtraction can always be thought of as adding the opposite.

book3_chapter01_3_1	no label	Multiplication with Signed Numbers Multiplication with Signed Numbers Multiplication with Signed Numbers We can apply this same rule to make sense out of what we mean by a positive number times a negative number. For example, 3 × (–4) just means to take 3 of the number “negative four” and add them together: 3 × (–4) = (–4) + (–4) + (–4) = –12 Unfortunately, this scheme breaks down when we try to multiply a negative number times a number. It doesn’t make sense to try to write down a number a negative number of times. There are two ways to look at this problem. One way is to use the fact that multiplication obeys the commutative law, which means that the order of multiplication does not matter: a × b = b × a. This lets us write a negative times a positive as a positive times a negative and proceed as before: (–3) × 4 = 4 × (–3) = (–3) + (–3) + (–3) + (–3) = –12 However, we are still in trouble when it comes to multiplying a negative times a negative. A better way to look at this problem is to demand that multiplication obey a consistent pattern. If we look at a multiplication table for positive numbers and then extend it to include negative numbers, the results in the table should continue to change in the same pattern. For example, consider the following multiplication table: a b a × b 3 2 6 2 2 4 1 2 2 0 2 0 The numbers in the last column are decreasing by 2 each time, so if we let the values for a continue into the negative numbers we should keep decreasing the product by 2: a b a × b 3 2 6 2 2 4 1 2 2 0 2 0 –1 2 –2 –2 2 –4 –3 2 –6 We can make a bigger multiplication table that shows many different possibilities. By keeping the step sizes the same in each row and column, even as we extend into the negative numbers, we see that the following sign rules hold for multiplication:

The formal development of the real number system starts with the field axioms. The field axioms are postulated, and then all the other properties follow from them. The field axioms are The associative and commutative laws for addition and multiplication The existence of the additive and multiplicative identities (0 and 1) The existence of the additive inverse (opposites, or negatives) and the multiplicative inverse (the reciprocal) The distributive law All of these are essential, but the distributive law is particularly important because it is what distinguishes the behavior of multiplication from addition. Namely, multiplication distributes over addition but not vice-versa. The rules of arithmetic like “a negative times a negative gives a positive” are what they are because that is the only way the field axioms would still hold. For example, the distributive law requires that –2(3 – 2) = (–2)(3) + (–2)(–2) We can evaluate the left side of this equation by following the order of operations, which says to do what is in parentheses first, so –2(3 – 2) = –2(1) = –2. Now for the distributive law to be true, the right side must also be equal to -2, so (–2)(3) + (–2)(–2) = –2 If we use our sign rules for multiplication then it works out the way it should: (–2)(3) + (–2)(–2) = –6 + 4 = –2   
book3_chapter01_3_3	no label	Notation for Multiplication Notation for Multiplication Notation for Multiplication We are used to using the symbol “×” to represent multiplication in arithmetic, but in algebra we prefer to avoid that symbol because we like to use the letter “x” to represent a variable, and the two symbols can be easily confused. So instead, we adopt the following notation for multiplication: 1.      Multiplication is implied if two quantities are written side-by-side with no other symbol between them. Example:  ab means a × b. 2.      If a symbol is needed to prevent confusion, we use a dot.   Example:  If we need to show 3 times 5, we cannot just write them next to each other or it would look like the number thirty-five, so we write 3 · 5. We can also use parentheses to separate factors. 3 times 5 could be written as 3(5) or (3)5 or (3)(5). 
book3_chapter01_3_4	no label	Division Division Division There are two ways to think of division: as implying a related multiplication, or as multiplying by the reciprocal. Division as Related Multiplication The statement “12 ÷ 3 = 4” is true only because 3 × 4 = 12. A division problem is really asking the question “What number can I multiply the divisor by to get the dividend?”; and so every division equation implies an equivalent multiplication equation. In general: a ÷ b = c if and only if a = b × c This also shows why you cannot divide by zero. If we asked “What is six divided by zero?” we would mean “What number times zero is equal to six?”, but any number times zero gives zero, so there is no answer to this question.

Note that the reciprocal of 1/a is a. The reciprocal of the reciprocal gives you back what you started with. This allows us to define division as multiplication by the reciprocal: a ÷ b = a × (1/b) This is usually the most convenient way to think of division when you are doing algebra.

book3_chapter01_5	no label	Order of Operations Order of Operations When we encounter an expression such as 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 22+3, it makes quite a difference how we choose which operations to perform first. We need a set of rules that would guide anyone to one unique value for this kind of expression. Some of these rules are simply based on convention, while others are forced on us by mathematical logic. In the chapter on the Properties of Real Numbers, you will see how the distributive law is consistent with these rules. The universally agreed-upon order in which to evaluate a mathematical expression is as follows:1. Parentheses from Inside OutBy “parentheses” we mean anything that acts as a grouping symbol, including anything inside symbols such as [ ], { }, |  | and . Any expression in the numerator or denominator of a fraction or in an exponent are also considered grouped and should be simplified before carrying out further operations. ·        If there are nested parentheses (parentheses inside parentheses), you work from the innermost parentheses outward.2. ExponentsAlso other special functions such as log, sin, cos, etc.3. Multiplication and Division, left to rightThe left-to-right order does not matter if only multiplication is involved, but it matters for division.4. Addition and Subtraction, left to rightThe left-to-right order does not matter if only addition is involved, but it matters for subtraction.Example:  Going back to our original example, 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 22+3Given: 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 22+3 The exponent is an implied grouping, so the 2 + 3 must be evaluated first: = 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 25 Now the exponent is carried out: = 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 32 Now the multiplication and division, left to right, using 15 ¸ 3 = 5 and 5 ´ 32 = 160: = 3 + 5 + 160 Now the addition, left to right: = 168  Calculator Note: Most modern calculators “know” the order of operations, and you can enter expressions pretty much as they are written. Some older calculators will carry out each operation as soon as its key is pushed, which can result in the operations being carried out in the wrong order. Try some examples if you are not sure how your calculator behaves.For example, if you enter3 + 4 × 5 =The correct answer should be 23, because the multiplication should be performed before the addition, giving 3 + 20. But if your calculator carries out the “3 + 4” before getting to the “ × 5”, it will show a result of 35 because it will see it as 7 × 5.  Calculator  Note: Use the parenthesis keys to force grouping. If you are evaluating an expression such asthe denominator needs to be simplified before doing the division. If you enter it into your calculator as 4 ÷ 3 + 5, it will evaluate the “ 4 ÷ 3 “ first, and then add 5 to the result, giving the incorrect answer of 6.3333. To make it perform the addition first, use parentheses:4 ÷ (3 + 5) = 0.5 In our example problem above, the “2 + 3” in the exponent is an implied grouping, and you would need to use parentheses. To enter that expression in your calculator, you would enter it as3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 2 ^ (2 + 3) =(on some calculators the exponent button is labeled “ ^ ”, while on others it is labeled “ yx ”)
book3_chapter01_6_1	no label	Mixed Number Notation Mixed Number Notation Mixed Number  Notation One way of expressing the improper fraction 5/4 is as the mixed number , which is read as “one and one-fourth.” This notation is potentially confusing and is not advised in algebra. One cause of confusion is that in algebra we use the convention that multiplication is implied when two quantities are written next to each other with no symbols in between. However, the mixed number notation implies addition, not multiplication. For example, means 1 plus one-quarter, and 3 1/2 = 3 + 1/2. It is possible to do arithmetic with mixed numbers by treating the whole number parts and the fractional parts separately, but it is generally more convenient in algebra to always write improper fractions. When you encounter a problem with mixed numbers, the first thing you should do is convert them to improper fractions.

You can measure a half-cup of sugar or two quarter-cups of sugar, or even four eighth-cups of sugar, and you will still have the same amount of sugar. ·       Multiply by a form of One A fraction can be converted into an equivalent fraction by multiplying it by a form of 1. The number 1 can be represented as a fraction because any number divided by itself is equal to 1 (remember that the fraction notation means the same thing as division). In other words,   etc. Now if you multiply a number by 1 it does not change its value, so if we multiply a fraction by another fraction that is equal to 1, we will not be changing the value of the original fraction. For example, In this case, 2/3 represents exactly the same quantity as 4/6, because all we did was to multiply 2/3 by the number 1, represented as the fraction 2/2. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number to produce an equivalent fraction is called building up the fraction.

Example:  6 is not prime because it can be written as 2 × 3 Example:  7 is prime because the only way to write it as a product of whole numbers is 1 × 7 The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, . . . There are an infinite number of prime numbers (the list goes on forever).  Any non-prime number can be decomposed into a product of prime numbers Example:  4 = 2 × 2 Example:  12 = 2 × 2 × 3 The Branching Method This method works well for larger numbers that might have many factors. All you need to do is think of any two numbers that multiply to give your original number, and write them below it. Continue this process for each number until each branch ends in a prime number. The factors of the original number are the prime numbers on the ends of all the branches. Example:  Factor the number 60     60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 Notes Notice how I started with the smallest numbers: first 2’s, then 3’s, and so on. This is not required but it keeps the result nicely in order. If a number is even, then it is divisible by 2. If a number ends in 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. If the digits of a number add up to a number divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3. In this example 15 gives 1 + 5 = 6, which is divisible by 3, and therefore 15 is divisible by 3. Large numbers with large prime factors are notoriously hard to factor—it is mainly just a matter of trial and error. The public-key encryption system for sending secure computer data uses very large numbers that need to be factored in order to break the code. The code is essentially unbreakable because it would take an enormous amount of computer time to try every possible prime factor.

In this example, the common denominator is 1000, and we get This suggests a general rule for converting a decimal number to its fraction form: Put all the digits over the denominator that corresponds to the last decimal place value. In the number 2.345, the last decimal place value is the thousandths place, so we put the digits 2345 over the denominator 1000. Of course we would usually want to reduce the resulting fraction to its simplest form. In this case 
book3_chapter01_7_2	no label	Repeating Fractions Repeating Fractions Repeating Fractions The only time this method does not work is for repeating fractions. We know that 1/3 = 0.3333333... but how could we go from 0.3333333... back to 1/3? There is no ‘last decimal place’ because the decimals repeat forever. Fortunately, there is a simple trick for this: ·         Put the repeating digit over a denominator of 9. So we see that in the case of 0.3333333...., the repeating digit is 3, and we make the fraction 3/9, which reduces to 1/3. If there is a group of more than one digit that repeats, Put the repeating group of digits over as many 9’s as there are digits. For example, in the fraction we see that the group of digits ‘15’ repeats, so we put ‘15’ over a denominator of ‘99’ to get o        One warning: This only works for the repeating fraction part of a number. If you have a number like 2.33333..., you should just work with the decimal part and rejoin it with the whole part after you have converted it to a fraction. o        Irrational numbers like p or  have non-repeating decimals, and so they cannot be written as fractions. You can, however, round them off at some point and produce an approximate fraction for them.   Why This Trick Works  If you have learned enough algebra to follow these steps, it is not difficult to see why this works. Let’s start with the simple example 0.3333333... Since we already know that the answer is 1/3, we can concentrate on the procedure, not the answer. Let x = 0.3333333... Multiply both sides by 10 to get 10x = 3.33333... Notice that the decimal part (.33333…) is still the same. In fact, it is the very thing that we called x in the first place, so we can say that 10x= 3 + x Now solve for x: This method will also work for repeating fractions that contain a group of repeating digits, but you have to multiply by a higher power of 10 in order to make the decimal portion stay the same as it was before. For example, suppose we had 0.345345345.... Let x = 0.345345345.... Multiply both sides by 1000 to get 1000x = 345.345345345.... Notice that the decimal part is still the same. In fact, it is still the thing that we called x in the first place, so we can say that 1000x = 345 + x Now solve for x:

Remember that the fraction bar means the same thing as division. To convert a fraction to a decimal, do the division. For example, You can do the division with a calculator or by hand with long division. 
book3_chapter01_7_4	no label	Rounding Rounding Rounding Look only one digit to the right ‘5’s or higher round up (there is some dispute about this rule, but it is good enough for most purposes)   Rounding 5’s Why round fives up? The number 3.5 is exactly halfway between 3.0 and 4.0, so it makes just as much sense to round it down as it does to round it up. Most of the time there is no harm in using the ‘always round fives up’ rule. This is the rule that the United States Internal Revenue Service advises you to use on your taxes, and who is going to argue with them? Sometimes, though, it can cause problems. Suppose you are adding a very large number of values that have all been rounded by this rule. The sum that you get will be a little bit bigger than it ought to be. This can be a very serious problem in computer programs. When thousands or even millions of additions are being performed, the accumulated roundoff error can be quite large. One way of dealing with this problem is the even-odd rule. This rule says that: If the five is the last significant digit and the round-off digit (the one to the left of the 5) is odd, round up. If the five is the last significant digit and the round-off digit is even, don’t round up. Actually, you could reverse even and odd in this rule. All that matters is that about half the time you will be rounding up on a 5, and half the time down. The reason it matters that the five is the last significant digit is because if there are any other non-zero digits past the five then you must round up, because the part that you are chopping off is more than 50% of the roundoff place-value. For example, suppose you want to round 3.351 to the nearest tenth. The decimal part represents the fraction 351/1000, which is 1/1000 closer to 400/1000 than it is to 300/100. Therefore you would always round this up to 3.4.     Example:  Round 11.3826 to the nearest hundredth. Solution: The hundredths place is where the ‘8’ is. We look one digit to the right and see a ‘2’, so we do not round up, leaving us with 11.38. Example:  Round 11.3826 to the nearest thousandth. Solution: The thousandths place is where the ‘2’ is. We look one place to the right and see a ‘6’, so we round the ‘2’ up, getting 11.383. Trouble with ‘9’s. If the digit you are rounding up is a ‘9’, then rounding it up will make it a ‘10’, which is too big for one place. What happens is that the extra ‘1’ gets added to the place to the left. Example:  Round 3.49721 to the nearest hundredth. Solution: The hundredth place has a ‘9’ in it. One step to the right is a ‘7’, so we have to round up. This makes the ‘9’ into a ‘10’, but we really can’t write the new number as 3.4(10). Instead, the extra ‘1’ moves one place to the left and is added to the ‘4’, giving us 3.50. It can happen that the place to the left contains another ‘9’, in which case the extra ‘1’ will cause it to become a ‘10’, which pushes the ‘1’ still further on to the next place to the left. Example:  Round 75.69996217 to the nearest ten-thousandth Solution: The ten-thousandths place is the last ‘9’ in the number, and the place to its right is a ‘6’, which means we round up. This makes the ‘9’ into a ‘10’, like this: 75.699(10) But of course we cannot put a ‘10’ in that place, so the ‘1’ moves to the left and gets added to the ‘9’ there, making it into a ‘10’: 75.69(10)0 This leaves us with the same problem, a ‘10’ in one decimal place, so the extra ‘1’ moves one more step to the left, turning that ‘9’ into a ‘10’: 75.6(10)00 Well, we still have the same problem, so we move the ‘1’ yet another step to the left, where it adds on to the ‘6’, finally leaving us with an acceptable answer: 75.7000 In general, ·        The extra ‘1’ migrates to the left until it finds a resting-place. This means that the ‘1’ moves to the left until it can be added to a digit less than ‘9’, or until it falls off the end as a new digit out in front. Example:  Round 999.96 to the nearest tenth. The digit to the right of the tenths place is a ‘6’, so we have to round up. But when we round up the ‘9’ it becomes a ‘10’, forcing the one to be added to the left. Unfortunately, we find another ‘9’ there and the process is repeated for each of the ‘9’s until we reach the leading ‘9’, which becomes a ‘10’ resulting in 1000.0

Addition and Subtraction To add or subtract decimal numbers, you use the familiar column method that you learned back in grade school. To use this method, the place values of the two numbers must be lined up. This means that the decimal points must be lined up, and you can fill in with zeros if one number has more decimal places than the other.   Example:     5.46 + 11.2   Becomes:   Multiplication To multiply two decimal numbers, you can use the column method just as you would with whole numbers. You ignore the decimal points as you carry out the multiplication, and then you put the decimal point in the result at the correct place. The product will have the number of decimal places as the total number of decimal places in the factors. In the following example, the first factor has 2 decimal places and the second factor has 1 decimal place, so the product must have 3 decimal places:   Division You can divide decimal numbers using the familiar (?) technique of long division. This can be awkward, though, because it is hard to guess at products of decimals (long division, you may recall, is basically a guess-and-check technique). It can be made easier by multiplying both the dividend and divisor by ‘10’s to make the divisor a whole number. This will not change the result of the division, because division is the same thing as fractions, and multiplying both the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number will not change the value of the fraction. For example, consider This is the same as the fraction , which is equivalent to the fraction , obtained by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 10. Thus   ,   which can be attacked with long division:     
book3_chapter01_8_1	no label	To convert a decimal to a percent To convert a decimal to a percent To convert a decimal to a percent Multiply the decimal number by 100 (or move the decimal point two places to the right). Since x% = x/100, it is also true that 100 x% = x. Another way to look at is to consider that in order to convert a number into a percent, you have to express it in hundredths. Recall that the hundredths place is the second place to the right of the decimal, so this is the digit that gives the units digit of the percent. Of course, all this means is that you move the decimal point two places to the right. WARNING: If you just remember these rules as “move the decimal two places to the left” and “move the decimal two places to the right,” you are very likely to get them confused. If you accidentally move the decimal in the wrong direction it will end up four places off from where it should be, which means that your answer will be either ten-thousand times too big or ten-thousand times too small. This is generally not an acceptable range of error. It is much better to remember these rules by simply remembering the meaning of the percent sign, namely that “ % “ means “ /100.” If you just write the problem that way, you should be able to see what you need to do in order to solve it. Converting between percents and their decimal equivalents is so simple that it is usually best to express all percents in decimal form when you are working percent problems. The decimal numbers are what you will need to put in your calculator, and you can always express the result as a percent if you need to.   Calculator  note: Some calculators have a percent key that essentially just divides by 100, but it can do other useful things that might save you a few keystrokes. For instance, if you need to add 5% to a number (perhaps to include the sales tax on a purchase), on most calculators you can enter the original number and then press “ + 5 % = “. Just make sure you understand what it does before you blindly trust it. What it is doing in this example is multiplying the original number by 0.05 and then adding the result onto the original number. You should be able to work any percent problem without using this key, but once you understand what is going on it can be a convenient short-cut.

Examples:  In this last example, the first fraction has a decimal in it, which is not a proper way to represent a fraction. To clear the decimal, just multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to produce an equivalent fraction written with whole numbers. 
book3_chapter01_8_3	no label	To convert a fraction to a percent To convert a fraction to a percent To convert a fraction to a percent ·         Divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100 To write a fraction as a percent you need to convert the fraction into hundredths. Sometimes this is easy to do without a calculator. For example, if you saw the fraction , you should notice that doubling the numerator and the denominator will produce an equivalent fraction that has a denominator of 100. Then the numerator will be the percent that you are seeking: With other fractions, though, it is not always so easy. It is not at all obvious how to convert a fraction like 5/7 into something over 100. In this case, the best thing to do is to convert the fraction into its decimal form, and then convert the decimal into a percent. To convert the fraction to a decimal, remember that the fraction bar indicates division: The “approximately equal to” sign () is used because the decimal parts have been rounded off. Because it is understood that approximate numbers are rounded, we will not continue to use the approximately equal sign. It is more conventional to just use the standard equal sign with approximate numbers, even though it is not entirely accurate. 
book3_chapter01_8_4	no label	Working percent problems Working percent problems Working percent problems In percent problems, just as in fraction problems, the word “of” implies multiplication: “x percent of a number” means “x% times a number” Example:  What is 12% of 345? 12% is 12/100, which we can express in decimal form as 0.12. 12% of 345 means 12% times 345, or Notice how it is easier to just move the decimal over two places instead of explicitly dividing by 100. We solve a problem like this by translating the question into mathematical symbols, using x to stand for the unknown “what” and that the “of” means “times”: Example:  What percent of 2342 is 319? Once again we translate this into mathematical symbols: Solving this equation involves a little bit of algebra. To isolate the x% on one side of the equation we must divide both sides by 2342: The calculator tells us that x% = 0.1362 Now the right-hand side of this equation is the decimal equivalent that is equal to x%, which means that x = 13.62, or 319 is 13.62% of 2342 If that last step confused you, remember that the percent symbol means “over 100”, so the equation x% = 0.1362 really says or x = 100(0.1362) x = 13.62 Example:  2.4 is what percent of 19.7? Translating into math symbols: Solving for x: 2.4 = x% (19.7) x% = 0.1218 x = 12.18 So we can say that 2.4 is 12% of 19.7 (rounding to 2 significant figures) Example:  46 is 3.2% of what? Translating into math symbols: Solving for x: 46 = 3.2% (x) 46 = 0.032x x = 1437.5 Therefore, we can say that 46 is 3.2% of 1400 (rounding to 2 significant figures). Notice that in the second step the percentage (3.2%) is converted into its decimal form (0.032). 
book3_chapter01_9	no label	Properties of Real Numbers Properties of Real Numbers The following table lists the defining properties of the real numbers (technically called the field axioms). These laws define how the things we call numbers should behave. Addition Multiplication Commutative For all real a, b a + b = b + a Commutative For all real a, b ab = ba Associative For all real a, b, c a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c Associative For all real a, b, c (ab)c = a(bc) Identity There exists a real number 0 such that for every real a a + 0 = a Identity There exists a real number 1 such that for every real a a × 1 = a Additive Inverse (Opposite) For every real number a there exist a real number, denoted (-a), such that a + (–a) = 0 Multiplicative Inverse (Reciprocal) For every real number a except 0 there exist a real number, denoted , such that a ×  = 1 Distributive Law For all real a, b, c a(b + c) = ab + ac, and (a + b)c = ac + bcThe commutative and associative laws do not hold for subtraction or division:a – b is not equal to b – aa ÷ b is not equal to b ÷ aa – (b – c) is not equal to (a – b) – ca ÷ (b ÷ c) is not equal to (a ÷ b) ÷ cTry some examples with numbers and you will see that they do not work.What these laws mean is that order and grouping don't matter for addition and multiplication, but they certainly do matter for subtraction and division. In this way, addition and multiplication are “cleaner” than subtraction and division. This will become important when we start talking about algebraic expressions. Often what we will want to do with an algebraic expression will involve rearranging it somehow. If the operations are all addition and multiplication, we don't have to worry so much that we might be changing the value of an expression by rearranging its terms or factors. Fortunately, we can always think of subtraction as an addition problem (adding the opposite), and we can always think of division as a multiplication (multiplying by the reciprocal).You may have noticed that the commutative and associative laws read exactly the same way for addition and multiplication, as if there was no difference between them other than notation. The law that makes them behave differently is the distributive law, because multiplication distributes over addition, not vice-versa.. The distributive law is extremely important, and it is impossible to understand algebra without being thoroughly familiar with this law.Example:  2(3 + 4)According to the order of operations rules, we should evaluate this expression by first doing the addition inside the parentheses, giving us2(3 + 4) = 2(7) = 14But we can also look at this problem with the distributive law, and of course still get the same answer. The distributive law says that

The way to think about this operation is that if you have three x-squareds, and then you get five more x-squareds, you will then have eight x-squareds. Example:  x2 + 2x + 3x2 + 2 + 4x + 7 Starting with the highest power of x, we see that there are four x-squareds in all (1x2 + 3x2). Then we collect the first powers of x, and see that there are six of them (2x + 4x). The only thing left is the constants 2 + 7 = 9.

Think of parentheses as opaque—the stuff inside the parentheses can’t “see” the stuff outside the parentheses. If there is some factor multiplying the parentheses, then the only way to get rid of the parentheses is to multiply using the distributive law. Example:  3x + 2(x – 4) = 3x + 2x – 8 = 5x – 8 
book3_chapter02_2_3	no label	Minus Signs: Subtraction and Negatives Minus Signs: Subtraction and Negatives Minus Signs: Subtraction and Negatives Subtraction can be replaced by adding the opposite 3x – 2 = 3x + (–2) Negative signs in front of parentheses A special case is when a minus sign appears in front of parentheses. At first glance, it looks as though there is no factor multiplying the parentheses, and you may be tempted to just remove the parentheses. What you need to remember is that the minus sign indicating subtraction should always be thought of as adding the opposite. This means that you want to add the opposite of the entire thing inside the parentheses, and so you have to change the sign of each term in the parentheses. Another way of looking at it is to imagine an implied factor of one in front of the parentheses. Then the minus sign makes that factor into a negative one, which can be multiplied by the distributive law: 3x – (2 – x) = 3x + (–1)[2 + (–x)] = 3x + (–1)(2) + (–1)(–x) = 3x – 2 + x = 4x – 2 However, if there is only a plus sign in front of the parentheses, then you can simply erase the parentheses: 3x + (2 – x) = 3x + 2 – x A comment about subtraction and minus signs Although you can always explicitly replace subtraction with adding the opposite, as in this previous example, it is often tedious and inconvenient to do so. Once you get used to thinking that way, it is no longer necessary to actually write it that way. It is helpful to always think of minus signs as being “stuck” to the term directly to their right. That way, as you rearrange terms, collect like terms, and clear parentheses, the “adding the opposite” business will be taken care of because the minus signs will go with whatever was to their right. If what is immediately to the right of a minus sign happens to be a parenthesis, then the minus sign attacks every term inside the parentheses. 
book3_chapter02_3	no label	Solutions of Algebraic Equations Solutions of Algebraic Equations Up until now, we have just been talking about manipulating algebraic expressions. Now it is time to talk about equations. An expression is just a statement like2x + 3This expression might be equal to any number, depending on the choice of x. For example, if x = 3 then the value of this expression is 9. But if we are writing an equation, then we are making a statement about its value. We might say2x + 3 = 7A mathematical equation is either true or false. This equation, 2x + 3 = 7, might be true or it might be false; it depends on the value chosen for x. We call such equations conditional, because their truth depends on choosing the correct value for x. If I choose x = 3, then the equation is clearly false because 2(3) + 3 = 9, not 7. In fact, it is only true if I choose x = 2. Any other value for x produces a false equation. We say that x = 2 is the solution of this equation.Solutions The solution of an equation is the value(s) of the variable(s) that make the equation a true statement. An equation like 2x + 3 = 7 is a simple type called a linear equation in one variable. These will always have one solution, no solutions, or an infinite number of solutions. There are other types of equations, however, that can have several solutions. For example, the equation x2 = 9 is satisfied by both 3 and –3, and so it has two solutions. One Solution This is the normal case, as in our example where the equation 2x + 3 = 7 had exactly one solution, namely x = 2. The other two cases, no solution and an infinite number of solutions, are the oddball cases that you don’t expect to run into very often. Nevertheless, it is important to know that they can happen in case you do encounter one of these situations. Infinite Number of Solutions Consider the equation x = x This equation is obviously true for every possible value of x. This is, of course, a ridiculously simple example, but it makes the point. Equations that have this property are called identities. Some examples of identities would be   2x = x + x 3 = 3 (x – 2)(x + 2) = x2 – 4   All of these equations are true for any value of x. The second example, 3 = 3, is interesting because it does not even contain an x, so obviously its truthfulness cannot depend on the value of x! When you are attempting to solve an equation algebraically and you end up with an obvious identity (like 3 = 3), then you know that the original equation must also be an identity, and therefore it has an infinite number of solutions. No Solutions Now consider the equation x + 4 = x + 3 There is no possible value for x that could make this true. If you take a number and add 4 to it, it will never be the same as if you take the same number and add 3 to it. Such an equation is called a contradiction, because it cannot ever be true. If you are attempting to solve such an equation, you will end up with an extremely obvious contradiction such as 1 = 2. This indicates that the original equation is a contradiction, and has no solution.  In summary, o        An identity is always true, no matter what x is o        A contradiction is never true for any value of x o        A conditional equation is true for some values of x
book3_chapter02_4_1	no label	The Addition Principle The Addition Principle The Addition Principle ·        Adding (or subtracting) the same number to both sides of an equation does not change its solution set. Think of the balance analogy—if both sides of the equation are equal, then increasing both sides by the same amount will change the value of each side, but they will still be equal. For example, if 3 = 3, then 3 + 2 = 3 + 2.   Consequently, if   6 + x = 8   for some value of x (which in this case is x = 2), then we can add any number to both sides of the equation and x = 2 will still be the solution. If we wanted to, we could add a 3 to both sides of the equation, producing the equation   9 + x = 11.   As you can see, x = 2 is still the solution. Of course, this new equation is no simpler than the one we started with, and this maneuver did not help us solve the equation. If we want to solve the equation   6 + x = 8,   the idea is to get x by itself on one side, and so we want to get rid of the 6 that is on the left side. We can do this by subtracting a 6 from both sides of the equation (which of course can be thought of as adding a negative six):   6 – 6 + x = 8 – 6 or x = 2   You can think of this operation as moving the 6 from one side of the equation to the other, which causes it to change sign   ·        The addition principle is useful in solving equations because it allows us to move whole terms from one side of the equal sign to the other. While this is a convenient way to think of it, you should remember that you are not really “moving” the term from one side to the other—you are really adding (or subtracting) the term on both sides of the equation. 
book3_chapter02_4_2	no label	Notation notes Notation notes Notation notes In the previous example, we wrote the –6 in-line with the rest of the equation. This is analogous to writing an arithmetic subtraction problem in one line, as in   234 – 56 = 178.   You probably also learned to write subtraction and addition problems in a column format, like We can also use a similar notation for the addition method with algebraic equations. Given the equation   x + 3 = 2, we want to subtract a 3 from both sides in order to isolate the variable. In column format this would look like Here the numbers in the second row are negative 3’s, so we are adding the two rows together to produce the bottom row. The advantage of the column notation is that it makes the operation easier to see and reduces the chances for an error. The disadvantage is that it takes more space, but that is a relatively minor disadvantage. Which notation you prefer to use is not important, as long as you can follow what you are doing and it makes sense to you.

book3_chapter02_6	no label	Using the Principles Together Using the Principles Together Suppose you were given an equation like 2x – 3 = 5. You will need to use the addition principle to move the –3, and the multiplication principle to remove the coefficient 2. Which one should you use first? Strictly speaking, it does not matter—you will eventually get the right answer. In practice, however, it is usually simpler to use the addition principle first, and then the multiplication principle. The reason for this is that if we divide by 2 first we will turn everything into fractions: Given: 2x – 3 = 5 Suppose we first divide both sides by 2: Now there is nothing wrong with doing arithmetic with fractions, but it is not as simple as working with whole numbers. In this example we would have to add 3/2 to both sides of the equation to isolate the x. It is usually more convenient, though, to use the addition principle first: Given: 2x – 3 = 5 Add 3 to both sides:    At this point all we need to do is divide both sides by 2 to get x = 4.

Thus, every point on the plane can be identified by a pair of numbers (x, y), called its coordinates. Examples:  
book3_chapter04_1_2	no label	Quadrants Quadrants Quadrants Sometimes we just want to know what general part of the graph we are talking about. The axes naturally divide the plane up into quarters. We call these quadrants, and number them from one to four. Notice that the numbering begins in the upper right quadrant and continues around in the counter-clockwise direction. Notice also that each quadrant can be identified by the unique combination of positive and negative signs for the coordinates of a point in that quadrant. 
book3_chapter04_2	no label	Graphing Functions Graphing Functions Consider an equation such asy = 2x – 1We say that y is a function of x because if you choose any value for x, this formula will give you a unique value of y. For example, if we choose x = 3 then the formula gives usy = 2(3) – 1ory = 5Thus we can say that the value y = 5 is generated by the choice of x = 3. Had we chosen a different value for x, we would have gotten a different value for y. In fact, we can choose a whole bunch of different values for x and get a y value for each one. This is best shown in a table:x (Input) x→ FORMULA→ y y (Output) –2 2(–2) – 1 = –5 –5 –1 2(–1) – 1 = –3 –3 0 2(0) – 1 = –1 –1 1 2(1) – 1 = 1 1 2 2(2) – 1 = 3 3 3 2(3) – 1 = 5 5This relationship between x and its corresponding y values produces a collection of pairs of points (x, y), namely(–2, –5)(–1, –3)(0, –1)(1, 1)(2, 3)(3, 5)Since each of these pairs of numbers can be the coordinates of a point on the plane, it is natural to ask what this collection of ordered pairs would look like if we graphed them. The result is something like this:The points seem to fall in a straight line. Now, our choices for x were quite arbitrary. We could just as well have picked other values, including non-integer values. Suppose we picked many more values for x, like 2.7, 3.14, etc. and added them to our graph. Eventually the points would be so crowded together that they would form a solid line:The arrows on the ends of the line indicate that it goes on forever, because there is no limit to what numbers we could choose for x. We say that this line is the graph of the function y = 2x – 1.If you pick any point on this line and read off its x and y coordinates, they will satisfy the equation y = 2x – 1. For example, the point (1.5, 2) is on the line:and the coordinates x = 1.5, y = 2 satisfy the equation y = 2x – 1:2 = 2(1.5) – 1·        Note: This graph turned out to be a straight line only because of the particular function that we used as an example. There are many other functions whose graphs turn out to be various curves.
book3_chapter04_3_1	no label	Describing Lines Describing Lines Describing Lines Just as there are an infinite number of equations that satisfy the above conditions, there are also an infinite number of straight lines that we can draw on a graph. To describe a particular line we need to specify two distinct pieces of information concerning that line. A specific straight line can be determined by specifying two distinct points that the line passes through, or it can be determined by giving one point that it passes through and somehow describing how “tilted” the line is. 
book3_chapter04_3_2	no label	Slope Slope Slope The slope of a line is a measure of how “tilted” the line is. A highway sign might say something like “6% grade ahead.” What does this mean, other than that you hope your brakes work? What it means is that the ratio of your drop in altitude to your horizontal distance is 6%, or 6/100. In other words, if you move 100 feet forward, you will drop 6 feet; if you move 200 feet forward, you will drop 12 feet, and so on. We measure the slope of lines in much the same way, although we do not convert the result to a percent. Suppose we have a graph of an unknown straight line. Pick any two different points on the line and label them point 1 and point 2: In moving from point 1 to point 2, we cover 4 steps horizontally (the x direction) and 2 steps vertically (the y direction): Therefore, the ratio of the change in altitude to the change in horizontal distance is 2 to 4. Expressing it as a fraction and reducing, we say that the slope of this line is To formalize this procedure a bit, we need to think about the two points in terms of their x and y coordinates. Now you should be able to see that the horizontal displacement is the difference between the x coordinates of the two points, or 4 = 5 – 1, and the vertical displacement is the difference between the y coordinates, or 2 = 4 – 2. In general, if we say that the coordinates of point 1 are (x1, y1) and the coordinates of point 2 are (x2, y2), then we can define the slope m as follows: where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are any two distinct points on the line. It is customary (in the US) to use the letter m to represent slope. No one knows why. It makes no difference which two points are used for point 1 and point 2. If they were switched, both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction would be changed to the opposite sign, giving exactly the same result. Many people find it useful to remember this formula as “slope is rise over run.” Another common notation is , where the Greek letter delta (D) means “the change in.” The slope is a ratio of how much y changes per change in x: 
book3_chapter04_3_3	no label	Horizontal Lines Horizontal Lines Horizontal Lines A horizontal line has zero slope, because there is no change in y as x increases. Thus, any two points will have the same y coordinates, and since y1 = y2,   . 
book3_chapter04_3_4	no label	Vertical Lines Vertical Lines Vertical Lines A vertical line presents a different problem. If you look at the formula , you see that there is a problem with the denominator. It is not possible to get two different values for xl and x2, because if x changes then you are not on the vertical line anymore. Any two points on a vertical line will have the same x coordinates, and so x2 – x1 = 0. Since the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero, we have to say that a vertical line has undefined slope. Do not confuse this with the case of the horizontal line, which has a well-defined slope that just happens to equal zero. 
book3_chapter04_3_5	no label	Positive and Negative Slope Positive and Negative Slope Positive and Negative Slope The x coordinate increases to the right, so moving from left to right is motion in the positive x direction. Suppose that you are going uphill as you move in the positive x direction. Then both your x and y coordinates are increasing, so the ratio of rise over run will be positive—you will have a positive increase in y for a positive increase in x. On the other hand, if you are going downhill as you move from left to right, then the ratio of rise over run will be negative because you lose height for a given positive increase in x. The thing to remember is: As you go from left to right, Uphill = Positive Slope Downhill = Negative Slope And of course, no change in height means that the line has zero slope.   Some Slopes 
book3_chapter04_3_6	no label	Intercepts Intercepts Intercepts Two lines can have the same slope and be in different places on the graph. This means that in addition to describing the slope of a line we need some way to specify exactly where the line is on the graph. This can be accomplished by specifying one particular point that the line passes through. Although any point will do, it is conventional to specify the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This point is called the y-intercept, and is usually denoted by the letter b. Note that every line except vertical lines will cross the y-axis at some point, and we have to handle vertical lines as a special case anyway because we cannot define a slope for them. Same Slopes, Different y-Intercepts 
book3_chapter04_3_7	no label	Equations Equations Equations The equation of a line gives the mathematical relationship between the x and y coordinates of any point on the line. Let’s return to the example we used in graphing functions. The equation y = 2x – 1 produces the following graph: This line evidently has a slope of 2 and a y intercept equal to –1. The numbers 2 and –1 also appear in the equation—the coefficient of x is 2, and the additive constant is –1. This is not a coincidence, but is due to the standard form in which the equation was written. Standard Form (Slope-Intercept Form) If a linear equation in two unknowns is written in the form y = mx + b   where m and b are any two real numbers, then the graph will be a straight line with a slope of m and a y intercept equal to b. Point-Slope Form As mentioned earlier, a line is fully described by giving its slope and one distinct point that the line passes through. While this point is customarily the y intercept, it does not need to be. If you want to describe a line with a given slope m that passes through a given point (x1, y1), the formula is   To help remember this formula, think of solving it for m:   Since the point (x, y) is an arbitrary point on the line and the point (x1, y1) is another point on the line, this is nothing more than the definition of slope for that line. Two-Point Form Another way to completely specify a line is to give two different points that the line passes through. If you are given that the line passes through the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the formula is   This formula is also easy to remember if you notice that it is just the same as the point-slope form with the slope m replaced by the definition of slope,

Because the two equations describe the same line, they have all their points in common; hence there are an infinite number of solutions to the system. Attempting to solve gives an identity If you try to solve a dependent system by algebraic methods, you will eventually run into an equation that is an identity. An identity is an equation that is always true, independent of the value(s) of any variable(s). For example, you might get an equation that looks like x = x, or 3 = 3. This would tell you that the system is a dependent system, and you could stop right there because you will never find a unique solution.

Inconsistent Equations Lines do not intersect (Parallel Lines; have the same slope) No solutions If two lines happen to have the same slope, but are not identically the same line, then they will never intersect. There is no pair (x, y) that could satisfy both equations, because there is no point (x, y) that is simultaneously on both lines. Thus these equations are said to be inconsistent, and there is no solution. The fact that they both have the same slope may not be obvious from the equations, because they are not written in one of the standard forms for straight lines. The slope is not readily evident in the form we use for writing systems of equations. (If you think about it you will see that the slope is the negative of the coefficient of x divided by the coefficient of y). Attempting to solve gives a false statement By attempting to solve such a system of equations algebraically, you are operating on a false assumption—namely that a solution exists. This will eventually lead you to a contradiction: a statement that is obviously false, regardless of the value(s) of the variable(s). At some point in your work you would get an obviously false equation like 3 = 4. This would tell you that the system of equations is inconsistent, and there is no solution.     Solution by Graphing For more complex systems, and especially those that contain non-linear equations, finding a solution by algebraic methods can be very difficult or even impossible. Using a graphing calculator (or a computer), you can graph the equations and actually see where they intersect. The calculator can then give you the coordinates of the intersection point. The only drawback to this method is that the solution is only an approximation, whereas the algebraic method gives the exact solution. In most practical situations, though, the precision of the calculator is sufficient. For more demanding scientific and engineering applications there are computer methods that can find approximate solutions to very high precision.   
book3_chapter05_2	no label	Addition Method Addition Method The whole problem with solving a system of equations is that you cannot solve an equation that has two unknowns in it. You need an equation with only one variable so that you can isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Both methods that we will look at are techniques for eliminating one of the variables to give you an equation in just one unknown, which you can then solve by the usual methods.The first method of solving systems of linear equations is the addition method, in which the two equations are added together to eliminate one of the variables.Adding the equations means that we add the left sides of the two equations together, and we add the right sides together. This is legal because of the Addition Principle, which says that we can add the same amount to both sides of an equation. Since the left and right sides of any equation are equal to each other, we are indeed adding the same amount to both sides of an equation.Consider this simple example:Example:If we add these equations together, the terms containing y will add up to zero (2y plus -2y), and we will getor5x = 5 x = 1However, we are not finished yet—we know x, but we still don’t know y. We can solve for y by substituting the now known value for x into either of our original equations. This will produce an equation that can be solved for y:Now that we know both x and y, we can say that the solution to the system is the pair (1, 1/2).This last example was easy to see because of the fortunate presence of both a positive and a negative 2y. One is not always this lucky. ConsiderExample:Now there is nothing so obvious, but there is still something we can do. If we multiply the first equation by -3, we get(Don’t forget to multiply every term in the equation, on both sides of the equal sign). Now if we add them together the terms containing x will cancel:orAs in the previous example, now that we know y we can solve for x by substituting into either original equation. The first equation looks like the easiest to solve for x, so we will use it:And so the solution point is (-4, 7/2).Now we look at an even less obvious example:Example:Here there is nothing particularly attractive about going after either the x or the y. In either case, both equations will have to be multiplied by some factor to arrive at a common coefficient. This is very much like the situation you face trying to find a least common denominator for adding fractions, except that here we call it a Least Common Multiple (LCM). As a general rule, it is easiest to eliminate the variable with the smallest LCM. In this case that would be the y, because the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. If we wanted to eliminate the x we would have to use a LCM of 10 (5 times 2). So, we choose to make the coefficients of y into plus and minus 6. To do this, the first equation must be multiplied by 3, and the second equation by 2:orNow adding these two together will eliminate the terms containing y:orx = 2We still need to substitute this value into one of the original equations to solve for y:Thus the solution is the point (2, 2).
book3_chapter05_3	no label	Substitution Method Substitution Method When we used the Addition Method to solve a system of equations, we still had to do a substitution to solve for the remaining variable. With the substitution method, we solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other, and then substitute that into the other equation. This makes more sense with an example:Example:2y + x = 3 (1) 4y – 3x = 1 (2)Equation 1 looks like it would be easy to solve for x, so we take it and isolate x:2y + x = 3   x = 3 – 2y (3)Now we can use this result and substitute 3 - 2y in for x in equation 2:Now that we have y, we still need to substitute back in to get x. We could substitute back into any of the previous equations, but notice that equation 3 is already conveniently solved for x:And so the solution is (1, 1).As a rule, the substitution method is easier and quicker than the addition method when one of the equations is very simple and can readily be solved for one of the variables.

One way to help keep things straight is to use the column format for addition, keeping like terms lined up in columns:This method is particularly helpful in the case of subtraction, because it is too easy to make a mistake distributing the minus sign when you write it all in one row.

book3_chapter06_5_2	no label	Trinomials (Quadratic) Trinomials (Quadratic) Trinomials (Quadratic) A quadratic trinomial has the form ax2 + bx + c, where the coefficients a, b, and c, are real numbers (for simplicity we will only use integers, but in real life they could be any real number). We are interested here in factoring quadratic trinomials with integer coefficients into factors that have integer coefficients. Not all such quadratic polynomials can be factored over the real numbers, and even fewer into integers (they all can be factored of we allow for imaginary numbers and rational coefficients, but we don't). Therefore, when we say a quadratic can be factored, we mean that we can write the factors with only integer coefficients. If a quadratic can be factored, it will be the product of two first-degree binomials, except for very simple cases that just involve monomials. For example x2 by itself is a quadratic expression where the coefficient a is equal to 1, and b and c are zero. Obviously, x2 factors into (x)(x), but this is not a very interesting case. A slightly more complicated case occurs when only the coefficient c is zero. Then you get something that looks like 2x2 + 3x This can be factored very simply by factoring out (‘undistributing’) the common factor of x: 2x2 + 3x = x(2x + 3) The most general case is when all three terms are present, as in x2 + 5x + 6 We look at two cases of this type. The easiest to factor are the ones where the coefficient of x2 (which we are calling ‘a’) is equal to 1, as in the above example. If a is not 1 then things get a little bit more complicated, so we will begin by looking at a = 1 examples. Coefficient of x2 is 1 Since the trinomial comes from multiplying two first-degree binomials, let’s review what happens when we multiply binomials using the FOIL method. Remember that to do factoring we will have to think about this process in reverse (you could say we want to ‘de-FOIL’ the trinomial). Suppose we are given (x + 2)(x + 3) Using the FOIL method, we get (x + 2)(x + 3) = x2 + 3x + 2x + 6 Then, collecting like terms gives (x + 2)(x + 3) = x2 + 5x + 6 Now look at this and think about where the terms in the trinomial came from. Obviously the x2 came from x times x. The interesting part is what happens with the other parts, the ‘+ 2’ and the ‘+ 3’. The last term in the trinomial, the 6 in this case, came from multiplying the 2 and the 3. Where did the 5x in the middle come from? We got the 5x by adding the 2x and the 3x when we collected like terms. We can state this as a rule: If the coefficient of x2 is one, then to factor the quadratic you need to find two numbers that: 1. Multiply to give the constant term (which we call c) 2. Add to give the coefficient of x (which we call b) This rule works even if there are minus signs in the quadratic expression (assuming that you remember how to add and multiply positive and negative numbers). 
book3_chapter06_5_3	no label	Special Case: Perfect Square Trinomial Special Case: Perfect Square Trinomial Special Case: Perfect Square Trinomial Recall from special products of binomials that and The trinomials on the right are called perfect squares because they are the squares of a single binomial, rather than the product of two different binomials. A quadratic trinomial can also have this form: (x + 3)2 = (x + 3)(x + 3) = x2 + 6x + 9 Notice that just as before the coefficient of x is the sum 3 + 3, and the constant term is the product 3 ´ 3. One can also say that The coefficient of x is twice the number 3 The constant term is the number three squared In general, if a quadratic trinomial is a perfect square, then o        The coefficient of x is twice the square root of the constant term Or to put it another way, o        The constant term is the square of half the coefficient of x In symbolic form we can express this as It is helpful to be able to recognize perfect square trinomials. We will see them again when we talk about solving quadratic equations. Coefficient of x2 is not 1 A quadratic is more difficult to factor when the coefficient of the squared term is not 1, because that coefficient is mixed in with the other products from FOILing the two binomials. There are two methods for attacking these: either you can use a systematic guess-and-check method, or a method called factoring by grouping. We will first look at the guess-and-check method (which we could call factoring by grouping). If you need to factor a trinomial such as 2x2 + x - 3, you have to think about what combinations could give the 2x2 as well as the other two terms. In this example the 2x2 must come from (x)(2x), and the constant term might come from either (-1)(3) or (1)(-3). The hard part is figuring out which combination will give the correct middle term. This gets messy because all those coefficients will be mixed in with the middle term when you FOIL the binomials. To see what is going on, let’s see what happens when we FOIL the following binomials: What happened? There are several significant things to notice: The leading term in the trinomial (the 2x2) is just the product of the leading terms in the binomials. The constant term in the trinomial (the -3) is the product of the constant terms in the binomials (so far this is the same as in the case where the coefficient of x2 is 1) The middle term in the trinomial (the x) is the sum of the outer and inner products, which involves all the constants and coefficients in the binomials, in a messy way that is not always obvious by inspection. Because 1 and 2 are relatively simple and 3 is complicated, it makes sense to think of the possible candidates that would satisfy conditions 1 and 2, and then test them in every possible combination by multiplying the resulting binomials to see if you get the correct middle term. This seems tedious, and indeed it can be if the numbers you are working with have a lot of factors, but in practice you usually only have to try a few combinations before you see what will work. As a demonstration, let’s see how we would attack the example by this method. Given 2x2 + x - 3 We make a list of the possible factors of 2x2: The only choice is (2x)(x). Then we make a list of the possible factors of the constant term -3: it is either (1)(-3) or (-1)(3). (Notice that since we need a negative number, one factor must be negative and the other positive, but it doesn’t matter which one so we have to try it both ways). The possible factors of the trinomial are the binomials that we can make out of these possible factors, taken in every possible order. From these possibilities, we see that the candidate binomials are: (2x + 1)(x – 3) (x + 1)(2x – 3) (2x + 3)(x – 1) (x + 3)(2x – 1) If we start multiplying these out, we will find that the third one works, and then we are finished. All you really need to check is to see if the sum of the outer and inner multiplications will give you the correct middle term, since we already know that we will get the correct first and last terms. In short, the method is: 1.      List all the possible ways to get the coefficient of x2 (which we call a) by multiplying two numbers 2.      List all the possible ways to get the constant term (which we call c) by multiplying two numbers 3.      Try all possible combinations of these to see which ones give the correct middle term ·        Don’t forget that the number itself times 1 is a possibility ·        If the number (a or c) is negative, remember to try the plus and minus signs both ways   
book3_chapter06_6	no label	Factoring a Quadratic Trinomial by Grouping Factoring a Quadratic Trinomial by Grouping Another method for factoring these kinds of quadratic trinomials is called factoring by grouping. Factoring by grouping can be a bit more tedious, and is often not worth the trouble if you can find the correct factors by some quick trial and error. However, it works quite well when the factors are not immediately obvious, such as when you have a very large number of candidate factors. When this happens, the trial and error method becomes very tediousFactoring by grouping is best demonstrated with a few examples. Example: Given: 5x2 + 11x + 2 Find the product ac: (5)(2) = 10 Think of two factors of 10 that add up to 11: 1 and 10 Write the 11x as the sum of 1x and 10x: 5x2 + 1x + 10x + 2 Group the two pairs of terms: (5x2 + 1x) + (10x + 2) Remove common factors from each group: x(5x + 1) + 2(5x + 1) Notice that the two quantities in parentheses are now identical. That means we can factor out a common factor of (5x + 1): (5x + 1)(x + 2) Example: Given: 4x2 + 7x – 15 Find the product ac: (4)(-15) = -60 Think of two factors of -60 that add up to 7: -5 and 12 Write the 7x as the sum of -5x and 12x: 4x2 – 5x + 12x – 15 Group the two pairs of terms: (4x2 – 5x) + (12x – 15) Remove common factors from each group: x(4x – 5) + 3(4x – 5) Notice that the two quantities in parentheses are now identical. That means we can factor out a common factor of (4x - 5): (4x – 5)(x + 3)The ProcedureGiven a general quadratic trinomialax2 + bx + c1. Find the product ac.2. Find two numbers h and k such thathk = ac(h and k are factors of the product of the coefficient of x2 and the constant term)AND h + k = b(h and k add to give the coefficient of x)3. Rewrite the quadratic asax2 + hx + kx + c4. Group the two pairs of terms that have common factors and simplify.(ax2 + hx) + (kx + c)x(ax + h) + (kx + c)(note: because of the way you chose h and k, you will be able to factor a constant out of the second parentheses, leaving you with two identical expressions in parentheses as in the examples).·        Remember that this won’t work for all quadratic trinomials, because not all quadratic trinomials can be factored into products of binomials with integer coefficients. If you have a non-factorable trinomial, you will not be able to do step 2 above.Why this works Suppose the quadratic trinomial in question came from multiplying two arbitrary binomials: (px + n)(qx + m) If we multiply this out we will get pqx2 + pmx + qnx + nm or pqx2 + (pm + qn)x + nm Notice that the coefficient of x consists of a sum of two terms, pm and qn. These are the two numbers we called h and k above. pm = h qn = k Now we see that the two numbers h and k add up to the coefficient of x, which we called b: h + k = b Obviously they are factors of their own product pmqn, but we notice that pq = a, and mn = c, so (pm)(qn) = (pq)(nm) which is equivalent to hk = ac

book3_chapter07_1	no label	Rational Expressions Rational Expressions o        A rational expression is a ratio of polynomials:Examples: Excluded Values Whenever an expression containing variables is present in the denominator of a fraction, you should be alert to the possibility that certain values of the variables might make the denominator equal to zero, which is forbidden. This means that when we are talking about rational expressions we can no longer say that the variable represents “any real number.” Certain values may have to be excluded. For example, in the expression , we cannot allow the value x = 0 so we would parenthetically add the comment (x ¹ 0), and for we would say (x ¹ 3) . In the case of we would exclude both x = 1 and x = –1, since either choice would make the denominator zero. We don’t care if the numerator is zero. If the numerator is zero, that just makes the whole rational expression zero (assuming, of course, that the denominator is not zero), just as with common fractions. Recall that 0/4 = 0, but 4/0 is undefined. It is important to keep this in mind as you work with rational expressions, because it can happen that you are trying to solve an equation and you get one of the “forbidden” values as a solution. You would have to discard that solution as being unacceptable. You can also get some crazy results if you don’t pay attention to the possibility that the denominator might be zero for certain values of the variable. For example, the celebrated proof that 0 = 1 and other nonsense. Proof that 1 = 0 And other nonsense Can you identify the flaw in this argument? Let x = 1. Then Given: x = 1 Multiply both sides by x: x2 = x Subtract x from both sides: x2 – x = 0 Factor out an x: x(x – 1) = 0 Divide both sides by (x ‑ 1): x = 0 But x = 1, so substitute 1 for x to get: 1 = 0 This is a very simple variant of this classic ‘proof’. Once you see the trick*, you can construct more elaborate versions that do a better job of concealing the error, and you can vary it to ‘prove’ other nonsense such as 1 = 2. For example: Let x = 1 . Then Given: x = 1 Multiply both sides by –1: –x = –1 Add x2 to both sides: x2 - x = x2 – 1 Factor both sides: x(x – 1) = (x – 1)(x + 1) Divide both sides by (x – 1): x = (x + 1) Substituting 1 back in for x gives the result: 1 = 2 *The trick:  We are dividing by zero because if x = 1 then (x – 1) = 0. Thus, all of these “proofs” are invalid because they use an illegal step.

This rule is quite reasonable when m and n are positive integers and m > n. For example: where indeed 5 – 2 = 3. However, in other cases it leads to situation where we have to define new properties for exponents. First, suppose that m < n.

The quadratic equation looks like ax2 + bx + c = 0, but if we take the quadratic expression on the left and set it equal to y, we will have a function: y = ax2 + bx + c When we graph y vs. x, we find that we get a curve called a parabola. The specific values of a, b, and c control where the curve is relative to the origin (left, right, up, or down), and how rapidly it spreads out. Also, if a is negative then the parabola will be upside-down. What does this have to do with finding the solutions to our original quadratic equation? Well, whenever y = 0 then the equation y = ax2 + bx + c is the same as our original equation. Graphically, y is zero whenever the curve crosses the x-axis. Thus, the solutions to the original quadratic equation (ax2 + bx + c = 0) are the values of x where the function (y = ax2 + bx + c) crosses the x-axis. From the figures below, you can see that it can cross the x-axis once, twice, or not at all.    Actually, if you have a graphing calculator this technique can be used to find solutions to any equation, not just quadratics. All you need to do is   Move all the terms to one side, so that it is equal to zero Set the resulting expression equal to y (in place of zero) Enter the function into your calculator and graph it Look for places where the graph crosses the x-axis   Your graphing calculator most likely has a function that will automatically find these intercepts and give you the x-values with great precision. Of course, no matter how many decimal places you have it is still just an approximation of the exact solution. In real life, though, a close approximation is often good enough.

To write down the number being conceptualized, a numeral is used. Numeral A numeral is a symbol that represents a number. In common usage today we do not distinguish between a number and a numeral. In our study of introductory mathematics, we will follow this common usage. Sample Set A The following are numerals. In each case, the first represents the number four, the second repre­sents the number one hundred twenty-three, and the third, the number one thousand five.

We can form any number in the number system by selecting one or more digits and placing them in certain positions. Each position has a particular value. The Hindu mathematician who devised the system about A.D. 500 stated that "from place to place each is ten times the preceding." Base Ten Positional Systems It is for this reason that our number system is called a positional number system with base ten. Commas When numbers are composed of more than three digits, commas are sometimes used to separate the digits into groups of three. Periods These groups of three are called periods and they greatly simplify reading numbers. In the Hindu-Arabic numeration system, a period has a value assigned to each or its three positions, and the values are the same for each period. The position values are Thus, each period contains a position for the values of one, ten, and hundred. Notice that, in looking from right to left, the value of each position is ten times the preceding. Each period has a particular name. As we continue from right to left, there are more periods. The five periods listed above are the most common, and in our study of introductory mathematics, they are sufficient. The following diagram illustrates our positional number system to trillions. (There are, to be sure, other periods.) In our positional number system, the value of a digit is determined by its position in the number. Sample Set B Example 1.1.  Find the value of 6 in the number 7,261. Since 6 is in the tens position of the units period, its value is 6 tens. 6 tens = 60 Example 1.2.  Find the value of 9 in the number 86,932,106,005. Since 9 is in the hundreds position of the millions period, its value is 9 hundred millions. 9 hundred millions = 9 hundred million Example 1.3.  Find the value of 2 in the number 102,001. Since 2 is in the ones position of the thousands period, its value is 2 one thousands. 2 one thousands = 2 thousand Practice Set B Exercise 1.2.2.

book5_ch01_2_10	no label	Graphing Whole Numbers Graphing Whole Numbers Graphing Whole Numbers Number Line Whole numbers may be visualized by constructing a number line. To construct a number line, we simply draw a straight line and choose any point on the line and label it 0. Origin This point is called the origin. We then choose some convenient length, and moving to the right, mark off consecutive intervals (parts) along the line starting at 0. We label each new interval endpoint with the next whole number. Graphing We can visually display a whole number by drawing a closed circle at the point labeled with that whole number. Another phrase for visually displaying a whole number is graphing the whole number. The word graph means to "visually display." Sample Set C Example 1.4.  Graph the following whole numbers: 3, 5, 9. Example 1.5.  Specify the whole numbers that are graphed on the following number line. The break in the number line indicates that we are aware of the whole numbers between 0 and 106, and 107 and 872, but we are not listing them due to space limitations. The numbers that have been graphed are 0, 106, 873, 874 Practice Set C Exercise 1.2.5. (Go to Solution) Graph the following whole numbers: 46, 47, 48, 325, 327. Exercise 1.2.6.

book5_ch01_4_2	no label	Rounding as an Approximation Rounding as an Approximation Rounding as an Approximation A primary use of whole numbers is to keep count of how many objects there are in a collection. Sometimes we're only interested in the approximate number of objects in the collection rather than the precise number. For example, there are approxi­mately 20 symbols in the collection below. The precise number of symbols in the above collection is 18. Rounding We often approximate the number of objects in a collection by mentally seeing the collection as occurring in groups of tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. This process of approximation is called rounding. Rounding is very useful in estimation. We will study estimation in Chapter 8. When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of tens, we say we're rounding to the nearest ten. When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of hundreds, we say we're rounding to the nearest hundred. This idea of rounding continues through thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions, etc. The process of rounding whole numbers is illustrated in the following examples. Example 1.12.  Round 67 to the nearest ten. On the number line, 67 is more than halfway from 60 to 70. The digit immedi­ately to the right of the tens digit, the round-off digit, is the indicator for this. Thus, 67, rounded to the nearest ten, is 70. Example 1.13.  Round 4,329 to the nearest hundred. On the number line, 4,329 is less than halfway from 4,300 to 4,400. The digit to the immediate right of the hundreds digit, the round-off digit, is the indicator. Thus, 4,329, rounded to the nearest hundred is 4,300. Example 1.14.  Round 16,500 to the nearest thousand. On the number line, 16,500 is exactly halfway from 16,000 to 17,000. By convention, when the number to be rounded is exactly halfway between two numbers, it is rounded to the higher number. Thus, 16,500, rounded to the nearest thousand, is 17,000. Example 1.15.  A person whose salary is $41,450 per year might tell a friend that she makes $41,000 per year. She has rounded 41,450 to the nearest thousand. The number 41,450 is closer to 41,000 than it is to 42,000. 
book5_ch01_4_3	no label	The Method of Rounding Whole Numbers The Method of Rounding Whole Numbers The Method of Rounding Whole Numbers From the observations made in the preceding examples, we can use the following method to round a whole number to a particular position. Mark the position of the round-off digit. Note the digit to the immediate right of the round-off digit. If it is less than 5, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Leave the round-off digit unchanged. If it is 5 or larger, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Increase the round-off digit by 1. Sample Set A Use the method of rounding whole numbers to solve the following problems. Example 1.16.  Round 3,426 to the nearest ten. We are rounding to the tens position. Mark the digit in the tens position Observe the digit immediately to the right of the tens position. It is 6. Since 6 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 6 with 0 and adding 1 to the digit in the tens position (the round-off position): 2 + 1 = 3 . 3,430 Thus, 3,426 rounded to the nearest ten is 3,430. Example 1.17.  Round 9,614,018,007 to the nearest ten million. We are rounding to the nearest ten million. Observe the digit immediately to the right of the ten millions position. It is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down by replacing 4 and all the digits to its right with zeros. 9,610,000,000 Thus, 9,614,018,007 rounded to the nearest ten million is 9,610,000,000. Example 1.18.  Round 148,422 to the nearest million. Since we are rounding to the nearest million, we'll have to imagine a digit in the millions position. We'll write 148,422 as 0,148,422. The digit immediately to the right is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we'll round down by replacing it and all the digits to its right with zeros. 0,000,000 This number is 0. Thus, 148,422 rounded to the nearest million is 0. Example 1.19.  Round 397,000 to the nearest ten thousand. We are rounding to the nearest ten thousand. The digit immediately to the right of the ten thousand position is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 7 and all the digits to its right with zeros and adding 1 to the digit in the ten thousands position. But 9 + 1 = 10 and we must carry the 1 to the next (the hundred thousands) position. 400,000 Thus, 397,000 rounded to the nearest ten thousand is 400,000. Practice Set A Use the method of rounding whole numbers to solve each problem. Exercise 1.4.1. (Go to Solution) Round 3387 to the nearest hundred. Exercise 1.4.2.

For example, We are combining a collection of four objects with a collection of three objects to obtain a collection of seven objects. Addition The process of combining two or more objects (real or intuitive) to form a third, the total, is called addition. In addition, the numbers being added are called addends or terms, and the total is called the sum. The plus symbol (+) is used to indicate addition, and the equal symbol (=) is used to represent the word "equal." For example, 4 + 3 = 7 means "four added to three equals seven."

We can suggest the following procedure for adding whole numbers using this example. Example 1.20. The Process of Adding Whole Numbers To add whole numbers, The process: Write the numbers vertically, placing corresponding positions in the same column. Add the digits in each column. Start at the right (in the ones position) and move to the left, placing the sum at the bottom. Caution Confusion and incorrect sums can occur when the numbers are not aligned in columns properly. Avoid writing such additions as Sample Set A Example 1.21.  Add 276 and 103. Example 1.22.  Add 1459 and 130 In each of these examples, each individual sum does not exceed 9. We will examine individual sums that exceed 9 in the next section. Practice Set A Perform each addition. Show the expanded form in problems 1 and 2. Exercise 1.5.1. (Go to Solution) Add 63 and 25.

book5_ch01_5_7	no label	Addition Involving Carrying Addition Involving Carrying Addition Involving Carrying It often happens in addition that the sum of the digits in a column will exceed 9. This happens when we add 18 and 34. We show this in expanded form as follows. Notice that when we add the 8 ones to the 4 ones we get 12 ones. We then convert the 12 ones to 1 ten and 2 ones. In vertical addition, we show this conversion by carrying the ten to the tens column. We write a 1 at the top of the tens column to indicate the carry. This same example is shown in a shorter form as follows: 8 + 4 = 12 Write 2, carry 1 ten to the top of the next column to the left. Sample Set B Perform the following additions. Use the process of carrying when needed. Example 1.23.  Add 1875 and 358. The sum is 2233. Example 1.24.  Add 89,208 and 4,946. The sum is 94,154. Example 1.25.  Add 38 and 95. As you proceed with the addition, it is a good idea to keep in mind what is actually happening. The sum is 133. Example 1.26.  Find the sum 2648, 1359, and 861. The sum is 4,868. Numbers other than 1 can be carried as illustrated in Example 1.27. Example 1.27.  Find the sum of the following numbers. The sum is 983,689. Example 1.28.  The number of students enrolled at Riemann College in the years 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987 was 10,406, 9,289, 10,108, and 11,412, respectively. What was the total number of students en­rolled at Riemann College in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987? We can determine the total number of students enrolled by adding 9,289, 10,108, and 11,412, the number of students enrolled in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987.

book5_ch01_6_2	no label	Subtraction Subtraction Subtraction Subtraction Subtraction is the process of determining the remainder when part of the total is removed. Suppose the sum of two whole numbers is 11, and from 11 we remove 4. Using the number line to help our visualization, we see that if we are located at 11 and move 4 units to the left, and thus remove 4 units, we will be located at 7. Thus, 7 units remain when we remove 4 units from 11 units. The Minus Symbol The minus symbol (-) is used to indicate subtraction. For example, 11 − 4 indicates that 4 is to be subtracted from 11. Minuend The number immediately in front of or the minus symbol is called the minuend, and it represents the original number of units. Subtrahend The number immediately following or below the minus symbol is called the subtrahend, and it represents the number of units to be removed. Difference The result of the subtraction is called the difference of the two numbers. For example, in 11 − 4 = 7, 11 is the minuend, 4 is the subtrahend, and 7 is the difference.

This happens when we subtract 27 from 84. We do not have a name for 4 − 7. We need to rename 84 in order to continue. We'll do so as follows: Our new name for 84 is 7 tens + 14 ones.

This occurs in problems such as and We'll examine each case. Example 1.43. Borrowing from a single zero. Consider the problem Since we do not have a name for 3 − 7, we must borrow from 0. Since there are no tens to borrow, we must borrow 1 hundred. One hundred = 10 tens. We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens (leaving 9 tens). One ten = 10 ones and 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones. Now we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a single zero. Borrowing from a Single Zero To borrow from a single zero, Decrease the digit to the immediate left of zero by one. Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10. Proceed to subtract as usual. Sample Set E Example 1.44.  Perform this subtraction. The number 503 contains a single zero The number to the immediate left of 0 is 5. Decrease 5 by 1. 5 − 1 = 4 Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10. Borrow from the 10 and proceed. 1 ten + 10 ones 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones Practice Set E Perform each subtraction. Exercise 1.6.18. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.19. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.20. (Go to Solution) Example 1.45. Borrowing from a group of zeros Consider the problem In this case, we have a group of zeros. Since we cannot borrow any tens or hundreds, we must borrow 1 thousand. One thousand = 10 hundreds. We can now borrow 1 hundred from 10 hundreds. One hundred = 10 tens. We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens. One ten = 10 ones. From observations made in this procedure we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a group of zeros. Borrowing from a Group of zeros To borrow from a group of zeros, Decrease the digit to the immediate left of the group of zeros by one. Draw a line through each zero in the group and make it a 9, except the rightmost zero, make it 10. Proceed to subtract as usual. Sample Set F Perform each subtraction.

Make the rightmost 0 a 10. Subtract as usual. Example 1.47.  The number 8,000,006 contains a group of zeros. The number to the immediate left of the group is 8. Decrease 8 by 1. 8 − 1 = 7 Make each zero, except the rightmost one, 9. Make the rightmost 0 a 10. To perform the subtraction, we’ll need to borrow from the ten.

Therefore, we say we have three times five and describe it by writing 3 × 5 Thus, 3 × 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 Multiplicand In a multiplication, the repeated addend (number being added) is called the multi­plicand. In 3 × 5, the 5 is the multiplicand. Multiplier Also, in a multiplication, the number that records the number of times the multiplicand is used is called the multiplier. In 3 × 5, the 3 is the multiplier. Sample Set A Express each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the multiplicand.

book5_ch02_2_8	no label	The Multiplication Process With a Multiple Digit Multiplier The Multiplication Process With a Multiple Digit Multiplier The Multiplication Process With a Multiple Digit Multiplier In a multiplication in which the multiplier is composed of two or more digits, the multiplication must take place in parts. The process is as follows: Part 1: First Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the ones digit of the multiplier. This product is called the first partial product. Part 2: Second Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the tens digit of the multiplier. This product is called the second partial product. Since the tens digit is used as a factor, the second partial product is written below the first partial product so that its rightmost digit appears in the tens column. Part 3: If necessary, continue this way finding partial products. Write each one below the previous one so that the rightmost digit appears in the column directly below the digit that was used as a factor. Part 4: Total Product Add the partial products to obtain the total product. Note It may be necessary to carry when finding each partial product. Sample Set C Example 2.6.  Multiply 326 by 48.

book5_ch02_3_2	no label	Division Division Division Division is a description of repeated subtraction. In the process of division, the concern is how many times one number is contained in another number. For example, we might be interested in how many 5's are contained in 15. The word times is significant because it implies a relationship between division and multiplication. There are several notations used to indicate division. Suppose Q records the number of times 5 is contained in 15. We can indicate this by writing Each of these division notations describes the same number, represented here by the symbol . Each notation also converts to the same multiplication form. It is In division, Dividend the number being divided into is called the dividend. Divisor the number dividing into the dividend is the divisor. Quotient the result of the division is called the quotient. Sample Set A Find the following quotients using multiplication facts. Example 2.12.  Since , Notice also that Thus, 6 is contained in 18 three times. Example 2.13.  Since , Notice also that 3 could be subtracted exactly 8 times from 24. This implies that 3 is contained in 24 eight times. Example 2.14.  Since , Thus, there are 6 sixes in 36. Example 2.15.  Since , Thus, there are 8 nines in 72.

Then, Converting this division problem to its corresponding multiplication problem, we get From our knowledge of multiplication, we can understand that if the product of two whole numbers is zero, then one or both of the whole numbers must be zero.

book5_ch02_4_2	no label	Division with a Single Digit Divisor Division with a Single Digit Divisor Division with a Single Digit Divisor Our experience with multiplication of whole numbers allows us to perform such divisions as 75÷5. We perform the division by performing the corresponding multiplication, 5 × Q = 75. Each division we considered in Section 2.3 had a one-digit quotient. Now we will consider divisions in which the quotient may consist of two or more digits. For example, 75÷5. Let's examine the division 75÷5. We are asked to determine how many 5's are contained in 75. We'll approach the problem in the following way. Make an educated guess based on experience with multiplication. Find how close the estimate is by multiplying the estimate by 5. If the product obtained in step 2 is less than 75, find out how much less by subtracting it from 75. If the product obtained in step 2 is greater than 75, decrease the estimate until the product is less than 75. Decreasing the estimate makes sense because we do not wish to exceed 75. We can suggest from this discussion that the process of division consists of The Four Steps in Division an educated guess a multiplication a subtraction bringing down the next digit (if necessary) The educated guess can be made by determining how many times the divisor is contained in the dividend by using only one or two digits of the dividend. Sample Set A Example 2.23.  Find 75÷5. Rewrite the problem using a division bracket. Make an educated guess by noting that one 5 is contained in 75 at most 10 times.Since 7 is the tens digit, we estimate that 5 goes into 75 at most 10 times. Now determine how close the estimate is. 10 fives is 10 × 5 = 50. Subtract 50 from 75. Estimate the number of 5's in 25. There are exactly 5 fives in 25. Check: Thus, 75÷5 = 15. The notation in this division can be shortened by writing. Example 2.24.  Find 4,944÷8. Rewrite the problem using a division bracket. 8 goes into 49 at most 6 times, and 9 is in the hundreds column. We'll guess 600. Then, 8 × 600 = 4800. 8 goes into 14 at most 1 time, and 4 is in the tens column. We'll guess 10. 8 goes into 64 exactly 8 times. 600 eights + 10 eights + 8 eights = 618 eights. Check: Thus, 4,944÷8 = 618. As in the first problem, the notation in this division can be shortened by eliminating the subtraction signs and the zeros in each educated guess. Note Not all divisions end in zero. We will examine such divisions in a subsequent subsection. Practice Set A Perform the following divisions. Exercise 2.4.1. (Go to Solution) 126÷7 Exercise 2.4.2.

book5_ch02_4_5	no label	Division with a Multiple Digit Divisor Division with a Multiple Digit Divisor Division with a Multiple Digit Divisor The process of division also works when the divisor consists of two or more digits. We now make educated guesses using the first digit of the divisor and one or two digits of the dividend. Sample Set B Example 2.25.  Find 2,232÷36. Use the first digit of the divisor and the first two digits of the dividend to make the educated guess. 3 goes into 22 at most 7 times. Try 7: 7 × 36 = 252 which is greater than 223. Reduce the estimate. Try 6: 6 × 36 = 216 which is less than 223. Divide 3 into 7 to estimate the number of times 36 goes into 72. The 3 goes into 7 at most 2 times. Try 2: 2 × 36 = 72. Check: Thus, 2,232÷36 = 62. Example 2.26.  Find 2,417,228÷802. First, the educated guess: 24÷8 = 3. Then 3 × 802 = 2406, which is less than 2417. Use 3 as the guess. Since 3 × 802 = 2406, and 2406 has four digits, place the 3 above the fourth digit of the dividend. Subtract: 2417 - 2406 = 11. Bring down the 2. The divisor 802 goes into 112 at most 0 times. Use 0. The 8 goes into 11 at most 1 time, and 1 × 802 = 802, which is less than 1122. Try 1. Subtract 1122 – 802 = 320 Bring down the 8. 8 goes into 32 at most 4 times. 4 × 802 = 3208. Use 4.

Exponen­tial notation is a description of repeated multiplication. Suppose we have the repeated multiplication 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 Exponent The factor 8 is repeated 5 times. Exponential notation uses a superscript for the number of times the factor is repeated. The superscript is placed on the repeated factor, 8 5 , in this case. The superscript is called an exponent. The Function of an Exponent An exponent records the number of identical factors that are repeated in a multiplication. Sample Set A Write the following multiplication using exponents. Example 3.1.  3⋅3. Since the factor 3 appears 2 times, we record this as 32 Example 3.2.  62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62. Since the factor 62 appears 9 times, we record this as 629 Expand (write without exponents) each number. Example 3.3.  124 . The exponent 4 is recording 4 factors of 12 in a multiplication. Thus, 124 = 12⋅12⋅12⋅12 Example 3.4.  7063 . The exponent 3 is recording 3 factors of 706 in a multiplication. Thus, 7063 = 706⋅706⋅706 Practice Set A Write the following using exponents.

Exponent, Power 5 is called the exponent, or power. 85 is read as "eight to the fifth power," or more simply as "eight to the fifth," or "the fifth power of eight." Squared When a whole number is raised to the second power, it is said to be squared. The number 52 can be read as 5 to the second power, or 5 to the second, or 5 squared. Cubed When a whole number is raised to the third power, it is said to be cubed. The number 53 can be read as 5 to the third power, or 5 to the third, or 5 cubed. When a whole number is raised to the power of 4 or higher, we simply say that that number is raised to that particular power. The number 58 can be read as 5 to the eighth power, or just 5 to the eighth.

In mathematical terms, the word "root" is used to indicate that one number is the source of another number through repeated multiplication. Square Root We know that 49 = 72 , that is, 49 = 7⋅7. Through repeated multiplication, 7 is the source of 49. Thus, 7 is a root of 49. Since two 7's must be multiplied together to produce 49, the 7 is called the second or square root of 49. Cube Root We know that 8 = 23 , that is, 8 = 2⋅2⋅2. Through repeated multiplication, 2 is the source of 8. Thus, 2 is a root of 8. Since three 2's must be multiplied together to produce 8, 2 is called the third or cube root of 8. We can continue this way to see such roots as fourth roots, fifth roots, sixth roots, and so on.

We can use this observation to make a useful classification for whole numbers: prime numbers and composite numbers. Prime Number A whole number (greater than one) whose only factors are itself and 1 is called a prime number. The Number 1 is Not a Prime Number The first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.

Prime Factorization When a number is factored so that all its factors are prime numbers. the factori­zation is called the prime factorization of the number. The technique of prime factorization is illustrated in the following three examples. 10 = 5⋅2. Both 2 and 5 are primes. Therefore, 2⋅5 is the prime factorization of 10. 11. The number 11 is a prime number. Prime factorization applies only to composite numbers. Thus, 11 has no prime factorization. 60 = 2⋅30.

The Method of Finding the Prime Factorization of a Natural Number Divide the number repeatedly by the smallest prime number that will divide into it a whole number of times (without a remainder). When the prime number used in step 1 no longer divides into the given number without a remainder, repeat the division process with the next largest prime that divides the given number. Continue this process until the quotient is smaller than the divisor. The prime factorization of the given number is the product of all these prime divisors. If the number has no prime divisors, it is a prime number. We may be able to use some of the tests for divisibility we studied in Section 2.5 to help find the primes that divide the given number. Sample Set C Example 3.29.  Find the prime factorization of 60. Since the last digit of 60 is 0, which is even, 60 is divisible by 2. We will repeatedly divide by 2 until we no longer can. We shall divide as follows: The quotient 1 is finally smaller than the divisor 5, and the prime factorization of 60 is the product of these prime divisors. 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 We use exponents when possible. 60 = 2 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 Example 3.30.  Find the prime factorization of 441. 441 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is not divisible by 2. 441 is divisible by 3 since 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3.

Finding the GCF To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more whole numbers: Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on repeated factors. Write each base that is common to each of the numbers. To each base listed in step 2, attach the smallest exponent that appears on it in either of the prime factorizations. The GCF is the product of the numbers found in step 3. Sample Set A Find the GCF of the following numbers. Example 3.32.  12 and 18 The common bases are 2 and 3. The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 1 and 1 ( 21 and 31 ), or 2 and 3. The GCF is the product of these numbers. 2 ⋅ 3 = 6 The GCF of 30 and 42 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides both 30 and 42 without a remainder. Example 3.33.  18, 60, and 72 The common bases are 2 and 3. The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 1 and 1: 21 from 18 31 from 60 The GCF is the product of these numbers. GCF is 2⋅3 = 6 Thus, 6 is the largest number that divides 18, 60, and 72 without a remainder.

Least Common Multiple The least common multiple, LCM, of two or more whole numbers is the smallest whole number that each of the given numbers will divide into without a remainder. The least common multiple will be extremely useful in working with fractions (Section 4.1). 
book5_ch03_6_9	no label	Finding the Least Common Multiple Finding the Least Common Multiple Finding the Least Common Multiple Finding the LCM To find the LCM of two or more numbers: Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on repeated factors. Write each base that appears in each of the prime factorizations. To each base, attach the largest exponent that appears on it in the prime factorizations. The LCM is the product of the numbers found in step 3. There are some major differences between using the processes for obtaining the GCF and the LCM that we must note carefully: The Difference Between the Processes for Obtaining the GCF and the LCM Notice the difference between step 2 for the LCM and step 2 for the GCF. For the GCF, we use only the bases that are common in the prime factorizations, whereas for the LCM, we use each base that appears in the prime factorizations. Notice the difference between step 3 for the LCM and step 3 for the GCF. For the GCF, we attach the smallest exponents to the common bases, whereas for the LCM, we attach the largest exponents to the bases. Sample Set C Find the LCM of the following numbers. Example 3.36.  9 and 12 The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2 and 3. The largest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 2 and 2: 22 from 12. 32 from 9. The LCM is the product of these numbers. LCM = 22⋅32 = 4⋅9 = 36 Thus, 36 is the smallest number that both 9 and 12 divide into without remainders. Example 3.37.  90 and 630 The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The largest exponents that appear on 2, 3, 5, and 7 are, respectively, 1, 2, 1, and 1: 21 from either 90 or 630. 32 from either 90 or 630. 51 from either 90 or 630. 71 from 630. The LCM is the product of these numbers. LCM = 2⋅32⋅5⋅7 = 2⋅9⋅5⋅7 = 630 Thus, 630 is the smallest number that both 90 and 630 divide into with no remainders. Example 3.38.  33, 110, and 484 The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2, 3, 5, and 11. The largest exponents that appear on 2, 3, 5, and 11 are, respectively, 2, 1, 1, and 2: 22 from 484. 31 from 33. 51 from 110 112 from 484. The LCM is the product of these numbers. Thus, 7260 is the smallest number that 33, 110, and 484 divide into without remainders. Practice Set C Find the LCM of the following numbers. Exercise 3.6.11.

We noted that we could visually display the whole numbers by drawing a number line and placing closed circles at whole number locations. By observing this number line, we can see that the whole numbers do not account for every point on the line. What numbers, if any, can be associated with these points? In this section we will see that many of the points on the number line, including the points already associated with whole numbers, can be associated with numbers called fractions. 
book5_ch04_2_3	no label	Fractions of Whole Numbers Fractions of Whole Numbers Fractions of Whole Numbers The Nature of the Positive Fractions We can extend our collection of numbers, which now contains only the whole numbers, by including fractions of whole numbers. We can determine the nature of these fractions using the number line. If we place a pencil at some whole number and proceed to travel to the right to the next whole number, we see that our journey can be broken into different types of equal parts as shown in the following examples. 1 part. 2 equal parts. 3 equal parts. 4 equal parts. The Latin Word Fractio Notice that the number of parts, 2, 3, and 4, that we are breaking the original quantity into is always a nonzero whole number. The idea of breaking up a whole quantity gives us the word fraction. The word fraction comes from the Latin word "fractio" which means a breaking, or fracture. Suppose we break up the interval from some whole number to the next whole number into five equal parts. After starting to move from one whole number to the next, we decide to stop after covering only two parts. We have covered 2 parts of 5 equal parts. This situation is described by writing .

Use of the Hyphen One of the main uses of the hyphen is to tell the reader that two words not ordinarily joined are to be taken in combination as a unit. Hyphens are always used for numbers between and including 21 and 99 (except those ending in zero). Sample Set B Write each fraction using whole numbers. Example 4.5.  Fifty three-hundredths. The hyphen joins the words three and hundredths and tells us to consider them as a single unit. Therefore, fifty three-hundredths translates as Example 4.6.  Fifty-three hundredths. The hyphen joins the numbers fifty and three and tells us to con­sider them as a single unit. Therefore, fifty-three hundredths translates as Example 4.7.  Four hundred seven-thousandths. The hyphen joins the words seven and thousandths and tells us to consider them as a single unit. Therefore, four hundred seven-thousandths translates as Example 4.8.  Four hundred seven thousandths.

book5_ch04_4_5	no label	Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms It is often very useful to convert one fraction to an equivalent fraction that has reduced values in the numerator and denominator. We can suggest a method for doing so by considering the equivalent fractions and . First, divide both the numerator and denominator of by 3. The fractions and are equivalent. (Can you prove this?) So, . We wish to convert to . Now divide the numerator and denominator of by 3, and see what happens. The fraction is converted to . A natural question is "Why did we choose to divide by 3?" Notice that We can see that the factor 3 is common to both the numerator and denominator. Reducing a Fraction From these observations we can suggest the following method for converting one fraction to an equivalent fraction that has reduced values in the numerator and denominator. The method is called reducing a fraction. A fraction can be reduced by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero whole number. Consider the collection of equivalent fractions , , , , Reduced to Lowest Terms Notice that each of the first four fractions can be reduced to the last fraction, , by dividing both the numerator and denominator by, respectively, 5, 4, 3, and 2. When a fraction is converted to the fraction that has the smallest numerator and denomi­nator in its collection of equivalent fractions, it is said to be reduced to lowest terms. The fractions , , , and are all reduced to lowest terms. Observe a very important property of a fraction that has been reduced to lowest terms. The only whole number that divides both the numerator and denominator without a remainder is the number 1. When 1 is the only whole number that divides two whole numbers, the two whole numbers are said to be relatively prime. Relatively Prime A fraction is reduced to lowest terms if its numerator and denominator are relatively prime. Methods of Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms Method 1: Dividing Out Common Primes Write the numerator and denominator as a product of primes. Divide the numerator and denominator by each of the common prime factors. We often indicate this division by drawing a slanted line through each divided out factor. This process is also called cancelling common factors. The product of the remaining factors in the numerator and the product of remaining factors of the denominator are relatively prime, and this fraction is reduced to lowest terms.

Most often, we will want to convert a given fraction to an equivalent fraction with a higher specified denominator. For example, we may wish to convert to an equivalent fraction that has denominator 32, that is, This is possible to do because we know the process. We must multiply both the numerator and denominator of by the same nonzero whole number in order to 8 obtain an equivalent fraction. We have some information. The denominator 8 was raised to 32 by multiplying it by some nonzero whole number. Division will give us the proper factor. Divide the original denominator into the new denominator. 32 ÷ 8 = 4 Now, multiply the numerator 5 by 4. 5 ⋅ 4 = 20 Thus, So, Sample Set D Determine the missing numerator or denominator.

Divide 3 into 9 and 21, and divide 2 into 10 and 16. The product is a fraction that is reduced to lowest terms. The Process of Multiplication by Dividing Out Common Factors To multiply fractions by dividing out common factors, divide out factors that are common to both a numerator and a denominator. The factor being divided out can appear in any numerator and any denominator. Sample Set B Perform the following multiplications.

This is easily seen on the number line. On the number line, a number that appears to the right of another number is larger than that other number. For example, 5 is greater than 2 because 5 is located to the right of 2 on the number line. We may also say that 2 is less than 5. To make the inequality phrases "greater than" and "less than" more brief, mathematicians represent them with the symbols > and <, respectively. Symbols for Greater Than > and Less Than < > represents the phrase "greater than." < represents the phrase "less than." 5 > 2 represents "5 is greater than 2." 2 < 5 represents "2 is less than 5."

We also noted that each position has a particular value. We observed that each position has ten times the value of the position to its right. This means that each position has the value of the position to its left. Thus, a digit written to the right of the units position must have a value of of 1. Recalling that the word "of" translates to multiplication (⋅), we can see that the value of the first position to the right of the units digit is of 1, or The value of the second position to the right of the units digit is of , or The value of the third position to the right of the units digit is of , or This pattern continues. We can now see that if we were to write digits in positions to the right of the units positions, those positions have values that are fractions.

Mathematicians denote the separation point of the units digit and the tenths digit by writing a decimal point. The word decimal comes from the Latin prefix "deci" which means ten, and we use it because we use a base ten number system. Numbers written in this form are called decimal fractions, or more simply, decimals. Notice that decimal numbers have the suffix "th." Decimal Fraction A decimal fraction is a fraction in which the denominator is a power of 10. The following numbers are examples of decimals. 42.6 The 6 is in the tenths position. 9.8014 The 8 is in the tenths position. The 0 is in the hundredths position. The 1 is in the thousandths position. The 4 is in the ten thousandths position. 0.93 The 9 is in the tenths position. The 3 is in the hundredths position. Note Quite often a zero is inserted in front of a decimal point (in the units position) of a decimal fraction that has a value less than one. This zero helps keep us from overlooking the decimal point. 0.7 The 7 is in the tenths position.

Example 6.15.  Round 32.116 to the nearest hundredth. 1) 2b) The digit immediately to the right is 6, and 6 > 5, so we add 1 to the round-off digit: 1 + 1 = 2 3a) The round-off digit is to the right of the decimal point, so we eliminate all digits to its right. 32.12 The number 32.116 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 32.12. Example 6.16.  Round 633.14216 to the nearest hundred. 1) 2a) The digit immediately to the right is 3, and 3 < 5 so we leave the round-off digit unchanged. 3b) The round-off digit is to the left of 0, so we replace all the digits between it and the decimal point with zeros and eliminate the decimal point and all the decimal digits. 600 The number 633.14216 rounded to the nearest hundred is 600. Example 6.17.  1,729.63 rounded to the nearest ten is 1,730. Example 6.18.  1.0144 rounded to the nearest tenth is 1.0. Example 6.19.  60.98 rounded to the nearest one is 61. Sometimes we hear a phrase such as "round to three decimal places." This phrase means that the round-off digit is the third decimal digit (the digit in the thousandths position).

Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals To add or subtract decimals: Align the numbers vertically so that the decimal points line up under each other and the corresponding decimal positions are in the same column. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Place a decimal point in the resulting sum or difference directly under the other decimal points. Sample Set A Find the following sums and differences. Example 6.22.  9.813 + 2.140 Example 6.23.  841.0056 + 47.016 + 19.058 To insure that the columns align properly, we can write a 0 in the position at the end of the numbers 47.016 and 19.058 without changing their values.

book5_ch06_7_6	no label	A Method of Dividing a Decimal By a Nonzero Decimal A Method of Dividing a Decimal By a Nonzero Decimal A Method of Dividing a Decimal By a Nonzero Decimal Now that we can divide decimals by nonzero whole numbers, we are in a position to divide decimals by a nonzero decimal. We will do so by converting a division by a decimal into a division by a whole number, a process with which we are already familiar. We'll illustrate the method using this example: Divide 4.32 by 1.8. Let's look at this problem as . The divisor is . We can convert into a whole number if we multiply it by 10. But, we know from our experience with fractions, that if we multiply the denomina­tor of a fraction by a nonzero whole number, we must multiply the numerator by that same nonzero whole number. Thus, when converting to a whole number by multiplying it by 10, we must also multiply the numerator by 10. We have converted the division 4.32÷1.8 into the division 43.2÷18, that is, Notice what has occurred. If we "move" the decimal point of the divisor one digit to the right, we must also "move" the decimal point of the dividend one place to the right. The word "move" actually indicates the process of multiplication by a power of 10. Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Decimal Number To divide a decimal by a nonzero decimal, Convert the divisor to a whole number by moving the decimal point to the position immediately to the right of the divisor's last digit. Move the decimal point of the dividend to the right the same number of digits it was moved in the divisor. Set the decimal point in the quotient by placing a decimal point directly above the newly located decimal point in the dividend. Divide as usual. Sample Set B Find the following quotients. Example 6.46.  32.66÷7.1 The divisor has one decimal place. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 1 place to the right. Set the decimal point. Divide as usual. Thus, 32.66÷7.1 = 4.6. Check: 32.66÷7.1 = 4.6 if 4.6 × 7.1 = 32.66 Example 6.47.  1.0773÷0.513 The divisor has 3 decimal places. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 3 places to the right. Set the decimal place and divide. Thus, 1.0773÷0.513 = 2.1. Checking by multiplying 2.1 and 0.513 will convince us that we have obtained the correct result. (Try it.) Example 6.48.  12÷0.00032 The divisor has 5 decimal places. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 5 places to the right. We will need to add 5 zeros to 12. Set the decimal place and divide. This is now the same as the division of whole numbers. Checking assures us that 12÷0.00032 = 37,500. Practice Set B Find the decimal representation of each quotient. Exercise 6.7.5.

book5_ch06_7_9	no label	Calculators Calculators Calculators Calculators can be useful for finding quotients of decimal numbers. As we have seen with the other calculator operations, we can sometimes expect only approximate results. We are alerted to approximate results when the calculator display is filled with digits. We know it is possible that the operation may produce more digits than the calculator has the ability to show. For example, the multiplication produces 5 + 4 = 9 decimal places. An eight-digit display calculator only has the ability to show eight digits, and an approximation results. The way to recognize a possible approximation is illustrated in problem 3 of the next sample set. Sample Set C Find each quotient using a calculator.

BE AWARE OF POSSIBLE APPROXI­MATIONS. We can check for a possible approximation in the following way. Since the division can be checked by multiplying 4 and 3, we can check our division by performing the multiplication This multiplication produces 3 + 7 = 10 decimal digits. But our suspected quotient contains only 8 decimal digits. We conclude that the answer is an approximation. Then, rounding to five decimal places, we get 0.19974.

Let's look at each of these again and then, from these observations, make a general statement regarding division of a decimal num­ber by a power of 10. Thus, 8,162.41÷10 = 816.241. Notice that the divisor 10 is composed of one 0 and that the quotient 816.241 can be obtained from the dividend 8,162.41 by moving the decimal point one place to the left. Thus, 8,162.41÷100 = 81.6241. Notice that the divisor 100 is composed of two 0's and that the quotient 81.6241 can be obtained from the dividend by moving the decimal point two places to the left. Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing decimal numbers by powers of 10. Dividing a Decimal Fraction by a Power of 10 To divide a decimal fraction by a power of 10, move the decimal point of the decimal fraction to the left as many places as there are zeros in the power of 10.

A terminating division is a division in which the quotient terminates after several divisions (the remainder is zero). Exact Divisions The quotient in this problem terminates in the tenths position. Terminating divi­sions are also called exact divisions. Nonterminating Division The division in example 2 is an example of a nonterminating division. A non-terminating division is a division that, regardless of how far we carry it out, always has a remainder. Repeating Decimal We can see that the pattern in the brace is repeated endlessly. Such a decimal quotient is called a repeating decimal. 
book5_ch06_8_3	no label	Denoting Nonterminating Quotients Denoting Nonterminating Quotients Denoting Nonterminating Quotients We use three dots at the end of a number to indicate that a pattern repeats itself endlessly. 4 ÷ 3 = 1 . 333 … Another way, aside from using three dots, of denoting an endlessly repeating pattern is to write a bar ( ¯ ) above the repeating sequence of digits. The bar indicates the repeated pattern of 3. Repeating patterns in a division can be discovered in two ways: As the division process progresses, should the remainder ever be the same as the dividend, it can be concluded that the division is nonterminating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats. This fact is illustrated in Example 6.54 of the section called “Sample Set A”. As the division process progresses, should the "product, difference" pattern ever repeat two consecutive times, it can be concluded that the division is nonter­minating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats. This fact is illustrated in Example 6.55 and 4 of the section called “Sample Set A”. Sample Set A Carry out each division until the repeating pattern can be determined. Example 6.54.  100 ÷ 27 When the remainder is identical to the dividend, the division is nonterminating. This implies that the pattern in the quotient repeats. 100÷27 = 3.70370370… The repeating block is 703. Example 6.55.  1 ÷ 9 We see that this “product, difference”pattern repeats. We can conclude that the division is nonterminating and that the quotient repeats. 1÷9 = 0.111… The repeating block is 1. Example 6.56.  Divide 2 by 11 and round to 3 decimal places. Since we wish to round the quotient to three decimal places, we'll carry out the division so that the quotient has four decimal places. The number .1818 rounded to three decimal places is .182. Thus, correct to three decimal places, 2 ÷ 11 = 0 . 182 Example 6.57.  Divide 1 by 6. We see that this “product, difference” pattern repeats. We can conclude that the division is nonterminating and that the quotient repeats at the 6. Practice Set A Carry out the following divisions until the repeating pattern can be determined.

Denominate num­bers are numbers together with some specified unit. If the units being compared are alike, the denominate numbers are called like denominate numbers. If units are not alike, the numbers are called unlike denominate numbers. Examples of denominate numbers are shown in the diagram: Pure Numbers Numbers that exist purely as numbers and do not represent amounts of quantities are called pure numbers. Examples of pure numbers are 8, 254, 0, , , and 0.07. Numbers can be compared in two ways: subtraction and division. Comparing Numbers by Subtraction and Division Comparison of two numbers by subtraction indicates how much more one number is than another. Comparison by division indicates how many times larger or smaller one number is than another. Comparing Pure or Like Denominate Numbers by Subtraction Numbers can be compared by subtraction if and only if they both are like denominate numbers or both pure numbers. Sample Set A Example 7.1.  Compare 8 miles and 3 miles by subtraction. 8 mile – 3 miles = 5 miles This means that 8 miles is 5 miles more than 3 miles. Examples of use: I can now jog 8 miles whereas I used to jog only 3 miles. So, I can now jog 5 miles more than I used to. Example 7.2.  Compare 12 and 5 by subtraction. 12 − 5 = 7 This means that 12 is 7 more than 5. Example 7.3.  Comparing 8 miles and 5 gallons by subtraction makes no sense. 8 miles – 5 gallons = ? Example 7.4.  Compare 36 and 4 by division. 36 ÷ 4 = 9 This means that 36 is 9 times as large as 4. Recall that 36÷4 = 9 can be expressed as . Example 7.5.  Compare 8 miles and 2 miles by division. This means that 8 miles is 4 times as large as 2 miles. Example of use: I can jog 8 miles to your 2 miles. Or, for every 2 miles that you jog, I jog 8. So, I jog 4 times as many miles as you jog. Notice that when like quantities are being compared by division, we drop the units. Another way of looking at this is that the units divide out (cancel). Example 7.6.  Compare 30 miles and 2 gallons by division. Example of use: A particular car goes 30 miles on 2 gallons of gasoline. This is the same as getting 15 miles to 1 gallon of gasoline. Notice that when the quantities being compared by division are unlike quantities, we do not drop the units. Practice Set A Make the following comparisons and interpret each one. Exercise 7.2.1.

book5_ch07_2_5	no label	Ratios and Rates Ratios and Rates Ratios and Rates Ratio A comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate numbers is a ratio. The comparison by division of the pure numbers and the like denominate numbers are examples of ratios. Rate A comparison, by division, of two unlike denominate numbers is a rate. The comparison by division of two unlike denominate numbers, such as are examples of rates. Let's agree to represent two numbers (pure or denominate) with the letters a and b . This means that we're letting a represent some number and b represent some, perhaps different, number. With this agreement, we can write the ratio of the two numbers a and b as or The ratio is read as " a to b ." The ratio is read as " b to a ." Since a ratio or a rate can be expressed as a fraction, it may be reducible. Sample Set B Example 7.7.  The ratio 30 to 2 can be expressed as . Reducing, we get . The ratio 30 to 2 is equivalent to the ratio 15 to 1. Example 7.8.  The rate "4 televisions to 12 people" can be expressed as . The meaning of this rate is that "for every 4 televisions, there are 12 people." Reducing, we get . The meaning of this rate is that "for every 1 television, there are 3 people.” Thus, the rate of "4 televisions to 12 people" is the same as the rate of "1 television to 3 people."

Such proportions will be composed of three specified numbers and one unknown number. It is customary to let a letter, such as x , represent the unknown number. An example of such a proportion is This proportion is read as " x is to 4 as 20 is to 16." There is a method of solving these proportions that is based on the equality of fractions. Recall that two fractions are equivalent if and only if their cross products are equal. For example, Notice that in a proportion that contains three specified numbers and a letter representing an unknown quantity, that regardless of where the letter appears, the following situation always occurs. We recognize this as a multiplication statement. Specifically, it is a missing factor statement. (See Section 4.7 for a discussion of multiplication statements.) For example, Each of these statements is a multiplication statement. Specifically, each is a missing factor statement. (The letter used here is x , whereas M was used in Section 4.7.) Finding the Missing Factor in a Proportion The missing factor in a missing factor statement can be determined by dividing the product by the known factor, that is, if x represents the missing factor, then x = ( product ) ÷ ( known factor ) Sample Set B Find the unknown number in each proportion.

We must be careful when setting up proportions that involve rates. The form is impor­tant. For example, if a rate involves two types of units, say unit type 1 and unit type 2, we can write or Both cross products produce a statement of the type (unit type 1) ⋅ (unit type 2) = (unit type 1) ⋅ (unit type 2) which we take to mean the comparison Examples of correctly expressed proportions are the following: However, if we write the same type of units on different sides, such as, the cross product produces a statement of the form We can see that this is an incorrect comparison by observing the following example: It is incorrect to write for two reason. The cross product is numerically wrong: (2⋅4 ≠ 3⋅6). The cross product produces the statement “hooks are to hooks as poles are to poles,” which makes no sense.

Such proportions will be composed of three specified numbers and one unknown number represented by a letter. The first and most important part of solving a proportion problem is to deter­mine, by careful reading, what the unknown quantity is and to represent it with some letter. The Five-Step Method The five-step method for solving proportion problems: By careful reading, determine what the unknown quantity is and represent it with some letter. There will be only one unknown in a problem. Identify the three specified numbers. Determine which comparisons are to be made and set up the proportion. Solve the proportion (using the methods of Section 7.3). Interpret and write a conclusion in a sentence with the appropriate units of measure. Step 1 is extremely important. Many problems go unsolved because time is not taken to establish what quantity is to be found. When solving an applied problem, always begin by determining the unknown quantity and representing it with a letter.

Step 1: The unknown quantity is miles. Let x = number of miles represented by 8 inches Step 2: The three specified numbers are 2 inches 25 miles 8 inches Step 3: The comparisons are 2 inches to 25 miles → 8 inches to x miles → Proportions involving ratios and rates are more readily solved by suspending the units while doing the computations. Step 4: In step 1, we let x represent the number of miles. So, x represents 100 miles. Step 5: If 2 inches represents 25 miles, then 8 inches represents 100 miles.

A most convenient number to compare numbers to is 100. Ratios in which one number is compared to 100 are called percents. The word percent comes from the Latin word "per centum." The word "per" means "for each" or "for every," and the word "centum" means "hundred." Thus, we have the following definition. Percent means “for each hundred," or "for every hundred." The symbol % is used to represent the word percent. Sample Set A Example 7.22.  The ratio 26 to 100 can be written as 26%. We read 26% as "twenty-six percent." Example 7.23.  The ratio can be written as 165%. We read 165% as "one hundred sixty-five percent." Example 7.24.  The percent 38% can be written as the fraction . Example 7.25.  The percent 210% can be written as the fraction or the mixed number or 2.1. Example 7.26.  Since one dollar is 100 cents, 25 cents is of a dollar.

When converting nonterminating fractions of 1% to decimals, it is customary to express the fraction as a rounded decimal with at least three decimal places. Converting a Nonterminating Fraction to a Decimal To convert a nonterminating fraction of 1% to a decimal: Convert the fraction as a rounded decimal. Move the decimal point two digits to the left and remove the percent sign. Sample Set B Example 7.33.  Convert % to a three-place decimal. Convert to a decimal. Since we wish the resulting decimal to have three decimal digits, and removing the percent sign will account for two of them, we need to round to one place (2 + 1 = 3). % to one decimal place.

book5_ch07_7_2	no label	Base, Percent, and Percentage Base, Percent, and Percentage Base, Percent, and Percentage There are three basic types of percent problems. Each type involves a base, a percent, and a percentage, and when they are translated from words to mathemati­cal symbols each becomes a multiplication statement. Examples of these types of problems are the following: What number is 30% of 50? (Missing product statement.) 15 is what percent of 50? (Missing factor statement.) 15 is 30% of what number? (Missing factor statement.) In problem 1, the product is missing. To solve the problem, we represent the missing product with P . P = 30% ⋅ 50 Percentage The missing product P is called the percentage. Percentage means part, or por­tion. In P = 30% ⋅50, P represents a particular part of 50. In problem 2, one of the factors is missing. Here we represent the missing factor with Q . 15 = Q ⋅ 50 Percent The missing factor is the percent. Percent, we know, means per 100, or part of 100. In 15 = Q ⋅50, Q indicates what part of 50 is being taken or considered. Specifi­cally, 15 = Q ⋅50 means that if 50 was to be divided into 100 equal parts, then Q indicates 15 are being considered. In problem 3, one of the factors is missing. Represent the missing factor with B . 15 = 30% ⋅ B Base The missing factor is the base. Some meanings of base are a source of supply, or a starting place. In 15 = 30% ⋅B , B indicates the amount of supply. Specifically, 15 = 30% ⋅B indicates that 15 represents 30% of the total supply. Each of these three types of problems is of the form ( percentage ) = ( percent ) ⋅ ( base ) We can determine any one of the three values given the other two using the methods discussed in Section 4.7.

Example 7.38.  A salesperson, who gets a commission of 12% of each sale she makes, makes a sale of $8,400.00. How much is her commission? We need to determine what part of $8,400.00 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the salesperson's commission is $1,008.00. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.2.. Example 7.39.  A girl, by practicing typing on her home computer, has been able to increase her typing speed by 110%. If she originally typed 16 words per minute, by how many words per minute was she able to increase her speed? We need to determine what part of 16 has been taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the girl has increased her typing speed by 17.6 words per minute. Her new speed is 16 + 17.6 = 33.6 words per minute. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.3.. Example 7.40.  A student who makes $125 a month working part-time receives a 4% salary raise. What is the student's new monthly salary? With a 4% raise, this student will make 100% of the original salary + 4% of the original salary. This means the new salary will be 104% of the original salary. We need to determine what part of $125 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, this student's new monthly salary is $130. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.4.. Example 7.41.  An article of clothing is on sale at 15% off the marked price. If the marked price is $24.95, what is the sale price? Since the item is discounted 15%, the new price will be 100% – 15% = 85% of the marked price. We need to determine what part of 24.95 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the sale price of the item is $21.21. Practice Set A Exercise 7.7.1. (Go to Solution) What number is 42% of 85? Exercise 7.7.2.

book5_ch08_2_2	no label	Estimation by Rounding Estimation by Rounding Estimation by Rounding The rounding technique estimates the result of a computation by rounding the numbers involved in the computation to one or two nonzero digits. Sample Set A Example 8.1.  Estimate the sum: 2,357 + 6,106. Notice that 2,357 is near and that 6,106 is near The sum can be estimated by 2,400 + 6,100 = 8,500. (It is quick and easy to add 24 and 61.) Thus, 2,357 + 6,106 is about 8,400. In fact, 2,357 + 6,106 = 8,463. Practice Set A Exercise 8.2.1. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 4,216 + 3,942. Exercise 8.2.2. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 812 + 514. Exercise 8.2.3. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 43,892 + 92,106. Sample Set B Example 8.2.  Estimate the difference: 5,203 – 3,015. Notice that 5,203 is near and that 3,015 is near The difference can be estimated by 5,200 – 3,000 = 2,200. Thus, 5,203 – 3,015 is about 2,200. In fact, 5,203 – 3,015 = 2,188. We could make a less accurate estimation by observing that 5,203 is near 5,000. The number 5,000 has only one nonzero digit rather than two (as does 5,200). This fact makes the estimation quicker (but a little less accurate). We then estimate the difference by 5,000 – 3,000 = 2,000, and conclude that 5,203 – 3,015 is about 2,000. This is why we say "answers may vary." Practice Set B Exercise 8.2.4. (Go to Solution) Estimate the difference: 628 – 413. Exercise 8.2.5. (Go to Solution) Estimate the difference: 7,842 – 5,209. Exercise 8.2.6. (Go to Solution) Estimate the difference: 73,812 – 28,492. Sample Set C Example 8.3.  Estimate the product: 73 ⋅ 46. Notice that 73 is near and that 46 is near The product can be estimated by 70 ⋅ 50 = 3,500. (Recall that to multiply numbers ending in zeros, we multiply the nonzero digits and affix to this product the total number of ending zeros in the factors. See Section 2.2 for a review of this technique.) Thus, 73 ⋅ 46 is about 3,500. In fact, 73 ⋅ 46 = 3,358. Example 8.4.  Estimate the product: 87 ⋅ 4,316. Notice that 87 is close to and that 4,316 is close to The product can be estimated by 90 ⋅ 4,000 = 360,000. Thus, 87 ⋅ 4,316 is about 360,000. In fact, 87 ⋅ 4,316 = 375,492. Practice Set C Exercise 8.2.7. (Go to Solution) Estimate the product: 31 ⋅ 87. Exercise 8.2.8. (Go to Solution) Estimate the product: 18 ⋅ 42. Exercise 8.2.9. (Go to Solution) Estimate the product: 16 ⋅ 94. Sample Set D Example 8.5.  Estimate the quotient: 153 ÷ 17. Notice that 153 is close to and that 17 is close to The quotient can be estimated by 150 ÷ 15 = 10. Thus, 153 ÷ 17 is about 10. In fact, 153 ÷ 17 = 9. Example 8.6.  Estimate the quotient: 742,000 ÷ 2,400. Notice that 742,000 is close to , and that 2,400 is close to The quotient can be estimated by 700,000 ÷ 2,000 = 350. Thus, 742,000 ÷ 2,400 is about 350. In fact, . Practice Set D Exercise 8.2.10. (Go to Solution) Estimate the quotient: 221 ÷ 18. Exercise 8.2.11. (Go to Solution) Estimate the quotient: 4,079 ÷ 381. Exercise 8.2.12. (Go to Solution) Estimate the quotient: 609,000 ÷ 16,000. Sample Set E Example 8.7.  Estimate the sum: 53.82 + 41.6. Notice that 53.82 is close to and that 41.6 is close to The sum can be estimated by 54 + 42 = 96. Thus, 53.82 + 41.6 is about 96. In fact, 53.82 + 41.6 = 95.42. Practice Set E Exercise 8.2.13. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 61.02 + 26.8. Exercise 8.2.14. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 109.12 + 137.88. Sample Set F Example 8.8.  Estimate the product: (31.28)(14.2). Notice that 31.28 is close to and that 14.2 is close to The product can be estimated by 30 ⋅ 15 = 450. ( 3 ⋅ 15 = 45, then affix one zero.) Thus, (31.28)(14.2) is about 450. In fact, (31.28)(14.2) = 444.176. Example 8.9.  Estimate 21% of 5.42. Notice that 21% = .21 as a decimal, and that .21 is close to Notice also that 5.42 is close to Then, 21% of 5.42 can be estimated by (.2)(5) = 1. Thus, 21% of 5.42 is about 1. In fact, 21% of 5.42 is 1.1382. Practice Set F Exercise 8.2.15. (Go to Solution) Estimate the product: (47.8)(21.1). Exercise 8.2.16. (Go to Solution) Estimate 32% of 14.88.

It is used often in algebra, and we can use it now to obtain exact results for a multiplication. Suppose we wish to compute 3(2 + 5). We can proceed in either of two ways, one way which is known to us already (the order of operations), and a new way (the distributive property). Compute 3(2 + 5) using the order of operations. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) Operate inside the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) = 3 ⋅ 7 Now multiply 3 and 7. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) = 3 ⋅ 7 = 21 Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21. Compute 3(2 + 5) using the distributive property. We know that multiplication describes repeated addition. Thus, Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21. Let's look again at this use of the distributive property. The 3 has been distributed to the 2 and 5. This is the distributive property. We distribute the factor to each addend in the parentheses. The distributive property works for both sums and differences.

book5_ch09_2_2	no label	Measurement Measurement Measurement There are two major systems of measurement in use today. They are the United States system and the metric system. Before we describe these systems, let's gain a clear understanding of the concept of measurement. Measurement Measurement is comparison to some standard. Standard Unit of Measure The concept of measurement is based on the idea of direct comparison. This means that measurement is the result of the comparison of two quantities. The quantity that is used for comparison is called the standard unit of measure. Over the years, standards have changed. Quite some time in the past, the stan­dard unit of measure was determined by a king. For example, 1 inch was the distance between the tip of the thumb and the knuckle of the king. 1 inch was also the length of 16 barley grains placed end to end. Today, standard units of measure rarely change. Standard units of measure are the responsibility of the Bureau of Standards in Washington D.C. Some desirable properties of a standard are the following: Accessibility. We should have access to the standard so we can make comparisons. Invariance. We should be confident that the standard is not subject to change. Reproducibility. We should be able to reproduce the standard so that measure­ments are convenient and accessible to many people. 
book5_ch09_2_3	no label	The United States System of Measurement The United States System of Measurement The United States System of Measurement Some of the common units (along with their abbreviations) for the United States system of measurement are listed in the following table. Table 9.1. Unit Conversion Table Length 1 foot (ft) = 12 inches (in.) 1 yard (yd) = 3 feet (ft) 1 mile (mi) = 5,280 feet Weight 1 pound (lb) =16 ounces (oz) 1 ton (T) = 2,000 pounds Liquid Volume 1 tablespoon (tbsp) = 3 teaspoons (tsp) 1 fluid ounce (fl oz) = 2 tablespoons 1 cup (c) = 8 fluid ounces 1 pint (pt) = 2 cups1 quart (qt) = 2 pints1 gallon (gal) = 4 quarts Time 1 minute (min) = 60 seconds (sec) 1 hour ( hr) = 60 minutes1 day (da) = 24 hours1 week (wk) = 7 days 
book5_ch09_2_4	no label	Conversions in the United States System Conversions in the United States System Conversions in the United States System It is often convenient or necessary to convert from one unit of measure to another. For example, it may be convenient to convert a measurement of length that is given in feet to one that is given in inches. Such conversions can be made using unit fractions. Unit Fraction A unit fraction is a fraction with a value of 1. Unit fractions are formed by using two equal measurements. One measurement is placed in the numerator of the fraction, and the other in the denominator. Place­ment depends on the desired conversion. Placement of Units Place the unit being converted to in the numerator. Place the unit being converted from in the denominator. For example, Table 9.2. Equal Measurements Unit Fraction 1ft = 12in. 1pt = 16 fl oz 1wk = 7da Sample Set A Make the following conversions. If a fraction occurs, convert it to a decimal rounded to two decimal places. Example 9.1.  Convert 11 yards to feet. Looking in the unit conversion table under length, we see that 1 yd = 3 ft. There are two corresponding unit fractions, and . Which one should we use? Look to see which unit we wish to convert to. Choose the unit fraction with this unit in the numerator. We will choose since this unit fraction has feet in the numerator. Now, multiply 11 yd by the unit fraction. Notice that since the unit fraction has the value of 1, multiplying by it does not change the value of 11 yd. Thus, 11 yd = 33ft. Example 9.2.  Convert 36 fl oz to pints. Looking in the unit conversion table under liquid volume, we see that 1 pt = 16 fl oz. Since we are to convert to pints, we will construct a unit fraction with pints in the numerator. Thus, 36 fl oz = 2.25 pt. Example 9.3.  Convert 2,016 hr to weeks. Looking in the unit conversion table under time, we see that 1wk = 7da and that 1 da = 24 hr. To convert from hours to weeks, we must first convert from hours to days and then from days to weeks. We need two unit fractions. The unit fraction needed for converting from hours to days is . The unit fraction needed for converting from days to weeks is . Thus, 2,016 hr = 12 wk. Practice Set A Make the following conversions. If a fraction occurs, convert it to a decimal rounded to two decimal places. Exercise 9.2.1. (Go to Solution) Convert 18 ft to yards. Exercise 9.2.2.

The advantage of the metric system over the United States system is that in the metric system it is possible to convert from one unit of measure to another simply by multiplying or dividing the given number by a power of 10. This means we can make a conversion simply by moving the decimal point to the right or the left. 
book5_ch09_3_3	no label	Prefixes Prefixes Prefixes Common units of measure in the metric system are the meter (for length), the liter (for volume), and the gram (for mass). To each of the units can be attached a prefix. The metric prefixes along with their meaning are listed below. kilo — thousand deci — tenth hecto — hundred centi — hundredth deka — ten milli — thousandth For example, if length is being measured, 1 kilometer is equivalent to 1000 meters. 1 centimeter is equivalent to one hundredth of a meter. 1 millimeter is equivalent to one thousandth of a meter. 
book5_ch09_3_4	no label	Conversion from One Unit to Another Unit Conversion from One Unit to Another Unit Conversion from One Unit to Another Unit Let's note three characteristics of the metric system that occur in the metric table of measurements. In each category, the prefixes are the same. We can move from a larger to a smaller unit of measure by moving the decimal point to the right. We can move from a smaller to a larger unit of measure by moving the decimal point to the left. The following table provides a summary of the relationship between the basic unit of measure (meter, gram, liter) and each prefix, and how many places the decimal point is moved and in what direction. kilo hecto deka unit deci centi milli Table 9.3.

The weight of a body is related to gravity whereas the mass of a body is not. For example, your weight on the earth is different than it is on the moon, but your mass is the same in both places. Mass is a measure of a body's resistance to motion. The more massive a body, the more resistant it is to motion. Also, more massive bodies weigh more than less massive bodies. Converting Metric Units To convert from one metric unit to another metric unit: Determine the location of the original number on the metric scale (pictured in each of the following examples). Move the decimal point of the original number in the same direction and same number of places as is necessary to move to the metric unit you wish to go to. We can also convert from one metric unit to another using unit fractions. Both methods are shown in Example 9.4 of the section called “Sample Set A”. Sample Set A Example 9.4.  Convert 3 kilograms to grams. 3 kg can be written as 3.0 kg. Then, Thus, 3kg = 3,000 g. We can also use unit fractions to make this conversion. Since we are converting to grams, and 1,000    g = 1   kg, we choose the unit fraction since grams is in the numerator. Example 9.5.  Convert 67.2 hectoliters to milliliters. Thus, 67.2 hL = 6,720,000 mL. Example 9.6.  Convert 100.07 centimeters to meters. Thus, 100.07 cm = 1.0007 m. Example 9.7.  Convert 0.16 milligrams to grams. Thus, 0.16   mg = 0.00016 g.

book5_ch09_4_2	no label	Converting to Multiple Units Converting to Multiple Units Converting to Multiple Units Denominate Numbers Numbers that have units of measure associated with them are called denominate numbers. It is often convenient, or even necessary, to simplify a denominate number. Simplified Denominate Number A denominate number is simplified when the number of standard units of measure associated With it does not exceed the next higher type of unit. The denominate number 55 min is simplified since it is smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min is not simplified since it is not smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min can be simplified to 1 hr 5 min. The denominate number 1 hr 5 min is simplified since the next higher type of unit is day, and 1 hr does not exceed 1 day. Sample Set A Example 9.8.  Simplify 19 in.

Formulas are usually composed of letters that represent important, but possibly unknown, quantities. If C , d , and r represent, respectively, the circumference, diameter, and radius of a circle, then the following two formulas give us directions for computing the circum­ference of the circle.

book5_ch10_2_2	no label	Variables and Constants Variables and Constants Variables and Constants A basic distinction between algebra and arithmetic is the use of symbols (usually letters) in algebra to represent numbers. So, algebra is a generalization of arithme­tic. Let us look at two examples of situations in which letters are substituted for numbers: Suppose that a student is taking four college classes, and each class can have at most 1 exam per week. In any 1-week period, the student may have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 exams. In algebra, we can let the letter x represent the number of exams this student may have in a 1-week period. The letter x may assume any of the various values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Suppose that in writing a term paper for a biology class a student needs to specify the average lifetime, in days, of a male housefly. If she does not know this number off the top of her head, she might represent it (at least temporarily) on her paper with the letter t (which reminds her of time). Later, she could look up the average time in a reference book and find it to be 17 days. The letter t can assume only the one value, 17, and no other values. The value t is constant. Variable, Constant A letter or symbol that represents any member of a collection of two or more numbers is called a variable. A letter or symbol that represents one specific number, known or unknown, is called a constant. In example 1, the letter x is a variable since it can represent any of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The letter t example 2 is a constant since it can only have the value 17. 
book5_ch10_2_3	no label	Real Numbers Real Numbers Real Numbers Real Number Line The study of mathematics requires the use of several collections of numbers. The real number line allows us to visually display (graph) the numbers in which we are interested. A line is composed of infinitely many points. To each point we can associate a unique number, and with each number, we can associate a particular point. Coordinate The number associated with a point on the number line is called the coordinate of the point. Graph The point on a number line that is associated with a particular number is called the graph of that number. Constructing a Real Number Line We construct a real number line as follows: Draw a horizontal line. Origin Choose any point on the line and label it 0. This point is called the origin. Choose a convenient length. Starting at 0, mark this length off in both direc­tions, being careful to have the lengths look like they are about the same. We now define a real number. Real Number A real number is any number that is the coordinate of a point on the real number line. Positive Numbers, Negative Numbers Real numbers whose graphs are to the right of 0 are called positive real numbers, or more simply, positive numbers. Real numbers whose graphs appear to the left of 0 are called negative real numbers, or more simply, negative numbers. The number 0 is neither positive nor negative.

They have decimal representations that either terminate or do not terminate but contain a repeating block of digits. Some examples are       Some rational numbers are graphed below. Notice that every integer is a rational number. Notice that there are still a great many points on the number line that have not yet been assigned a type of number. We will not examine these other types of numbers in this text. They are examined in detail in algebra. An example of these numbers is the number π , whose decimal representation does not terminate nor contain a repeating block of digits. An approximation for π is 3.14.

For this reason, we say that each real number has an opposite. Opposites are the same distance from zero but have opposite signs. The opposite of a real number is denoted by placing a negative sign directly in front of the number. Thus, if a is any real number, then − a is its opposite. Note The letter " a " is a variable. Thus, " a " need not be positive, and " – a " need not be negative. If a is any real number, − a is opposite a on the number line.

book5_ch10_4_2	no label	Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Absolute Value-Geometric Approach Geometric definition of absolute value: The absolute value of a number a , denoted ∣ a ∣ , is the distance from a to 0 on the number line. Absolute value answers the question of "how far," and not "which way." The phrase "how far" implies "length" and length is always a nonnegative quantity. Thus, the absolute value of a number is a nonnegative number. Sample Set A Determine each value. Example 10.14.  ∣ 4 ∣ = 4 Example 10.15.  ∣ − 4 ∣ = 4 Example 10.16.  ∣ 0 ∣ = 0 Example 10.17.  − ∣ 5 ∣ = − 5. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of 5." The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence, negative the absolute value of 5 is -5. Example 10.18.  − ∣ − 3 ∣ = − 3. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of -3." The absolute value of -3 is 3. Hence, negative the absolute value of -3 is – ( 3 ) = – 3 . Practice Set A By reasoning geometrically, determine each absolute value. Exercise 10.4.1. (Go to Solution) ∣ 7 ∣ Exercise 10.4.2.

book5_ch10_4_5	no label	Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value From the problems in the section called “Sample Set A”, we can suggest the following algebraic defini­tion of absolute value. Note that the definition has two parts. Absolute Value—Algebraic Approach Algebraic definition of absolute value The absolute value of a number a is The algebraic definition takes into account the fact that the number a could be either positive or zero (a ≥ 0) or negative (a < 0). If the number a is positive or zero (a ≥ 0), the upper part of the definition applies. The upper part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed in the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, the absolute value of the number is the number itself. The lower part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a negative number, the absolute value of the number is the opposite of the number. The opposite of a negative number is a positive number. Note The definition says that the vertical absolute value lines may be elimi­nated only if we know whether the number inside is positive or negative. Sample Set B Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values. Example 10.19.  ∣ 8 ∣ . The number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, so the upper part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of 8 is 8 itself. ∣ 8 ∣ = 8 Example 10.20.  ∣ − 3 ∣ . The number enclosed within absolute value bars is a negative number, so the lower part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of -3 is the opposite of -3, which is − ( − 3). By the definition of absolute value and the double-negative property, ∣ − 3 ∣ = − ( − 3 ) = 3 Practice Set B Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values.

Begin at 0, the origin. Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right. Since 3 is positive, move 3 more units to the right. We are now located at 5. Thus, 2 + 3 = 5. Summarizing, we have ( 2 positive units ) + ( 3 positive units ) = ( 5 positive units ) The addition of the two negative numbers -2 and -3 is performed on the number line as follows. Begin at 0, the origin. Since -2 is negative, move 2 units to the left. Since -3 is negative, move 3 more units to the left. We are now located at -5. Thus, ( − 2) + ( − 3) = − 5. Summarizing, we have ( 2 negative units ) + ( 3 negative units ) = ( 5 negative units ) Observing these two examples, we can suggest these relationships: ( positive number ) + ( positive number ) = ( positive number ) ( negative number ) + ( negative number ) = ( negative number ) Adding Numbers with the Same Sign Addition of numbers with like sign: To add two real numbers that have the same sign, add the absolute values of the numbers and associate with the sum the common sign. Sample Set A Find the sums. Example 10.21.  3 + 7 Add these absolute values. 3 + 7 = 10 The common sign is “+.” Thus, 3 + 7 = + 10, or 3 + 7 = 10. Example 10.22.  ( − 4) + ( − 9) Add these absolute values. 4 + 9 = 13 The common sign is “ – .“ Thus, ( − 4) + ( − 9) = − 13. Practice Set A Find the sums. Exercise 10.5.1.

book5_ch10_5_6	no label	Addition of Numbers with Unlike Signs Addition of Numbers with Unlike Signs Addition of Numbers with Unlike Signs The addition 2 + ( – 6), two numbers with unlike signs, can also be illustrated using the number line. Begin at 0, the origin. Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right. Since -6 is negative, move, from 2, 6 units to the left. We are now located at -4. We can suggest a rule for adding two numbers that have unlike signs by noting that if the signs are disregarded, 4 can be obtained by subtracting 2 from 6. But 2 and 6 are precisely the absolute values of 2 and -6. Also, notice that the sign of the number with the larger absolute value is negative and that the sign of the resulting sum is negative. Adding Numbers with Unlike Signs Addition of numbers with unlike signs: To add two real numbers that have unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and associate with this difference the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. Sample Set B Find the following sums. Example 10.23.  7 + ( – 2)       Subtract absolute values: 7 – 2 = 5. Attach the proper sign: "+." Thus, 7 + ( – 2) = + 5 or 7 + ( – 2) = 5. Example 10.24.  3 + ( – 11 )       Subtract absolute values: 11 – 3 = 8. Attach the proper sign: " – ." Thus, 3 + ( – 11) = – 8.

book5_ch10_6_2	no label	Definition of Subtraction Definition of Subtraction Definition of Subtraction We know from experience with arithmetic that the subtraction 5 – 2 produces 3, that is 5 – 2 = 3. We can suggest a rule for subtracting signed numbers by illus­trating this process on the number line. Begin at 0, the origin. Since 5 is positive, move 5 units to the right. Then, move 2 units to the left to get to 6. (This reminds us of addition with a negative number.) From this illustration we can see that 5 – 2 is the same as 5 + ( – 2). This leads us directly to the definition of subtraction. Definition of Subtraction If a and b are real numbers, a – b is the same as a + ( – b), where – b is the opposite of b .

Multiply: 3 ⋅ 5. 3 ⋅ 5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 This suggests[1] that ( positive number ) ⋅ ( positive number ) = ( positive number ) More briefly, ( + ) ( + ) = ( + ) Now consider the product of a positive number and a negative number. Multiply: (3)( − 5).

When we are dealing with quantities of the same type, we may combine them using addition and subtraction. Simplifying an Algebraic Expression An algebraic expression may be simplified by combining like terms. This concept is illustrated in the following examples. Eight and 5 of the same type give 13 of that type. We have combined quantities of the same type. Eight and 5 of the same type give 13 of that type. Thus, we have 13 of one type and 3 of another type.

We can obtain an equivalent equation by subtracting the same number from both sides of the equation. The Idea Behind Equation Solving The idea behind equation solving is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Signs of operation (+, -, ⋅,÷) are used to associate two numbers. For example, in the expression , the numbers 5 and 3 are associated by addition. An association can be undone by performing the opposite operation.

When beginning to solve an equation such as , it is helpful to know which property of equality to use first, addition/subtraction or multiplication/di­vision. Recalling that in equation solving we are trying to isolate the variable (disas­sociate numbers from it), it is helpful to note the following. To associate numbers and letters, we use the order of operations. Multiply/divide Add/subtract To undo an association between numbers and letters, we use the order of opera­tions in reverse. Add/subtract Multiply/divide Sample Set B Solve each equation. (In these example problems, we will not show the checks.) Example 11.31.  -4 is associated with by subtraction.

Undo the association by subtracting 3 from both sides. -8 is associated with by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by -8. Example 11.33.  Begin by solving this equation by combining like terms. Choose a side on which to isolate m. Since 7 is greater than 1, we'll isolate m on the right side. Subtract m from both sides. 8 is associated with m by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 8 to both sides. 6 is associated with m by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by 6. Reduce. Notice that if we had chosen to isolate m on the left side of the equation rather than the right side, we would have proceeded as follows: Subtract from both sides. Add 6 to both sides, Divide both sides by -6. This is the same result as with the previous approach. Example 11.34.  7 is associated with by division.

book5_ch11_6_2	no label	Translating Words to Symbols Translating Words to Symbols Translating Words to Symbols Practical problems seldom, if ever, come in equation form. The job of the problem solver is to translate the problem from phrases and statements into mathematical expressions and equations, and then to solve the equations. As problem solvers, our job is made simpler if we are able to translate verbal phrases to mathematical expressions and if we follow the five-step method of solving applied problems. To help us translate from words to symbols, we can use the following Mathematics Dictionary. Table 11.2.

The problems we shall solve are intended as logic developers. Although they may not seem to reflect real situations, they do serve as a basis for solving more complex, real situation, applied problems. To solve problems algebraically, we will use the five-step method. Strategy for Reading Word Problems When solving mathematical word problems, you may wish to apply the following "reading strategy." Read the problem quickly to get a feel for the situation. Do not pay close attention to details. At the first reading, too much attention to details may be overwhelming and lead to confusion and discouragement. After the first, brief reading, read the problem carefully in phrases. Reading phrases introduces information more slowly and allows us to absorb and put together important information. We can look for the unknown quantity by reading one phrase at a time. Five-Step Method for Solving Word Problems Let (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Draw a picture if possible. Solve the equation. Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement, not equation, of the problem. Write a conclusion. If it has been your experience that word problems are difficult, then follow the five-step method carefully. Most people have trouble with word problems for two reasons: They are not able to translate the words to mathematical symbols. (See Section 11.5.) They neglect step 1. After working through the problem phrase by phrase, to become familiar with the situation, INTRODUCE A VARIABLE

book6_ch01_2_1	no label	Definition of Exponential Notation Definition of Exponential Notation Definition of Exponential Notation Exponential notation is a short way of writing the same number multiplied by itself many times. Exponential notation uses a superscript for the number of times the number is repeated. The superscript is placed on the number to be multiplied (the factor), and is written like a n where n is an integer and a can be any real number. a is called the base and n is called the exponent or power. The nth power of a is defined as: a n = 1⋅a⋅a⋅…⋅a (n times) with a multiplied by itself n times. The resulting value is called the argument. For example, instead of 5⋅5⋅5⋅5⋅5⋅5, we write 56 to show that the number 5 is multiplied by itself 6 times. 5 is the base, and 6 is the exponent or power. The result, 15625, is the argument. 56 is read as “five to the sixth power,” or more simply as “five to the sixth,” or “the sixth power of five.” Likewise 52 is 5⋅5 and 35 is 3⋅3⋅3⋅3⋅3. We will now have a closer look at writing numbers using exponential notation. When a whole number is raised to the second power, it is said to be squared. The number 52 can be read as 5 to the second power, or 5 to the second, or 5 squared. When a whole number is raised to the third power, it is said to be cubed. The number 53 can be read as 5 to the third power, or 5 to the third, or 5 cubed. When a whole number is raised to the power of 4 or higher, we simply say that the number is raised to that particular power. The number 58 can be read as 5 to the eighth power, or just 5 to the eighth. We can also define what it means if we have a negative index, -n. Then,    (n times) If n is an even integer, then a n will always be positive for any non-zero real number a. For example, although -2 is negative, ( − 2)2 = 1⋅ − 2⋅ − 2 = 4  is positive and so is . Examples, Exponential Notation Write the following multiplication using exponents: Example 1.1.  3 · 3  Since the factor 3 appears 2 times, we write this as 32    Example 1.2.  62 · 62 · 62 · 62 · 62 · 62 · 62 · 62 · 62  Since the factor 62 appears nine times, we write this as: 629 Expand each number (write without exponents): Example 1.3.  124.        The exponent 4 indicates that the base (12) is repeated 4 times, thus: 124 = 12 · 12 · 12 · 12    Example 1.4.  7063.   The exponent 3 indicates that the base (706) is repeated 3 times in a multiplication. 7063 = 706 · 706 · 706 Exercises, Exponential Notation Write each of the following using exponents: Exercise 1.2.1.

book6_ch01_2_4	no label	Laws of Exponents Laws of Exponents Laws of Exponents There are several laws we can use to make working with exponential numbers easier. We list all the laws here for easy reference. (1.1) a 0 = 1 (1.2) a m × a n = a m + n (1.3) (1.4) (1.5) (1.6) We explain each law in detail in the following sections. Exponential Law 1 Our definition of exponential notation shows that: , For example, . Note that the base must be a non-zero value. 00 is called an indeterminate number, and has no value. This is because 00 = 0/0. If one considers 0 = 0 × n (where n can be any number) then it follows that 0/0 = n, where n can be any number – meaning the value of 0/0 cannot be determined. Examples: Application using Exponential Law 1 Exponential Law 2 Our definition of exponential notation shows that: (1.7) That is:  (m times)   (n times)                  (m + n times)              For example: This simple law illustrates the reason exponentials were originally invented. In the days before calculators, all multiplication had to be done by hand with a pencil and a pad of paper. Multiplication takes a very long time to do and is very tedious. Adding numbers, however, is easy and quick. This law says that adding the exponents of two exponential numbers (of the same base) is the same as multiplying the two numbers together. This means that, for certain numbers, there is no need to actually multiply the numbers together in order to find their multiple. This saved mathematicians a lot of time. Examples: Application using Exponential Law 2 2x 3 y ⋅ 5x 2 y 7 = 10 x 5 y 8 23⋅24 = 27    (Note that the base (2) stays the same.) 3 ⋅ 3 2a ⋅ 3 2 = 3 2a + 3 Exponential Law 3 (1.8) We know from Law 2 that a m + n is base a multiplied by itself m times plus a multiplied by itself n times. Law 3 extends this to the case where an exponent is negative. By factoring out a n from both numerator and denominator, we are left with              (m – n times)      For example, Examples: Exponential Law 3    (Always give the final answer with a positive index) Exponential Law 4 (1.9) Our definition of exponential notation for a negative exponent shows that    (n times)                 The minus sign in the exponent is just another way of writing that the whole exponential number is to be divided instead of multiplied. For example, starting with Law 3, take the case of a m − n , but where n > m: Examples: Exponential Law 4 Exponential Law 5 (1.10) The order in which two real numbers are multiplied together does not matter. Therefore,     (n times)           (n times)  (n times)           For example: (1.11) Examples: Exponential Law 5 Exponential Law 6 (1.12) We can find the exponential of an exponential just as well as we can for a number, because an exponential is a real number.     (n times)                (m × n times)           For example: (1.13) Examples: Exponential Law 6

The grouping symbols commonly used in mathematics are the following: Parentheses:  (   ) Brackets:     [   ] Braces:       {   } Bar:           — In a computation in which more than one operation is involved, grouping symbols indicate which operation to perform first. If possible, we perform operations inside grouping symbols first. For example: (5 · 5) + 20 = 45 whereas: 5 · (5 + 20) = 125 If there are no parentheses, you should always do multiplications and divisions first followed by additions and subtractions. You can always put your own parentheses into equations using this rule to make things easier for yourself, for example: (1.14) Grouping Symbols Examples If possible, determine the value of each of the following. Example 1 9 + (3 · 8) Since 3 and 8 are within parentheses, they are to be combined first: = 9 + 24 Then add the terms: = 33 Thus, 9 + (3 · 8) = 33. Example 2 (10 ÷ 0) · 6 Since (10 ÷ 0) is undefined, this operation is meaningless, and we attach no value to it.

book6_ch01_3_10	no label	Order of Operations Order of Operations Order of Operations Sometimes there are no grouping symbols indicating which operations to perform first. For example, suppose we wish to find the value of 3 + 5⋅ 2. We could do either of two things: Add 3 and 5, then multiply this sum by 2.   Multiply 5 and 2, then add 3 to this product.   We now have two values for the same expression. We need a set of rules to guide anyone to one unique value for this kind of expression. Some of these rules are based on convention, while other are forced on up by mathematical logic. The universally agreed-upon accepted order of operations for evaluating a mathematical expression is as follows: 1. Parentheses (grouping symbols) from the inside out. By parentheses we mean anything that acts as a grouping symbol, including anything inside symbols such as [  ], {  }, |  |, and . Any expression in the numerator or denominator of a fraction or in an exponent is also considered grouped, and should be simplified before carrying out further operations. If there are nested parentheses (parentheses inside parentheses), you work from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Exponents and other special functions, such as log, sin, cos etc. 3. Multiplications and divisions, from left to right. 4. Additions and subtractions, from left to right. For example, given: 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 22+3 The exponent is an implied grouping, so the 2+3 must be evaluated first:  = 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 25 Now the exponent is carried out:  = 3 +15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 32 Then the multiplication and division, left to right using 15 ÷ 3 = 5 and 5 × 32 = 160:  = 3 + 5 + 160 Finally, the addition, left to right:  = 168 Examples, Order of Operation Determine the value of each of the following. Example 1.7.  21 + 3⋅12. Multiply first: = 21 + 36 Add. = 57    Example 1.8.  (15 − 8) + 5(6 + 4).

book6_ch02_2_2	no label	Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Geometric Definition of Absolute Value The absolute value of a number a, denoted ∣ a ∣ , is the distance from that number to the origin (zero) on the number line. Absolute value answers the question of “how far,” not “which way.” That distance is always given as a nonnegative number. In short: If a number is positive (or zero), the absolute value function does nothing to it: ∣ 3 ∣ = 3 If a number is negative, the absolute value function makes it positive: ∣ − 3 ∣ = 3 WARNING: If there is arithmetic to do inside the absolute value function, you must do it before taking the absolute value—the absolute value function acts on the result of whatever is inside it. For example, a common error is ∣ 5 + ( − 2) ∣ = 5 + 2 = 7 (Wrong!) The mistake here is in assuming that the absolute value makes everything inside it positive. This is not true. It only makes the result positive. The correct result is ∣ 5 + ( − 2) ∣ = ∣ 3 ∣ = 3 (Correct) Examples Determine each value. ∣ 4 ∣ = __ The answer is 4: Figure 2.1.  ∣ − 4 ∣ = __ The answer is 4: Figure 2.2.  ∣ 0 ∣ = __ The answer is 0. − ∣ 5 ∣ = __ The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as “negative the absolute value of 5.” The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence, negative the absolute value of 5 is −5. − ∣ − 3 ∣ = __ The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as “negative the absolute value of −3.” The absolute value of −3 is 3. Hence, negative the absolute value of −3 is −(3) = −3. Geometric Absolute Value Exercises By reasoning geometrically, determine each absolute value. Exercise 2.2.1.

book6_ch02_2_5	no label	Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value From the preceding exercises, we can suggest the following algebraic definition of absolute value. Note that the definition has two parts. The absolute value of a number a is Figure 2.3.  The algebraic definition takes into account the fact that the number a could be positive or zero (a ≥ 0) or negative (a < 0). If the number a is positive or zero (a ≥ 0), the first part of the definition applies. The first part of the definition tells us that, if the number enclosed in the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, the absolute value of the number is the number itself. The second part of the definition tells us that, if the number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a negative number, the absolute value of the number is the opposite of the number. The opposite of a negative number is a positive number. Note The definition says that the vertical absolute value lines may be eliminated only if we know whether the number inside is positive or negative. Examples Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values. ∣ 8 ∣ = __ The number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, so the first part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of 8 is 8 itself. ∣ 8 ∣ = 8 ∣ − 3 ∣ = __ The number enclosed within absolute value bars is a negative number, so the second part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of −3 is the opposite of −3, which is −(−3). By the definition of absolute value and the double-negative property, ∣ − 3 ∣ = −(−3) = 3 Algebraic Absolute Value Exercises Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values. Exercise 2.2.7. (Go to Solution) ∣ 7 ∣ = __ Exercise 2.2.8. (Go to Solution) ∣ 9 ∣ = __ Exercise 2.2.9. (Go to Solution) ∣ − 12 ∣ = __ Exercise 2.2.10. (Go to Solution) ∣ − 5 ∣ = __ Exercise 2.2.11.

To see why this rule makes sense, let’s consider the problem of adding a quarter and a dime. A quarter is of a dollar. A dime is of a dollar. We know that 1 quarter + 1 dime = 35 cents. How do we get to this answer by adding and ? We convert them to quantities of the same denomination. A quarter is equivalent to 25 cents, or . A dime is equivalent to 10 cents, or . By converting them to quantities of the same denomination, we can add them easily: + = . Same denomination → same denominator If the denominators are not the same, make them the same by building up the fractions so that they both have a common denominator. A common denominator can always be found by multiplying all the denominators, but it is not necessarily the Least Common Denominator. 
book6_ch03_1_8	no label	Least Common Denominator (LCD) Least Common Denominator (LCD) Least Common Denominator (LCD) The LCD is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all the denominators. It is the least common multiple of the denominators. The LCD is the product of all the prime factors of all the denominators, each factor taken the greatest number of times that it appears in any single denominator. Finding the LCD Example 3.7.  Find the sum of these unlike fractions. + Factor the denominators: 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 15 = 3 × 5 What is the greatest number of times the prime factor 2 appear in any single denominator? Answer: 2 times. That is the number of times the prime factor 2 will appear as a factor in the LCD. What is the greatest number of times the prime factor 3 appear in any single denominator? Answer: 1 time. That is the number of times the prime factor 3 will appear as a factor in the LCD. What is the greatest number of times the prime factor 5 appear in any single denominator? Answer: 1 time. That is the number of times the prime factor 5 will appear as a factor in the LCD. So we assemble the LCD by multiplying each prime factor by the number of times it appears in a single denominator, or: 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60 60 is the Least Common Denominator (the Least Common Multiple of 12 and 15). Building up the Fractions To create fractions with like denominators, we now multiply the numerators by whatever factors are missing when we compare the original denominator to the new LCD. Example 3.8.  In the fraction , we multiply the denominator 12 by 5 to get the LCD of 60. Therefore we multiply the numerator 1 by the same factor (5). × = Similarly, × = Adding the Built Up Fractions Example 3.9.  We can now add the two fractions because they have like denominators: + = Reduce the result: = Adding and Subtracting Fractions with Unlike Denominators - Exercises Find the following sums and differences.
