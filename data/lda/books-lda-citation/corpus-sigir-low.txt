1571943	From networks to human behavior Highly interconnected networks with amazingly complex topology describe systems as diverse as the World Wide Web, our cells, social systems or the economy. Recent studies indicate that these networks are the result of self-organizing processes governed by simple but generic laws, resulting in architectural features that makes them much more similar to each other than one would have expected by chance. I will discuss the amazing order characterizing our interconnected world and its implications to network robustness and spreading processes. Finally, most of these networks are driven by the temporal patterns characterizing human activity. I will use communication and web browsing data to show that there is deep order in the temporal domain of human dynamics, and discuss the different ways to understand and model the emerging patterns.
1571958	Web derived pronunciations for spoken term detection Indexing and retrieval of speech content in various forms such as broadcast news, customer care data and on-line media has gained a lot of interest for a wide range of applications, from customer analytics to on-line media search. For most retrieval applications, the speech content is typically first converted to a lexical or phonetic representation using automatic speech recognition (ASR). The first step in searching through indexes built on these representations is the generation of pronunciations for named entities and foreign language query terms. This paper summarizes the results of the work conducted during the 2008 JHU Summer Workshop by the Multilingual Spoken Term Detection team, on mining the web for pronunciations and analyzing their impact on spoken term detection. We will first present methods to use the vast amount of pronunciation information available on the Web, in the form of IPA and ad-hoc transcriptions. We describe techniques for extracting candidate pronunciations from Web pages and associating them with orthographic words, filtering out poorly extracted pronunciations, normalizing IPA pronunciations to better conform to a common transcription standard, and generating phonemic representations from ad-hoc transcriptions. We then present an analysis of the effectiveness of using these pronunciations to represent Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) query terms on the performance of a spoken term detection (STD) system. We will provide comparisons of Web pronunciations against automated techniques for pronunciation generation as well as pronunciations generated by human experts. Our results cover a range of speech indexes based on lattices, confusion networks and one-best transcriptions at both word and word fragments levels.

1571999	A probabilistic topic-based ranking framework for location-sensitive domain information retrieval It has been observed that many queries submitted to search engines are location-sensitive. Traditional search techniques fail to interpret the significance of such geographical clues and as such are unable to return highly relevant search results. Although there have been efforts in the literature to support location-aware information retrieval, critical challenges still remain in terms of search result quality and data scalability. In this paper, we propose an innovative probabilistic ranking framework for domain information retrieval where users are interested in a set of location-sensitive topics. Our proposed method recognizes the geographical distribution of topic influence in the process of ranking documents and models it accurately using probabilistic Gaussian Process classifiers. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking framework by implementing it in a Web search service for NBA news. Extensive performance evaluation is performed on real Web document collections, which confirms that our proposed mechanism works significantly better (around 29.7% averagely using DCG20 measure) than other popular location-aware information retrieval techniques in ranking quality.
1572035	Leveraging sources of collective wisdom on the web for discovering technology synergies One of the central tasks of R&D strategy and portfolio management at large technology companies and research institutions refers to the identification of technological synergies throughout the organization. These efforts are geared towards saving resources by consolidating scattered expertise, sharing best practices, and reusing available technologies across multiple product lines. In the past, this task has been done in a manual evaluation process by technical domain experts. While feasible, the major drawback of this approach is the enormous effort in terms of availability and time: For a structured and complete analysis every combination of any two technologies has to be rated explicitly. We present a novel approach that recommends technological synergies in an automated fashion, making use of abundant collective wisdom from the Web, both in pure textual form as well as classification ontologies. Our method has been deployed for practical support of the synergy evaluation process within our company. We have also conducted empirical evaluations based on randomly selected technology pairs so as to benchmark the accuracy of our approach, as compared to a group of general computer science technologists as well as a control group of domain experts.
1572045	Spam filter evaluation with imprecise ground truth When trained and evaluated on accurately labeled datasets, online email spam filters are remarkably effective, achieving error rates an order of magnitude better than classifiers in similar applications. But labels acquired from user feedback or third-party adjudication exhibit higher error rates than the best filters -- even filters trained using the same source of labels. It is appropriate to use naturally occuring labels -- including errors -- as training data in evaluating spam filters. Erroneous labels are problematic, however, when used as ground truth to measure filter effectiveness. Any measurement of the filter's error rate will be augmented and perhaps masked by the label error rate. Using two natural sources of labels, we demonstrate automatic and semi-automatic methods that reduce the influence of labeling errors on evaluation, yielding substantially more precise measurements of true filter error rates.
1572051	Annotation of URLs: more than the sum of parts Recently a number of studies have demonstrated that search engine logfiles are an important resource to determine the relevance relation between URLs and query terms. We hypothesized that the queries associated with a URL could also be presented as useful URL metadata in a search engine result list, e.g. for helping to determine the semantic category of a URL. We evaluated this hypothesis by a classification experiment based on the DMOZ dataset. Our method can also annotate URLs that have no associated queries.
1572052	Automatic URL completion and prediction using fuzzy type-ahead search Type-ahead search is a new information-access paradigm, in which systems can find answers to keyword queries "on-the-fly" as a user types in a query. It improves traditional autocomplete search by allowing query keywords to appear at different places in an answer. In this paper we study the problem of automatic URL completion and prediction using fuzzy type-ahead search. That is, we interactively find relevant URLs that contain words matching query keywords, even approximately, as the user types in a query. Supporting fuzzy search is very important when the user has limited knowledge about URLs. We describe the design and implementation of our method, and report the experimental results on Firefox.
1572053	Beyond session segmentation: predicting changes in search intent with client-side user interactions Effective search session segmentation "grouping queries according to common task or intent" can be useful for improving relevance, search evaluation, and query suggestion. Previous work has largely attempted to segment search sessions off-line, after the fact. In contrast, we present preliminary investigation of predicting, in real time, whether a user is about to switch interest - that is, whether the user is about to finish the current search and switch to another search task (or stop searching altogether). We explore an approach for this task using client-side user behavior such as clicks, scrolls, and mouse movements, contextualized by the content of the search result pages and previous searches. Our experiments over thousands of real searches show that we can identify context and user behavior patterns that indicate that a user is about to switch to a new search task. These preliminary results can be helpful for more effective query suggestion and personalization.
1572056	Characterizing the subjectivity of topics A document or web page in isolation may appear completely reasonable, but may represent a biased perspective on the topic being discussed. Given the topic of a document, we propose new metrics provocativeness and balance that suggest when the topic could be controversial. We explore the use of these metrics to characterize the subjectivity of the topics in the TREC Blog Track.
1572057	Classifying library catalogue by author profiling This paper presents a novel approach to classifying library records by making use of what we call "author profile," a representation of an author's expertise along a library classification. Coupled with a string kernel classifier, the idea is shown to bring a significant improvement over a baseline.
1572059	Comparing both relevance and robustness in selection of web ranking functions In commercial search engines, a ranking function is selected for deployment mainly by comparing the relevance measurements over candidates. In this paper we suggest to select Web ranking functions according to both their relevance and robustness to the changes that may lead to relevance degradation over time. We argue that the ranking robustness can be effectively measured by taking into account the ranking score distribution across Web pages. We then improve NDCG with two new metrics and show their superiority in terms of stability to ranking score turbulence and stability in function selection.
1572060	A comparison of retrieval-based hierarchical clustering approaches to person name disambiguation This paper describes a simple clustering approach to person name disambiguation of retrieved documents. The methods are based on standard IR concepts and do not require any task-specific features. We compare different term-weighting and indexing methods and evaluate their performance against the Web People Search task (WePS). Despite their simplicity these approaches achieve very competitive performance.
1572061	Compression-based document length prior for language models The inclusion of document length factors has been a major topic in the development of retrieval models. We believe that current models can be further improved by more refined estimations of the document's scope. In this poster we present a new document length prior that uses the size of the compressed document. This new prior is introduced in the context of Language Modeling with Dirichlet smoothing. The evaluation performed on several collections shows significant improvements in effectiveness.
1572062	Concept representation based video indexing This poster introduces a novel concept-based video indexing approach. It is developed based on a rich set of base concepts, of which the models are available. Then, for a given concept with several labeled samples, we combine the base concepts to fit it and its model can thus be obtained accordingly. Empirical results demonstrate that this method can achieve great performance even with very limited labeled data. We have compared different representation approaches including both sparse and non-sparse methods. Our conclusion is that the sparse method will lead to much better performance.
1572064	Counting ancestors to estimate authority The AncestorRank algorithm calculates an authority score by using just one characteristic of the web graph-the number of ancestors per node. For scalability, we estimate the number of ancestors by using a probabilistic counting algorithm. We also consider the case in which ancestors which are closer to the node have more influence than those farther from the node. Thus we further apply a decay factor delta on the contributions from successively earlier ancestors. The resulting authority score is used in combination with a content-based ranking algorithm. Our experiments show that as long as delta is in the range of [0.1, 0.9], AncestorRank can greatly improve BM25 performance, and in our experiments is often better than PageRank.
1572065	Cross language name matching Cross language information retrieval methods are used to determine which segments of Arabic language documents match name-based English queries. We investigate and contrast a word-based translation model with a character-based transliteration model in order to handle spelling variation and previously unseen names. We measure performance by making a novel use of the training data from the 2007 ACE Entity Translation
1572068	Enhancing topical ranking with preferences from click-through data To overcome the training data insufficiency problem for dedicated model in topical ranking, this paper proposes to utilize click-through data to improve learning. The efficacy of click-through data is explored under the framework of preference learning. The empirical experiment on a commercial search engine shows that, the model trained with the dedicated labeled data combined with skip-next preferences could beat the baseline model and the generic model in NDCG5 for 4.9% and 2.4% respectively.
1572069	Equivalence between nonnegative tensor factorization and tensorial probabilistic latent semantic analysis This paper establishes a connection between NMF and PLSA on multi-way data, called NTF and T-PLSA respectively. Two types of T-PLSA models are proven to be equivalent to non-negative PARAFAC and non-negative Tucker3. This paper also shows that by running NTF and T-PLSA alternatively, they can jump out of each other's local minima and achieve a better clustering solution.
1572076	Experiments in CLIR using fuzzy string search based on surface similarity Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) between languages of the same origin is an interesting topic of research. The similarity of the writing systems used for these languages can be used effectively to not only improve CLIR, but to overcome the problems of textual variations, textual errors, and even the lack of linguistic resources like stemmers to an extent. We have conducted CLIR experiments between three languages which use writing systems (scripts) of Brahmi-origin, namely Hindi, Bengali and Marathi. We found significant improvements for all the six language pairs using a method for fuzzy text search based on Surface Similarity. In this paper we report these results and compare them with a baseline CLIR system and a CLIR system that uses Scaled Edit Distance (SED) for fuzzy string matching.
1572077	Feature selection for automatic taxonomy induction Most existing automatic taxonomy induction systems exploit one or more features to induce a taxonomy; nevertheless there is no systematic study examining which are the best features for the task under various conditions. This paper studies the impact of using different features on taxonomy induction for different types of relations and for terms at different abstraction levels. The evaluation shows that different conditions need different technologies or different combination of the technologies. In particular, co-occurrence and lexico-syntactic patterns are good features for is-a, sibling and part-of relations; contextual, co-occurrence, patterns, and syntactic features work well for concrete terms; co-occurrence works well for abstract terms.
1572078	Finding advertising keywords on video scripts A key to success to contextual in-video advertising is finding advertising keywords on video contents effectively, but there has been little literature in the area so far. This paper presents some preliminary results of our learning-based system that finds relevant advertising keywords on particular scene of video contents using their scripts. The system is trained with not only features proven useful in earlier studies but novel features that reflect the situation of a targeted scene. Experimental results show that the new features are potentially helpful for enhancing the accuracy of keyword extraction for contextual in-video advertising.
1572079	Fitting score distribution for blog opinion retrieval Current blog opinion retrieval approaches cannot be applied if the topic relevance and opinion score distributions by rank are dissimilar. This problem severely limits the feasibility of these approaches. We propose to tackle this problem by fitting the distribution of opinion scores, which replaces the original topic relevance score distribution with the simulated one. Our proposed score distribution fitting method markedly enhances the feasibility of a state-of-the-art dictionary-based opinion retrieval approach. Evaluation on a standard TREC blog test collection shows significant improvements over high quality topic relevance baselines.
1572082	High precision retrieval using relevance-flow graph Traditional bag-of-words information retrieval models use aggregated term statistics to measure the relevance of documents, making it difficult to detect non-relevant documents that contain many query terms by chance or in the wrong context. In-depth document analysis is needed to filter out these deceptive documents. In this paper, we hypothesize that truly relevant documents have relevant sentences in predictable patterns. Our experimental results show that we can successfully identify and exploit these patterns to significantly improve retrieval precision at top ranks.
1572083	Identifying the original contribution of a document via language modeling One goal of text mining is to provide readers with automatic methods for quickly finding the key ideas in individual documents and whole corpora. To this effect, we propose a statistically well-founded method for identifying the original ideas that a document contributes to a corpus, focusing on self-referential diachronic corpora such as research publications, blogs, email, and news articles. Our statistical model of passage impact defines (interesting) original content through a combination of impact and novelty, and it can be used to identify the most original passages in a document. Unlike heuristic approaches, this statistical model is extensible and open to analysis. We evaluate the approach on both synthetic and real data, showing that the passage impact model outperforms a heuristic baseline method.
1572084	The importance of manual assessment in link discovery Using a ground truth extracted from the Wikipedia, and a ground truth created through manual assessment, we show that the apparent performance advantage seen in machine learning approaches to link discovery are an artifact of trivial links that are actively rejected by manual assessors.
1572086	Improving user confidence in cultural heritage aggregated results State of the art web search systems enable aggregation of information from many sources. Users are challenged to assess the reliability of information from different sources. We report on an empirical user study on the effect of displaying credibility ratings of multiple cultural heritage sources (e.g. museum websites, art blogs) on users' search performance and selection. The results of our online interactive study (N=122) show that when explicitly presenting these ratings, people become significantly more confident in their selection of information from aggregated results.
1572088	Integrating clusters created offline with query-specific clusters for document retrieval Previous work on cluster-based document retrieval has used either static document clusters that are created offline, or query-specific (dynamic) document clusters that are created from top-retrieved documents. We present the potential merit of integrating these two types of clusters.
1572089	Integrating phrase inseparability in phrase-based model In this paper, we propose a new phrase-based IR model, which integrates a measure of "inseparability" of phrases. Our experiments show its high potential to produce large improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
1572099	Modeling facial expressions and peripheral physiological signals to predict topical relevance By analyzing explicit & implicit feedback information retrieval systems can determine topical relevance and tailor search criteria to the user's needs. In this paper we investigate whether it is possible to infer what is relevant by observing user affective behaviour. The sensory data employed range between facial expressions and peripheral physiological signals. We extract a set of features from the signals and analyze the data using classification methods, such as SVM and KNN. The results of our initial evaluation indicate that prediction of relevance is possible, to a certain extent, and implicit feedback models can benefit from taking into account user affective behavior.
1572100	Modeling search response time Modeling the response time of search engines is an important task for many applications such as resource selection in federated text search. Limited research has been conducted to address this task. Prior research calculated the search response time of all queries in the same way either with the average response time of several sample queries or with a single probability distribution, which is irrelevant to the characteristics of queries. However, the search response time may vary a lot for different types of queries. This paper proposes a novel query-specific and source-specific approach to model search response time. Some training data is acquired by measuring the search response time of some sample queries from a search engine. Then, a query-specific model is estimated with the training data and their corresponding response times by utilizing Ridge Regression. The obtained model can be used to predict search response times for new queries. A set of empirical studies are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
1572101	Multiclass VisualRank: image ranking method in clustered subsets based on visual features This paper proposes Multiclass VisualRank, a method that expands the idea of VisualRank into more than one category of images. Multiclass VisualRank divides images retrieved from search engines into several categories based on distinctive patterns of visual features, and gives ranking within the category. Experimental results show that our method can extract several different image categories relevant to given keyword and gives good ranking scores to retrieved images.
1572107	On the relative age of spam and ham training samples for email filtering Email spam filters are commonly trained on a sample of spam and ham (non-spam) messages. We investigate the effect on filter performance of using samples of spam and ham messages sent months before those to be filtered. Our results show that filter performance deteriorates with the overall age of spam and ham samples, but at different rates. Spam and ham samples of different ages may be mixed to advantage, provided temporal cues are elided
1572109	Personalized music emotion recognition In recent years, there has been a dramatic proliferation of research on information retrieval based on highly subjective concepts such as emotion, preference and aesthetic. Such retrieval methods are fascinating but challenging since it is difficult to built a general retrieval model that performs equally well to everyone. In this paper, we propose two novel methods, bag-of-users model and residual modeling, to accommodate the individual differences for emotion-based music retrieval. The proposed methods are intuitive and generally applicable to other information retrieval tasks that involve subjective perception. Evaluation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
1572111	Protein identification as an information retrieval problem We present the first interdisciplinary work on transforming a popular problem in proteomics, i.e. protein identification from tandem mass spectra, to an Information Retrieval (IR) problem. We present an empirical comparison of popular IR approaches, such as those available from Indri and Lemur toolkits on benchmark datasets, to representative popular baselines in the proteomics literature. Our experiments demonstrate statistically significant evidence that popular IR approaches outperform representative baseline approaches in proteomics.
1572117	A relevance-based topic model for news event tracking Event tracking is the task of discovering temporal patterns of popular events from text streams. Existing approaches for event tracking have two limitations: scalability and inability to rule out non-relevant portions in text streams. In this study, we propose a novel approach to tackle these limitations. To demonstrate the approach, we track news events across a collection of weblogs spanning a two-month time period.
1572118	Revisiting logical imaging for information retrieval Retrieval with Logical Imaging is derived from belief revision and provides a novel mechanism for estimating the relevance of a document through logical implication (i.e. P(q->d). In this poster, we perform the first comprehensive evaluation of Logical Imaging (LI) in Information Retrieval (IR) across several TREC test Collections. When compared against standard baseline models, we show that LI fails to improve performance. This failure can be attributed to a nuance within the model that means non-relevant documents are promoted in the ranking, while relevant documents are demoted. This is an important contribution because it not only contextualizes the effectiveness of LI, but crucially explains why it fails. By addressing this nuance, future LI models could be significantly improved.
1572119	A robust retrieval system of polyphonic music based on chord progression similarity Retrieval systems for polyphonic music rely on the automatic estimation of similarity between two musical pieces. In the case of symbolic music, existing systems either consider a monophonic reduction based on melody or propose algorithms with high complexity. In this paper, we propose a new approach. Musical pieces are represented as a sequence of chords which are estimated from groups of notes sounding at the same time. A root and a mode are associated to each chord. Local alignment is then applied for estimating a similarity score between these sequences. Experiments performed on MIDI files collected on the Internet show that the system proposed allows the retrieval of different versions of the same song.
1572120	Score and rank convergence of HITS How many iterations does the (ever more) popular HITS algorithm require to converge in score and, perhaps more importantly, in rank (i.e. to get the nodes of a graph "in the right order")? After pinning down the elusive notion of convergence in rank we provide the first non-trivial bounds on the convergence of HITS. A "worst case" example, requiring a number of iterations superexponential in the size of the target graph to achieve even "mild" convergence, suggests the need for greater caution in the experimental evaluation of the algorithm - as recent results of poor performance (e.g. vs. SALSA) might be due to insufficient iterations, rather than to an intrinsic deficiency of HITS. An almost matching upper bound shows that, as long as one employs exponential acceleration e.g. through a "squaring trick", a polynomial running time (practical in many application domains) always provides strong convergence guarantees.
1572121	A search engine in a few lines.: yes, we can! Many research implementations of search engines are written in C, C++, or Java. They are difficult to understand and modify because they are at least a few thousand lines of code and contain many low-level details. In this paper, we show how to achieve a much shorter and higher level implementation: one in about a few hundred lines. We accomplish this result through the use of a high-level functional programming language, F#, and some of its features such as sequences, pipes and structured input and output. By using a search engine implementation as a case study, we argue that functional programming fits the domain of Information Retrieval problems much better than imperative/OO languages like C++ and Java. Functional programming languages are ideal for rapid algorithm prototyping and data exploration in the field of Information Retrieval (IR). Additionally, our implementation can be used as case study in an IR course since it is a very high level, but nevertheless executable specification of a search engine.
1572123	Searching documentation using text, OCR, and image We describe a mixed-modality method to index and search software documentation in three ways: plain text, OCR text of embedded figures, and visual features of these figures. Using a corpus of 102 computer books with a total of 62,943 pages and 75,800 figures, we empirically demonstrate that our method achieves better precision/recall than do alternatives based on single modalities.
1572124	Selecting hierarchical clustering cut points for web person-name disambiguation Hierarchical clustering is often used to cluster person-names referring to the same entities. Since the correct number of clusters for a given person-name is not known a priori, some way of deciding where to cut the resulting dendrogram to balance risks of over- or under-clustering is needed. This paper reports on experiments in which outcome-specific and result-set measures are used to learn a global similarity threshold. Results on the Web People Search (WePS)-2 task indicate that approximately 85% of the optimal F1 measure can be achieved on held-out data.
1572126	Spoken information retrieval for turkish broadcast news Speech Retrieval systems utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) to generate textual data for indexing. However, automatic transcriptions include errors, either because of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or due to ASR inaccuracy. In this work, we address spoken information retrieval in Turkish, a morphologically rich language where OOV rates are high. We apply several techniques, such as using subword units and indexing alternative hypotheses, to cope with the OOV problem and ASR inaccuracy. Experiments are performed on our Turkish Broadcast News (BN) Corpus which also incorporates a spoken IR collection. Results indicate that word segmentation is quite useful but the efficiency of indexing alternative hypotheses depends on retrieval type.
1572128	SugarCube: quantification of topic propagation in the blogosphere using percolation theory Blogs facilitate online debates and discussions for millions of people around the world. Identifying the most popular and prevailing topics discussed in the Blogosphere is a crucial task. This poster describes our novel approach to the quantification of the level of topic propagation in the Blogosphere. Our model uses graph-theoretic representations of the Blogosphere's link structures that allows it to deduce the `Percolation Threshold', which is then used in the quantification and definition of a global topic. The result of our experiments on a blog collection shows that our model is able to quantify the propagation of topics. Moreover, our model is successful in identifying specific topics that propagate throughout the Blogosphere and classifies them as `Global'.
1572129	System scoring using partial prior information We introduce smoothing of retrieval effectiveness scores, which balances results from prior incomplete query sets against limited additional complete information, in order to obtain more refined system orderings than would be possible on the new queries alone.
1572130	Tag-based object similarity computation using term space dimension reduction In this paper, we propose a novel approach for measuring similarity between web objects. Our similarity measure is defined based on the representation of a web object as a collection of tags. Precisely, we first construct a vector space in which multiple terms are mapped into a single dimension by using information available from Open Directory Project and Delicious.com. Then we position web objects in the vector space and apply the traditional cosine measure for similarity computation. We demonstrate that the proposed similarity computation method is able to overcome the limitation of traditional vector space approach while at the same time require less computational cost compares to LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).
1572131	Tagging products using image classification Associating labels with online products can be a labor-intensive task. We study the extent to which a standard "bag of visual words" image classifier can be used to tag products with useful information, such as whether a sneaker has laces or velcro straps. Using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) image descriptors at random keypoints, a hierarchical visual vocabulary, and a variant of nearest-neighbor classification, we achieve accuracies between 66% and 98% on 2- and 3-class classification tasks using several dozen training examples. We also increase accuracy by combining information from multiple views of the same product.
1572132	Template-independent wrapper for web forums This paper presents a novel work on the task of extracting data from Web forums. Millions of users contribute rich information to Web forum everyday, which has become an important resource for manyWeb applications, such as product opinion retrieval, social network analysis, and so on. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that it can not only extract the pure text but also distinguish between the original post and replies. Experimental results on a large number of real Web forums indicate that the proposed algorithm can correctly ex
1572134	Temporal query substitution for ad search Recently, information retrieval researchers have witnessed the increasing interest in query substitution for ad search. Most previous works substitute search queries via content based query similarities, and few of them take the temporal characteristics of queries into consideration. In this extended abstract, we propose a novel temporal similarity measurement for query substitution in ad search task. We firstly extract temporal features, such as burst and periodicity, from query frequency curves and then define the temporal query similarity by integrating these new features with the temporal query frequency distribution. Compared to the traditional temporal similarity measurements such as correlation coefficient, our proposed approach is more effective owing to the explicit extraction of high-level semantic query temporal features for similarity measure. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed similarity measure can make the ads more relevant to user search queries compared to ad search without temporal features.
1572136	Topic (query) selection for IR evaluation The need for evaluating large amounts of topics (queries) makes IR evaluation an uneasy task. In this paper, we study a topic selection problem for IR evaluation. The selection criterion is based on the overall difficulty of the chosen set, as well as the uncertainty of the final IR metric applied to the systems. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that our approach helps to identify a set of topics that provides confident estimates of systems' performance while keeping the requirement of the query difficulty.
1572137	Topic prerogative feature selection using multiple query examples for automatic video retrieval Well acceptance of relevance feedback and collaborative systems has given the users to express their preferences in terms of multiple query examples. The technology devised to utilize these user preferences, is expected to mine the semantic knowledge embedded within these query examples. In this paper, we propose a video mining framework based on dynamic learning from queries, using a statistical model for topic prerogative feature selection. The proposed method is specifically designed for multiple query example scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been established with an extensive experimentation on TRECVid2007 data collection. The results reveal that our approach achieves a performance that is in par with the best results for this corpus without the requirement of any textual data.
1572141	Undergraduates' evaluations of assigned search topics This paper evaluates undergraduate students' knowledge, interests and experiences with 20 topics from the TREC Robust Track collection. The goal is to characterize these topics along several dimensions to help researchers make more informed decisions about which topics are most appropriate to use in experimental IIR evaluations with undergraduate student subjects.
1572142	A unified inverted index for an efficient image and text retrieval We present an efficient method for approximate search in a combination of several metric spaces -- which are a generalization of low level image features -- using an inverted index. Our approximation gives very high recall with subsecond response time on a real data set of one million images extracted from Flickr. We further exploit the inverted index to improve efficiency of the query processing by combining our search in metric features with search in associated textual metadata.
1572144	User-centric multi-criteria information retrieval Information retrieval models usually represent content only, and not other considerations, such as authority, cost, and recency. How could multiple criteria be utilized in information retrieval, and how would it effect the results? In our experiments, using multiple user-centric criteria always produced better results than a single criteria.
1572145	Users' stopping behaviors and estimates of recall This paper investigates subjects' stopping behaviors and estimates of recall in an interactive information retrieval (IIR) experiment. Subjects completed four recall-oriented search tasks and were asked to estimate how many of the relevant documents they believed they had found after each task. Subjects also responded to an interview question probing their reasons for stopping a search. Results show that most subjects believed they found about 51-60% of the relevant documents and that this estimate was correlated positively with number of documents saved and actual recall, even though subjects' recall estimates were inaccurate. Reasons given for stopping search are also explored.
1572148	Visualizing the problems with the INEX topics Topics form a crucial component of a test collection. We show, through visualization, that the INEX 2008 topics have shortcomings, which questions their validity for evaluating XML retrieval effectiveness.
1572149	What queries are likely to recur in web search? We study the recurrence dynamics of queries in Web search by analysing a large real-world query log dataset. We find that query frequency is more useful in predicting collective query recurrence whereas query recency is more useful in predicting individual query recurrence. Our findings provide valuable insights for understanding and improving Web search.

1572159	Accommodating colorblind users in image search There are about 8% of men and 0.8% of women suffering from colorblindness. Due to certain loss of color information, the existing image search techniques may not provide satisfactory results for these users. In this demonstration, we show an image search system that can accommodate colorblind users. It can help these special users find and enjoy what they want by providing multiple services for them, including search results reranking, image recoloring and color indication.

1572168	Toponym ambiguity in geographical information retrieval The objectives of this research work is to study the effects of toponym (place name) ambiguity in the Geographical Information Retrieval (GIR) task. Our experience with GIR systems shows that toponym ambiguity may be an important factor in the inability of these systems to take advantage from geographical knowledge. Previous studies over ambiguity and Information Retrieval (IR) suggested that disambiguation may be useful in some specific IR scenario. We suppose that GIR may constitute such a scenario. This preliminary study was carried out over the WordNet based, manually disambiguated collection developed for the CLIR-WSD task, using the GeoCLEF collection of 100 geographically related topics. The employed GIR system was based on the GeoWorSE system that participated in GeoCLEF 2008. The experiments were carried out considering the manual disambiguation and comparing this result with those obtained by randomly disambiguating the document collection and those obtained by using always the most common referent. The obtained results show no significant difference in the overall results, although the work gave an insight into some errors that are produced by toponym ambiguity and how they may affect the results. These preliminary results also suggest that WordNet is not a suitable resource for the planned research.
1572169	Exploiting temporal information in retrieval of archived documents In a text retrieval community, many researchers have shown a good quality of searching a current snapshot of the Web. However, only a small number have demonstrated a good quality of searching a long-term archival domain, where documents are preserved for a long time, i.e., ten years or more. In such a domain, a search application is not only applicable for archivists or historians, but also in a context of national library and enterprise search (searching document repositories, emails, etc.). In the rest of this paper, we will explain three problems of searching document archives and propose possible approaches to solve these problems. Our main research question is: How to improve the quality of search in a document archive using temporal information?
1572170	Using document structure for automatic summarization An abstract is not available.
1572171	Topic structure for information retrieval In my research, I propose a coherence measure, with the goal of discovering and using topic structures within and between documents, of which I explore its extensions and applications in information retrieval.
1572172	Using computational community interest as an indicator for ranking Ranking documents in response to users' information needs is a challenging task, due, in part, to the dynamic nature of users' interests with respect to a query. I hypothesize that the interests of a given user are similar to the interests of the broader community of which he is a part and propose an innovative method that uses social media to characterize the interests of the community and use this characterization to improve future rankings. By generating a community interest vector (CIV) for a given query, we use community interest to alter the ranking score of individual documents retrieved by the query. The CIV is based on a continuously updated set of recent (daily or past few hours) user-oriented text data. The user-oriented data can be user blogs or user comment tagged news. Preliminary evaluation shows that the new ranking method significantly improves ranking performance.

1572174	A study on performance volatility in information retrieval A common practice in comparative evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is to create a test collection comprising a set of topics (queries), a document corpus, and relevance judgments, and to monitor the performance of retrieval systems over such a collection. A typical evaluation of a system involves computing a performance metric, e.g., Average Precision (AP), for each topic and then using the average performance metric, e.g., Mean Average Precision (MAP) to express the overall system performance. However, averages do not capture all the important aspects of system performance, and used alone may not thoroughly express system effectiveness, i.e., average of performance can mask large variance in individual topic effectiveness. The author hypothesis is that, in addition to the average of overall performance, attention needs to be paid to how a system performance varies across topics. This variability can be measured by calculating the standard deviation (SD) of individual performance scores. We refer to this performance variation as Volatility.

1572176	Personalizing information retrieval using task features, topic knowledge, and task product Personalization of information retrieval tailors search towards individual users to meet their particular information needs. Personalization systems obtain additional information about users and their contexts beyond the queries they submit to the systems, and use this information to bring the desired documents to top ranks. The additional information can come from various sources: user preferences, user behaviors, contexts, etc. [1] To avoid users taking extra effort in providing explicit preferences, most personalization approaches have adopted an implicit strategy to obtain users' interests from their behaviors and/or contexts, such as query history, browsing history, and so on. Task, topic knowledge, and desktop information have been used as evidence for personalization. Tailoring display time threshold based on task information was found to improve implicit relevance feedback performance [5]. User's familiarity with search topics was found to be positively correlated with reading time but negatively correlated with search efficacy [3]. This indicated the possibility of inferring topic familiarity from searching behavior. Desktop information was also found to be a good source for personalization [2, 4], and personalization using only those files relevant to user queries are more effective than using the entire desktop data [2]. Since search often happens in a work task environment, we examine how user-generated products and retained documents can help improve search performance. To these ends, this study looks at how the following factors can help personalize search: features of user's work tasks (including task stage and task type), user's familiarity with work task topic, user's saving and using behaviors, and task product(s) that the user generated for the work task. Work tasks are designed to include multiple sub-tasks, each being a stage. Two types of sub-task interdependence are considered: parallel, where the sub-tasks do not depend upon each other, or dependent, where one sub-task depends upon the accomplishment of other sub-task(s). The study examines the interaction effects of these factors, dwell time, and document usefulness. It also looks at a personalization technique that extracts terms for query expansion from work task product(s) and user behaviors. There are three research questions: RQ1: Does the stage of the user's task help predict document usefulness from dwell time in the parallel and the dependent tasks, respectively? RQ2. Does the user's familiarity with work task topic help predict document usefulness from dwell time in the parallel and the dependent tasks, respectively? RQ3. Do user's task product(s) and saving and using behaviors help with query disambiguation? Twenty-four participants are recruited, each coming three times (as three experiment sessions) to a usability laboratory working on three sub-tasks in a general task, either a parallel or a dependent. Take the parallel task as an example. It asks the participants to write a three-section article on hybrid cars, and each section is finished in one session. The three sections focus on Honda Civic sedan hybrid, Nissan Altima sedan hybrid, and Toyota Camry sedan hybrid, respectively. When searching for information, half of the participants use a query expansion condition, where the system recommends search terms based on their work in previous sessions, and the other half use a non-query expansion system condition. Data are collected by three major means: logging software that records user-system interactions, an eye tracker that records eye movement, and questionnaires that elicit users' background information and their perceptions on a number of aspects. The results will provide new evidence on personalizing search by taking account of the examined contextual factors.
1572177	Exploiting memory cues in personal lifelog retrieval In recent years personal lifelogs (PLs) have become an emerging field of research. PLs are collections of digital data taken from an individual's life experiences, gathered from both digital and physical worlds. PLs collections can potentially be collected over periods of years and thus can be very large. In our research group, four researchers have been engaged in collection of individual one-year-long PLs data sets. These collections include logs of computer and mobile phone activities, digital photos, in particular passively captured Microsoft SenseCam images, geo-location (via GPS), surrounding people or objects (via Bluetooth), and various biometric data. The complex data types and heterogeneous structure of this corpus brings great challenges to traditional content based information retrieval (IR). Yet, the rich connections integral to personal experience offer exciting potential opportunities to leverage features from human memory and associated models to support retrieval. My PhD project aims to develop an interface to assist IR from PLs. In doing this I plan to exploit features in human memory, in particular the mechanisms in associative memory models. Previous studies in personal information re-finding have explored the use of generally well-remembered attributes or metadata of the search targets, such as date, item type/format, authors of documents [1]. There have also been systems which utilize associated computer items or real life events (e.g. [2, 3]) to assist re-finding tasks. However, few of them looked into exactly what types of associated items/events people tend to recall. I plan to explore associations among PL items, as well as their attributes regarding their role in an individual's memory, since I believe that some associations and types of metadata which are available and feasible for use, may have been omitted in existing systems; due to the methods used in previous research where the users' behaviour may have been guided by the searching or management tools available to them. As indicated by some information seeking studies (e.g. [4]), different search context, search motivation, or personal differences such as habits, may lead to varied recall of contents and information seeking behaviours. For this reason, I will also investigate: the influences on personal information re-finding behaviour of context, lifestyle, and differences in prior personal experiences of IR tools. Results from these studies will be used to explore personalisation in search, e.g. to dynamically increase the importance of geo-location in scoring of search results for subjects who travel frequently. As indicated by [4], people tend to make small steps to approach the targets they are looking for, rather than trying to do this in a single search with a "perfect query" comprising all of the relevant details, partially because of their trouble in recalling them. To relieve users from the heavy cognitive burden of recalling the exact target, and on the other hand to reduce the rate of inaccurate queries caused by false recall, my proposed interface will be based on browsing and recognizing, instead of traditional recalling and searching. For example, a user will be able to browse and narrow results by recognizing landmarks and estimating the target activities' time range from the user's digital or physical life [5]. An important issue in my work will be to consider the challenges of evaluating my work with only a very limited number of PL datasets. To partially address this issue, I am currently in engaged in a number of smaller scale diary studies of searching experiences for larger numbers of subjects.
160700	Analysis of multiterm queries in a dynamic signature file organization Our analysis combines the concerns of signature extraction and signature file organization which have usually been treated as separate issues. We also relax the uniform frequency and single term query assumptions and provide a comprehensive analysis for multiterm query environments where terms can be classified based on their query and database occurrence frequencies. The performance of three superimposed signature generation schemes is explored as they are applied to one dynamic signature file organization based on linear hashing: Linear Hashing with Superimposed Signatures (LHSS). First scheme (SM) allows all terms set the same number of bits regardless of their discriminatory power whereas the second and third methods (MMS and MMM) emphasize the terms with high query and low database occurrence frequencies. Of these three schemes, only MMM takes the probability distribution of the number of query terms into account in finding the optimal mapping strategy. Derivation of performance evaluation formulas is provided together with the results of various experimental settings. Suggestions as to how to implement the given techniques in real life cases are also provided. Results indicate that MMM outperforms the other methods as the gap between the discriminatory power of the terms gets larger. The absolute value of the savings provided by MMM reach a maximum for the high query weight case. However, the extra savings decline sharply for high weight and moderately for the low weight queries with the increase in database size.
160704	Cluster analysis for hypertext systems Identifying nodes of information that are highly related has many applications in any information systems, and in particular in hypertext systems. In this paper we present a technique to identify “natural” clusters in a hypertext. A natural cluster is a cluster that is not arbitrary, but depends only on intrinsic properties of the hypertext. In our case, the property we will use to identify the clusters is the number of independent paths between nodes. Using the graph theoretic definition of k -edge-components we present an aggregation technique to cluster the nodes. We then use this techniques to cluster three medium sized hypertexts that were developed by different authors for different users, using different methodologies. We also show how to use clustering to improve data display, browsing and retrieval.
160706	Constant interaction-time scatter/gather browsing of very large document collections The Scatter/Gather document browsing method uses fast document clustering to produce table-of-contents-like outlines of large document collections. Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections. However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection. We present a scheme that supports constant interaction-time Scatter/Gather of arbitrarily large collections after near-linear time preprocessing. This involves the construction of a cluster hierarchy . A modification of Scatter/Gather employing this scheme, and an example of its use over the Tipster collection are presented.
160708	Integrating a dynamic lexicon with a dynamic full-text retrieval system There has been a great deal of interest within the Information Retrieval community in evaluating the use of linguistic knowledge to improve the indexing and searching of textual databases. Such systems must often employ a lexicon to store information about the words and phrases comprising the application's domain. Unlike a static lexicon, a dynamic lexicon raises practical concerns about the coordination between the state of the lexicon and IR indexing schemes based on lexical knowledge. Additionally, it introduces a host of database management issues, many of which are similar to those found in the text databases as well. In this paper, we explore a range of system design and performance issues that arise when integrating a dynamic lexicon with a dynamic full-text information retrieval system. We observe that the principle of functional isolation argues against the use of language-dependent information in article indexes and favors the use of query-time strategies for applying lexical knowledge. We propose and evaluate a system architecture which embodies this principle. We also show how a storage and retrieval infrastructure based on Burkowski's [BURKOWSKI92] “containment model” abstraction can be employed to implement both the text retrieval and lexicon facilities required in an integrated system.
1835450	Is the cranfield paradigm outdated? An abstract is not available.
1835451	Refactoring the search problem The most common way of framing the search problem is as an exchange between a user and a database, where the user issues queries and the database replies with results that satisfy constraints imposed by the query but that also optimize some notion of relevance. There are several variations to this basic model that augment the dialogue between humans and machines through query refinement, relevance feedback, and other mechanism. However, rarely is this problem ever posed in a way in which the properties of the client and server are fundamentally different and in a way in which exploiting the differences can be used to yield substantially different experiences. I propose a reframing of the basic search problem which presupposes that servers are scalable on most dimensions but suffer from low communication latencies while clients have lower scalability but support vastly richer user interactions because of lower communication latencies. Framed in this manner, there is clear utility in refactoring the search problem so that user interactions are processed fluidly by a client while the server is relegated to pre-computing the properties of a result set that cannot be efficiently left to the client. I will demonstrate Pivot, an experimental client application that allows the user to visually interact with thousands of search results at once, while using facetted-based exploration in a zoomable interface. I will argue that the evolving structure of the Web will tend to push all IR-based applications in a similar direction, which has the algorithmic intelligence increasingly split between clients and servers. Put another way, my claim is that future clients will be neither thin nor dumb.
1835553	Content-enriched classifier for web video classification With the explosive growth of online videos, automatic real-time categorization of Web videos plays a key role for organizing, browsing and retrieving the huge amount of videos on the Web. Previous work shows that, in addition to text features, content features of videos are also useful for Web video classification. Unfortunately, extracting content features is computationally prohibitive for real-time video classification. In this paper we propose a novel video classification framework that is able to exploit both content and text features for video classification while avoiding the expensive computation of extracting content features at classification time. The main idea of our approach is to utilize the content features extracted from training data to enrich the text based semantic kernels, yielding content-enriched semantic kernels. The content-enriched semantic kernels enable to utilize both content and text features for classifying new videos without extracting their content features. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art video classification methods.
1835566	iCollaborate: harvesting value from enterprise web usage We are in a phase of 'Participatory Web' in which users add value' to the information on the web by publishing, tagging and sharing. The Participatory Web has enormous potential for an enterprise because unlike the users of the internet an enterprise is a community that shares common goals, assumptions, vocabulary and interest and has reliable user identification and mutual trust along with a central governance and incentives to collaborate. Everyday, the employees of an organization locate content relevant to their work on the web. Finding this information takes time, expertise and creativity, which costs an organization money. That is, the web pages employees find are knowledge assets owned by the enterprise. This investment in web-based knowledge assets is lost every time the enterprise fails to capture and reuse them. iCollaborate is tooled to capture user's web interaction, persist and analyze it, and feed that interaction back into the community - the enterprise.
1835567	Exploring desktop resources based on user activity analysis Relocation in personal desktop resources is an interesting and promising research topic. This demonstration illustrates a new perspective in exploring desktop resources to help users re-find expected data resources more effectively. Different from existing works, our prototype OrientSpace has two features: automatically extract and maintain user tasks to support task-based exploration, and support vague search by exploiting associations between desktop resources.

1835572	Suggesting related topics in web search Suggesting topics that are related to user's goal or interest is very important in web search. However, search engines today focus on suggesting mainly reformulations and lexical variants of the query mined from query logs. In this demonstration, we show a system that can suggest related topics for a query based on the top search results for the query. It can help users in exploring the topics related to their information need. The topic suggestion system can be integrated with any search engine or it can be easily installed on the client machine as a browser plugin.
1835573	Agro-Gator: digesting experts, logs, and N-grams As research includes more and larger user studies, a significant problem lies in combining the many types of data files into a single table suitable for analysis by common statistical tools. We have developed a data-aggregation tool that combines user logs, expert scoring, and task/session attributes. The tool also integrates the n-grams derived from a given sequence of actions in the user tasks. The tool provides a GUI for quick and easy configuration.
1835574	Medical search and classification tools for recommendation their patients' records from paper to computer, enormous amounts of electronic medical records (EMR) have become available for medical research. Some of the EMR data are well-structured, for which traditional database management systems can provide effective retrieval and management functions. However, most of the EMR data (such as progress notes and consultation letters) are in free text formats. How to effectively and efficiently retrieve and discover useful information from the vast amount of such semi-structured data is a challenge faced by medical professionals. Without proper tools, the rich information and knowledge buried in the medical health records are unavailable for clinical research and decision-making. The objective of our research is to develop text analytics tools that are capable of parsing clinical medical data so that predefined search subjects that correspond to a list of medical diagnoses can be extracted. In addition to this particular core functionality, it is also desired that several important assets should be present within the text-analytics tools in order to improve its overall ability to be used as recommendation tools. In this research, we work with research scientists at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) in Toronto and examine a number of techniques for structuring and processing free text documents in order to effectively and efficiently search and analyze vast amount of medical records. We implement several powerful medical text analytics tools for clinical data searching and classification. For data classification, our tools sort through a great amount of patientrecords to identify the likelihood of a patient having myocardial infarction (MI) or hypertension (HTN), and classify the patients accordingly. Our tools can also identify the likelihood of a patient being a smoker, previous smoker or non-smoker based on the text data of medical records.
1835575	Multilingual people search People Search is an important search service with multiple applications (eg. looking up a friend on Facebook, finding colleagues in corporate email directories etc). With the proportion of non-English users on a steady rise, people search services are being used by users from diverse language demographics. Users may issue name search queries against these directories in languages other than the language of the directory, in which case the present monolingual name search approaches will not work. In this demo, we present a Multilingual People Search system capable of performing fast name lookups on large user directories, independent of the directory language. Our system has applications in areas like social networking, enterprise search and email address book search.
1835578	Blog snippets: a comments-biased approach In the last years Blog Search has been a new exciting task in Information Retrieval. The presence of user generated information with valuable opinions makes this field of huge interest. In this poster we use part of this information, the readers' comments, to improve the quality of post snippets with the objective of enhancing the user access to the relevant posts in a result list. We propose a simple method for snippet generation based on sentence selection, using the comments to guide the selection process. We evaluated our approach with standard TREC methodology in the Blogs06 collection showing significant improvements up to 32% in terms of MAP over the baseline.
1835579	SIGIR: scholar vs. scholars' interpretation Google Scholar allows researchers to search through a free and extensive source of information on scientific publications. In this paper we show that within the limited context of SIGIR proceedings, the rankings created by Google Scholar are both significantly different and very negatively correlated with those of domain experts.
1835580	Effective query expansion with the resistance distance based term similarity metric In this paper, we define a new query expansion method that relies on term similarity metric derived from the electric resistance network. This proposed metric lets us measure the mutual relevancy in between terms and between their groups. This paper shows how to define this metric automatically from the document collection, and then apply it in query expansion for document retrieval tasks. The experiments show this method can be used to find good expansion terms of search queries and improve document retrieval performance on two TREC genomic track datasets.
1835581	A method to automatically construct a user knowledge model in a forum environment Having a mechanism to validate the opinions and to identify experts in a forum could help people to favor one opinion against another. To achieve this, some solutions have already been introduced, including social network analysis techniques and reputation modeling. However, neither of these solutions considers the users' knowledge to identify an expert. In this paper, a novel method is proposed which estimates users' knowledge based on the forum itself, and identifies the possible areas of expertise associated with each user.
1835583	Multi-modal query expansion for web video search Query expansion is an effective method to improve the usability of multimedia search. Most existing multimedia search engines are able to automatically expand a list of textual query terms based on text search techniques, which can be called textual query expansion (TQE). However, the annotations (title and tag) around web videos are generally noisier for text-only query expansion and search matching. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal query expansion (MMQE) framework for web video search to solve the issue. Compared with traditional methods, MMQE provides a more intuitive query suggestion by transforming tex-tual query to visual presentation based on visual clustering. Paral-lel to this, MMQE can enhance the process of search matching with strong pertinence of intent-specific query by joining textual, visual and social cues from both metadata and content of videos. Experimental results on real web videos from YouTube demon-strate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
1835584	Context aware query classification using dynamic query window and relationship net The context of the user queries, preceding a given query, is utilized to improve the effectiveness of query classification. Earlier efforts utilize fixed number of preceding queries to derive such context information. We propose and evaluate an approach (DQW) that identifies a set of unambiguous preceding queries in a dynamically determined window to utilize in classifying an ambiguous query. Furthermore, utilizing a relationship-net (R-net) that represents relationships among known categories, we improve the classification effectiveness for those ambiguous queries whose predicted category in this relationship-net is related to the category of a query within the window. Our results indicate that the hybrid approach (DQW+R-net) statistically significantly improves the Conditional Random Field (CRF) query classification approach when static query windowing and hierarchical taxonomy are used (SQW+Tax), in terms of precision (10.8%), recall (13.2%), and F1 measure (11.9%).
1835585	Predicting query potential for personalization, classification or regression? The goal of predicting query potential for personalization is to determine which queries can benefit from personalization. In this paper, we investigate which kind of strategy is better for this task: classification or regression. We quantify the potential benefits of personalizing search results using two implicit click-based measures: Click entropy and Potential@N. Meanwhile, queries are characterized by query features and history features. Then we build C-SVM classification model and epsilon-SVM regression model respectively according to these two measures. The experimental results show that the classification model is a better choice for predicting query potential for personalization.
1835586	The impact of collection size on relevance and diversity It has been observed that precision increases with collection size. One explanation could be that the redundancy of information increases, making it easier to find multiple documents conveying the same information. Arguably, a user has no interest in reading the same information over and over, but would prefer a set of diverse search results covering multiple aspects of the search topic. In this paper, we look at the impact of the collection size on the relevance and diversity of retrieval results by down-sampling the collection. Our main finding is that we can we can improve diversity by randomly removing the majority of the results--this will significantly reduce the redundancy and only marginally affect the subtopic coverage.
1835587	Spatial relationships in visual graph modeling for image categorization In this paper, a language model adapted to graph-based representation of image content is proposed and assessed. The full indexing and retrieval processes are evaluated on two different image corpora. We show that using the spatial relationships with graph model has a positive impact on the results of standard Language Model (LM) and outperforms the baseline built upon the current state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method.
1835589	Query recovery of short user queries: on query expansion with stopwords User queries to search engines are observed to predominantly contain inflected content words but lack stopwords and capitalization. Thus, they often resemble natural language queries after case folding and stopword removal. Query recovery aims to generate a linguistically well-formed query from a given user query as input to provide natural language processing tasks and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). The evaluation of query translation shows that translation scores (NIST and BLEU) decrease after case folding, stopword removal, and stemming. A baseline method for query recovery reconstructs capitalization and stopwords, which considerably increases translation scores and significantly increases mean average precision for a standard CLIR task.
1835590	Where to start filtering redundancy?: a cluster-based approach Novelty detection is a difficult task, particularly at sentence level. Most of the approaches proposed in the past consist of re-ordering all sentences following their novelty scores. However, this re-ordering has usually little value. In fact, a naive baseline with no novelty detection capabilities yields often better performance than any state-of-the-art novelty detection mechanism. We argue here that this is because current methods initiate too early the novelty detection process. When few sentences have been seen, it is unlikely that the user is negatively affected by redundancy. Therefore, re-ordering the first sentences may be harmful in terms of performance. We propose here a query-dependent method based on cluster analysis to determine where we must start filtering redundancy.
1835592	Robust music identification based on low-order zernike moment in the compressed domain In this paper, we devise a novel robust music identification algorithm utilizing compressed-domain audio Zernike moment adapted from image processing techniques as the pivotal feature. Audio fingerprint derived from this feature exhibits strong robustness against various audio signal distortions including the challenging pitch shifting and time-scale modification. Experiments show that in our test dataset composed of 1822 popular songs, a 5s music query example which might have been severely corrupted is still sufficient to identify its original near-duplicate copy, with more than 90% top five precision rate.
1835595	Multi-field learning for email spam filtering Through the investigation of email document structure, this paper proposes a multi-field learning (MFL) framework, which breaks the multi-field document Text Classification (TC) problem into several sub-document TC problems, and makes the final category prediction by weighted linear combination of several sub-document TC results. Many previous statistical TC algorithms can be easily rebuilt within the MFL framework via turning binary result to spamminess score, which is a real number and reflects the likelihood that the classified email is spam. The experimental results in the TREC spam track show that the performances of many TC algorithms can be improved within the MFL framework.
1835598	Semi-supervised spam filtering using aggressive consistency learning A graph based semi-supervised method for email spam filtering, based on the local and global consistency method, yields low error rates with very few labeled examples. The motivating application of this method is spam filters with access to very few labeled message. For example, during the initial deployment of a spam filter, only a handful of labeled examples are available but unlabeled examples are plentiful. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on TREC 2007 and CEAS 2008 email corpora. Our results compare favorably with the best-known methods, using as few as just two labeled examples: one spam and one non-spam.
1835599	Entropy descriptor for image classification This paper presents a novel entropy descriptor in the sense of geometric manifolds. With this descriptor, entropy cycles can be easily designed for image classification. Minimizing this entropy leads to an optimal entropy cycle where images are connected in the semantic order. During classification, the training step is to find an optimal entropy cycle in each class. In the test step, an unknown image is grouped into a class if the entropy increase as the result of inserting the image into the cycle of this class is relatively least. The proposed approach can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where images with same objects are taken in multiple views. Experimental results show that this entropy descriptor performs well in image classification and has potential in the image-based modeling retrieval.
1835600	Has portfolio theory got any principles? Recently, Portfolio Theory (PT) has been proposed for Information Retrieval. However, under non-trivial conditions PT violates the original Probability Ranking Principle (PRP). In this poster, we shall explore whether PT upholds a different ranking principle based on Quantum Theory, i.e. the Quantum Probability Ranking Principle (QPRP), and examine the relationship between this new model and the new ranking principle. We make a significant contribution to the theoretical development of PT and show that under certain circumstances PT upholds the QPRP, and thus guarantees an optimal ranking according to the QPRP. A practical implication of this finding is that the parameters of PT can be automatically estimated via the QPRP, instead of resorting to extensive parameter tuning.
1835601	Re-examination on lam% in spam filtering Logistic average misclassification percentage (lam%) is a key measure for the spam filtering performance. This paper demonstrates that a spam filter can achieve a perfect 0.00% in lam%, the minimal value in theory, by simply setting a biased threshold during the classifier modeling. At the same time, the overall classification performance reaches only a low accuracy. The result suggests that the role of lam% for spam filtering evaluation should be re-examined.
1835609	Cross-language retrieval using link-based language models We propose a cross-language retrieval model that is solely based on Wikipedia as a training corpus. The main contributions of our work are: 1. A translation model based on linked text in Wikipedia and a term weighting method associated with it. 2. A combination scheme to interpolate the link translation model with retrieval based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation. On the CLEF 2000 data we achieve improvement with respect to the best German-English system at the bilingual track (non-significant) and improvement against a baseline based on machine translation (significant).
1835611	On performance of topical opinion retrieval We investigate the effectiveness of both the standard evaluation measures and the opinion component for topical opinion retrieval. We analyze how relevance is affected by opinions by perturbing relevance ranking by the outcomes of opinion-only classifiers built by Monte Carlo sampling. Topical opinion rankings are obtained by either re-ranking or filtering the documents of a first-pass retrieval of topic relevance. The proposed approach establishes the correlation between the accuracy and the precision of the classifier and the performance of the topical opinion retrieval. Among other results, it is possible to assess the effectiveness of the opinion component by comparing the effectiveness of the relevance baseline with the topical opinion ranking.
1835612	Improving sentence retrieval with an importance prior The retrieval of sentences is a core task within Information Retrieval. In this poster we employ a Language Model that incorporates a prior which encodes the importance of sentences within the retrieval model. Then, in a set of comprehensive experiments using the TREC Novelty Tracks, we show that including this prior substantially improves retrieval effectiveness, and significantly outperforms the current state of the art in sentence retrieval.
1835618	MEMOSE: search engine for emotions in multimedia documents The MEMOSE (Media Emotion Search) system is a specialized search engine for fundamental emotions in all kinds of emotional-laden documents. We apply a controlled vocabulary for basic emotions, a slide control to adjust the intensities of the emotions and the approach of broad folksonomies. The paper describes the indexing and the retrieval tool of MEMOSE and results from its evaluation.
1835619	Hierarchical pitman-yor language model for information retrieval In this paper, we propose a new application of Bayesian language model based on Pitman-Yor process for information retrieval. This model is a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution. The Pitman-Yor process creates a power-law distribution which is one of the statistical properties of word frequency in natural language. Our experiments on Robust04 indicate that this model improves the document retrieval performance compared to the commonly used Dirichlet prior and absolute discounting smoothing techniques.
1835620	Entity summarization of news articles In this paper we study the problem of entity retrieval for news applications and the importance of the news trail history (i.e. past related articles) to determine the relevant entities in current articles. We construct a novel entity-labeled corpus with temporal information out of the TREC 2004 Novelty collection. We develop and evaluate several features, and show that an article's history can be exploited to improve its summarization.
1835622	Clicked phrase document expansion for sponsored search ad retrieval We present a document expansion approach that uses Conditional Random Field (CRF) segmentation to automatically extract salient phrases from ad titles. We then supplement the ad document with query segments that are probable translations of the document phrases, as learned from a large commercial search engine's click logs. Our approach provides a significant improvement in DCG and interpolated precision and recall on a large set of human labeled query-ad pairs.
1835624	Exploiting click-through data for entity retrieval We present an approach for answering Entity Retrieval queries using click-through information in query log data from a commercial Web search engine. We compare results using click graphs and session graphs and present an evaluation test set making use of Wikipedia "List of" pages.
1835625	Feature subset non-negative matrix factorization and its applications to document understanding In this paper, we propose feature subset non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which is an unsupervised approach to simultaneously cluster data points and select important features. We apply our proposed approach to various document understanding tasks including document clustering, summarization, and visualization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for these tasks.
1835629	Investigating the suboptimality and instability of pseudo-relevance feedback Although Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) techniques improve average retrieval performance at the price of high variance, not much is known about their optimality and the reasons for their instability. In this work, we study more than 800 topics from several test collections including the TREC Robust Track and show that PRF techniques are highly suboptimal, i.e. they do not make the fullest utilization of pseudo-relevant documents and under-perform. A careful selection of expansion terms from the pseudo-relevant document with the help of an oracle can actually improve retrieval performance dramatically (by > 60%). Further, we show that instability in PRF techniques is mainly due to wrong selection of expansion terms from the pseudo-relevant documents. Our findings emphasize the need to revisit the problem of term selection to make a break through in PRF.
1835630	From fusion to re-ranking: a semantic approach A number of works have shown that the aggregation of several Information Retrieval (IR) systems works better than each system working individually. Nevertheless, early investigation in the context of CLEF Robust-WSD task, in which semantics is involved, showed that aggregation strategies achieve only slight improvements. This paper proposes a re-ranking approach which relies on inter-document similarities. The novelty of our idea is twofold: the output of a semantic based IR system is exploited to re-weigh documents and a new strategy based on Semantic Vectors is used to compute inter-document similarities.
1835634	A stack decoder approach to approximate string matching We present a new efficient algorithm for top-N match retrieval of sequential patterns. Our approach is based on an incremental approximation of the string edit distance using index information and a stack based search. Our approach produces hypotheses with average edit error of about 0.29 edits from the optimal SED result while using only about 5% of the CPU computation.
1835636	Inferring user intent in web search by exploiting social annotations In this paper, we present a folksonomy-based approach for implicit user intent extraction during a Web search process. We present a number of result re-ranking techniques based on this representation that can be applied to any Web search engine. We perform a user experiment the results of which indicate that this type of representation is better at context extraction than using the actual textual content of the document.
1835638	A ranking approach to target detection for automatic link generation We focus on the task of target detection in automatic link generation with Wikipedia, i.e., given an N-gram in a snippet of text, find the relevant Wikipedia concepts that explain or provide background knowledge for it. We formulate the task as a ranking problem and investigate the effectiveness of learning to rank approaches and of the features that we use to rank the target concepts for a given N-gram. Our experiments show that learning to rank approaches outperform traditional binary classification approaches. Also, our proposed features are effective both in binary classification and learning to rank settings.
1835640	Using local precision to compare search engines in consumer health information retrieval We have conducted a user study to evaluate several generalist and health-specific search engines on health information retrieval. Users evaluated the relevance of the top 30 documents of 4 search engines in two different health information needs. We introduce the concepts of local and global precision and analyze how they affect the evaluation. Results show that Google surpasses the precision of all other engines, including the health-specific ones, and that precision differs with the type of clinical question and its medical specialty.
1835641	multi Searcher: can we support people to get information from text they can't read or understand? The goal of the proposed tool multi Searcher is to answer this research question: can we expect people to be able to get information from text in languages they can not read or understand? The proposed tool multi Searcher provides users with interactive contextual information that describes the translation in the user's own language so that the user has a certain degree of confidence about the translation. Therefore, the user is considered as an integral part of the retrieval process. The tool provides possibilities to interactively select relevant terms from contextual information in order to improve the translation and thus improve the cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR) process.
1835644	A framework for BM25F-based XML retrieval We evaluate a framework for BM25F-based XML element retrieval. The framework gathers contextual information associated with each XML element into an associated field, which we call a characteristic field . The contents of the element and the contents of the characteristic field are then treated as distinct fields for BM25F weighting purposes. Evidence supporting this framework is drawn from both our own experiments and experiments reported in related work.
1835647	Transitive history-based query disambiguation for query reformulation We present a probabilistic model of a user's search history and a target query reformulation. We derive a simple transitive similarity algorithm for disambiguating queries and improving history-based query reformulation accuracy. We compare the merits of this approach to other methods and present results on both examples assessed by human editors and on automatically-labeled click data.
1835649	Metrics for assessing sets of subtopics To evaluate the diversity of search results, test collections have been developed that identify multiple intents for each query. Intents are the different meanings or facets that should be covered in a search results list. This means that topic development involves proposing a set of intents for each query. We propose four measurable properties of query-to-intent mappings, allowing for more principled topic development for such test collections.
1835651	VisualSum: an interactive multi-document summarizationsystem using visualization Given a collection of documents, most of existing multidocument summarization methods automatically generate a static summary for all the users. However, different users may have different opinions on the documents, thus there is a necessity for improving users' interactions in the summarization process. In this paper, we propose an interactive document summarization system using information visualization techniques.
1835652	Web page publication time detection and its application for page rank Publication Time (P-time for short) of Web pages is often required in many application areas. In this paper, we address the issue of P-time detection and its application for page rank. We first propose an approach to extract P-time for a page with explicit P-time displayed on its body. We then present a method to infer P-time for a page without P-time. We further introduce a temporal sensitive page rank model using P-time. Experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform the baseline methods significantly.
1835654	Retrieval system evaluation: automatic evaluation versus incomplete judgments In information retrieval (IR), research aiming to reduce the cost of retrieval system evaluations has been conducted along two lines: (i) the evaluation of IR systems with reduced amounts of manual relevance assessments, and (ii) the fully automatic evaluation of IR systems, thus foregoing the need for manual assessments altogether. The proposed methods in both areas are commonly evaluated by comparing their performance estimates for a set of systems to a ground truth (provided for instance by evaluating the set of systems according to mean average precision). In contrast, in this poster we compare an automatic system evaluation approach directly to two evaluations based on incomplete manual relevance assessments. For the particular case of TREC's Million Query track, we show that the automatic evaluation leads to results which are highly correlated to those achieved by approaches relying on incomplete manual judgments.
1835655	Aspect presence verification conditional on other aspects I have shown that the presence of difficult query aspects that are revealed only implicitly (e.g. exploration, opposition, achievements, cooperation, risks) can be improved by taking advantage of the known presence of other, easier to verify query aspects. The approach proceeds by mining a large external corpus and results in substantial improvements in re-ranking the subset of the top retrieved documents.
1835656	The value of visual elements in web search We used eye-tracking equipment to observe 36 participants as they performed three search tasks using three graphically-enhanced web search interfaces (Kartoo, SearchMe and Viewzi). In this poster we describe findings of the study focusing on how the presentation of SERP results influences how the user scans and attends to the results, and the user satisfaction with these search engines.
1835657	Diversification of search results using webgraphs A set of words is often insufficient to express a user's information need. In order to account for various information needs associated with a query, diversification seems to be a reasonable strategy. By diversifying the result set, we increase the probability of results being relevant to the user's information needs when the given query is ambiguous. A diverse result set must contain a set of documents that cover various subtopics for a given query. We propose a graph based method which exploits the link structure of the web to return a ranked list that provides complete coverage for a query. Our method not only provides diversity to the results set, but also avoids excessive redundancy. Moreover, the probability of relevance of a document is conditioned on the documents that appear before it in the result list. We show the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with a query-likelihood model as the baseline.
1835658	Capturing page freshness for web search Freshness has been increasingly realized by commercial search engines as an important criteria for measuring the quality of search results. However, most information retrieval methods focus on the relevance of page content to given queries without considering the recency issue. In this work, we mine page freshness from web user maintenance activities and incorporate this feature into web search. We first quantify how fresh the web is over time from two distinct perspectives--the page itself and its in-linked pages--and then exploit a temporal correlation between two types of freshness measures to quantify the confidence of page freshness. Results demonstrate page freshness can be better quantified when combining with temporal freshness correlation. Experiments on a real-world archival web corpus show that incorporating the combined page freshness into the searching process can improve ranking performance significantly on both relevance and freshness.
1835659	S-PLASA+: adaptive sentiment analysis with application to sales performance prediction Analyzing the large volume of online reviews would produce useful knowledge that could be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. In particular, the sentiments expressed in the online reviews have been shown to be strongly correlated with the sales performance of products. In this paper, we present an adaptive sentiment analysis model called S-PLSA+, which aims to capture the hidden sentiment factors in the reviews with the capability to be incrementally updated as more data become available. We show how S-PLSA+ can be applied to sales performance prediction using an ARSA model developed in previous literature. A case study is conducted in the movie domain, and results from preliminary experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.
1835661	A two-stage model for blog feed search We consider blog feed search: identifying relevant blogs for a given topic. An individual's search behavior often involves a combination of exploratory behavior triggered by salient features of the information objects being examined plus goal-directed in-depth information seeking behavior. We present a two-stage blog feed search model that directly builds on this insight. We first rank blog posts for a given topic, and use their parent blogs as selection of blogs that we rank using a blog-based model.
1835664	Incorporating global information into named entity recognition systems using relational context The state-of-the-art in Named Entity Recognition relies on a combination of local features of the text and global knowledge to determine the types of the recognized entities. This is problematic in some cases, resulting in entities being classified as belonging to the wrong type. We show that using global information about the corpus improves the accuracy of type identification. We explore the notion of a global domain frequency that relates relation identifying terms with pairs of entity types which are used in that relation. We use this to identify entities whose types are not compatible with the terms they co-occur in the text. Our results on a large corpus of social media content allows the identification of mistyped entities with 70% accuracy.
1835665	Achieving high accuracy retrieval using intra-document term ranking Most traditional ranking models roughly score the relevance of a given document by observing simple term statistics, such as the occurrence of query terms within the document or within the collection. Intuitively, the relative importance of query terms with regard to other individual non-query terms in a document can also be exploited to promote the ranks of documents in which the query is dedicated as the main topic. In this paper, we introduce a simple technique named intra-document term ranking, which involves ranking all the terms in a document according to their relative importance within that particular document. We demonstrate that the information regarding the rank positions of given query terms within the intra-document term ranking can be useful for enhancing the precision of top-retrieved results by traditional ranking models. Experiments are conducted on three standard TREC test collections.
1835668	Visual concept-based selection of query expansions for spoken content retrieval In this paper we present a novel approach to semantic-theme-based video retrieval that considers entire videos as retrieval units and exploits automatically detected visual concepts to improve the results of retrieval based on spoken content. We deploy a query prediction method that makes use of a coherence indicator calculated on top returned documents and taking into account the information about visual concepts presence in videos to make a choice between query expansion methods. The main contribution of our approach is in its ability to exploit noisy shot-level concept detection to improve semantic-theme-based video retrieval. Strikingly, improvement is possible using an extremely limited set of concepts. In the experiments performed on TRECVID 2007 and 2008 datasets our approach shows an interesting performance improvement compared to the best performing baseline.
1835669	Mining adjacent markets from a large-scale ads video collection for image advertising The research on image advertising is still in its infancy. Most previous approaches suggest ads by directly matching an ad to a query image, which lacks the power to identify ads from adjacent market. In this paper, we tackle the problem by mining knowledge on adjacent markets from ads videos with a novel Multi-Modal Dirichlet Process Mixture Sets model, which is a unified model of (video frames) clustering and (ads) ranking. Our approach is not only capable of discovering relevant ads (e.g. car ads for a query car image), but also suggesting ads from adjacent markets (e.g. tyre ads). Experimental results show that our proposed approach is fairly effective.
1835670	A co-learning framework for learning user search intents from rule-generated training data Learning to understand user search intents from their online behaviors is crucial for both Web search and online advertising. However, it is a challenging task to collect and label a sufficient amount of high quality training data for various user intents such as "compare products", "plan a travel", etc. Motivated by this bottleneck, we start with some user common sense, i.e. a set of rules, to generate training data for learning to predict user intents. The rule-generated training data are however hard to be used since these data are generally imperfect due to the serious data bias and possible data noises. In this paper, we introduce a Co-learning Framework (CLF) to tackle the problem of learning from biased and noisy rule-generated training data. CLF firstly generates multiple sets of possibly biased and noisy training data using different rules, and then trains the individual user search intent classifiers over different training datasets independently. The intermediate classifiers are then used to categorize the training data themselves as well as the unlabeled data. The confidently classified data by one classifier are added to other training datasets and the incorrectly classified ones are instead filtered out from the training datasets. The algorithmic performance of this iterative learning procedure is theoretically guaranteed.
1835672	Graphical models for text: a new paradigm for text representation and processing Almost all text applications use the well known vector-space model for text representation and analysis. While the vector-space model has proven itself to be an effective and efficient representation for mining purposes, it does not preserve information about the ordering of the words in the representation. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of distance graph representations of text data. Such representations preserve distance and ordering information between the words, and provide a much richer representation of the underlying text. This approach enables knowledge discovery from text which is not possible with the use of a pure vector-space representation, because it loses much less information about the ordering of the underlying words. Furthermore, this representation does not require the development of new mining and management techniques. This is because the technique can also be converted into a structural version of the vector-space representation, which allows the use of all existing tools for text. In addition, existing techniques for graph and XML data can be directly leveraged with this new representation. Thus, a much wider spectrum of algorithms is available for processing this representation.
1835675	Low cost evaluation in information retrieval Search corpora are growing larger and larger: over the last 10 years, the IR research community has moved from the several hundred thousand documents on the TREC disks to the tens of millions of U.S. government web pages of GOV2 to the one billion general-interest web pages in the new ClueWeb09 collection. But traditional means of acquiring relevance judgments and evaluating - e.g. pooling documents to calculate average precision - do not seem to scale well to these new large collections. They require substantially more cost in human assessments for the same reliability in evaluation; if the additional cost goes over the assessing budget, errors in evaluation are inevitable. Some alternatives to pooling that support low-cost and reliable evaluation have recently been proposed. A number of them have already been used in TREC and other evaluation forums (TREC Million Query, Legal, Chemical, Web, Relevance Feedback Tracks, CLEF Patent IR, INEX). Evaluation via implicit user feedback (e.g. clicks) and crowdsourcing have also recently gained attention in the community. Thus it is important that the methodologies, the analysis they support, and their strengths and weaknesses are well-understood by the IR community. Furthermore, these approaches can support small research groups attempting to start investigating new tasks on new corpora with relatively low cost. Even groups that do not participate in TREC, CLEF, or other evaluation conferences can benefit from understanding how these methods work, how to use them, and what they mean as they build test collections for tasks they are interested in. The goal of this tutorial is to provide attendees with a comprehensive overview of techniques to perform low cost (in terms of judgment effort) evaluation. A number of topics will be covered, including alternatives to pooling, evaluation measures robust to incomplete judgments, evaluating with no relevance judgments, statistical inference of evaluation metrics, inference of relevance judgments, query selection, techniques to test the reliability of the evaluation and reusability of the constructed collections. The tutorial should be of interest to a wide range of attendees. Those new to the field will come away with a solid understanding of how low cost evaluation methods can be applied to construct inexpensive test collections and evaluate new IR technology, while those with intermediate knowledge will gain deeper insights and further understand the risks and gains of low cost evaluation. Attendees should have a basic knowledge of the traditional evaluation framework (Cranfield) and metrics (such as average precision and nDCG), along with some basic knowledge on probability theory and statistics. More advanced concepts will be explained during the tutorial.
1835677	Introduction to probabilistic models in IR Most of today's state-of-the-art retrieval models, including BM25 and language modeling, are grounded in probabilistic principles. Having a working understanding of these principles can help researchers understand existing retrieval models better and also provide industrial practitioners with an understanding of how such models can be applied to real world problems. This half-day tutorial will cover the fundamentals of two dominant probabilistic frameworks for Information Retrieval: the classical probabilistic model and the language modeling approach. The elements of the classical framework will include the probability ranking principle, the binary independence model, the 2-Poisson model, and the widely used BM25 model. Within language modeling framework, we will discuss various distributional assumptions and smoothing techniques. Special attention will be devoted to the event spaces and independence assumptions underlying each approach. The tutorial will outline several techniques for modeling term dependence and addressing vocabulary mismatch. We will also survey applications of probabilistic models in the domains of cross-language and multimedia retrieval. The tutorial will conclude by suggesting a set of open problems in probabilistic models of IR. Attendees should have a basic familiarity with probability and statistics. A brief refresher of basic concepts, including random variables, event spaces, conditional probabilities, and independence will be given at the beginning of the tutorial. In addition to slides, some hands on exercises and examples will be used throughout the tutorial.
1835678	Multimedia information retrieval This tutorial is concerned with creating the best possible multimedia search experience. The intriguing bit here is that the query itself can be a multimedia excerpt: For example, when you walk around in an unknown place and stumble across an interesting landmark, would it not be great if you could just take a picture with your mobile phone and send it to a service that finds a similar picture in a database and tells you more about the building - and about its significance for that matter? The ideas for this type of search have been around for a decade, but this tutorial will look at recent successes and take stock of the state-of-the-art. It examines the full matrix of a variety of query modes versus document types. How do you retrieve a music piece by humming? What if you want to find news video clips on forest fires using a still image? The tutorial discusses underlying techniques and common approaches to facilitate multimedia search engines: metadata driven search; piggy-back text search where automated processes create text surrogates for multimedia; automated image annotation; content-based search. The latter is studied in more depth looking at features and distances, and how to effectively combine them for efficient retrieval, to a point where the participants have the ingredients and recipe in their hands for building their own visual search engines. Supporting users in their resource discovery mission when hunting for multimedia material is not a technological indexing problem alone. We will briefly look at interactive ways of engaging with repositories through browsing and relevance feedback, roping in geographical context, and providing visual summaries for videos. The tutorial emphasises state-of-the-art research in the area of multimedia information retrieval, which gives an indication of the research and development trends and, thereby, a glimpse of the future world.
1835679	Web retrieval: the role of users Web retrieval methods have evolved through three major steps in the last decade or so. They started from standard document-centric IR in the early days of the Web, then made a major step forward by leveraging the structure of the Web, using link analysis techniques in both crawling and ranking challenges. A more recent, no less important but maybe more discrete step forward, has been to enter the user in this equation in two ways: (1) implicitly, through the analysis of usage data captured by query logs, and session and click information in general, the goal being to improve ranking as well as to measure user's happiness and engagement; (2) explicitly, by offering novel interactive features; the goal here being to better answer users' needs. In this tutorial, we will cover the user-related challenges associated with the implicit and explicit role of users in Web retrieval. We will review and discuss challenges associated with two types of activities, namely: usage data analysis and metrics and user interaction. The goal of this tutorial is to teach the key principles and technologies behind the activities and challenges briefly outlined above, bring new understanding and insights to the attendees, and hopefully foster future research.
1835680	Information retrieval challenges in computational advertising Computational advertising is an emerging scientific sub-discipline, at the intersection of large scale search and text analysis, information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, classification, optimization, and microeconomics. The central challenge of computational advertising is to find the "best match" between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement. The aim of this tutorial is to present the state of the art in Computational Advertising, in particular in its IR-related aspects, and to expose the participants to the current research challenges in this field. The tutorial does not assume any prior knowledge of Web advertising, and will begin with a comprehensive background survey. Going deeper, our focus will be on using a textual representation of the user context to retrieve relevant ads. At first approximation, this process can be reduced to a conventional setup by constructing a query that describes the user context and executing the query against a large inverted index of ads. We show how to augment this approach using query expansion and text classification techniques tuned for the ad-retrieval problem. In particular, we show how to use the Web as a repository of query-specific knowledge and use the Web search results retrieved by the query as a form of a relevance feedback and query expansion. We also present solutions that go beyond the conventional bag of words indexing by constructing additional features using a large external taxonomy and a lexicon of named entities obtained by analyzing the entire Web as a corpus. The last part of the tutorial will be devoted to a potpourri of recent research results and open problems inspired by Computational Advertising challenges in text summarization, natural language generation, named entity recognition, computer-human interaction, and other SIGIR-relevant areas.
1835681	Extraction of open-domain class attributes from text: building blocks for faceted search Knowledge automatically extracted from text captures instances, classes of instances and relations among them. In particular, the acquisition of class attributes (e.g., "top speed", "body style" and "number of cylinders" for the class of "sports cars") from text is a particularly appealing task and has received much attention recently, given its natural fit as a building block towards the far-reaching goal of constructing knowledge bases from text. This tutorial provides an overview of extraction methods developed in the area of Web-based information extraction, with the purpose of acquiring attributes of open-domain classes. The attributes are extracted for classes organized either as a flat set or hierarchically. The extraction methods operate over unstructured or semi-structured text available within collections of Web documents, or over relatively more intriguing data sources consisting of anonymized search queries. The methods take advantage of weak supervision provided in the form of seed examples or small amounts of annotated data, or draw upon knowledge already encoded within human-compiled resources (e.g., Wikipedia). The more ambitious methods, aiming at acquiring as many accurate attributes from text as possible for hundreds or thousands of classes covering a wide range of domains of interest, need to be designed to scale to Web collections. This restriction has significant consequences on the overall complexity and choice of underlying tools, in order for the extracted attributes to ultimately aid information retrieval in general and Web search in particular, by producing relevant attributes for open-domain classes, along with other types of relations among instances or among classes.
1835684	Search and browse log mining for web information retrieval: challenges, methods, and applications Huge amounts of search log data have been accumulated in various search engines. Currently, a commercial search engine receives billions of queries and collects tera-bytes of log data on any single day. Other than search log data, browse logs can be collected by client-side browser plug-ins, which record the browse information if users' permissions are granted. Such massive amounts of search/browse log data, on the one hand, provide great opportunities to mine the wisdom of crowds and improve search results as well as online advertisement. On the other hand, designing effective and efficient methods to clean, model, and process large scale log data also presents great challenges. In this tutorial, we focus on mining search and browse log data for Web information retrieval. We consider a Web information retrieval system consisting of four components, namely, query understanding, document understanding, query-document matching, and user understanding. Accordingly, we organize the tutorial materials along these four aspects. For each aspect, we will survey the major tasks, challenges, fundamental principles, and state-of-the-art methods. The goal of this tutorial is to provide a systematic survey on large-scale search/browse log mining to the IR community. It will help IR researchers to get familiar with the core challenges and promising directions in log mining. At the same time, this tutorial may also serve the developers of Web information retrieval systems as a comprehensive and in-depth reference to the advanced log mining techniques.
1835685	Information retrieval for e-discovery Discovery, the process under which parties to legal cases must reveal documents relevant to the disputed issues is a core aspect of trials in the United States, and a lesser but important factor in other countries. Discovery on documents stored in computerized systems (known variously as electronic discovery, e-discovery, e-disco, EDD, and ED) is increasingly the major factor in discovery, and has become a multi-billion dollar industry. I will discuss the basics of e-discovery, the scale and diversity of the materials involved, and the economics of identifying and reviewing potentially responsive material. I will then focus on three major IR areas of interest: search, supervised machine learning (including text classification and relevance feedback), and interface support for manual relevance assessment. For each, I will discuss technologies currently used in e-discovery, the evaluation methods applicable to measuring effectiveness, and existing research results not yet seeing commercial practice. I will also outline research directions that, if successfully pursued, would potentially be of great interest in e-discovery applications. A particular focus will be on areas where researchers can make progress without access to operational e-discovery environments or "realistic" test collections. Connections will be drawn with the use of IR in related tasks, such as enterprise search, criminal investigations, intelligence analysis, historical research, truth and reconciliation commissions, and freedom of information (open records or sunshine law) requests.
1835687	On the mono- and cross-language detection of text reuse and plagiarism Plagiarism, the unacknowledged reuse of text, has increased in recent years due to the large amount of texts readily available. For instance, recent studies claim that nowadays a high rate of student reports include plagiarism, making manual plagiarism detection practically infeasible. Automatic plagiarism detection tools assist experts to analyse documents for plagiarism. Nevertheless, the lack of standard collections with cases of plagiarism has prevented accurate comparing models, making differences hard to appreciate. Seminal efforts on the detection of text reuse [2] have fostered the composition of standard resources for the accurate evaluation and comparison of methods. The aim of this PhD thesis is to address three of the main problems in the development of better models for automatic plagiarism detection: (i) the adequate identification of good potential sources for a given suspicious text; (ii) the detection of plagiarism despite modifications, such as words substitution and paraphrasing (special stress is given to cross-language plagiarism); and (iii) the generation of standard collections of cases of plagiarism and text reuse in order to provide a framework for accurate comparison of models. Regarding difficulties (i) and (ii) , we have carried out preliminary experiments over the METER corpus [2]. Given a suspicious document dq and a collection of potential source documents D, the process is divided in two steps. First, a small subset of potential source documents D* in D is retrieved. The documents d in D* are the most related to dq and, therefore, the most likely to include the source of the plagiarised fragments in it. We performed this stage on the basis of the Kullback-Leibler distance, over a subsample of document's vocabularies. Afterwards, a detailed analysis is carried out comparing dq to every d in D* in order to identify potential cases of plagiarism and their source. This comparison was made on the basis of word n-grams, by considering n = {2, 3}. These n-gram levels are flexible enough to properly retrieve plagiarised fragments and their sources despite modifications [1]. The result is offered to the user to take the final decision. Further experiments were done in both stages in order to compare other similarity measures, such as the cosine measure, the Jaccard coefficient and diverse fingerprinting and probabilistic models. One of the main weaknesses of currently available models is that they are unable to detect cross-language plagiarism. Approaching the detection of this kind of plagiarism is of high relevance, as the most of the information published is written in English, and authors in other languages may find it attractive to make use of direct translations. Our experiments, carried out over parallel and a comparable corpora, show that models of "standard" cross-language information retrieval are not enough. In fact, if the analysed source and target languages are related in some way (common linguistic ancestors or technical vocabulary), a simple comparison based on character n-grams seems to be the option. However, in those cases where the relation between the implied languages is weaker, other models, such as those based on statistical machine translation, are necessary [3]. We plan to perform further experiments, mainly to approach the detection of cross-language plagiarism. In order to do that, we will use the corpora developed under the framework of the PAN competition on plagiarism detection (cf. PAN@CLEF: http://pan.webis.de). Models that consider cross-language thesauri and comparison of cognates will also be applied.
1835688	User interface designs to support the social transfer of web search expertise While there are many ways to develop search expertise, I maintain that most members of the general public do so in an inefficient manner. One reason is that, with current tools, is difficult to observe experts as a means of acquiring search expertise in a scalable fashion. This calls for a redesign of computer-mediated communication tools to make individual search strategies visible to other users. I present a research agenda to investigate this claim, which draws upon theories of social learning. I use design-based research to build novel systems that enable imitation-based learning of search expertise.
1835689	Leveraging user interaction and collaboration for improving multilingual information access in digital libraries The goal of interactive cross-lingual information retrieval systems is to support users in formulating effective queries and selecting the documents which satisfy their information needs regardless of the language of these documents. This dissertation aims at harnessing user-system interaction, extracting the added value and integrating it back into the system to improve cross-lingual information retrieval for successive users. To achieve this, user input at different interaction points will be evaluated. This will, among others, include interaction during user-assisted query translations, implicit and explicit relevance feedback and social tags. To leverage this input, explorative studies need to be conducted to determine beneficial user input and the methods of extracting it.
1835690	Entity information management in complex networks Entity information management (EIM) deals with organizing, processing and delivering information about entities. Its emergence is a result of satisfying more sophisticated information needs that go beyond document search. In the recent years, entity retrieval has attracted much attention in the IR community. INEX has started the XML Entity Ranking track since 2007 and TREC has launched the Entity track since 2009 to investigate the problem of related entity finding. Some EIM problems go beyond retrieval and ranking such as: 1) entity profiling, which is about characterizing a specific entity, and 2) entity distillation, which is about discovering the trend about an entity. These problems have received less attention while they have many important applications. On the other hand, the entities in the real world or in the Web environment are usually not isolated. They are connected or related with each other in one way or another. For example, the coauthorship makes the authors with similar research interests be connected. The emergence of social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube has further interweaved the related entities in a much larger scale. Millions of users in these sites can become friends, fans or followers of others, or taggers or commenters of different types of entities (e.g., bookmarks, photos and videos). These networks are complex in the sense that they are heterogeneous with multiple types of entities and of interactions, they are large-scale, they are multi-lingual, and they are dynamic. These features of the complex networks go beyond traditional social network analysis and require further research. In this proposed research, I investigate entity information management in the environment of complex networks. The main research question is: how can the EIM tasks be facilitated by modeling the content and structure of complex networks? The research is in the intersection of content based information retrieval and complex network analysis, which deals with both unstructured text data and structured networks. The specific targeting EIM tasks are entity retrieval, entity profiling and entity distillation. In addition to the main research question, the following questions are considered: How can we accomplish a EIM task involving diverse entity and interaction types? How to model the evolution of entity profiles as well as the underlying complex networks? How can the existing cross-language IR work be leveraged to build entity profiles with multi-lingual evidence? I propose to use probabilistic models and discriminative models in particular to address the above research questions. In my research, I have developed discriminative models for expert search to integrate arbitrary document features [3] and to learn flexible combination strategies to rank experts in heterogeneous information sources [1]. Discriminative graphical models are proposed to jointly discover homepages by inference on the homepage dependence network [2]. The dependence of table elements is exploited to collectively perform the entity retrieval task [4]. These works have shown the power of discriminative models for entity search and the benefits of utilizing the dependencies among related entities. What I would like to do next is to develop a unified probabilistic framework to investigate the research questions raised in this proposal.
1835691	Finding people and their utterances in social media Since its introduction, social media, "a group of internet-based applications that (...) allow the creation and exchange of user generated content" [1], has attracted more and more users. Over the years, many platforms have arisen that allow users to publish information, communicate with others, connect to like-minded, and share anything a users wants to share. Text-centric examples are mailing lists, forums, blogs, community question answering, collaborative knowledge sources, social networks, and microblogs, with new platforms starting all the time. Given the volume of information available in social media, ways of accessing this information intelligently are needed; this is the scope of my research. Why should we care about information in social media? Here are three examples that motivate my interest. (A) Viewpoint research; someone wants to take note of the viewpoints on a particular issue. (B) Answers to problems; many problems have been encountered before, and people have shared solutions. (C) Product development; gaining insight into how people use a product and what features they wish for, eases the development of new products. Looking at these examples of information need in social media, we observe that they revolve not just around relevance in the traditional sense (i.e., objects relevant to a given topic), but also around criteria like credibility, authority, viewpoints, expertise, and experiences. However, these additional aspects are typically conditioned on the topical relevance of information objects. In social media, "information objects" come in several types but many are utterances created by people (blog posts, emails, questions, answers, tweets). People and their utterances offer two natural entry points to information contained in social media: utterances that are relevant and people that are of interest. I focus on three tasks in which the interaction between the two is key.
1835692	Leveraging user-generated content for news search Over the last few years both availability and accessibility of current news stories on the Web have dramatically improved. In particular, users can now access news from a variety of sources hosted on the Web, from newswire presences such as the New York Times, to integrated news search within Web search engines. However, of central interest is the emerging impact that user-generated content (UGC) is having on this online news landscape. Indeed, the emergence of Web 2.0 has turned a static news consumer base into a dynamic news machine, where news stories are summarised and commented upon. In summary, value is being added to each news story in terms of additional content. Importantly, however, while there has been movement in commercial circles to exploit this extra value to enrich online news, there has been little research from the academic community on how can be achieved. Indeed, the main purpose of this thesis is to research practical techniques for the integration of UGC to improve the news search component of the most ubiquitous of Web tools, i.e the Web search engine.
1835693	User centered story tracking Using data collections available on the Internet has for many people became the main medium for staying informed about the world. Many of these collections are in nature dynamic, evolving as the subjects they describe change. The goal of different research areas is to identify and highlight these changes to better enable readers to track stories. In this work we restrict ourselves to news collections and investigate "real-life" effectiveness and usability of temporal text mining (TTM) story tracking methods. We propose a new story tracking method and build a tool to support it. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness and usability of story tracking methods and define a new frameworks for automatic and user oriented evaluation. We built methods and tools which allow for understanding, discovery, and search through user interaction. Although there are many TTM methods developed there is a lack of common evaluation procedure. Therefore, we propose an evaluation framework for measuring how different TTM methods discover novel "facts". Apart from the automatic evaluation we are interested in how can users interact with pattens and learn about the underlying subjects of the story they track. For this purpose we propose a user testing environment that measures speed and accuracy in which users can use story tracking methods to discover predefined sets of ground-truth sentences.
1835694	Reverse annotation based retrieval from large document image collections A number of projects are dedicated to creating digital libraries from scanned books, such as Google Books, UDL, Digital Library of India (DLI), etc. The ability to search in the content of document images is essential for the usability and popularity of these DLs. In this work, we aim toward building a retrieval system over 120K document images coming from 1000 scanned books of Telugu literature. This is a challenge because: i) OCRs are not robust enough for Indian languages, especially the Telugu script, ii) the document images contain large number of degradations and artifacts, iii) scalability to large collections is hard. Moreover, users expect that the search system accept text queries and retrieve relevant results in interactive times. We propose a Reverse Annotation framework [1], that labels word-images by their equivalent text label in the offline phase. Reverse Annotation applies a retrieval based approach to recognition. Unlike traditional annotation/recognition that identifies keywords for data, Reverse Annotation identifies data that corresponds to a given keyword. It first selects a set of keywords which are considered useful for labeling and retrieval, such as those that repeat often, and ignoring stopwords and rare-words. Exemplars are obtained for each word from a crude OCR or human annotations. The labels are then propagated across the rest of the collection by matching words in the image-feature space. Since such a matching is computationally expensive, scalability is achieved using a fast approximate nearest neighbor technique based on Hierarchical K-Means. Once text labels are assigned, each document image is considered a bag-of-words over the labeled keywords. A standard search engine is used to build a search index for quick online retrieval. An example query and the retrieved results are shown in Figure 1. We are unaware of any conventional OCRs which can retrieve such images for the given query. There are three major contributions of our work: i) recognizing the entire document collection together, instead of one-at-a-time; this means that the repetition of words in the test set is effectively used for improving accuracy, ii) speeding up recognition by clustering multiple instances of a given word, iii) recognising at the word-level, avoiding the pitfalls of character segmentation and recognition. Other OCR techniques that use word-level context still rely on inaccurate component-level classification. Using the techniques developed from this work, we were able to successfully build a retrieval system over our challenging dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest collection of document images that has been made searchable for any Indian language. Our algorithm is easily scalable to larger collections, and directly applicable to documents from other language scripts. The first issue to discuss, is the fraction of word-images that remain unrecognized at the end of the Reverse Annotation phase. Rare-words, nouns etc. are not labeled in the test set. It is important to estimate the cost of not being able to answer such queries. If this cost is indeed high, we need to explore methods to label such infrequently occurring words in the collection. Needless to say, such methods should be computationally efficient without compromising on accuracy. The other major issue to discuss is the evaluation of retrieval results. The true recall of the retrieval system cannot be computed, since it is impossible to identify every occurrence of the given query in such large data. Questions to be considered include: whether precision alone is a sufficient indicator of retrieval performance; whether there is some better document-level effectiveness assessment possible; and how best to estimate the relative satisfaction of the user's information need.
1835695	Learning hidden variable models for blog retrieval We describe probabilistic models that leverage individual blog post evidence to improve blog seed retrieval performances. Our model offers a intuitive and principled method to combine multiple posts in scoring a whole blog site by treating individual posts as hidden variables. When applied to the seed retrieval task, our model yields state-of-the-art results on the TREC 2007 Blog Distillation Task dataset.
1835696	Investigation on smoothing and aggregation methods in blog retrieval Recently, user generated data is growing rapidly and becoming one of the most important source of information in the web. Blogosphere (the collection of blogs on the web) is one of the main source of information in this category. In my work for my PhD, I mainly focussed on the blog distillation task which is: given a user query find the blogs that are most related to the query topic [3]. There are some properties of blogs that make blog analysis different from usual text analysis. One of these properties is related to the time stamp assigned to each post; it is possible that the topics of a blog change over the time and this can affect blog relevance to the query. Also each post in a blog can have viewer generated comments that can change the relevance of the blog to the query if these are considered as part of the content of the blog. Another property is related to the meaning of the links between blogs which are different than links between websites. Finally, blog distillation is different from traditional ad-hoc search since the retrieval unit is a blog (a collection of posts), instead of a single document. With this view, blog distillation is similar to the task of resource selection in federated search [1]. Researchers have applied different methods from similar problems to blog distillation like ad-hoc search methods, expert search algorithms or methods from resource selection in distributed information retrieval. Based on our preliminary experiments, I decided to divide the blog distillation problem into two sub-problems. First of all, I want to use mentioned properties of blogs to retrieve the most relevant posts for a given query. This part is very similar to the ad hoc retrieval. After that, I want to aggregate relevance of posts in each blog and calculate relevance of the blog. This part requires the development of a cross-modal aggregation model that combines the different blog relevance clues found in the blogosphere. We use structure based smoothing methods for improving posts retrieval. The idea behind these smoothing methods is to change the score of a document based on the score of its similar or related documents. We model the blogosphere as a single graph that represents relations between posts and terms [2]. The idea is that in accordance with the Clustering Hypothesis, related documents should have similar scores for the same query . To model the relatedness between posts, we define a new measure which takes into account both content similarity and temporal distance. In more recent work, in the aggregation part of the problem, we model each post as evidence about relevance of a blog to the query, and use aggregation methods like Ordered Weighted Averaging operators to combine the evidence. The ordered weighted averaging operator, commonly called OWA operator, was introduced by Yager [4]. OWA provides a parametrized class of mean type aggregation operators, that can generate OR operator ( Max ), AND operator ( Min ) and any other aggregation operator between them. For the next steps, I'm thinking about capturing the temporal properties of the blogs. Bloggers can change their interests over the time or write about different topics periodically. Capturing these changes and using them in the retrieval is one the future woks that I'm interested in. Also, studying the relations between blogs and news and their effect on each other is an interesting problem.

2009918	Future of the web and search No one doubts that we have only scratched the surface of what is possible with the Web. The day is coming fast when the Web will become almost a virtual mind reader. Your intent, interests, and needs will be instantly perceived and the information you want will be promptly delivered -- whether you ask for it directly or not -- based on a deep understanding of the meaning of words in your query, knowledge of your preferences and patterns, what others have done before you, your location, and more. In this talk, I will share some of my thoughts about where the Web is heading and how search will be transformed to align to this new Web, laying out some specifics behind Microsoft's vision to empower people with knowledge.
2009920	Beyond search: statistical topic models for text analysis Search is generally a means to the end of finishing a task. While the current search engines are useful to users for finding relevant information, they offer little help to users for further digesting and analyzing the overwhelming found information needed for finishing a complex task. In this talk, I will discuss how statistical topic models can be used to help users analyze and digest the found relevant information and turn search results into actionable knowledge needed to complete a task. I will present several general statistical topic models for extracting and analyzing topics and their patterns in text, and show sample applications of such models in tasks such as opinion integration, comparative summarization, contextual topic trend analysis, and event impact analysis. The talk will conclude with a discussion of novel challenges raised in extending a search engine to an analysis engine that can go beyond search to provide more complete support for users to finish their tasks.
2009924	Seeding simulated queries with user-study data forpersonal search evaluation In this paper we perform a lab-based user study (n=21) of email re-finding behaviour, examining how the characteristics of submitted queries change in different situations. A number of logistic regression models are developed on the query data to explore the relationship between user- and contextual- variables and query characteristics including length, field submitted to and use of named entities. We reveal several interesting trends and use the findings to seed a simulated evaluation of various retrieval models. Not only is this an enhancement of existing evaluation methods for Personal Search, but the results show that different models are more effective in different situations, which has implications both for the design of email search tools and for the way algorithms for Personal Search are evaluated.
2009943	Enhancing ad-hoc relevance weighting using probability density estimation Classical probabilistic information retrieval (IR) models, e.g. BM25, deal with document length based on a trade-off between the Verbosity hypothesis, which assumes the independence of a document's relevance of its length, and the Scope hypothesis, which assumes the opposite. Despite the effectiveness of the classical probabilistic models, the potential relationship between document length and relevance is not fully explored to improve retrieval performance. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of this relationship based on the Scope hypothesis that document length does have its impact on relevance. We study a list of probability density functions and examine which of the density functions fits the best to the actual distribution of the document length. Based on the studied probability density functions, we propose a length-based BM25 relevance weighting model, called BM25L, which incorporates document length as a substantial weighting factor. Extensive experiments conducted on standard TREC collections show that our proposed BM25L markedly outperforms the original BM25 model, even if the latter is optimized.
2009951	Detecting outlier sections in us congressional legislation Reading congressional legislation, also known as bills, is often tedious because bills tend to be long and written in complex language. In IBM Many Bills, an interactive web-based visualization of legislation, users of different backgrounds can browse bills and quickly explore parts that are of interest to them. One task users have is to be able to locate sections that don't seem to fit with the overall topic of the bill. In this paper, we present novel techniques to determine which sections within a bill are likely to be outliers by employing approaches from information retrieval. The most promising techniques first detect the most topically relevant parts of a bill by ranking its sections, followed by a comparison between these topically relevant parts and the remaining sections in the bill. To compare sections we use various dissimilarity metrics based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence. The results indicate that these techniques are more successful than a classification based approach. Finally, we analyze how the dissimilarity metrics succeed in discriminating between sections that are strong outliers versus those that are 'milder' outliers.
2009956	Efficiently collecting relevance information from clickthroughs for web retrieval system evaluation Various click models have been recently proposed as a principled approach to infer the relevance of documents from the clickthrough data. The inferred document relevance is potentially useful in evaluating the Web retrieval systems. In practice, it generally requires to acquire the accurate evaluation results within minimal users' query submissions. This problem is important for speeding up search engine development and evaluation cycle and acquiring reliable evaluation results on tail queries. In this paper, we propose a reordering framework for efficient evaluation problem in the context of clickthrough based Web retrieval evaluation. The main idea is to move up the documents that contribute more for the evaluation task. In this framework, we propose four intuitions and formulate them as an optimization problem. Both user study and TREC data based experiments validate that the reordering framework results in much fewer query submissions to get accurate evaluation results with only a little harm to the users' utility.
2009987	Integrating hierarchical feature selection and classifier training for multi-label image annotation It is well accepted that using high-dimensional multi-modal visual features for image content representation and classifier training may achieve more sufficient characterization of the diverse visual properties of the images and further result in higher discrimination power of the classifiers. However, training the classifiers in a high-dimensional multi-modal feature space requires a large number of labeled training images, which will further result in the problem of curse of dimensionality . To tackle this problem, a hierarchical feature subset selection algorithm is proposed to enable more accurate image classification, where the processes for feature selection and classifier training are seamlessly integrated in a single framework. First, a feature hierarchy (i.e., concept tree for automatic feature space partition and organization) is used to automatically partition high-dimensional heterogeneous multi-modal visual features into multiple low-dimensional homogeneous single-modal feature subsets according to their certain physical meanings and each of them is used to characterize one certain type of the diverse visual properties of the images. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on each homogeneous singlemodal feature subset to select the most representative feature dimensions and a weak classifier is learned simultaneously. After the weak classifiers and their representative feature dimensions are available for all these homogeneous single-modal feature subsets, they are combined to generate an ensemble image classifier and achieve hierarchical feature subset selection. Our experiments on a specific domain of natural images have also obtained very positive results.
2009991	Temporal index sharding for space-time efficiency in archive search Time-travel queries that couple temporal constraints with keyword queries are useful in searching large-scale archives of time-evolving content such as the web archives or wikis. Typical approaches for efficient evaluation of these queries involve slicing either the entire collection [20] or individual index lists [10] along the time-axis. Both these methods are not satisfactory since they sacrifice compactness of index for processing efficiency making them either too big or, otherwise, too slow. We present a novel index organization scheme that shards each index list with almost zero increase in index size but still minimizes the cost of reading index entries during query processing. Based on the optimal sharding thus btained, we develop a practically efficient sharding that takes into account the different costs of random and sequential accesses. Our algorithm merges shards from the optimal solution to allow for a few extra sequential accesses while gaining significantly by reducing the number of random accesses. We empirically establish the effectiveness of our sharding scheme with experiments over the revision history of the English Wikipedia between 2001-2005 (approx 700 GB) and an archive of U.K. governmental web sites (approx 400 GB). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of faster time-travel query processing with no space overhead.
2009993	Faster temporal range queries over versioned text Versioned textual collections are collections that retain multiple versions of a document as it evolves over time. Important large-scale examples are Wikipedia and the web collection of the Internet Archive. Search queries over such collections often use keywords as well as temporal constraints, most commonly a time range of interest. In this paper, we study how to support such temporal range queries over versioned text. Our goal is to process these queries faster than the corresponding keyword-only queries, by exploiting the additional constraint. A simple approach might partition the index into different time ranges, and then access only the relevant parts. However, specialized inverted index compression techniques are crucial for large versioned collections, and a naive partitioning can negatively affect index size and query throughput. We show how to achieve high query throughput by using smart index partitioning techniques that take index compression into account. Experiments on over 85 million versions of Wikipedia articles show that queries can be executed in a few milliseconds on memory-based index structures, and only slightly more time on disk-based structures. We also show how to efficiently support the recently proposed stable top-k search primitive on top of our schemes.
2009994	Indexing strategies for graceful degradation of search quality Large web search engines process billions of queries each day over tens of billions of documents with often very stringent requirements for a user's search experience, in particular, low latency and highly relevant search results. Index generation and serving are key to satisfying both these requirements. For example, the load to search engines can vary drastically when popular events happen around the world. In the case when the load is exceeding what the search engine can serve, queries will get dropped. This results in an un- graceful degradation in search quality. Another example that could increase the query load and affect the user's search experience are ambiguous queries which often result in the execution of multiple query alterations in the back end. In this paper, we look into the problem of designing robust indexing strategies, i.e. strategies that allow for a graceful degradation of search quality in both the above scenarios. We study the problems of index generation and serving using the notions of document allocation, server selection, and document replication. We explore the space of efficient algorithms for these problems and empirically corroborate with existing theory that it is hard to optimally solve the alocation and selection problems without any replication. We propose a greedy replication algorithm and study its performance under different choices of allocation and selection. Further, we show hat under random selection and allocation, our algorithm is optimal.
2010003	Filtering semi-structured documents based on faceted feedback Existing adaptive filtering systems learn user profiles based on users' relevance judgments on documents. In some cases, users have some prior knowledge about what features are important for a document to be relevant. For example, a Spanish speaker may only want news written in Spanish, and thus a relevant document should contain the feature "Language: Spanish"; a researcher working on HIV knows an article with the medical subject "Subject: AIDS" is very likely to be interesting to him/her. Semi-structured documents with rich faceted metadata are increasingly prevalent over the Internet. Motivated by the commonly used faceted search interface in e-commerce, we study whether users' prior knowledge about faceted features could be exploited for filtering semi-structured documents. We envision two faceted feedback solicitation mechanisms, and propose a novel user profile learning algorithm that can incorporate user feedback on features. To evaluate the proposed work, we use two data sets from the TREC filtering track, and conduct a user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our experimental results show that user feedback on faceted features is useful for filtering. The new user profile learning algorithm can effectively learn from user feedback on faceted features and performs better than several other methods adapted from the feature-based feedback techniques proposed for retrieval and text classification tasks in previous work.
2010030	Enriching document representation via translation for improved monolingual information retrieval Word ambiguity and vocabulary mismatch are critical problems in information retrieval. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes the use of translated words to enrich document representation, going beyond the words in the original source language to represent a document. In our approach, each original document is automatically translated into an auxiliary language, and the resulting translated document serves as a semantically enhanced representation for supplementing the original bag of words. The core of our translation representation is the expected term frequency of a word in a translated document, which is calculated by averaging the term frequencies over all possible translations, rather than focusing on the 1-best translation only. To achieve better efficiency of translation, we do not rely on full-fledged machine translation, but instead use monotonic translation by removing the time-consuming reordering component. Experiments carried out on standard TREC test collections show that our proposed translation representation leads to statistically significant improvements over using only the original language of the document collection.
2010061	Learning features through feedback for blog distillation The paper is focused on blogosphere research based on the TREC blog distillation task, and aims to explore unbiased and significant features automatically and efficiently. Feedback from faceted feeds is introduced to harvest relevant features and information gain is used to select discriminative features. The evaluation result shows that the selected feedback features can greatly improve the performance and adapt well to the terabyte data.
2010064	Learning to rank using query-level regression In this paper, we use query-level regression as the loss function. The regression loss function has been used in pointwise methods, however pointwise methods ignore the query boundaries and treat the data equally across queries, and thus the effectiveness is limited. We show that regression is an effective loss function for learning to rank when used in query-level. We use neural network to model the ranking function and gradient descent for optimization and refer our method as ListReg. Experimental results show that ListReg significantly outperforms pointwise Regression and the state-of-the-art listwise method in most cases.
2010065	Diversifying product search results In recent years, online shopping is becoming more and more popular. Users type keyword queries on product search systems to find relevant products, accessories, and even related products. However, existing product search systems always return very similar products on the first several pages instead of taking diversity into consideration. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the diversity issue in the context of product search. We transform search result diversification into a combination of diversifying product categories and diversifying product attribute values within each category. The two sub-problems are optimization problems which can be reduced into well-known NP-hard problems respectively. We further leverage greedy-based approximation algorithms for efficient product search results re-ranking.
2010066	Ad hoc IR: not much room for improvement Ranking function performance reached a plateau in 1994. The reason for this is investigated. First the performance of BM25 is measured as the proportion of queries satisfied on the first page of 10 results -- it performs well. The performance is then compared to human performance. They perform comparably. The conclusion is there isn't much room for ranking function improvement.
2010067	Image annotation based on recommendation model In this paper, a novel approach based on recommendation model is proposed for automatic image annotation. For any to-be-annotated image, we first select some related images with tags from training dataset according to their visual similarity. And then we estimate the initial ratings for tags of the training images based on tag ranking method and construct a rating matrix. We also construct a trust matrix based on visual similarity with a k-NN strategy. Then a recommendation model is built on both matrices to rank candidate tags for the target image. The proposed approach is evaluated using two benchmark image datasets, and experimental results have indicated its effectiveness.
2010068	Utilizing minimal relevance feedback for ad hoc retrieval Using relevance feedback can significantly improve (ad hoc) retrieval effectiveness. Yet, if little feedback is available, effectively exploiting it is a challenge. To that end, we present a novel approach that utilizes document passages. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the merits of the approach.
2010069	Sense discrimination for physics retrieval Information Retrieval in technical domains like physics is characterised by long and precise queries, whose meaning is strongly influenced by term context and domain. We treat this as a disambiguation problem, and present initial findings of a retrieval model that posits a higher probability of relevance for documents matching disambiguated query terms. Preliminary evaluation on a real-life physics test collection shows promising performance improvement.
2010071	Location and timeliness of information sources during news events People nowadays can obtain information on current news events through media outlets, social media, and by actively seeking information using search engines. In this paper we investigate the temporal relationship between news coverage by media outlets, social media, and query logs and show that social media frequently precedes other information sources. Additionally, we demonstrate that there is strong negative correlation between the probability for reporting of an event and the distance of the information source from the event.
2010073	Collective topic modeling for heterogeneous networks In this paper, we propose a joint probabilistic topic model for simultaneously modeling the contents of multi-typed objects of a heterogeneous information network. The intuition behind our model is that different objects of the heterogeneous network share a common set of latent topics so as to adjust the multinomial distributions over topics for different objects collectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the tasks of topic modeling and object clustering.
2010074	Graph-cut based tag enrichment In this paper, a graph cut based tag enrichment approach is proposed. We build a graph for each image with its initial tags. The graph is with two terminals. Nodes of the graph are full connected with each other. Min-cut/max-flow algorithm is utilized to find the relevant tags for the image. Experiments on Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed graph-cut based tag enrichment approach.
2010077	Cognitive coordinating behaviors in multitasking web search This paper investigates how users cognitively coordinate multitasking Web search across different information search problems. The analysis suggests that (1) multitasking is a prevalent Web search behavior including both sequential multitasking (31%) and parallel multitasking (69%); (2) multitasking is performed through a task switching process; and (3) such a process is supported and underpinned by cognitive coordination mechanisms and strategy coordination.
2010078	Optimizing multimodal reranking for web image search In this poster, we introduce a web image search reranking approach with exploring multiple modalities. Diff erent from the conventional methods that build graph with one feature set for reranking, our approach integrates multiple feature sets that describe visual content from different aspects. We simultaneously integrate the learning of relevance scores, the weighting of different feature sets, the distance metric and the scaling for each feature set into a unified scheme. Experimental results on a large data set that contains more than 1,100 queries and 1 million images demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
2010079	Multi-layer graph-based semi-supervised learning for large-scale image datasets using mapreduce Semi-supervised learning is to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled data in the world. This paper proposes a scalable graph-based technique leveraging the distributed computing power of the MapReduce programming model. For a higher quality of learning, the paper also presents a multi-layer learning structure to unify both visual and textual information of image data during the learning process. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
2010080	Tackling class imbalance and data scarcity in literature-based gene function annotation In recent years, a number of machine learning approaches to literature-based gene function annotation have been proposed. However, due to issues such as lack of labeled data, class imbalance and computational cost, they have usually been unable to surpass simpler approaches based on string-matching. In this paper, we propose a principled machine learning approach based on kernel classifiers. We show that kernels can address the task's inherent data scarcity by embedding additional knowledge and we propose a simple yet effective solution to deal with class imbalance. From experiments on the TREC Genomics Track data, our approach achieves better F1-score than two state-of-the-art approaches based on string-matching and cross-species information.
2010081	Bootstrapping subjectivity detection We describe a method for automatically generating subjectivity clues for a specific topic and a set of (relevant) document, evaluating it on the task of classifying sentences w.r.t. subjectivity, with improvements over previous work.
2010082	The effects of choice in routing relevance judgments The emergence of human computation systems, including Mechanical Turk and games with a purpose, has made it feasible to distribute relevance judgment tasks to workers over the Web. Most human computation systems assign tasks to individuals randomly, and such assignments may match workers with tasks that they may be unqualified or unmotivated to perform. We compare two groups of workers, those given a choice of queries to judge versus those who are not, in terms of their self-rated competence and their actual performance. Results show that when given a choice of task, workers choose ones for which they have greater expertise, interests, confidence, and understanding.
2010083	Statistical feature extraction for cross-language web content quality assessment Web content quality assessment is a typical static ranking problem. Heuristic content and TFIDF features based statistical systems have proven effective for Web content quality assessment. But they are all language dependent features, which are not suitable for cross-language ranking. In this paper, we fuse a series of language-independent features including hostname features, domain registration features, two-layer hyperlink analysis features and third-party Web service features to assess the Web content quality. The experiments on ECML/PKDD 2010 Discovery Challenge cross-language datasets show that the assessment is effective.
2010084	Exploiting endorsement information and social influence for item recommendation Social networking services possess two features: (1) capturing the social relationships among people, represented by the social network, and (2) allowing users to express their preferences on different kinds of items (e.g. photo, celebrity, pages) through endorsing buttons, represented by a kind of endorsement bipartite graph. In this work, using such information, we propose a novel recommendation method, which leverages the viral marketing in the social network and the wisdom of crowds from endorsement network. Our recommendation consists of two parts. First, given some query terms describing user's preference, we find a set of targeted influencers who have the maximum activation probability on those nodes related to the query terms in the social network. Second, based on the derived targeted influencers as key experts, we recommend items via the endorsement network. We conduct the experiments on DBLP co-authorship social network with author-reference data as the endorsement network. The results show our method can achieve effective recommendations.
2010086	Domain expert topic familiarity and search behavior Users of information retrieval systems employ a variety of strategies when searching for information. One factor that can directly influence how searchers go about their information finding task is the level of familiarity with a search topic. We investigate how the search behavior of domain experts changes based on their previous level of familiarity with a search topic, reporting on a user study of biomedical experts searching for a range of domain-specific material. The results of our study show that topic familiarity can influence the number of queries that are employed to complete a task, the types of queries that are entered, and the overall number of query terms. Our findings suggest that biomedical search systems should enable searching through a variety of querying modes, to support the different search strategies that users were found to employ depending on their familiarity with the information that they are searching for.
2010088	Evaluating medical information retrieval This paper presents a framework for evaluating information retrieval of medical records. We use the BLULab corpus, a large collection of real-world de-identified medical records. The collection has been hand coded by clinical terminologists using the ICD-9 medical classification system. The ICD codes are used to devise queries and relevance judgements for this collection. Results of initial test runs using a baseline IR system show that there is room for improvement in medical information retrieval. Queries and relevance judgements are made available at http://aehrc.com/med_eval
2010089	Region-based landmark discovery by crowdsourcing geo-referenced photos We propose a novel model for landmark discovery that locates region-based landmarks on map in contrast to the traditional point-based landmarks. The proposed method preserves more information and automatically identifies candidate regions on map by crowdsourcing geo-referenced photos. Gaussian kernel convolution is applied to remove noises and generate detected region. We adopt F1 measure to evaluate discovered landmarks and manually check the association between tags and regions. The experiment results show that more than 90% of attractions in the selected city can be correctly located by this method.
2010091	Temporal latent semantic analysis for collaboratively generated content: preliminary results Latent semantic analysis (LSA) has been intensively studied because of its wide application to Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. Yet, traditional models such as LSA only examine one (current) version of the document. However, due to the recent proliferation of collaboratively generated content such as threads in online forums, Collaborative Question Answering archives, Wikipedia, and other versioned content, the document generation process is now directly observable. In this study, we explore how this additional temporal information about the document evolution could be used to enhance the identification of latent document topics. Specifically, we propose a novel hidden-topic modeling algorithm, temporal Latent Semantic Analysis (tLSA), which elegantly extends LSA to modeling document revision history using tensor decomposition. Our experiments show that tLSA outperforms LSA on word relatedness estimation using benchmark data, and explore applications of tLSA for other tasks.
2010093	BlogCast effect on information diffusion in a blogosphere A blog service company provides a function named BlogCast that exposes quality posts on the blog main page to vitalize a blogosphere. This paper analyzes a new type of information diffusion via BlogCast. We show that there exists a strong halo effect in a blogosphere via thorough investigation on a huge volume of blog data.
2010094	Product comparison using comparative relations This paper proposes a novel Product Comparison approach. The comparative relations between products are first mined from both user reviews on multiple review websites and community-based question answering pairs containing product comparison information. A unified graph model is then developed to integrate the resultant comparative relations for product comparison. Experiments on popular electronic products show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
2010096	Do IR models satisfy the TDC retrieval constraint An abstract is not available.
2010097	On diversifying and personalizing web search Diversification and personalization methods are common ap-proaches to deal with the one-size-fits-all paradigm of Web search engines. We performed a user study with 190 subjects where we analyzed the effects of diversification and personalization methods in a Web search engine. The obtained results suggest that our proposed combination of diversification and personalization factors may be a way to overcome the notion of intrusiveness in personalized approaches.
2010098	Semantic tag recommendation using concept model The common tags given by multiple users to a particular document are often semantically relevant to the document and each tag represents a specific topic. In this paper, we attempt to emulate human tagging behavior to recommend tags by considering the concepts contained in documents. Specifically, we represent each document using a few most relevant concepts contained in the document, where the concept space is derived from Wikipedia. Tags are then recommended based on the tag concept model derived from the annotated documents of each tag. Evaluated on a Delicious dataset of more than 53K documents, the proposed technique achieved comparable tag recommendation accuracy as the state-of-the-art, while yielding an order of magnitude speed-up.
2010099	Recommending interesting activity-related local entities When searching for entities with a strong local character (e.g., a museum), people may also be interested in discovering proximal activity-related entities (e.g., a café). Geographical proximity is a necessary, but not sufficient, qualifier for recommending other entities such that they are related in a useful manner (e.g., interest in a fish market does not imply interest in nearby bookshops, but interest in other produce stores is more likely). We describe and evaluate methods to identify such activity-related local entities.
2010100	Cross-corpus relevance projection An abstract is not available.
2010101	Location disambiguation for geo-tagged images In this poster, we address the problem of location disambiguation for geotagged Web photo resources. We propose an approach for analyzing and partitioning large geotagged photo collections using geographic and semantic information. By organizing the dataset in a structural scheme, we resolve the location ambiguity and clutter problem yield by massive volume of geotagged photos.
2010102	Towards an indexing method to speed-up music retrieval Computations in most music retrieval systems strongly depend on the size of data compared. We propose to enhance performances of a music retrieval system, namely a harmonic similarity evaluation method, by first indexing relevant parts of music pieces. The indexing algorithm represents each audio piece exclusively by its major repetition, using harmonic descriptions and string matching techniques. Evaluations are performed in the context of a state-of-the-art retrieval method, namely cover songs identification, and results highlight the success of our indexing system in keeping similar results while yielding a substantial gain in computation time.
2010103	An investigation of decompounding for cross-language patent search Decompounding has been found to improve information retrieval (IR) effectiveness in general domains for languages such as German or Dutch. We investigate if cross-language patent retrieval can profit from decompounding. This poses two challenges: i) There may be few resources such as parallel corpora available for training an machine translation system for a compounding language. ii) Patents have a specific writing style and vocabulary ("patentese"), which may affect the performance of decompounding and translation methods. Experiments on data from the CLEF-IP 2010 task show that decompounding patents for translation can overcome out-of-vocabulary problems (OOV) and that decompounding improves IR performance significantly for small training corpora.
2010105	Learning to rank under tight budget constraints This paper investigates the influence of pruning feature lists to keep a given budget for the evaluation of ranking methods. We learn from a given training set how important the individual prefixes are for the ranking quality. Based on there importance we choose the best prefixes to calculate the ranking while keeping the budget.
2010106	A novel hybrid index structure for efficient text retrieval Query processing with precomputed term pair lists can improve efficiency for some queries, but suffers from the quadratic number of index lists that need to be read. We present a novel hybrid index structure that aims at decreasing the number of index lists retrieved at query processing time, trading off a reduced number of index lists for an increased number of bytes to read. Our experiments demonstrate significant cold-cache performance gains of almost 25% on standard benchmark queries.
2010107	A weighted curve fitting method for result merging in federated search Result merging is an important step in federated search to merge the documents returned from multiple source-specific ranked lists for a user query. Previous result merging methods such as Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Sample- Agglomerate Fitting Estimate (SAFE) use regression methods to estimate global document scores from document ranks in individual ranked lists. SSL relies on overlapping documents that exist in both individual ranked lists and a centralized sample database. SAFE goes a step further by using both overlapping documents with accurate rank information and documents with estimated rank information for regression. However, existing methods do not distinguish the accurate rank information from the estimated information. Furthermore, all documents are assigned equal weights in regression while intuitively, documents in the top should carry higher weights. This paper proposes a weighted curve fitting method for result merging in federated search. The new method explicitly models the importance of information from overlapping documents over non-overlapping ones. It also weights documents at different positions differently. Empirically results on two datasets clearly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.
2010109	Time-based query performance predictors Query performance prediction is aimed at predicting the retrieval effectiveness that a query will achieve with respect to a particular ranking model. In this paper, we study query performance prediction for a ranking model that explicitly incorporates the time dimension into ranking. Different time-based predictors are proposed as analogous to existing keyword-based predictors. In order to improve predicting performance, we combine different predictors using linear regression and neural networks. Extensive experiments are conducted using queries and relevance judgments obtained by crowdsourcing.
2010110	Search task difficulty: the expected vs. the reflected We report findings on how the user's perception of task difficulty changes before and after searching for information to solve tasks. We found that while in one type of task, the dependent task, this did not change, in another, the parallel task, it did. The findings have implications on designing systems that can provide assistance to users with their search and task solving strategies.
2010111	On the suitability of diversity metrics for learning-to-rank for diversity An optimally diverse ranking should achieve the maximum coverage of the aspects underlying an ambiguous or underspecified query, with minimum redundancy with respect to the covered aspects. Although evaluation metrics that reward coverage and penalise redundancy provide intuitive objective functions for learning a diverse ranking, it is unclear whether they are the most effective. In this paper, we contrast the suitability of relevance and diversity metrics as objective functions for learning a diverse ranking. Our results in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks show that diversity metrics are not necessarily better suited for guiding a learning approach. Moreover, the suitability of these metrics is compromised as they try to penalise redundancy during the learning process.
2010112	How diverse are web search results? Search result diversification has recently gained attention as a means to tackle ambiguous queries. While query ambiguity is of particular concern for the short queries commonly observed in a Web search scenario, it is unclear how much diversity is actually promoted by Web search engines (WSEs). In this paper, we assess the diversification performance of two leading WSEs in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks. Our results show that these WSEs perform effectively for queries with multiple interpretations, but not for those open to multiple aspects related to a single interpretation. Moreover, by deploying a state-of-the-art diversification approach based on query suggestions from these WSEs themselves, we show that their diversification performance can be further improved.
2010113	Analysis of an expert search query log Expert search has made rapid progress in modeling, algorithms and evaluations in the recent years. However, there is very few work on analyzing how users interact with expert search systems. In this paper, we conduct analysis of an expert search query log. The aim is to understand the special characteristics of expert search usage. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest work on expert search query log analysis. We find that expert search users generally issue shorter queries, more common queries, and use more advanced search features, with fewer queries in a session, than general Web search users do. This study explores a new research direction in expert search by analyzing and exploiting query logs.
2010114	A model for expert finding in social networks Expert finding is a task of finding knowledgeable people on a given topic. State-of-the-art expertise retrieval algorithms identify matching experts based on analysis of textual content of documents experts are associated with. While powerful, these models ignore social structure that might be available. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for expert finding that accounts for both social relationships and content. The model assumes that social links are determined by expertise similarity between candidates. We demonstrate the improved retrieval performance of our model over the baseline on a realistic data set.
2010115	Transductive learning over automatically detected themes for multi-document summarization We propose a new method for query-biased multi-document summarization, based on sentence extraction. The summary of multiple documents is created in two steps. Sentences are first clustered; where each cluster corresponds to one of the main themes present in the collection. Inside each theme, sentences are then ranked using a transductive learning-to-rank algorithm based on RankNet, in order to better identify those which are relevant to the query. The final summary contains the top-ranked sentences of each theme. Our approach is validated on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets.
2010116	Rating-based collaborative filtering combined with additional regularization The collaborative filtering (CF) approach to recommender system has received much attention recently. However, previous work mainly focuses on improving the formula of rating prediction, e.g. by adding user and item biases, implicit feedback and time-aware factors, etc, to reach a better prediction by minimizing an objective function. However, little effort has been made on improving CF by incorporating additional regularization to the objective function. Regularization can further bound the searching range of predicted ratings. In this paper, we improve the conventional rating-based objective function by using ranking constraints as the supplementary regularization to restrict the searching of predicted ratings in smaller and more likely ranges, and develop a novel method, called RankSVD++, based on the SVD++ model. Experimental results show that RankSVD++ achieves better performance than existing main-streaming methods due to the addition of informative ranking-based regularization. The idea proposed here can also be easily incorporated to the other CF models.
2010117	Words-of-interest selection based on temporal motion coherence for video retrieval The "Bag of Visual Words" (BoW) framework has been widely used in query-by-example video retrieval to model the visual content by a set of quantized local feature descriptors. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to enhance BoW by the selection of Word-of-Interest (WoI) that utilizes the quantified temporal motion coherence of the visual words between the adjacent frames in the query example. Experiments carried out using TRECVID datasets show that our technique improves the retrieval performance of the classical BoW-based approach.
2010118	Aggregating multiple opinion evidence in proximity-based opinion retrieval Blog post opinion retrieval is the problem of ranking blog posts according to the likelihood that the post is relevant to the query and that the author was expressing an opinion about the topic (of the query). A recent study has proposed a method for finding the opinion density at query term positions in a document which uses the proximity of query term and opinion term as an indicator of their relatedness. The maximum opinion density between different query positions was used as an opinion score of the whole document. In this paper we investigate the effect of exploiting multiple opinion evidence of a document. We propose using the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator in order to combine the opinion score of different query positions for a final score of a document, in the proximity-based opinion retrieval system.
2010119	Enhancing mobile search using web search log data Mobile search is still in infancy compared with general purpose web search. With limited training data and weak relevance features, the ranking performance in mobile search is far from satisfactory. To address this problem, we propose to leverage the knowledge of Web search to enhance the ranking of mobile search. In this paper, we first develop an equivalent page conversion between web search and mobile search, then we design a few novel ranking features, generated from the click-through data in web search, for estimating the relevance of mobile search. Large scale evaluations demonstrate that the knowledge from web search is quite effective for boosting the relevance of ranking on mobile search.
2010120	Award prediction with temporal citation network analysis Each year many ACM SIG communities will recognize an outstanding researcher through an award in honor of his or her profound impact and numerous research contributions. This work is the first to investigate an automated mechanism to help in selecting future award winners. We approach the problem as a researchers' expertise ranking problem, and propose a temporal probabilistic ranking model which combines content with citation network analysis. Experimental results based on real-world citation data and historical awardees indicate that some kinds of SIG awards are well-modeled by this approach.
2010121	Rating prediction using feature words extracted from customer reviews We developed a simple method of improving the accuracy of rating prediction using feature words extracted from customer reviews. Many rating predictors work well for a small and dense dataset of customer reviews. However, a practical dataset tends to be large and sparse, because it often includes too many products for each customer to buy and evaluate. Data sparseness reduces prediction accuracy. To improve accuracy, we reduced the dimension of the feature vector using feature words extracted by analyzing the relationship between ratings and accompanying review comments instead of using ratings. We applied our method to the Pranking algorithm and evaluated it on a corpus of golf course reviews supplied by a Japanese e-commerce company. We found that by successfully reducing data sparseness, our method improves prediction accuracy as measured using RankLoss.
2010122	Ranking tags in resource collections We examine different tag ranking strategies for constructing tag clouds to represent collections of tagged objects. The proposed methods are based on random walk on graphs, diversification, and rank aggregation, and they are empirically evaluated on a data set of tagged images from Flickr.
2010126	Best document selection based on approximate utility optimization This poster describes an alternative approach to handling the best document selection problem. Best document selection is a common problem with many real world applications, but is not a well studied problem by itself; a simple solution would be to treat it as a ranking problem and to use existing ranking algorithms to rank all documents. We could then select only the first element of the sorted list. However, because ranking models optimize for all ranks, the model may sacrifice accuracy of the top rank for the sake of overall accuracy. This is an unnecessary trade-off. We begin by first defining an appropriate objective function for the domain, then create a boosting algorithm that explicitly targets this function. Based on experiments on a benchmark retrieval data set and Digg.com news commenting data set, we find that even a simple algorithm built for this specific problem gives better results than baseline algorithms that were designed for the more complicated ranking tasks.
2010127	Forecasting counts of user visits for online display advertising with probabilistic latent class models Display advertising is a multi-billion dollar industry where advertisers promote their products to users by having publishers display their advertisements on popular Web pages. An important problem in online advertising is how to forecast the number of user visits for a Web page during a particular period of time. Prior research addressed the problem by using traditional time-series forecasting techniques on historical data of user visits; (e.g., via a single regression model built for forecasting based on historical data for all Web pages) and did not fully explore the fact that different types of Web pages have different patterns of user visits. In this paper we propose a probabilistic latent class model to automatically learn the underlying user visit patterns among multiple Web pages. Experiments carried out on real-world data demonstrate the advantage of using latent classes in forecasting online user visits.
2010128	Knowledge effects on document selection in search results pages Click through events in search results pages (SERPs) are not reliable implicit indicators of document relevance. A user's task and domain knowledge are key factors in recognition and link selection and the most useful SERP document links may be those that best match the user's domain knowledge. User study participants rated their knowledge of genomics MeSH terms before conducting 2004 TREC Genomics Track tasks. Each participant's document knowledge was represented by their knowledge of the indexing MeSH terms. Results show high, intermediate, and low domain knowledge groups had similar document selection SERP rank distributions. SERP link selection distribution varied when participant knowledge of the available documents was analyzed. High domain knowledge participants usually selected a document with the highest personal knowledge rating. Low domain knowledge participants were reasonably successful at selecting available documents of which they had the most knowledge, while intermediate knowledge participants often failed to do so. This evidence for knowledge effects on SERP link selection may contribute to understanding the potential for personalization of search results ranking based on user domain knowledge.
2010130	How to count thumb-ups and thumb-downs?: an information retrieval approach to user-rating based ranking of items It is a common practice among Web 2.0 services to allow users to rate items on their sites. In this paper, we first point out the flaws of the popular methods for user-rating based ranking of items, and then argue that two well-known Information Retrieval (IR) techniques, namely the Probability Ranking Principle and Statistical Language Modelling, provide a simple but effective solution to this problem.
2010132	The interactive PRP for diversifying document rankings The assumptions underlying the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) have led to a number of alternative approaches that cater or compensate for the PRP's limitations. In this poster we focus on the Interactive PRP (iPRP), which rejects the assumption of independence between documents made by the PRP. Although the theoretical framework of the iPRP is appealing, no instantiation has been proposed and investigated. In this poster, we propose a possible instantiation of the principle, performing the first empirical comparison of the iPRP against the PRP. For document diversification, our results show that the iPRP is significantly better than the PRP, and comparable to or better than other methods such as Modern Portfolio Theory.
2010135	A bipartite graph based social network splicing method for person name disambiguation The key issue of person name disambiguation is to discover different namesakes in massive web documents rather than simply cluster documents by using textual features. In this paper, we describe a novel person name disambiguation method based on social networks to effectively identify namesakes. The social network snippets in each document are extracted. Then, the namesakes are identified via splicing the social networks of each namesake by using the snippets as a bipartite graph. Experimental results show that our method achieves better result than the top performance of WePS-2 in identifying different namesakes.
2010137	Evolution of web search results within years We provide a first large-scale analysis of the evolution of query results obtained from a real search engine at two distant points in time, namely, in 2007 and 2010, for a set of 630,000 real queries.
2010138	Decayed DivRank: capturing relevance, diversity and prestige in information networks Many network-based ranking approaches have been proposed to rank objects according to different criteria, including relevance, prestige and diversity. However, existing approaches either only aim at one or two of the criteria, or handle them with additional heuristics in multiple steps. Inspired by DivRank, we propose a unified ranking model, Decayed DivRank (DDRank), to meet the three criteria simultaneously. Empirical experiments on paper citation network show that DDRank can outperform existing algorithms in capturing relevance, diversity and prestige simultaneously in ranking.
2010139	Multi-objective optimization in learning to rank Supervised learning to rank algorithms typically optimize for high relevance and ignore other facets of search quality, such as freshness and diversity. Prior work on multi-objective ranking trained rankers focused on using hybrid labels that combine overall quality of documents, and implicitly incorporate multiple criteria into quantifying ranking risks. However, these hybrid scores are usually generated based on heuristics without considering potential correlations between individual facets (e.g., freshness versus relevance). In this poster, we empirically demonstrate that the correlation between objective facets in multi-criteria ranking optimization may significantly influence the effectiveness of trained rankers with respect to each objective.
2010140	A large-scale study of the effect of training set characteristics over learning-to-rank algorithms In this work we describe the results of a large-scale study on the effect of the distribution of labels across the different grades of relevance in the training set on the performance of trained ranking functions. In a controlled experiment we generate a large number of training datasets wih different label distributions and employ three learning to rank algo- rithms over these datasets. We investigate the effect of these distributions on the accuracy of obtained ranking functions to give an insight into the manner training sets should be constructed.
2010143	SEJoin: an optimized algorithm towards efficient approximate string searches We investigated the problem of finding from a collection of strings those similar to a given query string based on edit distance, for which the critical operation is merging inverted lists of grams generated from the collection of strings. We present an efficient algorithm to accelerate the merging operation.
2010144	Bag-of-visual-words vs global image descriptors on two-stage multimodal retrieval The Bag-Of-Visual-Words (BOVW) paradigm is fast becoming a popular image representation for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), mainly because of its better retrieval effectiveness over global feature representations on collections with images being near-duplicate to queries. In this experimental study we demonstrate that this advantage of BOVW is diminished when visual diversity is enhanced by using a secondary modality, such as text, to pre-filter images. The TOP-SURF descriptor is evaluated against Compact Composite Descriptors on a two-stage image retrieval setup, which first uses a text modality to rank the collection and then perform CBIR only on the top-K items.
2010145	Query term ranking based on search results overlap In this paper, we propose a method to rank and assign weights to query terms according to their impact on the topic of the query. We use Search Result Overlap Ratio (SROR) to quantify the overlap of the search results of the full query and a shorten query after removing one term. Intuitively, if the overlap is small, it indicates a big topic shift and the removed term should be discriminative and important. The SROR could be used for measuring query term importance with a search engine automatically. By this way, learning based models could be trained based on a large number of automatically labeled instances and make predictions for future queries efficiently.
2010148	Learning for graphs with annotated edges Automatic classification with graphs containing annotated edges is an interesting problem and has many potential applications. We present a risk minimization formulation that exploits the annotated edges for classification tasks. One major advantage of our approach compared to other methods is that the weight of each edge in the graph structures in our model, including both positive and negative weights, can be learned automatically from training data based on edge features. The empirical results show that our approach can lead to significantly improved classification performance compared to several baseline approaches.
2010149	Formulating effective questions for community-based question answering Community-based Question Answering (CQA) services have become a major venue for people's information seeking on the Web. However, many studies on CQA have focused on the prediction of the best answers for a given question. This paper looks into the formulation of effective questions in the context of CQA. In particular, we looked at effect of contextual factors appended to a basic question on the performance of submitted answers. This study analysed a total of 930 answers returned in response to 266 questions that were formulated by 46 participants. The results show that adding a questionnaire's personal and social attribute to the question helped improve the perceptions of answers both in information seeking questions and opinion seeking questions.
2010151	ClusteringWiki: personalized and collaborative clustering of search results How to organize and present search results plays a critical role in the utility of search engines. Due to the unprecedented scale of the Web and diversity of search results, the common strategy of ranked lists has become increasingly inadequate, and clustering has been considered as a promising alternative. Clustering divides a long list of disparate search results into a few topic-coherent clusters, allowing the user to quickly locate relevant results by topic navigation. While many clustering algorithms have been proposed that innovate on the automatic clustering procedure, we introduce ClusteringWiki, the first prototype and framework for personalized clustering that allows direct user editing of clustering results. Through a Wiki interface, the user can edit and annotate the membership, structure and labels of clusters for a personalized presentation. In addition, the edits and annotations can be shared among users as a mass collaborative way of improving search result organization and search engine utility.
2010152	OrientSTS: spatio-temporal sequence searching in flickr Nowadays, due to the increasing user requirements of efficient and personalized services, a perfect travel plan is urgently needed. However, at present it is hard for people to make a personalized traveling plan. Most of them follow other people's general travel trajectory. So only after finishing their travel, do they know which scene is their favorite, which is not, and what is the perfect order of visits. In this research we propose a novel spatio-temporal sequence (STS) searching, which mainly includes two steps. Firstly, we propose a novel method to detect tourist features of every scene, and its difference in different seasons. Secondly, combined with personal profile and scene features, a set of interesting scenes will be chosen and each scene has a specific weight for each user. The goal of our research is to provide the traveler with the STS, which passes through as many chosen scenes as possible with the maximum weight and the minimum distance within his travel time. We propose a method based on topic model to detect scene features, and provide two approximate algorithms to mine STS: a local optimization algorithm and a global optimization algorithm. System evaluations have been conducted and the performance results show the efficiency.
2010153	A toolkit for knowledge base population The main goal of knowledge base population (KBP) is to distill entity information (e.g., facts of a person) from multiple unstructured and semi-structured data sources, and incorporate the information into a knowledge base (KB). In this work, we intend to release an open source KBP toolkit that is publicly available for research purposes.
2010154	iMecho: a context-aware desktop search system In this demo, we present iMecho, a context-aware desktop search system to help users get more relevant results. Different from other desktop search engines, iMecho ranks results not only by the content of the query, but also the context of the query. It employs an Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based user model, which is learned from user's activity logs, to estimate the query context when he submits the query. The results from keyword search are re-ranked by their relevances to the context with acceptable overhead.
2010155	Visualizing and querying semantic social networks We demonstrate SSNetViz that is developed for integrating, visualizing and querying heterogeneous semantic social networks obtained from multiple information sources. A semantic social network refers to a social network graph with multi-typed nodes and links. We demonstrate various innovative features of SSNetViz with social networks from three information sources covering a similar set of entities and relationships in terrorism domain.
2010156	What-you-retrieve-is-what-you-see: a preliminary cyber-physical search engine The cyber-physical systems (CPS) are envisioned as a class of real-time systems integrating the computing, communication and storage facilities with monitoring and control of the physical world. One interesting CPS application in the mobile Internet is to provide Web search "on the spot" regarding the physical world that a user sees, or literally WYRIWYS (What-You-Retrieve-Is-What-You-See). The objective of our work is to develop server/browser software for supporting WYRIWYS search in our prototype cyber-physical search engine. A WYRIWYS search retrieves visible Web objects and ranks them by their cyber-physical relevances (term, visual, spatial, temporal etc.). This work is distinguished from previous LWS as it provides quality Web search geared with the physical world. Therefore it suggests a very promising solution to cyber-physical Web search.
2010157	QuickView: advanced search of tweets Tweets have become a comprehensive repository for real-time information. However, it is often hard for users to quickly get information they are interested in from tweets, owing to the sheer volume of tweets as well as their noisy and informal nature. We present QuickView, an NLP-based tweet search platform to tackle this issue. Specifically, it exploits a series of natural language processing technologies, such as tweet normalization, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, sentiment analysis, tweet classification, to extract useful information, i.e., named entities, events, opinions, etc., from a large volume of tweets. Then, non-noisy tweets, together with the mined information, are indexed, on top of which two brand new scenarios are enabled, i.e., categorized browsing and advanced search, allowing users to effectively access either the tweets or fine-grained information they are interested in.
2010158	Personalized video: leanback online video consumption Current user interfaces for online video consumption are mostly browser based, lean forward, require constant interaction and provide a fragmented view of the total content available. For easier consumption, the user interface and interactions need to be redesigned for less interruptive and lean back experience. In this paper, we describe Personalized Video, an application that converts the online video experience into a personalized lean back experience. It has been implemented on the Windows platform and integrated with intuitive user interactions like gesture and face recognition. It also supports group personalization for concurrent users.
2010159	GreenMeter: a tool for assessing the quality and recommending tags for web 2.0 applications We present GreenMeter, a tool for assessing the quality and recommending tags for Web 2.0 content. Its goal is to improve tag quality and the effectiveness of various information services (e.g., search, content recommendation) that rely on tags as data sources. We demonstrate an implementation of GreenMeter for the popular Last.fm application.
2010160	JuSe: a picture dictionary query system for children As adults we take for granted our capacity to express our information needs verbally and textually. However, young children also have preferences and information needs, but are just learning to be able to express themselves effectively. Consequently they encounter many barriers when trying to spell, type, and communicate their needs to a 'faceless' search engine text box. Junior Search (JuSe) is an interface that enables preschoolers and young children to search and find consumable online content (such as games for kids, videos, etc.) through adaptable picture dictionaries. Inspired by educational children's toys, rather than search engines designed for adults, JuSe incorporates a learning element by combining audio-visual and textual cues to improve written word recognition and vocabulary skills. JuSe provides an interactive learning environment that allows parents to introduce new words and concepts into the child's lexicon, as well as controlling the content and search queries.
2010161	CrowdTracker: enabling community-based real-time web monitoring CrowdTracker is a community-based web monitoring system optimized for real-time web streams like Twitter, Facebook, and Google Buzz. In this demo summary, we provide an overview of the system and architecture, and outline the demonstration plan.
2010162	The Meta-Dex Suite: generating and analyzing indexes and meta-indexes Our Meta-dex software suite extracts content and index text from a corpus of PDF files, and generates a meta-index that references entries across an entire domain. We provide tools to analyze the individual and integrated indexes, and visualize entries and books within the meta-index. The suite is scalable to very large data sets.

2010164	The TREC files: the (ground) truth is out there Traditional tools for information retrieval (IR) evaluation, such as TREC's trec_eval, have outdated command-line interfaces with many unused features, or 'switches', accumulated over the years. They are usually seen as cumbersome applications by new IR researchers, steepening the learning curve. We introduce a platform-independent application for IR evaluation with a graphical easy-to-use interface: the TREC_Files Evaluator. The application supports most of the standard measures used for evaluation in TREC, CLEF, and elsewhere, such as MAP, P10, P20, and bpref, as well as the Averaged Normalized Modified Retrieval Rank (ANMRR) proposed by MPEG for image retrieval evaluation. Additional features include a batch mode and statistical significance testing of the results against a pre-selected baseline.

2010167	Machine learning for information retrieval In recent years, we have witnessed successful application of machine learning techniques to a wide range of information retrieval problems, including Web search engines, recommendation systems, online advertising, etc. It is thus critical for researchers in the information retrieval community to understand the core machine learning techniques. In order to accommodate audiences with different levels of understanding of machine learning, we divide this tutorial into two sessions: the first session will focus on basic machine learning concepts and tools; in the second session, we will introduce more advanced topics in machine learning, and will present recent developments in machine learning and its application to information retrieval. Each season is self-contained. Session 1: Core Learning Technologies for Information Retrieval. This session of the tutorial will cover the core machine learning methods, basic optimization techniques and key information retrieval applications. In particular, it includes: 1). Core concepts in machine learning, such as supervised learning/unsupervised learning, bias and variance trade off, and probabilistic models; 2). Useful concepts and algorithms in optimization including the first and second order gradient methods, and Expectation and Maximization; 3). The application of machine learning methods to key information retrieval problems including text classification, collaborative filtering, clustering and learning to rank; Session 2: Emerging Learning Technologies for Information Retrieval. This session will cover more advanced machine learning techniques that have started to be utilized in information retrieval applications. In particular, it will cover: 1). Advanced Optimization Techniques including stochastic optimization and smooth minimization; 2). Emerging Learning Techniques such as Multiple-Instance Learning, Active Learning and Semi-supervised Learning. The tutorial will benefit a large body of audience in the information retrieval community, ranging from students who are new to machine learning to the seasoned researchers who would like to understand the recent advance in machine learning for information retrieval research. This tutorial will also benefit the practitioners who apply learning techniques to real-world information retrieval systems.
2010168	Enhancing web search by mining search and browse logs Huge amounts of search log data have been accumulated in various search engines. Currently, a commercial search engine receives billions of queries and collects tera-bytes of log data on any single day. Other than search log data, browse logs can be collected by client-side browser plug-ins, which record the browse information if users' permissions are granted. Such massive amounts of search/browse log data, on the one hand, provide great opportunities to mine the wisdom of crowds and improve web search results. On the other hand, designing effective and efficient methods to clean, model, and process large scale log data also presents great challenges. In this tutorial, we will focus on mining search and browse log data for search engines. We will start with an introduction of search and browse log data and an overview of frequently-used data summarization in log mining. We will then elaborate how log mining applications enhance the five major components of a search engine, namely, query understanding, document understanding, query-document matching, user understanding, and monitoring and feedbacks. For each aspect, we will survey the major tasks, fundamental principles, and state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and future trends of log data mining. The goal of this tutorial is to provide a systematic survey on large-scale search/browse log mining to the IR community. It may help IR researchers to get familiar with the core challenges and promising directions in log mining. At the same time, this tutorial may also serve the developers of web information retrieval systems as a comprehensive and in-depth reference to the advanced log mining techniques.
2010169	A new look at old tricks: the fertile roots of current research As we face an explosion of potential new applications for the fundamental concepts and technologies of information retrieval, ranging from ad ranking to social media, from collaborative recommending to question answering systems, many researchers are spending unnecessary time reinventing ideas and relationships that are buried in the prehistory of information retrieval (which, for many researchers, means anything published before they entered graduate school). A lot of the ideas that surface as "new" in today's super-heated research environment have very firm roots in earlier developments in fields as diverse as citation analysis and pattern recognition. The purpose of this tutorial is to survey those roots, and their relation to the contemporary fruits on the tree of information retrieval, and to separate, as much as is possible in an era of increasing secrecy about methods, the problems to be solved, the algorithms for solving them, and the heuristics that are the bread and butter of a working operation. Participants will become familiar with roots in Pattern Analysis, Statistics, Information Science and other sources of key ideas that reappear in the current development of Information Retrieval as it applies to Search Engines, Social Media, and Collaborative Systems. They will be able to separate problems from algorithms, and algorithms from heuristics, in the application of these ideas to their own research and/or development activities. Course materials will be made available on a Web site two weeks prior to the tutorial. They will include links to relevant software; links to publications that will be discussed; and mechanisms for chat among the tutorial participants, before, during and after the tutorial.
2010171	Practical online retrieval evaluation Online evaluation is amongst the few evaluation techniques available to the information retrieval community that is guaranteed to reflect how users actually respond to improvements developed by the community. Broadly speaking, online evaluation refers to any evaluation of retrieval quality conducted while observing user behavior in a natural context. However, it is rarely employed outside of large commercial search engines due primarily to a perception that it is impractical at small scales. The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize information retrieval researchers with state-of-the-art techniques in evaluating information retrieval systems based on natural user clicking behavior, as well as to show how such methods can be practically deployed. In particular, our focus will be on demonstrating how the Interleaving approach and other click based techniques contrast with traditional offline evaluation, and how these online methods can be effectively used in academic-scale research. In addition to lecture notes, we will also provide sample software and code walk-throughs to showcase the ease with which Interleaving and other click-based methods can be employed by students, academics and other researchers.
2010172	Web retrieval: the role of users Web retrieval methods have evolved through three major steps in the last decade or so. They started from standard document-centric IR in the early days of the Web, then made a major step forward by leveraging the structure of the Web, using link analysis techniques in both crawling and ranking challenges. A more recent, no less important but maybe more discrete step forward, has been to enter the user in this equation in two ways: (1) Implicitly, through the analysis of usage data captured by query logs, and session and click information in general; the goal here being to improve ranking as well as to measure user's happiness and engagement; (2) Explicitly, by offering novel interactive features; the goal here being to better answer users' needs. This half day tutorial covers the user-related challenges associated with the implicit and explicit role of users in Web retrieval. More specifically, we review and discuss challenges associated with: (1) Usage data analysis and metrics - It is critical to monitor how users take advantage and interact with Web retrieval systems, as this implicit relevant feedback aggregated at a large scale, can provide insights on users' underlying intent as well as approximate quite accurately the level of success of a given feature. Here we have to consider not only clicks statistics, the sequences of queries, the time spent in a page, the number of actions per session, etc. This is the focus of the first part of the tutorial. (2) User interaction - Given the intrinsic problems posed by the Web, the key challenge for the user is to conceive a good query to be submitted to the search system, one that leads to a manageable and relevant answer. The retrieval system must assist users during two key stages of interaction: efore the query is fully expressed and after the results are returned. After quite some stagnation on the front-end of Web retrieval, we have seen numerous novel interactive features appear in the last 3 to 4 years, as the leading commercial search engines seem to compete for users' attention. The second part of the tutorial will be dedicated to explicit user interaction. We will introduce novel material (as compared to previous versions of this tutorial that were given at SIGIR'2010, WSDM'2011 and ECIR'2011) in order to reflect recent Web search features such as Google Instant or Yahoo! Direct Search. The goal of this tutorial is to teach the key principles and technologies behind the activities and challenges briefly outlined above, bring new understanding and insights to the attendees, and hopefully foster future research. A previous version of this tutorial was offered at the ACM SIGIR'2010, WSDM'2011 and ECIR'2011.
2010173	Information organization and retrieval with collaboratively generated content Proliferation of ubiquitous access to the Internet enables millions of Web users to collaborate online on a variety of activities. Many of these activities result in the construction of large repositories of knowledge, either as their primary aim (e.g., Wikipedia) or as a by-product (e.g., Yahoo! Answers). In this tutorial, we will discuss organizing and exploiting Collaboratively Generated Content (CGC) for information organization and retrieval. Specifically, we intend to cover two complementary areas of the problem: (1) using such content as a powerful enabling resource for knowledge-enriched, intelligent representations and new information retrieval algorithms, and (2) development of supporting technologies for extracting, filtering, and organizing collaboratively created content. The unprecedented amounts of information in CGC enable new, knowledge-rich approaches to information access, which are significantly more powerful than the conventional word-based methods. Considerable progress has been made in this direction over the last few years. Examples include explicit manipulation of human-defined concepts and their use to augment the bag of words (cf. Explicit Semantic Analysis), using large-scale taxonomies of topics from Wikipedia or the Open Directory Project to construct additional class-based features, or using Wikipedia for better word sense disambiguation. However, the quality and comprehensiveness of collaboratively created content vary widely, and in order for this resource to be useful, a significant amount of preprocessing, filtering, and organization is necessary. Consequently, new methods for analyzing CGC and corresponding user interactions are required to effectively harness the resulting knowledge. Thus, not only the content repositories can be used to improve IR methods, but the reverse pollination is also possible, as better information extraction methods can be used for automatically collecting more knowledge, or verifying the contributed content. This natural connection between modeling the generation process of CGC and effectively using the accumulated knowledge suggests covering both areas together in a single tutorial. The intended audience of the tutorial includes IR researchers and graduate students, who would like to learn about the recent advances and research opportunities in working with collaboratively generated content. The emphasis of the tutorial is on comparing the existing approaches and presenting practical techniques that IR practitioners can use in their research. We also cover open research challenges, as well as survey available resources (software tools and data) for getting started in this research field.
2010175	Persistence in the ephemeral: utilizing repeat behaviors for multi-session personalized search As the abundance of information on the Internet grows, an increasing burden is placed on the user to specify his or her query precisely in order to avoid extraneous results that may be relevant, but not useful. At the same time, users have a tendency to repeat their search behaviors, seeking the same URL (re-finding) as well as issuing the same query (re-searching). These repeated actions reveal a form of user preference that the search engine can utilize to personalize the results. In our approach, we personalize search results related to ongoing tasks, allowing for a different degree of strength of interest, and diversity of interest per task. We focus on high valued queries; queries that are both related to past queries and will be related to future queries given the ongoing nature of the task.
2010176	Search engines that learn online The goal of my research is to develop self-learning search engines, that can learn online, i.e., directly from interactions with actual users. Such systems can continuously adapt to user preferences throughout their lifetime, leading to better search performance in settings where expensive manual tuning is infeasible. Challenges that are addressed in my work include the development of effective online learning to rank algorithms for IR, user aspects, and evaluation.
2010177	Query expansion based on a semantic graph model Query expansion is a classical topic in the field of information retrieval, which is proposed to bridge the gap between searchers' information intents and their queries. Previous researches usually expand queries based on document collections, or some external resources such as WordNet and Wikipedia [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. However, it seems that independently using one of these resources has some defects, document collections lack semantic information of words, while WordNet and Wikipedia may not include domain-specific knowledge in certain document collection. Our work aims to combine these two kinds of resources to establish an expansion model which represents not only domain-specific information but also semantic information. In our preliminary experiments, we construct a two-layer word graph and use Random-Walk algorithm to calculate the weights of each term in pseudo-relevance feedback documents, then select the highest weighted term to expand original query. The first layer of the word graph contains terms in related documents, while the second layer contains semantic senses corresponding to these terms. These terms and semantic senses are treated as vertices of the graph and connected with each other by all possible relationships, such as mutual information and semantic similarities. We utilized mutual information, semantic similarity and uniform distribution as the weight of term-term relation, sense-sense relation and word-sense relation respectively. Though these experiments show that our expansion outperform original queries, we are troubled with some difficult problems. Given the framework of semantic graph model, we need more effort to find out an optimal graph to represent the relationships between terms and their semantic senses. We utilized a two-layer graph model in our preliminary research, where terms from different documents are treated equally. Maybe we can introduce the document as a third layer in future work, where we can differ the same terms in different documents according to document relevance and context. Then we need appropriately represent initial weights of this words, senses and relationships. Various measures for weights of terms and term relations have been proved effective in other information retrieval tasks, such as TFIDF, mutual information (MI), but there is little research on weights for semantic senses and their relations. For polysemous words, we add all of their semantic senses to the graph and assume that these senses are uniformly distributed. Actually, it is not precise for a word in a special document and query. As we know, a polysemous word may have only one or two senses in a document, and they are not uniformly distributed. Give a word, what we should do is to determine its word senses in a relevant document and estimate the distribution of these senses. Word sense disambiguation may help us in this problem. Then, there are many methods to compute word similarity according to WordNet, which we use to represent the weights of relationships between word senses. Varelas et al implemented some popular methods to compute semantic similarity by mapping terms to an ontology and examining their relationships in that ontology [4]. We also need to know which algorithm for semantic similarity is most suitable for our model. Additional, WordNet is suitable to calculate word similarity but not suitable to measure word relevance. The inner hyperlinks of Wikipedia could help us to calculate word relevance. We wish to find an effective way to combine the similarity measure from WordNet and relevance measure from Wikipedia, which may completely reflect word relationships.
2010178	Descriptive modelling of text classification and its integration with other IR tasks Nowadays, Information Retrieval (IR) systems have to deal with multiple sources of data available in different formats. Datasets can consist of complex and heterogeneous objects with relationships between them. In addition, information needs can vary wildly and they can include different tasks. As a result, the importance of flexibility in IR systems is rapidly growing. This fact is specially important in environments where the information required at different moments is very different and its utility may be contingent on timely implementation. In these cases, how quickly a new problem is solved is as important as how well you solve it. Current systems are usually developed for specific cases. It implies that too much engineering effort is needed to adapt them when new knowledge appears or there are changes in the requirements. Furthermore, heterogeneous and linked data present greater challenges, as well as the simultaneous application of different tasks. This research proposes the usage of descriptive approaches for three different purposes: the modelling of the specific task of Text Classification (TC), focusing on knowledge and complex data exploitation; the flexible application of models to different tasks; and the simultaneously application of different IR-tasks. This investigation will contribute to the long-term goal of achieving a descriptive and composable IR technology that provides a modular framework that knowledge engineers can compose into a task-specific solution. The ultimate goal is to develop a flexible framework that offers classifiers, retrieval models, information extractors, and other functions. In addition, those functional blocks could be customised to satisfy user needs. Descriptive approaches allow a high-level definition of algorithms which are, in some cases, as compact as mathematical formulations. One of the expected benefits is to make the implementation clearer and the knowledge transfer easier. They allow models from different tasks to be defined as modules that can be "concatenated", processing the information as a pipeline where some of the outputs of one module are the input of the following one. This combination involves minimum engineering effort due to the paradigm's "Plug & Play" capabilities offered by its functional syntax. This solution provides the flexibility needed to customise and quickly combine different IR-tasks and/or models. Classification is a desired candidate for being part of a flexible IR framework because it can be required in several situations for different purposes. In particular, descriptive approaches will improve its modelling with complex and heterogeneous objects. Furthermore, we aim to show how this approach allows to apply TC models for ad-hoc retrieval (and vice versa) and their simultaneous application for complex information needs. The main hypothesis of this research is that a seamless approach for modelling TC and its integration with other IR-tasks will provide a general framework for rapid prototyping and modelling of solutions for specific users. In addition, it will allow new complex models that take into account relationships and inference from large ontologies. The importance of flexibility for information systems and the exploitation of complex information and knowledge from heterogeneous sources are the main points for discussion. The main challenges are expressiveness and scalability. Abstraction improves flexibility and maintainability. However, it limits the modelling power. A balance between abstraction and expressiveness has to be reached. On the other hand, scalability has been traditionally a challenge for descriptive modelling. Our goal is to prove the feasibility of our approach for real-scale environments.

2010181	Improving query and result list adaptation in personalized multilingual information retrieval A general characteristic of Information Retrieval (IR) and Multilingual IR (MIR) [5] systems is that if the same query was submitted by different users, the system would yield the same results, regardless of the user. On the other hand, Adaptive Hypermedia (AH) systems operate in a personalized manner where the services are adapted to the user [1]. Personalized IR (PIR) is motivated by the success in both areas, IR and AH [4]. IR systems have the advantage of scalability and AH systems have the advantage of satisfying individual user needs. The majority of studies in PIR literature have focused on monolingual IR, and relatively little work has been done concerning multilingual IR. This PhD research study aims to improve personalization in MIR systems, by improving the relevance of multilingual search results with respect to the user and not just the query. The study investigates how to model different aspects of a multilingual search user. Information about users can be demographic information, such as language and country, or information about the user's search interests. This information can be gathered explicitly by asking the user to supply the required information or implicitly by inferring the information from the user's search history. The study will then investigate how to exploit the modeled user information to personalize the user's multilingual search by performing query and result list adaptation. The main research questions that are addressed in this study are: how to improve the relevance of search results with respect to individual users in PMIR and how to construct profiles that represent aspects and interests of a multilingual search user. So far, the work carried out for this study included: (1) a proposed framework for the delivery and evaluation of PMIR [3]; and (2) exploratory experiments with search history and collection (result) re-ranking on a dataset of multilingual search logs [2]. The next stage of experimentation will involve the investigation and development of algorithms for: (1) constructing multilingual user profiles; (2) pre-translation and post-translation query expansion based on terms from the user profile; and (3) result list re-ranking based on the user's interests, and preferred language. Two types of experiments will be conducted in an in-lab setting, with a group of users from different linguistic backgrounds. In the first set of experiments, users will be asked to use a baseline web search system for their daily search activities over a period of time. The baseline system will be wrapped around one of the major search engines. Interactions with the system will be logged, and part of this information will be used for training the system (constructing user profiles from text of queries and clicked documents); the other part (remaining queries) will be used for testing the effectiveness of the query adaptation and result list adaptation algorithms, where the users will be asked to provide some personal relevance judgements. In the second set of experiments, the users will be asked to use the PMIR system to fulfill a number of defined search tasks. Quantitative and qualitative techniques will be used to evaluate different aspects of the experiments, including: (1) retrieval effectiveness, which can be measured using standard IR metrics; (2) user's performance on search tasks, which can be measured in terms of time and number of actions needed to fulfill the tasks; (3) user profile accuracy, which can be assessed by questionnaires that indicate how well the user profile depicted the users' search interests; and (4) usability and user satisfaction, which can be assessed using standard system usability questionnaires.
2010182	Using k-Top retrieved web snippets to date temporalimplicit queries based on web content analysis The World Wide Web (WWW) is a huge information network from which retrieving and organizing quality relevant content remains an open question for mostly all ambiguous queries. As an example, many queries have temporal implicit intents associated with them but they are not inferred by search engines. Inferring the user intentions and the period he has in mind, may therefore play an extremely important role in the improvement of the results. Our work goes in this direction. We aim to introduce a temporal analysis framework for analyzing documents in a temporal dimension in order to identify and understand the temporal nature of any given query, namely implicit ones. Our analysis is not based on metadata, but on the exploitation of temporal information from the content itself, particularly within web snippets, which are interesting pieces of concentrated information, where time clues, especially years, often appear. Our intention is to develop a language-independent solution and to model the degree of relationship between the terms and dates identified. This is the core part of the framework and the basis for both temporal query understanding and search results exploration, such as temporal clustering. We believe that inferring this knowledge is a very important step in the process of adding a temporal dimension to IR systems, thus disambiguating a large class of queries for which search engines continue to fail.
2010183	Domain-specific information retrieval using rcommenders The continuing increase in the volume of information available in our daily lives is creating ever greater challenges for people to find personally useful information. One approach used to addressing this problem is Personalized Information Retrieval (PIR). PIR systems collect a user's personal information from both implicit and explicit sources to build a user profile with the objective of giving retrieval results which better meet their individual user information needs than a standard Information Retrieval (IR) system. However, in many situations there may be no opportunity to learn about the specific interests of a user and build a personal model when this user is querying on a new topic, e.g. when a user visits a museum or exhibition which is unrelated to their normal search interests. Under this condition, the experiences and behaviours of other previous users, who have made similar queries, could be used to build a model of user behavior in this domain. My PhD proposes to focus on the development of new and innovative methods of domain-specific IR. My work seeks to combine recommender algorithms trained using previous search behaviours from different searchers with a standard ranked IR method to form a domain-specific IR model to improve the search effectiveness for a user entering a query without personal prior search history on this topic. The challenges for my work are: how to provide users better results; how to train and evaluate the methods proposed in my work.

2010185	Multidimensional search result diversification: diverse search results for diverse users Hundreds of millions of people today rely on Web based Search Engines to satisfy their information needs. In order to meet the expectations of this vast and diverse user population, the search engine should present a list of results such that the probability of satisfying the average user is maximized. This leads us to the problem of Search Result Diversification. Given a user submitted query, the search engine should include results that are relevant to the user query and at the same time, diverse enough to meet the expectations of diverse user populations. However, it is not clear in what respect the results should be diversified. Much of the current work in diversity focuses on ambiguous and underspecified queries and tries to include results corresponding to diverse interpretations of the ambiguous query. This is not always sufficient. My analysis of a commercial web search engine's logs reveals that even for well-specified informational queries, click entropy is very high indicating that different users prefer different types of documents. Very recently, a diversification algorithm fine-tuned for such informational queries has been proposed. Further, high click entropies were also observed for a large fraction of transactional queries. One major goal of my PhD thesis will then be to identify the various possible dimensions along which the search results can be diversified. Having such an information will enhance our understanding about the expectations of an average user from the search engine. By utilizing aggregate statistics about queries, users and their interaction with the search engine for different queries, more concrete evidences about diverse user preferences as well as relative importance of different diversity dimensions can be derived. Once we know different diversity dimensions, the next natural question is: given a query, how can we determine the diversification requirement best suited for the query? For some queries sub-topic coverage may be more important while for others diversification with respect to document source or stylistics might be important. This problem is related to the problem of selective diversification where the goal is to identify queries for which diversification techniques should be used. However, in addition, we are also interested in identifying different diversity classes a given query belongs to. Further, for some queries it may be required to diversify along multiple diversity dimensions. In such cases, it is also important to determine the relative importance of different diversity dimensions for the given query. By utilizing past user interaction data, query level features (like query clarity, entropy, lexical features etc.) and document level features (e.g. popularity, content quality, previous click history etc.), classifiers for diversification requirements can be developed. Given a user query, once we know the type of diversity requirements for the user, an appropriate diversification technique is required. I would like to study the problem of simultaneously diversifying search results along multiple dimensions, as discussed above. One possible way here could be to build upon the nugget based framework introduced by Clarke et al. where we represent each document as a set of nuggets, each nugget corresponding to a diversity dimension.
2010187	Sensor-aided mobile information management and retrieval The number of "smart" mobile devices such as wireless phones and tablet computers has been rapidly growing. These mobile devices are equipped with a variety of sensors such as camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, NFC, WiFi, GPS, etc. These sensors can be used to capture images and voice, detect motion patterns, and predict locations, to name just a few. This keynote depicts techniques in configuration, calibration, computation, and fusion for improving sensor performance and conserving power consumption. We also present novel mobile information management and retrieval applications that can benefit a great deal from enhanced sensor technologies.
2010188	Predicting eBay listing conversion At eBay Market Place, listing conversion rate can be measured by number of items sold divided by number of items in a sample set. For a given item, conversion rate can also be treated as the probability of sale. By investigating eBay listings' transactional patterns, as well as item attributes and user click-through data, we developed conversion models that allow us to predict a live listing's probability of sale. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of such conversion models. These models are highly valuable in analysis of inventory quality and ranking. Our work reveals the uniqueness of sales-oriented search at eBay and its similarity to general web search problems.
2010190	Review of MSR-Bing web scale speller challenge In this paper, we provide an overview of the MSR-Bing Web Scale Speller Challenge of 2011.

The design and the evaluation methods are also reviewed, and the online resources that will remain publicly available to the community are also described. The Challenge will culminate in a workshop after the time of the writing where the top prize winners will publish their approaches. The main findings and the lessons learned will be summarized and shared in the Industry Track presentation accompanying this paper.

253178	Document presentation and query formulation in Muse Several problems of document presentation and query, formulation arising in systems dealing with multimedia documents are discussed. Examples from a prototype distributed multimedia document filing system are described.
253180	An approach to multimedia information management The integrated management of multimedia information, that is of complex information consisting of conventional data, text, graphics, images and voice, is of great interest not only in fields like information Retrieval, Office Automation, Computer Aided Instruction, Computer Aided Design, but also in other emerging fields such as Tourist Applications, Computer generated films, Newspapers and magazines production, and so on. In this paper the definition of multimedia object, partially derived from the ECMA standard “Office Document Architecture”, is given and an approach to multimedia information management is proposed. A multilevel environment, where multimedia information can be handled, stored and retrieved and the inner level of which consists of a general purpose Multimedia Data Base Management System (MDBMS), is described. They are outlined the main functionalities that languages which describe and manipulate multimedia objects should provide.
253183	Methodological issues for the design of an office information server: focal topics for the analysis from an office system perspective This paper deal with the necessity of consideration of organizational and user requirements to create the basis for the successful design of future office information servers. Today volumes of the order of 10.000 to 50.000 multimode documents and 1 to 10 million documents at a company level (companies with over 1000 employees) per system have to be archived. The average amount of filing is 12 to 16 running metres of paper per year, with an increasing tendency (Ben84). However the shortcoming of systems of today is not the incapability of storage of big amounts of information but the fact they only support particular (and well structured) office tasks in an operative way. Future systems have to support all kind of work (procedures) people do in an office, consider the strategic and operative goals of the particular office and take the user behaviours especially their knowledge to solve problems and the individual kind of doing their jobs (e.g. search strategies, reminder functions) into account. Analysis methods for the collection of data for the design of office systems have mostly been developed in the context of office automation to develop systems to support particular tasks, to restructure offices to improve the profitability of the company. Because of that fact, these methods must be quite extended to supply data which are suited for the successful design and development of future office information servers. Focal topics of the analysis from an office system perspective are: information generation and location, consistency and permanence, work support, information handling and manipulation, access right and confidentiality, accountability, information flow and use of abstractions. Detailed dimensions concerning these areas are posted in this paper.
253192	Text compression using prediction In the compression of the text files, the dependencies between the successive characters should be exploited to as great an extent as possible. There are two obvious possibilities: either to detect and encode often occurring character strings, or to encode successors of character blocks. This paper presents two methods based on the latter approach. In the first method we encode only the most probable successors of blocks, whereas in the second we encode them all, using the knowledge of their distribution. The second method uses recursion to store effectively the dependencies between the characters and this results in good compression gains in practical cases.
253194	CALIN: a user interface based on a simple natural language In the framework of an application dealing with classified advertisement matching, a dedicated user interface has been designed and implemented. Its major originality relies on the user's language which is neither an artificial one, nor the usual natural language, but in fact the ad language. Beyond the language itself, the interface provides some facilities such as paraphrasing or explanations when needed. An expert system approach has been adopted and the interface is built up from the knowledge given by experts. They are in charge of describing what are acceptable ads, from both syntax and semantics points of view … Although designed in the context of ad matching, that interface may interestingly be adapted to other retrieving systems. We especially think that an adlike language is well-suited to ask questions since it is based on natural simple expressions. A given sentence involves terms that stand for elementary conditions applying to instances of a logical object contained inside the information system. This approach defines a complete interface, involving both a language and aiding capabilities. Moreover, the query language, although less powerful, represents a compromise between artificial languages and the usual natural language, with respect to ergonomics and analysis complexity.
253216	The using of inference mechanisms to improve the retrieval facilities from large relational databases This paper describes the development of “intelligent” tools aimed at improving the retrieval facilities from large relational databases. When a natural language query does not correspond directly to the data contained in the base, a class of inferential processes called “transformations” is applied. The original query is thus automatically converted into one or more “semantically close” ones. “Semantically close” means that the data possibly obtained with the new query will give useful information about the data originally searched for.
253220	Performance of self-taught documents: exploiting co-relevance structure in a document collection In this paper we study the behavior of an information retrieval system in which index terms are assigned at random to both documents and requests. The random indexing is then modified by means of a feedback mechanism derived from a normal probability model and applied to both the request and document representations. Of interest is the convergence properties of the representation vectors. After few feedback iterations, it is found that well defined clusters form that accurately represent the corelevance structure among the documents—in effect the feedback mechanism has permitted the documents to index themselves. This approach offers an interesting way to extend the dimensionality of the indexing vocabulary. Both this application and a theoretical analysis of the impact of extending the indexing vocabulary are discussed.
253504	Graphical information resources: maps and beyond The rise of computer graphics offers a new challenge for information retrieval: how to search and retrieve information which is partly or wholly graphical. As an example, procedures for handling geographical information, such as street maps and directories are explained. With this data, it is possible to find routes on maps, retrieve locations and names of people or businesses, and draw maps. But a comparison of these programs with programs for face processing or computer typesetting makes clear how far we are from general purpose routines. Today successful graphics routines contain a great deal of local domain knowledge. There is no analog of the simple keyword systems that handle textual documents in any subject area. Just as computational linguists have found that subject matter expertise is necessary to do really sophisticated processing of English, it seems also necessary to sophisticated processing of pictures; the difference is that we don't know how to do unsophisticated processing of graphics.
253507	Handling multiple data bases in document retrieval There is no such thing as a standard document. Bibliographic information comes in a wide variety of formats. Existing retrieval systems handle different document styles either by creating an artificial document type or by providing different and independent data bases. Neither approach seems satisfactory. In this paper we describe a data model which we feel is more appropriate for document representation and show it can handle the multiple document type problem quite naturally.
253508	Theoretical measure in P/Q document spaces Early work on the application of user interest profiles to aid in the interpretation of queries in an information retrieval system developed the concepts of retrieval subspaces that are either ellipsoids or Cassini ovals. This report extends the theoretical basis of these models, exploring other models and the effect of different metrics on the conceptual retrieval subspace.

253513	Processing free-text input to obtain a database of medical information The Linguistic String Project of New York University has developed computer programs that convert the information in free-text documents of a technical specialty into a structured form suitable for mapping into a relational database. The processing is based upon the restrictions on the use of language that are characteristic of the subject matter and the document type. These restrictions are summarized in a “sublanguage grammar” that provides a set of word classes and formulas corresponding to the objects and relations of interest in the domain. The programs are independent of the particular sublanguage grammar employed. The application to narrative patient records will be described and the applicability of the methods to other domains discussed.
253516	P-trees: storage efficient multiway trees A new variation of high order multiway tree structures, the P-tree is presented. P-trees have average access costs that are significantly better than those of B-trees and are no worse (and often better) in storage utilization. Unlike compact B-trees, they can be maintained dynamically, and unlike dense multiway trees and B-trees, their associated insertion algorithm, which is also presented, is cheap and involves (at most) a very localized rearrangement of keys.
253518	Optimization of a hierarchical file organization for spelling correction A spelling program using a hierarchically organized file seems to be promising, since it can correct more than common typing mistakes. However, its speed of detecting spelling errors in the inputs is rather slow. Here some techniques of modifying the program to improve the speed are presented.
253519	Designing an information retrieval interface based on user characteristics With the increasing number of information retrieval systems and databases available and the increasing demand of end users to utilize the systems, a need exists for improved interfaces and improved training mechanisms. This paper reports on a project to develop an integrated online instruction and assistance system to be used as a “front end” to the U.S. Department of Energy's RECON retrieval system. The conceptual framework for the interface design is based on individual characteristics of its current and prospective users, predominantly scientists conducting energy research. We are building a prototype based on information gained from interviews with scientists using the system (either directly or through a search intermediary) and interviews with search intermediaries. The paper reports on research in progress, including the results of the interviews and the preliminary design of the interface. The conference presentation will include a fuller description of the interface than can be specified here.

253528	On retrieval tests with an inhomogeneous query collection Retrieval tests are often performed with an inhomogeneous query collection, that means certain properties of queries vary within the collection. This paper investigates under which conditions this inhomogeneity may lead to a loss of measurement precision and validity and should be controlled by an experimental design. In particular, interrelationships between the design of a retrieval test, inhomogeneity of the query collection and measurement theoretical properties of the evaluation measure will be discussed. Based on these results, some recommendations for experimental design of retrieval tests are presented.
253529	A testbed for information retrieval research: the Utah retrieval system architecture The Utah Retrieval System Architecture provides an excellent testbed for the development and testing of new algorithms or techniques for information retrieval. URSA™ is a message-based structure capable of running on a variety of system configurations, ranging from a single mainframe processor to a system distributed across a number of dissimilar processors. It can readily support a variety of specialized backend processors, such as high-speed search engines. The architecture divides the components of a text retrieval system into two classes: servers and clients. A triple of servers (index, search, and document access) for each database provide the capabilities normally associated with a retrieval system. Possible clients for these servers include a window-based user interface, whose query language can be easily modified, a connection to a mainframe host processor, or Al-based query modification programs that wish to use the database. Any module in the system can be replaced by a new module using a different algorithm as long as the new module complies with the message formats for that function. In fact, with some care this module switch can occur while the system is running, without affecting the users. A monitor program collects statistics on all system messages, giving information regarding query complexity, processing time for each module, queueing times, and bandwidths between every module. This paper discusses the background of URSA and its structure, with particular emphasis on the features that make it a good testbed for information retrieval techniques.
253530	An integrated hierarchical file organization for data selection and retrieval This paper presents an approach, the IHF approach, of organising data of a hierarchical structure into one single file, maintaining adequate representation of the relationships among the data. The IHF approach requires each data item be stored in the basic form of name-value pair and consists in assigning each data item with identifier which provides not only the data item identification but also an implicit identification of the hierarchical structural relationships among groups of data items. Data selection and retrieval operations are effectively implemented with the concept of masking of relevant identifier bits, without resorting to any linking devices. Application of the IHF technique on CAFS is examined.
253532	ANNOD: a navigator of natural-language organized (textual) data ANNOD is the name of a system developed at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), which implements a set of linguistic and empirical techniques that permit retrieval of natural language information in response to natural language queries. The system is based on Dr. Gerard Salton's SMART [1] document retrieval system and is presently implemented on a mini-computer as part of an Interactive TExt Management System, ITEMS.[2] Actual experience with retrieval of information from NLM's Hepatitis Knowledge Base (HKB), an encyclopedic hierarchical, full-text file, is presented. The techniques used in ANNOD include: automatic stemming of words, common word deletion, thesaurus expansion, a complex empirical matching (ranking) algorithm (similarity measure), and techniques expressly designed to permit rapid response in a mini-computer environment. Preliminary testing demonstrates high efficiency in identifying portions of a text which are relevant to users.

1009072	A hybrid statistical/linguistic model for generating news story gists In this paper, we describe a News Story Gisting system that generates a 10-word short summary of a news story. This system uses a machine learning technique to combine linguistic, statistical and positional information in order to generate an appropriate summary. We also present the results of an automatic evaluation of this system with respect to the performance of other baseline summarisers using the new ROUGE evaluation metric.
1009073	Image based gisting in CLIR In this paper, we describe research which could lead to a novel approach to gathering an overview of a document in a foreign language. The research explores how much of the meaning of a document could be represented using images by researching the ability of subjects to derive the search term that might have been used to return a set of images from an image library. The Google image search engine was used to retrieve the images for this experiment, which uses English throughout. The results were analysed with respect to a previous paper [1] exploring ability to recognise concrete objects in hierarchies. It was found that there is a tendency to use one particular level of categorization.
1009074	Classifying racist texts using a support vector machine In this poster we present an overview of the techniques we used to develop and evaluate a text categorisation system to automatically classify racist texts. Detecting racism is difficult because the presence of indicator words is insufficient to indicate racist texts, unlike some other text classification tasks. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to automatically categorise web pages based on whether or not they are racist. Different interpretations of what constitutes a term are taken, and in this poster we look at three representations of a web page within an SVM -- bag-of-words, bigrams and part-of-speech tags.
1009075	Discovery of aggregate usage profiles based on clustering information needs We present an alternative technique for discovering aggregate usage profiles from Web access logs. The technique is based on clustering information needs inferred from users' browsing paths. Browsing paths are extracted from users' access logs. Information need is inferred from each browsing path by using the Ostensive Model[1]. The technique is evaluated in a document recommendation application. We compare the performance of our technique against the well-established transaction-based technique proposed in [2]. Based on an initial evaluation, the results are encouraging.
1009077	The effect of back-formulating questions in question answering evaluation An abstract is not available.
1009080	Subwebs for specialized search We describe a method to define and use subwebs, user-defined neighborhoods of the Internet. Subwebs help improve search performance by inducing a topic-specific page relevance bias over a collection of documents. Subwebs may be automatically identified using a simple algorithm we describe, and used to provide highly-relevant topic-specific information retrieval. Using subwebs in a Help and Support topic, we see marked improvements in precision compared to generic search engine results.
1009082	Measuring pseudo relevance feedback & CLIR In this poster, we report on the effects of pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) for a cross language image retrieval task using a test collection. Typically PRF has been shown to improve retrieval performance in previous CLIR experiments based on average precision at a fixed rank. However our experiments have shown that queries in which no relevant documents are returned also increases. Because query reformulation for cross language is likely to be harder than with monolingual searching, a great deal of user dissatisfaction would be associated with this scenario. We propose that an additional effectiveness measure based on failed queries may better reflect user satisfaction than average precision alone.
1009084	Natural language processing for browse help In this paper, we will present three "browsing" systems that should save user's time. The first uses named entities and gives a way to reduce search space. By using a information visualization system, the user can comprehend more easily the content of a corpus or a document. Named entities are highlighted for quick reading, temporal and geographic representation gives a global view of the result of a query. All these browse and search helps seem to be very useful. Nevertheless, an evaluation would give more practical results.
1009085	Triangulation without translation Transitive retrieval and triangulation have been proposed as ways to improve cross-language retrieval quality when translation resources have poor lexical coverage. We demonstrate that cross-language retrieval is viable for European languages with no translation resources at all; that transitive retrieval without translation does not suffer the drop-off in retrieval quality sometimes reported for transitive retrieval with translation; and that triangulation that combines multiple transitive runs with no translation can boost performance over direct translation-free retrieval.
1009087	Evaluation of filtering current news search results We describe an evaluation of result set filtering techniques for providing ultra-high precision in the task of presenting related news for general web queries. In this task, the negative user experience generated by retrieving non-relevant documents has a much worse impact than not retrieving relevant ones. We adapt cost-based metrics from the document filtering domain to this result filtering problem in order to explicitly examine the tradeoff between missing relevant documents and retrieving non-relevant ones. A large manual evaluation of three simple threshold filters shows that the basic approach of counting matching title terms outperforms also incorporating selected abstract terms based on part-of-speech or higher-level linguistic structures. Simultaneously, leveraging these cost-based metrics allows us to explicitly determine what other tasks would benefit from these alternative techniques.
1009090	Learning patterns to answer open domain questions on the web While being successful in providing keyword based access to web pages, commercial search portals still lack the ability to answer questions expressed in a natural language. We present a probabilistic approach to automated question answering on the Web, based on trainable patterns, answer triangulation and semantic filtering. In contrast to the other "shallow" approaches, our approach is entirely self-learning. It does not require any manually created scoring and filtering rules while still performing comparably. It also performs better than other fully trainable approaches.
1009092	Searching databases for sematically-related schemas In this paper, we address the problem of searching schema databases for semantically-related schemas. We first give a method of finding semantic similarity between pair-wise schemas based on tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, word expansion, and ontology matching. We then address the problem of indexing the schema database through a semantic hash table. Matching schemas in the database are found by hashing the query attributes and recording peaks in the histogram of schema hits. Results indicated a 90% improvement in search performance while maintaining high precision and recall.
1009097	Aggregated feature retrieval for MPEG-7 via clustering In this paper, we describe an approach to combining text and visual features from MPEG-7 descriptions of video. A video retrieval process is aligned to a text retrieval process based on the TF*IDF vector space model via clustering of low-level visual features. Our assumption is that shots within the same cluster are not only similar visually but also semantically, to a certain extent. Our experiments on the TRECVID2002 and TRECVID2003 collections show that adding extra meaning to a shot based on the shots from the same cluster is useful when each video in a collection contains a high proportion of similar shots, for example in documentaries.
1009107	Information extraction using two-phase pattern discovery This paper presents a new two-phase pattern (2PP) discovery technique for information extraction. 2PP consists of orthographic pattern discovery (OPD) and semantic pattern discovery (SPD) where the OPD determines the structural features from an identified region of a document and the SPD discovers a dominant semantic pattern for the region via inference, apposition and analogy. Then the discovered pattern is applied back into the region to extract required data items through pattern matching. We evaluated 2PP using 6500 data items and obtained effective result.
1009109	Context sensitive vocabulary and its application in protein secondary structure prediction Protein secondary structure prediction is an important step towards understanding the relation between protein sequence and structure. However, most current prediction methods use features difficult for biologists to interpret. In this paper, we present a new method that applies information retrieval techniques to solve the problem:we extract a context sensitive biological vocabulary for protein sequences and apply text classification methods to predict protein secondary structure. Experimental results show that our method performs comparably to the state-of-art methods. Furthermore, the context sensitive vocabularies can serve as a useful tool to discover meaningful regular expression patterns for protein structures.
1009111	User biased document language modelling Capitalizing on the intuitive underlying assumptions of Language Modelling for Ad-Hoc Retrieval we present a novel approach that is capable of injecting the user's context of the document collection into the retrieval process. The preliminary findings from the evaluation undertaken suggest that improved IR performance is possible under certain circumstances. This motivates further investigation to determine the extent and significance of this improved performance.
1009113	A unified model of literal mining and link analysis for ranking web resources Web link analysis has been proved to provide significant enhancement to the precision of Web search in practice. The PageRank algorithm, which is used in Google Search Engine, plays an important role on improving the quality of its resuls by employing the explicit hyperlink structure among the Web pages. The prestige of Web pages defined by PageRank is purely derived from surfer random walk on the Web graph without textual content content consideration. However, in the practical sense, user surfing behavior is far from random jumping. In this paper, we present a unified model for a more accurate page rank. User's surfing is guided by a probabilistic model that is based on literal matching between connected pages. The result shows that our proposed ranking algorithms do perform better than the original PageRank.
1009116	Refining term weights of documents using term dependencies When processing raw documents in Information Retrieval (IR) System, a term-weighting scheme is used to calculate the importance of each term which occurs in a document. However, most term-weighting schemes assume that a term is independent of the other terms. Term dependency is an indispensable consequence of language use [1]. Therefore, this assumption can make the information of a document being lost. In this paper, we propose new approach to refine term weights of documents using term dependencies discovered from a set of documents. Then, we evaluate our method with two experiments based on the vector space model [2] and the language model [3].
1009117	Multiple sources of evidence for XML retrieval Document-centric XML collections contain text-rich documents, marked up with XML tags. The tags add lightweight semantics to the text. Querying such collections calls for a hybrid query language: the text-rich nature of the documents suggest a content-oriented (IR) approach, while the mark-up allows users to add structural constraints to their IR queries. We will show how evidence for relevancy from different sources helps to answer such hybrid queries. We evaluate our methods using the INEX 2003 test set, and show that structural hints in hybrid queries help to improve retrieval effectiveness.
1009118	Verifying a Chinese collection for text categorization This article describes the development of a free test collection for Chinese text categorization. A novel retrieval-based approach was developed to detect duplicates and label inconsistency in this corpus and in Reuters-21578 for comparison. The method was able to detect certain types of similar and/or duplicated documents that were overlooked by an alternative repetition-based method [1]. Experiments showed that effectiveness was not affected by the confusing documents.
1009120	The patent retrieval task in the fourth NTCIR workshop This paper describes the Patent Retrieval Task in the Fourth NTCIR Workshop, and the test collections produced in this task. We perform the invalidity search task, in which each participant group searches a patent collection for the patents that can invalidate the demand in an existing claim. We also perform the automatic patent map generation task, in which the patents associated with a specific topic are organized in a multi-dimensional matrix.
1009126	Supporting federated information sharing communities In this paper we describe the concept of Federated Information Sharing Communities (FISC), and associated architecture, which provide a way for organisations, distributed workgroups and individuals to build up a federated community based on their common interests over the World Wide Web. To support communities, we develop capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people, their interests and inter-relationships. We focus on providing social awareness "in the large" to help users understand the members within a community and the relationships between them. Within the FISC framework, we provide viewpoint retrieval to enable a user to construct visual contextual views of the community from the perspective of any community member. To evaluate these ideas we develop test beds to compare individual component technologies such as user and group profile construction and similarity matching, and we develop prototypes to explore the broader architecture and usage issues.

1009129	Context-based methods for text categorisation We propose several context-based methods for text categorization. One method, a small modification to the PPM compression-based model which is known to significantly degrade compression performance, counter-intuitively has the opposite effect on categorization performance. Another method, called C-measure, simply counts the presence of higher order character contexts, and outperforms all other approaches investigated.
1009133	Automatic sense disambiguation for acronyms A machine learning methodology for the disambiguation of acronym senses is presented, which starts from an acronym sense dictionary. Training data is automatically extracted from downloaded documents identified from the results of search engine queries. Leave-one-out cross-validation on 9,963 documents with 47 acronym forms achieves accuracy 92.58% and F ß=1 =91.52%.

1008994	Chemoinformatics: an application domain for information retrieval techniques Chemoinformatics is the generic name for the techniques used to represent, store and process information about the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures of chemical molecules [1, 2]. Chemoinformatics has attracted much recent prominence as a result of developments in the methods that are used to synthesize new molecules and then to test them for biological activity. These developments have resulted in a massive increase in the amounts of structural and biological information that is available to support discovery programmes in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries.Chemoinformatics may appear to be far removed from information retrieval (IR), and there are indeed many significant differences, most notably in the use of graph representations to encode chemical molecules, rather than the strings that are used to encode text; however, there are also many similarities between the two fields, and this paper will exemplify some of these relationships. The most obvious area of similarity is in the principal types of database search that are carried out, with both application domains making extensive use of exact match, partial match and best match searching procedures: in the IR context these are known-item searching, Boolean searching and ranked-output searching; in the chemical context, these are structure searching, substructure searching and similarity searching. In IR, there is a natural distinction between an initial ranked-output search and one in which relevance feedback can be employed, where the keywords in the query statement are assigned weights based on their differential occurrences in known-relevant and known-nonrelevant documents. In the chemoinformatics technique called substructural analysis, substructural fragments are assigned weights based on their occurrence in molecules that do possess, and molecules that do not possess, some desired biological activity [3]. The analogy between relevance and biological activity has also resulted in the development of measures to quantify the effectiveness of chemical searching procedures that are based on the standard IR concepts of recall and precision [4].Analogies such as these have provided the basis for some of the chemoinformatics research carried out in Sheffield. The starting point was the recognition that techniques applicable to documents represented by keywords might also be applicable to molecules represented by substructural fragments. This led directly to the introduction of similarity searching, something that is now a standard tool in chemoinformatics software systems; in particular, its use for virtual screening, i.e., the ranking of a database in order of decreasing probability of activity so as to maximize the cost-effectiveness of biological testing [5]. Measures of inter-molecular structural similarity also lie at the heart of systems for clustering chemical databases: just as IR has the Cluster Hypothesis (similar documents tend to be relevant to the same requests) as a basis for document clustering, so the Similar Property Principle (similar molecules tend to have similar properties) has led to clustering becoming a well-established tool for the organization of large chemical databases [6]. More recently, we have applied another IR technique, the use of data fusion to combine different rankings of a database, to chemoinformatics and again found that it is equally applicable in this new domain [7].The many similarities between IR and chemoinformatics that have already been identified suggest that chemoinformatics is a domain of which IR researchers should be aware when considering the applicability of new techniques that they have developed.
1009013	Polynomial filtering in latent semantic indexing for information retrieval Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a well established and effective framework for conceptual information retrieval. In traditional implementations of LSI the semantic structure of the collection is projected into the k -dimensional space derived from a rank- k approximation of the original term-by-document matrix. This paper discusses a new way to implement the LSI methodology, based on polynomial filtering. The new framework does not rely on any matrix decomposition and therefore its computational cost and storage requirements are low relative to traditional implementations of LSI. Additionally, it can be used as an effective information filtering technique when updating LSI models based on user feedback.
1009135	Evaluating content-based filters for image and video retrieval This paper investigates the level of metadata accuracy required for image filters to be valuable to users. Access to large digital image and video collections is hampered by ambiguous and incomplete metadata attributed to imagery. Though improvements are constantly made in the automatic derivation of semantic feature concepts such as indoor, outdoor, face, and cityscape, it is unclear how good these improvements should be and under what circumstances they are effective. This paper explores the relationship between metadata accuracy and effectiveness of retrieval using an amateur photo collection, documentary video, and news video. The accuracy of the feature classification is varied from performance typical of automated classifications today to ideal performance taken from manually generated truth data. Results establish an accuracy threshold at which semantic features can be useful, and empirically quantify the collection size when filtering first shows its effectiveness.
1009136	Semantic video classification by integrating unlabeled samples for classifier training Semantic video classification has become an active research topic to enable more effective video retrieval and knowledge discovery from large-scale video databases. However, most existing techniques for classifier training require a large number of hand-labeled samples to learn correctly. To address this problem, we have proposed a semi-supervised framework to achieve incremental classifier training by integrating a limited number of labeled samples with a large number of unlabeled samples. Specifically, this emi-supervised framework includes: (a) Modeling the semantic video concepts by using the finite mixture models to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects; (b) Developing an adaptive EM algorithm to integrate the unlabeled samples to achieve parameter estimation and model selection simultaneously; The experimental results in a certain domain of medical videos are also provided.
1009138	An implicit system for predicting interests We demonstrate an adaptive search system that works proactively to help searchers find relevant information. The system observes searcher interaction, uses what it sees to model information needs and chooses additional query terms. The system watches for changes in the topic of the search and selects retrieval strategies that reflect the extent to which the topic is seen to change.

1009145	Improving document representation by accumulating relevance feedback (abstract only): the relevance feedback accumulation algorithm This paper presents a document representation improvement technique named the Relevance Feedback Accumulation (RFA) algorithm. Using prior relevance feedback assessments and a data mining measure called support this algorithm improves document representations and generates higher quality indexes. At the same time, the algorithm is efficient and scalable, suited for retrieval systems managing large document collections. The results of the preliminary evaluation reveal that the RFA algorithm is able to reduce the index dimensionality while improving retrieval effectiveness.
1009146	Supporting federated information sharing communities (abstract only) Increasingly, the World Wide Web is being viewed as a means of creating web communities rather than simply as a means of publishing and delivering documents and services. In this research we develop the concept of Federated Information Sharing Communities (FISC), and associated architecture, that enables community-centred information systems to be constructed. Such systems provide a way for organisations, distributed workgroups and individuals to build up a federated community based on their common interests over the World Wide Web. To support communities, we develop capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people, their interests and inter-relationships. We focus on providing social awareness "in the large" to help users understand the members within a community and the relationships between them: who is working on what topic, and who is working with whom. Within the FISC framework, we provide a viewpoint retrieval service to enable a user to construct visual contextual views of the community from the perspective of any community member. To evaluate these ideas we develop test beds to compare individual component technologies such as user and group profile construction and similarity matching, and we develop prototypes (Web Network and "CiteSeer Community") to explore the broader architecture and usage issues.
1009148	Sharing knowledge online (abstract only): a dream or reality? The Web provides a global platform for knowledge sharing. However, several shortcomings still arise from the absence of personalization and collaboration in Web searches. More effective retrieval techniques could be provided by means of transforming explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge. The approach presented in this paper is based on a peer-to-peer architecture and aims at complementing classical Web searches in terms of personalized ranking lists. These local rankings can be accumulated and evaluated in order to supplement the process of knowledge generation by building Virtual Knowledge Communities. Furthermore, the aggregation of ranking lists can be used to identify topics as well as communities of interest. Together with social aspects for community support, a framework for congenial Web search is defined.
1009149	Reliability and verification of natural language text on the world wide web (abstract only) The hypothesis that information on the Web can be verified automatically, with minimal user interaction, will be tested by building and evaluating an interactive system. In this paper, verification is defined as a reasonable determination of the truth or correctness of a statement by examination, research, or comparison with similar text. The system will contain modules for reliability ranking, query processing, document retrieval, and document clustering based on agreement. The query processing and document retrieval components will use standard IR techniques. The reliability module will estimate the likelihood that a statement on the Web can be trusted using standards developed by information scientists, as well as linguistic aspects of the page and the link structure of associated web pages. The clustering module will cluster relevant documents based on whether or not they agree or disagree with the statement to be verified. Relevant references are discussed.
1009151	Understanding combination of evidence using generative probabilistic models for information retrieval (abstract only) Structured documents, rich information needs, and detailed information about users are becoming more pervasive within everyday computing usage. Applications such as Question Answering, reading tutors, and XML retrieval demand more robust retrieval on richly annotated documents. In order to effectively serve these applications, the community will need a better understanding of the combination of evidence. In this work, I propose that the use of simple generative probabilistic models will be an effective framework for these problems. Statistical language models, which are a special case of generative probabilistic models, have been used extensively within recent Information Retrieval research. Their flexibility has been very effective in adapting to numerous tasks and problems. I propose to extend the statistical language modeling framework to handle rich information needs and documents with structural and linguistic annotations. Much of the prior work on combination of evidence has had few well-studied theoretical contributions, so I also propose to develop a sounder theoretical basis which gives more predictable results.
1009152	Discovering and representing the contextual and narrative structure of e-books to support reading and comprehension (abstract only) A person reading a book needs to build an understanding based on the available textual materials. As a result of a survey of users' reading behaviours and of existing e-Book user interfaces, we found that most of these interfaces provide poor support for the actual processes of reading and comprehension. In particular, there is generally minimal support for understanding the overall structure (or contextual structure) and the narrative structure of a book. We propose adapting topic tracking and detection techniques to discover the narrative threads within a book, and hence its narrative structure. The contextual and narrative structures will be presented to the user through purpose-designed visualisations, which will be integrated and linked within a newly developed e-Book browser. We have chosen to use the Bible as our test corpus, as it has a rich narrative structure, and relatively complex contextual structure. Evaluation of the interface, and its components, will be done through field studies involving actual readers of the Bible, to assess the effectiveness of the user interface in enhancing a user's experience.
1009153	Supporting multiple information-seeking strategies in a single system framework (abstract only) This research explores the relationship between information-seeking strategies (ISSs) and information retrieval (IR) system design. When people seek information they engage in a variety of ISSs in order to search for specific items, learn about the contents of the database, evaluate retrieved information, and so on.The theoretical foundations of the work are based on the information-seeking episode model developed by Belkin (1996), and the multi-facet classification scheme of information behaviors proposed by Cool & Belkin (2002).The goal of this research is to construct and evaluate an interactive retrieval system which uses different combinations of IR techniques to support different ISSs. Example IR techniques include comparison using exact and probabilistic matching algorithms; summarization of information objects using titles, snippets or abstracts; visualization techniques such as lists or classified results; and navigation techniques such as scrolling or following links. By designing a retrieval system with diverse strategies in mind, we can adaptively support multiple ISSs, permitting a user to move seamlessly from one strategy to another, choosing instantiations of each support technique tailored to the specific ISS.The research will be conducted in a series of four steps. (1) Develop an object-oriented framework for representing basic IR techniques. (2) Design, implement and evaluate systems which support individual ISSs such as browsing and searching. (3) Specify an interaction structure for guiding and controlling sequences of different supporting techniques.(4) Design, implement, and evaluate a dynamically adaptive system supporting multiple ISSs in comparison to a non-adaptive baseline system.
1076035	The Portinari project: IR helps art and culture In May 30, 1983, The New York Times published the article "Brazil Gathers Archive On Its Painter, Portinari". The author, Warren Hoge, narrates: "/The late Candido Portinari is considered here to be the greatest artist Brazil has ever produced, yet all but a few of his 4,000 paintings are out of public view. They have become dispersed in private collections in so many places that his biographer compared their fate to that of Brazil's 18th-century revolutionary hero Tiradentes, whose body was dismembered and strewn along a 300-mile turnpike. The inaccessibility of Portinari's work is particularly vexing to his enthusiasts because his own dedication to producing an epic view of Brazil for his countrymen was such that he continued painting even after doctors warned that exposure to paint was killing him. He died of lead poisoning at the age of 58. Now, in a pioneering effort for Latin America, a team of experts in Rio is busy assembling the far-flung pieces of Portinari's obra into an exhaustive computerized archive. "/We are trying to rescue what is authentically ours'/, said João Candido Portinari, the painter's 44-year-old son, who is the coordinator of the group of researchers who make their headquarters on the leafy campus of Rio's Pontifical Catholic University. A telecommunications engineer with a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chairman of the university's mathematics department, Mr. Portinari has brought exacting technical standards to the task. Now four years into the project, the 14-member team has compiled photographic, technical. This presentation aims at describing the 26-year effort undertaken by the Portinari Project to locate, document, and record all prints, drawings and paintings created by the Brazilian artist Candido Portinari (1903-1962), as well as all documents. It is important to highlite the role of science and technology in this endeavour. It was fascinating to watch, over the years, how much, as the Portinari Project evolved, the advances of science and technology, and especially those related to IR, were able to address important challenges encountered in its development. In this presentation, a few examples of this process shall be described, such as the problem of identifying false paintings, the digital preservation of color images, the building of a complex multimedia knowledge database, etc. We also present the social work of art education developed in making all this material available /in loco/ to a wide audience in Brazil and abroad, including school children, especially children from poverty-stricken families. This social inclusion action stems from the fact that Portinari was deeply concerned to devoting his life, as an artist and also as a political person, to social and human values. In his speech /Art in the United Nations/ at the .Palais des Nations., Geneve, Switzerland, Von Lauestein Massarani observed that. */Portinari bequeathed to his native Brazil paintings of great poetical intensity. He grew up on the vast coffee plantations of Brodosqui in the state of Sao Paulo and it is this social setting which provided the inspiration for his work. All its human, cultural and religious aspects, captured by Portinari.s brush, reveal him as a .chronicler. of the concerns of twentieth-century Brazil. A rich plastic quality and variety of expressions are qualitites which give singular appeal to this deeply inspired work. His paintings are the successful achievement of his objective throughout his life: to arouse a feeling of the dignity of man, of fraternity and community spirit/*. *From these concerns, faithfully reflected in Portinari.s artistic legacy, we have been able to build an exceedingly powerful tool for developing a social acton that has already involved more than 500,000 children for all over Brazil, as shall be demonstrated in our talk. And finally we present one of the most important results of the project: "Candido Portinari - Catalogue /Raisonné/", published in September 2004, in 5 volumes, containing 4,991 works, with all their images and their technical, bibliographic and historical data. An example of the complexity of this undertaking is the work involved in /dating/ Portinari's oeuvre. Half of the works were undated and, /for each/ of these 2,500 works, it was necessary to cross it with 30,000 documents, to search if in a letter (6,000), in a periodical clipping (12,000), in a historical photograph (1,200), in an oral history recording (74 interviewed, 130-hour total recordings), etc., one could find information that would eventually lead to the date the work was created. The Portinari Project web site (http://www.portinari.org.br) presents all 4,991 paintings, drawing and prints, and all 30,000 entering a word contained in the work's description. The Catalogue /Raisonnß/ also comprises a detailed chrono-biography of the artist's life and times, compiled from the 30,000 documents that form the Portinari Project archives. To complete this 26-year task, the team visited almost all Brazilian states and more than 20 countries in the three Americas, Europe and the Middle Orient.
1076036	The future of media, blogs and innovation: new IR challenges? An axiom of every good investor is not to buy shares when the goodness of them is already into newspapers. Before, the information was circulating in some form, for example from mouth-to-mouth, closed circles, or newsletters. Nowadays the news can also occur in blogs that point to public or private communities that discuss topics that traditional media do not carry or even hide. Nowadays, standard communication media are trapped in a Cartesian or Platonic correspondence assumption. They want to tell us how things really are, how they have occurred, and how they will happen, disregarding a concrete world of problems where opportunities and threats live in real time for people. Searching and exploring the world of blogs can create an acceleration of innovation and a dissolution of the previous status quo. Here, the search unit is not a word, but actions, worries, opportunities, threats, etc. That is, people living and pursuing shared goals with others. Which new searching tools can help to find trends, innovations and ideas taking consciousness in the context described above? Can IR help to end with this illusion of pseudo-objectivity and manipulation of passive individuals.
1076093	Web-based acquisition of Japanese katakana variants This paper describes a method of detecting Japanese Katakana variants from a large corpus. Katakana words, which are mainly used as loanwords, cause problems with information retrieval and so on, because transliteration creates several variations in spelling and all of these can be orthographic. Previous works manually defined Katakana rewrite rules such as %Y ( be ) and %t%' ( ve ) being replaceable with each other, for generating variants and also defined the weight of each operation to edit one string into another to detect these variants. However, these previous researches have not been able to keep up with the ever-increasing number of loanwords and their variants. With our method proposed in this paper, the weight of each edit operation is mechanically assigned based on Web data. In experiments, it performed almost as well as one with manually determined weights. Thus, the advantages of our method are: 1) need no expertise in linguistics to determine weight of each operation, and 2) able to keep up with new Katakana loanwords only by collecting text data from Web and acquiring new weights of edit operations automatically. It also achieved 98.6% recall and 86.3% precision in the task of extracting Katakana variant pairs from 38 year's worth of corpora of Japanese newspaper articles.
1076137	An interface to search human movements based on geographic and chronological metadata Historians and scholars can better understand historic events by studying the geographic and chronological activity of individuals who witnessed them. A lack of adequate tools to help users study these activities can hinder the process of learning and discovery. In this paper we present an interface to address this problem that contains three components: a map, a timeline, and a text representation of a survivor's movements. These components simultaneously provide query input (where users can specify their needs) and dynamic results display (where users can immediately see the effect of their decisions). The results of a pilot study show that users reacted positively to the interface.
1076142	Testing algorithms is like testing students In this paper, we apply methods from educational testing to measure the reliability of an IR collection.
1076143	Evaluating the impact of selection noise in community-based web search The I-SPY meta-search engine uses a technique called collaborative Web search to leverage the past search behaviour (queries and selections) of a community of users in order to promote search results that are relevant to the community. In this paper we describe recent studies to clarify the benefits of this approach in situations when the behaviour of users cannot be relied upon in terms of their ability to consistently select relevant results during search sessions.
1076144	Expectation of f-measures: tractable exact computation and some empirical observations of its properties We derive a tractable and exact computation for the expectation of F -measures. We also demonstrate the non-convexity of this expectation, and investigate errors of approximating the expectation under different settings.
1076146	On evaluation of adaptive topic tracking systems Summative evaluation methods for supervised adaptive topic tracking systems convolve the effect of system decisions on present utility with the effect on future utility. This paper describes a new formative evaluation approach that focuses on future utility for use in the design stage of adaptive systems. Topic model quality is assessed at a predefined set of points using a fixed document set to enhance comparability. Experiments using a vector-space topic tracking system illustrate the utility of this approach to formative evaluation.
1076147	Top subset retrieval on large collections using sorted indices In this poster we describe alternative inverted index structures that reduce the time required to process queries, produce a higher query throughput and still return high quality results to the end user. We give results based upon the TREC Terabyte dataset showing improvements that these indices give in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
1076150	Using Oracle® for natural language document retrieval an automatic query reformulation approach In corporate applications, vast amounts of data are often stored in database systems such as Oracle. Apart from structured information this can include text documents which cannot easily be retrieved using traditional SQL queries.Oracle includes means to deal with full text document retrieval (called Oracle Text) that offer special query operators for searches inside text fields. We have explored the effect of these different operators for queries derived from natural language queries. This article compares the retrieval performances achieved with different automatic reformulations from natural language to Oracle SQL queries.
1076151	Customizing information access according to domain and task knowledge: the ontoExplo system In this paper we present a system that allows a user to explore or mine a document collection. This system is based on domain and task knowledge modelled in the form of ontologies and allows direct access both to information as it is stored and to information that is built from it. The system has been developed in Java.
1076152	Evaluating semantic indexing techniques through cross-language fingerprinting Users in search of on-line document sources are usually looking for content, not words. Hence, IR researchers generally agree that search techniques should be geared toward the meaning underlying documents rather than toward the text itself. The most visible examples of such techniques are Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL). If these techniques really uncover semantic dependencies, then they should be applicable across languages. We investigated this using electronic versions of three kinds of translated material: a novel, a popular treatise about cosmology, and a data base of technical specifications. We used the analogy of fingerprinting used in forensics to establish if individuals are related. Genetic fingerprinting uses enzymes to split the DNA and then compare the resulting band patterns. Likewise, in our research we use queries to split a document into fragments. If a search technique really isolates fragments related to the query, then a document and its translation should have similar band patterns. In this paper we (1) present the fingerprinting technique, (2) introduce the material used, and (3) report preliminary results of an evaluation for two semantic indexing techniques.
1076153	Live visual relevance feedback for query formulation Users browsing the Internet seem relatively satisfied with the performance of search engines. An optimistic explanation would be the high quality of search engines. A more pessimistic one would be that people just adapt easily to any new technology. A third explanation is people's ignorance about recall: as they simply don't know what relevant documents are missed, they can hardly be expected to worry about them. And so they easily conceive the result as the best they can get. To allow the user to better assess the quality of the search results, an algorithm was developed that computes a visual representation of the document space in the neighborhood of the user's query.The paper (1) outlines the algorithm, (2) shows how users can explore the neighborhood of a query, and (3) demonstrates how users can guess more judiciously whether they need to further elaborate their query to improve retrieval results.
1076157	Study of cross lingual information retrieval using on-line translation systems Typical cross language retrieval requires special linguistic resources, such as bilingual dictionaries and parallel corpus. In this study, we focus on the cross lingual retrieval problem that only uses online translation systems. We compare two approaches: a translation-based approach that directly translates queries into the language of documents and then applies traditional information retrieval techniques; and a model-based approach that first learns a statistical translation model from the translations acquired from an online translation system and then applies the learned statistical model to cross lingual information retrieval. Our empirical study with ImageCLEF has shown the model-based approach performs significantly better than the translation-based approach.
1076160	Short comings of latent models in supervised settings The Aspect Model [1, 2] and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model [3, 4] are latent generative models proposed with the objective of modeling discrete data such as text. Though it is not explicitly published (to the best of our knowledge), it is reasonably well known in there search community that the Aspect Model does not perform very well in supervised settings and also that latent models are frequently not identifiable, i.e. their optimal parameters are not unique.In this paper, we make a much stronger claim about the pitfalls of commonly-used latent models. By constructing a small, synthetic, but by no means unrealistic corpus, we show that latent models have inherent limitations that prevent them from recovering semantically meaningful parameters from data generated from a reasonable generative distribution. In fact, our experiments with supervised classification using the Aspect Model, showed that its performance was rather poor, even worse than Naive Bayes, leading us to the synthetic study.We also analyze the scenario of using tempered EM and show that it would not plug the above shortcomings. Our analysis suggests that there is also some scope for improvement in the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model(LDA) [3, 4]. We then use our insight into the shortcomings of these models, to come up with a promising variant of the LDA, that does not suffer from the aforesaid drawbacks. This could potentially lead to much better performance and model fit, in the supervised scenario.

1076167	Information sharing through rational links and viewpoint retrieval In this paper we present the concept of Federated Information Sharing Communities (FISC), which leverages organisational and social relationships with document content to provide community-centred information sharing and communication environments. Prominence is given to capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people, their interests and inter-relationships. We focus on providing social awareness "in the large" to help users understand the members within community and the relationships between them. Within the FISC framework, we provide viewpoint retrieval to enable a user to construct member-specific view(s) of the community, based on their various topic interests. As proof of concept, we present the first FISC prototype based on the twenty-five year SIGIR collection and examples of operational results.
1076168	Mining multimedia salient concepts for incremental information extraction We propose a novel algorithm for extracting information by mining the feature space clusters and then assigning salient concepts to them. Bayesian techniques for extracting concepts from multimedia usually suffer either from lack of data or from too complex concepts to be represented by a single statistical model. An incremental information extraction approach, working at different levels of abstraction, would be able to handle concepts of varying complexities. We present the results of our research on the initial part of an incremental approach, the extraction of the most salient concepts from multimedia information.
1076173	Dependency relation matching for answer selection An abstract is not available.
1076174	Using dragpushing to refine centroid text classifiers We present a novel algorithm, DragPushing, for automatic text classification. Using a training data set, the algorithm first calculates the prototype vectors, or centroids, for each of the available document classes. Using misclassified examples, it then iteratively refines these centroids; by dragging the centroid of a correct class towards a misclassified example and in the same time pushing the centroid of an incorrect class away from the misclassified example. The algorithm is simple to implement and is computationally very efficient. Evaluation experiments conducted on two benchmark collections show that its classification accuracy is comparable to that of more complex methods, such as support vector machines (SVM).
1076175	Scalable hierarchical topic detection: exploring a sample based approach Hierarchical topic detection is a new task in the TDT 2004 evaluation program, which aims to organize an unstructured news collection in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, reflecting the topics discussed. We present a scalable architecture for HTD and compare several alternative choices for agglomerative clustering and DAG optimization in order to minimize the HTD cost metric.
1076181	Intelligent fusion of structural and citation-based evidence for text classification This paper shows how different measures of similarity derived from the citation information and the structural content (e.g., title, abstract) of the collection can be fused to improve classification effectiveness. To discover the best fusion framework, we apply Genetic Programming (GP) techniques. Our experiments with the ACM Computing Classification Scheme, using documents from the ACM Digital Library, indicate that GP can discover similarity functions superior to those based solely on a single type of evidence. Effectiveness of the similarity functions discovered through simple majority voting is better than that of content-based as well as combination-based Support Vector Machine classifiers. Experiments also were conducted to compare the performance between GP techniques and other fusion techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and linear fusion. Empirical results show that GP was able to discover better similarity functions than other fusion techniques.

1076189	A wireless natural language search engine Web search using stationary (desktop) computers has become a pervasive activity. The mobile user in need of information, however, faces several problems in his or her quest to satisfy an information need. Mobile devices have small displays, and mobile user interfaces are often less then usable, because they impose the desktop Web search paradigm on the mobile user. We present a wireless search engine based on natural language queries transmitted via popular Small Message Service (SMS) text messages. Besides traditional keyword based queries, the system can accept questions or phrases and returns responses that contain likely answers (Figure 1) instead of traditional lists of hyperlinks. The additional precision gained from performing a linguistic analysis of the query helps extracting answers from Web pages directly, which requires no navigation. The system is implemented using a NLIR system residing on a server, which can translate questions or phrases into search engine queries or queries to SOAP Web services, where a gateway mediates between the mobile network and the Internet (Figure 2). Whereas on the desktop keyboard-based search still prevails, we find that in a mobile context question answering techniques can help overcome the output constraints.

We demonstrate the system's capabilities and user interface.
1148171	Quantum haystacks This acceptance talk is a curious mixture of personal history and developing ideas in the context of the growing field of IR covering several decades. I want to concentrate on models and theories, interpreted loosely, and try and give an insight into where I have got to in my thinking, where the ideas came from, and where I believe we are going.In the last few years I have been working on the development of what might be coined as a design language for IR. It takes its inspiration from Quantum Mechanics, but by analogy only. The mathematical objects represent documents; these objects might be vectors (or density operators) in an n-dimensional vector space (usually a Hilbert space). A request for information, or a query, is taken as an observable and is represented as a linear operator on the space. Linear operators can be expressed as matrices. Such an operator, Hermitian, has a set of eigenvectors forming a basis for the space; which we interpret as a point of view or perspective from which to understand the space. Thus any document-vector can be located with respect to the basis, and we can calculate an inner product between such a vector and any basis vector, which may be interpreted as a probability of relevance. The probability of observing any given eigenvector is now given by the square of that inner product assuming all vectors are normalised. Hence we connect the probability of observation to the geometry of the space. Furthermore, the subspaces of the space make up a lattice structure which is equivalent to a logic. This makes up the entire mathematical structure, and the language for handling this structure is linear algebra: vectors, matrices, projections, inner-products, neatly captured by the Dirac notation used in quantum mechanics. Our probability is slightly different from classical probability, the same for logic; we end up with quantum logic and quantum probability.A commitment to this kind of mathematical structure, with which to model objects and processes in IR, depends on two critical assumptions. The distances in the space between objects are a source of important relationships with respect to relevance and aboutness. The observation of a property such as relevance or aboutness is user dependent in the sense that a potential interaction is specified by a user through an operator which when measured achieves outcomes with a probability determined by the geometry of the space. .The geometry of this mathematical structure and the probability defined on it are closely connected by the following theorem due to Gleason (1957). One may summarise this theorem by saying that the probability of a subspace is given by a simple algorithm derived from a projection onto the subspace and a special kind of operator, namely a statistical operator, or density matrix. And conversely, that given a probability measure on the subspaces then we can encode that measure uniquely through such an algorithm. This is a very powerful theorem and its consequences remain to be explored.So how did I get to this point and form of abstraction? Most of my research work can be divided into contributions to the following areas: Clustering Evaluation Probabilistic Models Logic Models Geometry .In all these areas I have attempted to search for underlying mathematical structures that would lead to computations. These topics have in common that they depend on the construction of measures on a space which in some sense determines the usefulness or effectiveness of the structure. For clustering one considers mapping from metric spaces to ultrametic spaces and measure the closeness of fit. In the case of evaluation, one starts with a relational conjoint structure and imposes some constraints given by what is to be measured, one then constructs a numerical representation of this structure leading to such measures as F (or E). For probabilistic models the main difficulty is concerned with deciding on an appropriate event space on which to define the 'right' probability measures. For me the most significant example in this context was the attempt to construct a Logical Uncertainty Principle which formulated a measure of uncertainty on incomplete logical constructs. This attempt left unspecified the exact form of the measure. In the Geometry of IR I finally managed to formulate that measure as a projection-valued measure.This way of thinking did not appear out of nowhere. It was heavily influenced by the work of Fairthorne(1961) whose work on Brouwerian Logic (an Intuitionistic Logic) was picked up by Salton in his early book on IR. At an earlier stage MacKay (1950) wrote a paper that opened with, 'This paper relates to the borderline linking experimental and theoretical physics with mathematical logic, and covers at several points ground which is common to the theory of communication.' He goes on to define an 'information-operator' which is very similar in scope and intent to the Hermitian operator above. Maron, who collaborated with MacKay, stated in his 1965 paper, 'Therefore, it can be argued that index descriptions should not be viewed as properties of documents: They function to relate documents and users.' One can see that the development of these early ideas was continued to the construction of the Geometry of IR.What does it leave to be done? An attempt should be made to use this design language to build an IR system. On the theoretical front it is worth considering whether it would be better to start with a transition probability space rather than a Hilbert space as Von Neumann did in 1937 (translated in 1981). The assumption that closed linear subspaces will be the elements of our logic can be challenged, as perhaps a construction with different elements is possible. It is not obvious what the best form of conditional probability might be in these spaces. Agreeing on a form of conditionalisation is intimately tied up with how to model contextuality. There is some evidence to suggest that contextuality plays a role in modelling the conjuncton of concepts (Widdows, 2004). Such contexts have been modelled in quantum theory almost from the beginning, for example, Gleason's theorem precludes noncontextual hidden variable theories.

1148251	Exploring the limits of single-iteration clarification dialogs Single-iteration clarification dialogs, as implemented in the TREC HARD track, represent an attempt to introduce interaction into ad hoc retrieval, while preserving the many benefits of large-scale evaluations. Although previous experiments have not conclusively demonstrated performance gains resulting from such interactions, it is unclear whether these findings speak to the nature of clarification dialogs, or simply the limitations of current systems. To probe the limits of such interactions, we employed a human intermediary to formulate clarification questions and exploit user responses. In addition to establishing a plausible upper bound on performance, we were also able to induce an "ontology of clarifications" to characterize human behavior. This ontology, in turn, serves as the input to a regression model that attempts to determine which types of clarification questions are most helpful. Our work can serve to inform the design of interactive systems that initiate user dialogs.
1148274	A complex document information processing prototype We developed a prototype for integrated retrieval and aggregation of diverse information contained in scanned paper documents. Such complex document information processing combines several forms of image processing together with textual/linguistic processing to enable effective analysis of complex document collections, a necessity for a wide range of applications. This is the first system to attempt integrated retrieval from complex documents; we report its current capabilities.

1148280	User expectations from XML element retrieval The primary aim of XML element retrieval is to return to users XML elements, rather than whole documents. This poster describes a small study, in which we elicited users' expectations, i.e. their anticipated experience, when interacting with an XML retrieval system, as compared to a traditional 'flat' document retrieval system.
1148281	Theoretical benchmarks of XML retrieval This poster investigates the use of theoretical benchmarks to describe the matching functions of XML retrieval systems and the properties of specificity and exhaustivity in XML retrieval. Theoretical benchmarks concern the formal representation of qualitative properties of IR models. To this end, Situation Theory framework for the meta-evaluation of XML retrieval is presented.
1148283	Community-based snippet-indexes for pseudo-anonymous personalization in web search We describe and evaluate an approach to personalizing Web search that involves post-processing the results returned by some underlying search engine so that they re .ect the interests of a community of like-minded searchers.To do this we leverage the search experiences of the community by mining the title and snippet texts of results that have been selected by community members in response to their queries. Our approach seeks to build a community-based snippet index that re .ects the evolving interests of a group of searchers. This index is then sed to re-rank the results returned by the underlying search engine by boosting the ranking of key results that have been freq ently selected for similar q eries by community members in the past.
1148290	Automated performance assessment in interactive QA In interactive question answering (QA), users and systems take turns to ask questions and provide answers. In such an interactive setting, user questions largely depend on the answers provided by the system. One question is whether user follow-up questions can provide feedback for the system to automatically assess its performance (e.g., assess whether a correct answer is delivered). This self-awareness can make QA systems more intelligent for information seeking, for example, by adapting better strategies to cope with problematic situations. Therefore, this paper describes our initial investigation in addressing this problem. Our results indicate that interaction context can provide useful cues for automated performance assessment in interactive QA.
1148291	Stylistic text segmentation This paper focuses on a method for the stylistic segmentation of text documents. Our technique involves mapping the change in a feature throughout a text. We use the linguistic features of conjunction and modality, through taxonomies from Systemic Functional Linguistics. This segmentation has applications in automated summarization, particularly of large documents.
1148292	On hierarchical web catalog integration with conceptual relationships in thesaurus Web catalog integration is an interesting problem in current digital content management. Past studies have shown that using a flattened structure with auxiliary information extracted from the source catalog can improve the integration results. However, the nature of a flattened structure ignores the hierarchical relationships, and thus the performance improvement of catalog integration may be reduced. In this paper, we propose an enhanced hierarchical catalog integration (EHCI) approach with conceptual thesauri extracted from the source catalog. The results show that our enhanced hierarchical integration approach effectively boosts the accuracy of hierarchical catalog integration.
1148294	A new web page summarization method In this paper, we present a novel multi-webpage summarization algorithm. It adds the graph based ranking algorithm into the framework of Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) method, to not only capture the main topic of the web pages but also eliminate the redundancy existing in the sentences of the summary result. The experiment result indicates that the new approach has the better performance than the previous methods.
1148298	Evaluating sources of query expansion terms This study investigates the effectiveness of retrieval systems and human users in generating terms for query expansion. We compare three sources of terms: system generated terms, terms users select from top-ranked sentences, and user generated terms. Results demonstrate that overall the system generated more effective expansion terms than users, but that users' selection of terms improved precision at the top of the retrieved document list.

1148302	Quantative analysis of the impact of judging inconsistency on the performance of relevance feedback Practical constrains of user interfaces make the user's judgment (during the feedback loop) deviate from real thoughts (when the full document is read).This is often overlooked in evaluation of relevance feedback.This paper quantitatively analyze the impact of judging inconsistency on the performance of relevance feedback.
1148303	Swordfish: an unsupervised Ngram based approach to morphological analysis Extracting morphemes from words is a nontrivial task. Rule based stemming approaches such as Porter's algorithm have encountered some success, however they are restricted by their ability to identify a limited number of affixes and are language dependent. When dealing with languages with many affixes, rule based approaches generally require many more rules to deal with all the possible word forms. Deriving these rules requires a larger effort on the part of linguists and in some instances can be simply impractical. We propose an unsupervised ngram based approach, named Swordfish. Using ngram probabilities in the corpus, possible morphemes are identified. We look at two possible methods for identifying candidate morphemes, one using joint probabilities between two ngrams, and the second based on log odds between prefix probabilities. Initial results indicate the joint probability approach to be better for English while the prefix ratio approach is better for Finnish and Turkish.
1148308	Enhancing topic tracking with temporal information In this paper, we propose a new strategy with time granularity reasoning for utilizing temporal information in topic tracking. Compared with previous ones, our work has four distinguished characteristics. Firstly, we try to determine a set of topic times for a target topic from the given on-topic stories. It helps to avoid the negative influence from other irrelevant times. Secondly, we take into account time granularity variance when deciding whether a coreference relationship exists between two times. Thirdly, both publication time and times presented in texts are considered. Finally, as time is only one attribute of a topic, we increase the similarity between a story and a target topic only when they are related not only temporally but also semantically. Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our method makes good use of temporal information in news stories.
1148309	A comparative study of the effect of search feature design on user experience in digital libraries (DLs) This study investigates the impact of different search feature designs in DLs on user search experience. The results indicate that the impact is significant in terms of the number of queries issued, search steps, zero-hits pages returned, and search errors.
1148313	Improving QA retrieval using document priors We present a simple way to improve document retrieval for question answering systems. The method biases the retrieval system toward documents that contain words that have appeared in other documents containing answers to the same type of question. The method works with virtually any retrieval system, and exhibits a statistically significant performance improvement over a strong baseline.
1148315	Action modeling: language models that predict query behavior We present a novel language modeling approach to capturing the query reformulation behavior of Web search users. Based on a framework that categorizes eight different types of "user moves" (adding/removing query terms, etc.), we treat search sessions as sequence data and build n-gram language models to capture user behavior. We evaluated our models in a prediction task. The results suggest that useful patterns of activity can be extracted from user histories. Furthermore, by examining prediction performance under different order n-gram models, we gained insight into the amount of history/context that is associated with different types of user actions. Our work serves as the basis for more refined user models.
1148318	Fact-focused novelty detection: a feasibility study Methods for detecting sentences in an input document set, which are both relevant and novel with respect to an information need, would be of direct benefit to many systems, such as extractive text summarizers. However, satisfactory levels of agreement between judges performing this task manually have yet to demonstrated, leaving researchers to conclude that the task is too subjective. In previous experiments, judges were asked to first identify sentences that are relevant to a general topic, and then to eliminate sentences from the list that do not contain new information. Currently, a new task is proposed, in which annotators perform the same procedure, but within the context of a specific, factual information need. In the experiment, satisfactory levels of agreement between independent annotators were achieved on the first step of identifying sentences containing relevant information relevant. However, the results indicate that judges do not agree on which sentences contain novel information.
1148321	Using small XML elements to support relevance Small XML elements are often estimated relevant by the retrieval model but they are not desirable retrieval units. This paper presents a generic model that exploits the information obtained from small elements. We identify relationships between small and relevant elements and use this linking information to reinforce the relevance of other elements before removing the small ones. Our experiments using the INEX testbed show the effectiveness of our approach.
1148324	Lightening the load of document smoothing for better language modeling retrieval We hypothesized that language modeling retrieval would improve if we reduced the need for document smoothing to provide an inverse document frequency (IDF) like effect. We created inverse collection frequency (ICF) weighted query models as a tool to partially separate the IDF-like role from document smoothing. Compared to maximum likelihood estimated (MLE) queries, the ICF weighted queries achieved a 6.4% improvement in mean average precision on description queries. The ICF weighted queries performed better with less document smoothing than that required by MLE queries. Language modeling retrieval may benefit from a means to separately incorporate an IDF-like behavior outside of document smoothing.
1148325	The effect of OCR errors on stylistic text classification Recently, interest is growing in non-topical text classification tasks such as genre classification, sentiment analysis, and authorship profiling. We study to what extent OCR errors affect stylistic text classification from scanned documents. We find that even a relatively high level of errors in the OCRed documents does not substantially affect stylistic classification accuracy.

1148333	A graph-based framework for relation propagation and its application to multi-label learning Label propagation exploits the structure of the unlabeled documents by propagating the label information of the training documents to the unlabeled documents. The limitation with the existing label propagation approaches is that they can only deal with a single type of objects. We propose a framework, named " relation propagation ", that allows for information propagated among multiple types of objects. Empirical studies with multi-label text categorization showed that the proposed algorithm is more effective than several semi-supervised learning algorithms in that it is capable of exploring the correlation among different categories and the structure of unlabeled documents simultaneously.
1148335	Incorporating query difference for learning retrieval functions in information retrieval We discuss information retrieval methods that aim at serving a diverse stream of user queries. We propose methods that emphasize the importance of taking into consideration of query difference in learning effective retrieval functions. We formulate the problem as a multi-task learning problem using a risk minimization framework. In particular, we show how to calibrate the empirical risk to incorporate query difference in terms of introducing nuisance parameters in the statistical models, and we also propose an alternating optimization method to simultaneously learn the retrieval function and the nuisance parameters. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods using modeling data extracted from a commercial search engine.

1148340	Appraisal navigator Much interesting text n the web consists largely of opinionated or evaluative text, as opposed to directly informative text. The new field of 'sentiment analysis' seeks to characterize such aspects of natural language text, as opposed to just the bare facts. We suggest that 'appraisal expression extraction' should be viewed as a fundamental task for sentiment analysis. We define an 'appraisal expression' to be a piece of text expressing some evaluative stance towards a particular object. The task is to find these elements and characterize the type and orientation (positive or negative) of the evaluative stance, as well as its target and possibly its source. Potential applications of these methods include new approaches to the now-traditional tasks of sentiment classification and pinion mining, as well as possibly for adversarial textual analysis and intention detection for intelligence applications.
1148342	Project contexts to situate personal information The Personal Project Planner prototype works as an extension to the file manager to provide people with rich-text overlays to their information (folders, files and also email, web pages, notes). Rich-text, document-like project plans can be created which then provide a context in which to create or reference the email messages, electronic documents, web pages, etc. that are needed to complete the plan. The user can later locate an information item such as an email message with reference to the plan (e.g., as an alternative to a mostly context-free search through the inbox or sent mail). The Planner explores a possibility that an effective organization of project-related information can emerge as a natural by-product of efforts to plan and structure the project.

The score is then used to browse the "similar" keyframes in terms of semantic visual features.

1277742	Strategy follows technology In strategic management there has been a debate over many years. Already in 1962 Alfred Chandler had stated: Structure follows Strategy. In the nineteen eighties, Michael Porter modified Chandler's dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure: organizational structure follows strategy, which in turn follows structure. So the question became: what is leading what?. Technology has in this debate been seen as a part of either the structure of the organisation itself, or part of the development of the environment in which the organisation tries to survive by adapting. The notion that technological advancement can also change the paradigmas of organisational strategy-development is new. This has mainly to do with the impact of the technological changes on the workflow and procedures of organisations. Never before they were so profound as in our days. Technological change affects us on different levels of our strategic development. I will give three examples of changes that are occurring or have occurred in "Sound and Vision". The first is the introduction of RFID transmitters in admission rings for the Sound and Vision experience. The second is the setup of a back office media asset management, storage and distribution structure for the Public Broadcasters. The third is the development of the archive towards becoming a Media-Application Service Provider.

1277861	Management of keyword variation with frequency based generation of word forms in IR This paper presents a new management method for morphological variation of keywords. The method is called FCG, Frequent Case Generation. It is based on the skewed distributions of word forms in natural languages and is suitable for languages that have either fair amount of morphological variation or are morphologically very rich. The proposed method has been evaluated so far with four languages, Finnish, Swedish, German and Russian, which show varying degrees of morphological complexity.
1277862	OMES: a new evaluation strategy using optimal matching for document clustering Existing measures for evaluating clustering results (e.g. F-measure) have the limitation of overestimating cluster quality because they usually adopt the greedy matching between classes (reference clusters) and clusters (system clusters) to allow multiple classes to correspond to one same cluster, which is in fact a locally optimal solution. This paper proposes a new evaluation strategy to overcome the limitation of existing evaluation measures by using optimal matching in graph theory. A weighted bipartite graph is built with classes and clusters as two disjoint sets of vertices and the edge weight between any class and any cluster is computed using a basic metric. Then the total weight of the optimal matching in the graph is acquired and we use it to evaluate the quality of the clusters. The optimal matching allows only one-to-one matching between classes and clusters and a globally optimal solution can be achieved. A preliminary study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation strategy.
1277865	Combining error-correcting output codes and model-refinement for text categorization In this work, we explore the use of error-correcting output codes (ECOC) to enhance the performance of centroid text classifier. The framework is to decompose one multi-class problem into multiple binary problems and then learn the individual binary classification problems by centroid classifier. However, this kind of decomposition incurs considerable bias for centroid classifier, which results in noticeable degradation of performance. To address this issue, we use Model-Refinement to adjust this so-called bias.
1277866	User-oriented text segmentation evaluation measure The paper describes a user oriented performance evaluation measure for text segmentation. Experiments show that the proposed measure differentiates well between error distributions with varying user impact.
1277867	Story segmentation of broadcast news in Arabic, Chinese and English using multi-window features The paper describes a maximum entropy based story segmentation system for Arabic, Chinese and English. In experiments with broadcast news data from TDT-3, TDT-4, and corpora collected in the DARPA GALE project we obtain a substantial performance gain using multiple overlapping windows for text-based features.
1277873	Combining term-based and event-based matching for question answering In question answering, two main kinds of matching methods for finding answer sentences for a question are term-based approaches -- which are simple, efficient, effective, and yield high recall -- and event-based approaches that take syntactic and semantic information into account. The latter often sacrifice recall for increased precision, but actually capture the meaning of the events denoted by the textual units of a passage or sentence. We propose a robust, data-driven method that learns the mapping between questions and answers using logistic regression and show that combining term-based and event-based approaches significantly outperforms the individual methods.
1277875	Estimating the value of automatic disambiguation A common motivation for personalised search systems is the ability to disambiguate queries based on some knowledge of a user's interests. An analysis of log files from three search providers, covering a range of scenarios, suggests that this sort of disambiguation would be of marginal use for more specialised providers but may be of use for whole-of-Web search.

1277881	Automatic classification of web pages into bookmark categories We describe a technique to automatically classify a web page into an existing bookmark category to help a user to bookmark a page. HyperBK compares a bag-of-words representation of the page to descriptions of categories in the user's bookmark file. Unlike default web browser dialog boxes in which the user may be presented with the category into which he or she saved the last bookmarked file, HyperBK also offers the category most similar to the page being bookmarked. The user can also opt to create a new category; or save the page elsewhere. In an evaluation, the user's preferred category was offered on average 61% of the time.
1277884	Topic segmentation using weighted lexical links (WLL) This paper presents two new approaches of lexical chains for topic segmentation using weighted lexical chains (WLC) or weighted lexical links (WLL) between repeated occurrences of lemmas along the text. The main advantage of using these new approaches is the suppression of the empirical parameter called hiatus in lexical chain processing. An evaluation according to the WindowDiff measure on a large automatically built corpus shows slight improvements in WLL compared to state-of-the-art methods based on lexical chains.
1277888	A flexible retrieval system of shapes in binary images This poster overviews the main characteristics of a flexible retrieval systems of shapes present in binary images and discusses some evaluation results. The system applies multiple indexing criteria of the shapes synthesizing distinct characteristics such as global features of the objects contour (Fourier Coefficients), boundary irregularities (Multifractal Spectrum), presence of concavities and convexities on the boundary (Contour Scale Space distribution). The system is flexible since it allows customizing the retrieval function to fit an application need. The query is a binary image containing the desired shape and a set of parameters specifying the distinct importance of the shape characteristics that must be taken into account to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved shapes. The retrieval function is then defined as a Flexible Multicriteria fusion Function producing ranked results. The evaluation experiments showed that this system can be suited to different retrieval purposes, and that generally the combination of the distinct shape indexing criteria increases both Recall and Precision with respect to the application of any single indexing criterion alone.
1277889	Semantic text classification of disease reporting Traditional text classification studied in the IR literature is mainly based on topics. That is, each class or category represents a particular topic, e.g., sports, politics or sciences. However, many real-world text classification problems require more refined classification based on some semantic aspects. For example, in a set of documents about a particular disease, some documents may report the outbreak of the disease, some may describe how to cure the disease, some may discuss how to prevent the disease, and yet some others may include all the above information. To classify text at this semantic level, the traditional "bag of words" model is no longer sufficient. In this paper, we report a text classification study at the semantic level and show that sentence semantic and structure features are very useful for such kind of classification. Our experimental results based on a disease outbreak dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
1277893	Model-averaged latent semantic indexing This poster introduces a novel approach to information retrieval that uses statistical model averaging to improve latent semantic indexing (LSI). Instead of choosing a single dimensionality $k$ for LSI , we propose using several models of differing dimensionality to inform retrieval. To manage this ensemble we weight each model's contribution to an extent inversely proportional to its AIC (Akaike information criterion). Thus each model contributes proportionally to its expected Kullback-Leibler divergence from the distribution that generated the data. We present results on three standard IR test collections, demonstrating significant improvement over both the traditional vector space model and single-model LSI.
1277895	Improving retrieval accuracy by weighting document types with clickthrough data For enterprise search, there exists a relationship between work task and document type that can be used to refine search results. In this poster, we adapt the popular Okapi BM25 scoring function to weight term frequency based on the relevance of a document type to a work task. Also, we use click frequency for each task-type pair to estimate a realistic weight. Using the W3C collection from the TREC Enterprise track for evaluations, our approach leads to significant improvements on search precision.
1277896	Protecting source privacy in federated search Many information sources contain information that can only be accessed through search-specific search engines. Federated search provides search solutions of this type of hidden information that cannot be searched by conventional search engines. In many scenarios of federated search, such as the search among health care providers or among intelligence agencies, an individual information source does not want to disclose the source of the search results to users or other sources. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-step federated search protocol that protects the privacy of information sources. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to address the research problem of protecting source privacy in federated text search.
1277897	Applying ranking SVM in query relaxation We propose an approach QRRS (Query Relaxative Ranking SVM) that divides a ranking function into different relaxation steps, so that only cheap features are used in Ranking SVM of early steps for query efficiency. We show search quality in the approach is improved compared to conventional Ranking SVM.
1277898	Learning to rank collections Collection selection, ranking collections according to user query is crucial in distributed search. However, few features are used to rank collections in the current collection selection methods, while hundreds of features are exploited to rank web pages in web search. The lack of features affects the efficiency of collection selection in distributed search. In this paper, we exploit some new features and learn to rank collections with them through SVM and RankingSVM respectively. Experimental results show that our features are beneficial to collection selection, and the learned ranking functions outperform the classical CORI algorithm.
1277900	Modelling epistemic uncertainty in ir evaluation Modern information retrieval (IR) test collections violate the completeness assumption of the Cranfield paradigm. In order to maximise the available resources, only a sample of documents (i.e. the pool) are judged for relevance by a human assessor(s). The subsequent evaluation protocol does not make any distinctions between assessed or unassesseddocuments, as documents that are not in the pool are assumedto be not relevant for the topic. This is beneficial from a practical point of view, as the relative performance can be compared with confidence if the experimental conditions are fair for all systems. However, given the incompleteness of relevance assessments, two forms of uncertainty emerge during evaluation. The first is Aleatory uncertainty, which refers to variation in system performance across the topic set, which is often addressed through the use of statistical significance tests. The second form of uncertainty is Epistemic, which refers to the amount of knowledge (or ignorance) we have about the estimate of a system's performance. Epistemic uncertainty is a consequence of incompleteness and is not addressed by the current evaluation protocol. In this study, we present a first attempt at modelling both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty associatedwith IR evaluation. We aim to account for both the variability associated with system performance and the amount of knowledge known about the performance estimate.
1277901	On the importance of preserving the part-order in shape retrieval This paper discusses the importance of part-order-preservation in shape matching. A part descriptor is introduced that supports both preserving and abandoning the order of parts. The evaluation shows that retrieval results are improved by almost 38% if the original ordering is preserved.
1277905	Resource monitoring in information extraction It is often argued that in information extraction (IE), certain machine learning (ML) approaches save development time over others, or that certain ML methods (e.g. Active Learning) require less training data than others, thus saving development cost. However, such development cost claims are not normally backed up by controlled studies which show that such development cost savings actually occur. This situation in Language Engineering is contrasted with Software Engineering in general, where a lot of studies investigating system development cost have been carried out. We argue for the need of controlled studies that measure actual system development time in language engineering. To this end, we carry out an experiment in resource monitoring for an IE task: three named entity taggers for the same "surprise" domain are developed in parallel, using competing methods. Their human development time is accounted forusing a logging facility.We report development cost results for parallel implementations of a named entity tagger and present a breakdown of the development time for the three alternative methods. We are not aware of detailed previous parallel studies that detail how system development time is spent when creating a named entity tagger.

1277913	MRF based approach for sentence retrieval This poster focuses on the study of term context dependence in the application of sentence retrieval. Based on Markov Random Field (MRF), three forms of dependence among query terms are considered. Under different assumptions of term dependence relationship, three feature functions are defined, with the purpose to utilize association features between query terms in sentence to evaluate the relevance of sentence. Experimental results have proven the efficiency of the proposed retrieval models in improving the performance of sentence retrieval.
1277924	A web page topic segmentation algorithm based on visual criteria and content layout This paper presents experiments using an algorithm of web page topic segmentation that show significant precision improvement in the retrieval of documents issued from the Web track corpus of TREC 2001. Instead of processing the whole document, a web page is segmented into different semantic blocks according to visual criteria (such as horizontal lines, colors) and structural tags (such as headings <H1>~<H6>, paragraph <P>). We conclude that combining visual and content layout criteria gives the best results for increasing the precision: the ranking of the page is calculated for relevant segments of pages resulting from the segmentation algorithm.
1277925	Document clustering: an optimization problem Clustering algorithms have been widely used in information retrieval applications. However, it is difficult to define an objective "best" result. This article analyzes some document clustering algorithms and illustrates that they are equivalent to the optimization problem of some global functions. Experiments show their good performance, but there are still counter-examples where they fail to return the optimal solution. We argue that Monte-Carlo algorithms in the global optimization framework have the potential to find better solutions than traditional clustering, and they are able to handle more complex structures.
1277929	Generative modeling of persons and documents for expert search In this paper we address the task of automatically finding an expert within the organization, known as the expert search problem. We present the theoretically-based probabilistic algorithm which models retrieved documents as mixtures of expert candidate language models. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing theoretically sound solutions.

In this paper, we describe our experience of participation in the NTCIR-6 Opinion Analysis Pilot Task by focusing on opinion holder extraction results in Japanese and English. Our approach to opinion holder extraction was based on the discrimination between author and authority viewpoints in opinionated sentences, and the evaluation results were fair with respect to the Japanese documents.
1277940	Dimensionality reduction for dimension-specific search Dimensionality reduction plays an important role in efficient similarity search, which is often based on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries over a high-dimensional feature space. In this paper, we introduce a novel type of k-NN query, namely conditional k-NN (ck-NN), which considers dimension-specific constraint in addition to the inter-point distances. However, existing dimensionality reduction methods are not applicable to this new type of queries. We propose a novel Mean-Std (standard deviation) guided Dimensionality Reduction (MSDR) to support a pruning based efficient ck-NN query processing strategy. Our preliminary experimental results on 3D protein structure data demonstrate that the MSDR method is promising.
1277941	An effective method for finding best entry points in semi-structured documents Focused structured document retrieval employs the concept of best entry point (BEP), which is intended to provide optimal starting-point from which users can browse to relevant document components [4]. In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for finding BEPs in XML documents. Experiments conducted within the framework of INEX 2006 evaluation campaign on the Wikipedia XML collection [2] shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
1277943	An analysis of peer-to-peer file-sharing system queries Many studies focus on the Web, but yet, few focus on peer-to-peer file-sharing system queries despite their massive scale in terms of Internet traffic. We analyzed several million queries collected on the Gnutella network and differentiated our findings from those of Web queries.
1277944	Investigating the relevance of sponsored results for web ecommerce queries Are sponsored links, the primary business model for Web search engines, providing Web consumers with relevant results? This research addresses this issue by investigating the relevance of sponsored and non-sponsored links for ecommerce queries from the major search engines. The results show that average relevance ratings for sponsored and non-sponsored links are virtually the same, although the relevance ratings for sponsored links are statistically higher. We used 108 ecommerce queries and 8,256 retrieved links for these queries from three major Web search engines, Google, MSN, and Yahoo!. We present the implications for Web search engines and sponsored search as a long-term business model as well as a mechanism for finding relevant information for searchers.
1277945	Viewing online searching within a learning paradigm In this research, we investigate whether one can model online searching as a learning paradigm. We examined the searching characteristics of 41 participants engaged in 246 searching tasks. We classified the searching tasks according to Anderson and Krathwohl's Taxonomy, an updated version of Bloom's taxonomy. Anderson and Krathwohl is a six level categorization of cognitive learning. Research results show that Applying takes the most searching effort as measured by queries per session and specific topics searched per sessions. The categories of Remembering and Understanding, which are lower-order learning levels, exhibit searching characteristics similar to the higher order categories of Evaluating and Creating. It seems that searchers rely primarily on their internal knowledge and use searching primarily as fact checking and verification when engaged in Evaluating and Creating. Implications are that the commonly held notions of Web searchers having simple information goals may not be correct. We discuss the implications for Web searching, including designing interfaces to support exploration and alternate views.

1277948	Fast exact maximum likelihood estimation for mixture of language models A common language modeling approach assumes the data D is generated from a mixture of several language models. EM algorithm is usually used to find the maximum likelihood estimation of one unknown mixture component, given the mixture weights and the other language models. In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm of O ( k ) complexity to find the exact solution, where k is the number of words occurred at least once in D . Another merit is that the probabilities of many words are exactly zeros, which means that the mixture language model also serves as a feature selection technique.
1277952	Ranking by community relevance A web page may be relevant to multiple topics; even when nominally on a single topic, the page may attract attention (and thus links) from multiple communities. Instead of indiscriminately summing the authority provided by all pages, we decompose a web page into separate subnodes with respect to each community pointing to it. By considering the relevance of these communities, we are able to better model the query-specific reputation for each potential result. We apply a total of 125 queries to the TREC .GOV dataset to demonstrate how the use of community relevance can improve ranking performance.
1277954	Making mind and machine meet: a study of combining cognitive and algorithmic relevance feedback Using Saracevic's relevance types, we explore approaches to combining algorithm and cognitive relevance in a term relevance feedback scenario. Data collected from 21 users who provided relevance feedback about terms suggested by a system for 50 TREC HARD topics are used. The former type of feedback is considered as cognitive relevance and the latter type is considered as algorithm relevance. We construct retrieval runs using these two types of relevance feedback and experiment with ways of combining them with simple Boolean operators. Results show minimal differences in performance with respect to the different techniques.
1277957	Effects of highly agreed documents in relevancy prediction Finding significant contextual features is a challenging task in the development of interactive information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper investigated a simple method to facilitate such a task by looking at aggregated relevance judgements of retrieved documents. Our study suggested that the agreement on relevance judgements can indicate the effectiveness of retrieved documents as the source of significant features. The effect of highly agreed documents gives us practical implication for the design of adaptive search models in interactive IR systems.
1277958	Detecting word substitutions: PMI vs. HMM Those who want to conceal the content of their communications can do so by replacing words that might trigger attention. For example, instead of writing "The bomb is in position", a terrorist may chose to write "The flower is in position." The substituted sentence would sound a bit "odd" for a human reader and it has been shown in prior research that such oddity is detectable by text mining approaches. However, the importance of each component in the suggested oddity detection approach has not been thoroughly investigated. Also, the approach has not been compared with such an obvious candidate for the task as Hidden Markov Models (HMM). In this work, we explore further oddity detection algorithms reported earlier, specifically those based on pointwise mutual information (PMI) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM).
1277959	Workload sampling for enterprise search evaluation In real world use of test collection methods, it is essential that the query test set be representative of the work load expected in the actual application. Using a random sample of queries from a media company's query log as a 'gold standard' test set we demonstrate that biases in sitemap-derived and top n query sets can lead to significant perturbations in engine rankings and big differences in estimated performance levels.
1277960	Document layout and color driven image retrieval This paper presents a contribution to image indexing applied to the document creation task. The presented method ranks a set of photographs based on how well they aesthetically work within a predefined document. Color harmony, document visual balance and image quality are taken into consideration. A user study conducted on people with a range of expertise in document creation helped gather the right visual features to consider by the algorithm. This shows some benefits for the traditional document creation task, as well as for the case of ever-changing web page banner colors and layout.
1277962	Improving active learning recall via disjunctive boolean constraints Active learning efficiently hones in on the decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant documents, but in the process can miss entire clusters of relevant documents, yielding classifiers with low recall. In this paper, we propose a method to increase active learning recall by constraining sampling to a document subset rich in relevant examples.
1277963	Creativity support: information discovery and exploratory search We are developing support for creativity in learning through information discovery and exploratory search. Users engage in creative tasks, such as inventing new products and services. The system supports evolving information needs. It gathers and presents relevant information visually using images and text. Users are able to search, browse, and explore results from multiple queries and interact with information elements by manipulating design and expressing interest. A field study was conducted to evaluate the system in an undergraduate class. The results demonstrated the efficacy of our system for developing creative ideas. Exposure to diverse information in visual and interactive forms is shown to support students engaged in invention tasks.

User modeling in ISKODOR fills three roles: discovery of sites with suitable information stores, context-based query interpretation, and automatic profile-based filtering of new information. Explanation and control are achieved through graphical depiction of sources, explicit feedback regard ingutility, and explicit control over peer association behavior and information sharing.

1277969	The wild thing goes local Suppose you are on a mobile device with no keyboard (e.g., a cell phone) and you want to perform a "near me" search. Where is the nearest pizza? How do you enter queries quickly? T9? The Wild Thing encourages users to enter patterns with implicit and explicit wild cards (regular expressions). The search engine uses Microsoft Local Live logs to find the most likely queries for a particular location. For example, 7#6 is short-hand for the regular expression: /^[PQRS].*[ ][MNO].*/, which matches "post office" in many places (but "Space Needle" in Seattle). Some queries are more local than others. Pizza is likely everywhere, whereas "Boeing Company," is very likely in Seattle and Chicago, moderately likely nearby, and somewhat likely elsewhere. Smoothing is important. Not every query is observed everywhere.

1277975	Text categorization for streams We describe a novel system for evaluating and performing stream-based text categorization. Stream-based text categorization considers the text being categorized as a stream of symbols, which differs from the traditional feature-based approach which relies on extracting features from the text. The system implements character-based languages models--specifically models based on the PPM text compression scheme--as well as count-based measures such as R-Measure and C-Measure. Use of the system demonstrates that all of these techniques outperform SVM, a feature-based classifier, at stream-related classification tasks such as authorship ascription.

1277979	Geographic ranking for a local search engine Traditional ranking schemes of the relevance of a Web page to a user query in a search engine are less appropriate when the search term contains geographic information. Often, geographic entities, such as addresses, city names, and location names, appear only once or twice in a Web page, and are typically not in a heading or larger font. Consequently, an alternative ranking approach to the traditional weighted tf*idf relevance ranking is need. Further, if a Web site contains a geographic entity, it is often the case that its in- and out-neighbours do not refer to the same entity, although they may refer to other geographic entities. We present a local search engine that applies a novel ranking algorithm suitable for ranking Web pages with geographic content. We describe its major components: geographic ranking, focused crawling, geographic extractor, and the related web-sites feature.
1277980	Focused ranking in a vertical search engine Since the debut of PageRank and HITS, hyperlink-induced Web document ranking has come a long way. The Web has become increasingly vast and topically diverse. Such vastness has led many into the area of topic-sensitive ranking and its variants. We address the high dimensionality of the Web by providing tools for focused search. A focused search engine is one which seeks coverage over a subset of topics of the Web and presents users with relevant search results in a known domain. This demonstration will introduce readers to the GenieKnows.com Vertical Search Engine.

1277984	Beyond classical measures: how to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive information retrieval system? This research explores the relationship between Information Retrieval (IR) systems' effectiveness and users' performance (accuracy and speed) and their satisfaction with the retrieved results (precision of the results, completeness of the results and overall system success). Previous studies have concluded that improvements in IR systems based on increase in IR effectiveness measures do not reflect on improvement in users' performance. This work aims at exploiting factors that can possibly be considered as confounding variables in Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) evaluation. In this research, we look at substantive approaches to evaluate IIR systems. We aim to build an interactive evaluation framework that brings together aspects of systems' effectiveness and users' performance and satisfaction. This research also involves developing methods for capturing users' satisfaction with the retrieved results of IR systems, as well as examination how users assess their own performance in task completion. Furthermore, we are also interested in identifying evaluation measures which are used in batch mode (non-interactive experiment), but correlate well in interactive IR system. Thus, by the end of this research, we hope to develop a valid and reliable metrics for IIR evaluation. A first study was set up to explore the relationship between system effectiveness as quantified by traditional measures, such as precision and recall, and users' effectiveness and satisfaction of the results, though this study was limited to few users. The tasks involve finding images for recall-based tasks. It was concluded that no direct relationship between system effectiveness and users' performance. People learn to adapt to a system regardless to its effectiveness. This study recommends that a combination of measures (e.g. system effectiveness, user performance and satisfaction) to be used to evaluate IIR systems. Based on our observation from this study, we found that users' familiarity of the search topic has increased their performance. Thus, we set up a second experiment to investigate how users' satisfaction correlate with some IR effectiveness measures such as precision and the suite of Cumulative Gain measures (CG, DCG, NDCG) in simple web searching tasks. Results from this study have shown that CG and Precision are better than NDCG at reflecting users' satisfaction with the results of an IR system. We have also concluded that users of web search engines, in the context of simple search task, are more concerned with precision than completeness of the search. This stemmed from the stronger correlation between users' satisfaction with the success of overall search and their satisfaction with the accuracy of the search results than with their satisfaction with the completeness of the search. Many scholars such as [1], [2], [3], and [4] have recommended considering perceptions of the users as important as IR effectiveness measures, and both should be interpreted as measures of effectiveness. Therefore, the issue in IIR evaluation should not be focusing on maximizing the retrieval performance, by refining IR techniques alone, but also understanding users' satisfaction, behaviors and information needs. This raises the need for more investigation on measures that translate users' performance and satisfaction as the criterion of a system. Future plans are to incorporate variables domain knowledge, motivation, task complexity and search behaviours on user performance and users evaluation of IR system performance when evaluating interactive IR systems; this is in an attempt to explore the suitability of different measures in IIR evaluation. Thus, the proposed approach adopts a systematic and multidimensional approach to evaluation including not only classical traditional evaluation measures, such as precision and recall, but also interactive non-traditional measures, such as users' characteristics and their satisfaction.

1277988	A summarisation logic for structured documents The logical approach to Information Retrieval tries to model the relevance of a document given a query as the logical implication between documents and queries. In early work, van Rijsbergen states that the retrieval status value of a document given a query is proportional to the degree of implication between a document and a query. Based on this, several probabilistic logics for information retrieval have been conceived, which add an additional layer of abstraction to the information retrieval task: probabilistic models for the retrieval of documents are expressed in those logics, rather than implemented directly. The aim of the research presented here is to develop a logic for the IR task of document summarisation. Such a summarisation logic adds an abstraction layer to the summarisation task, similarly to the way a logic for document retrieval adds a layer to the retrieval task. Probabilistic models for document summarisation will thus be expressed as logical formulae, with the actual implementation hidden by the logical expressions. The "extract-worthyness" of textual components in this logic is measured as the degree of implication from those textual components to their surrounding contexts, providing a measure of how much said components are "about" the context within which they are situated.
1277989	Information-behaviour modeling with external cues Much of human activity defines an information context. We awaken, start work, and hold meetings at roughly the same time every day, and retrieve the same information items (day planners, itineraries, schedules, agendas, reports, menus, web pages, etc.) for many of these activities. Information retrieval systems in general lack sensitivity to such recurrent context, requiring users to remember and re-enter search cues for objects regardless of how regularly or consistently the objects are used, and to develop ad-hoc storage strategies. We propose that in addition to semantic cues, information objects should also be indexed by temporal and sensory cues, such as clock time and location, so that objects can be retrieved by external environmental context, in addition to any internal semantic content. Our cue-event-object (CEO) model uses a network representation to associate information objects with the times and conditions (location, weather, etc.) when they are typically used. Users can query the system to review their activities, revealing what they do at particular times, and which information objects tend to be most often used and when. The system can also pre-fetch items that have proven useful in past similar situations. The CEO model is incremental, real-time, and dynamic, maintaining an accurate summary even as a user's information behaviour changes over time. Such environmentally-aware systems have applications in personal information management, mobile devices, and smart homes. As a memory prosthesis, the model can support autonomous living for the cognitively impaired. We present a comprehensive research agenda based on some promising preliminary findings.
1277990	Fuzzy temporal and spatial reasoning for intelligent information retrieval Temporal and spatial information in text documents is often expressed in a qualitative way. Moreover, both are frequently affected by vagueness, calling for appropriate extensions of traditional frameworks for qualitative reasoning about time and space. Our research aims at defining such extensions based on fuzzy set theory, and applying the resulting frameworks to two important kinds of intelligent information retrieval, viz. temporal question answering and geographic information retrieval.

1277992	Global resources for peer-to-peer text retrieval The thesis presented in this paper tackles selected issues in unstructured peer-to-peer information retrieval (P2PIR) systems, using world knowledge for solving P2PIR problems. A first part uses so-called reference corpora for estimating global term weights such as IDF instead of sampling them from the distributed collection. A second part of the work will be dedicated to the question of query routing in unstructured P2PIR systems using peer resource descriptions and world knowledge for query expansion.
1277993	Automatic query-time generation of retrieval expert coefficients for multimedia retrieval Content-based Multimedia Information Retrieval can be defined as the task of matching a multi-modal information need against various components of a multimedia corpus and retrieving relevant elements. Generally the matching and retrieval takes place across multiple 'features' which can either be visual or audio, or can be high-level or low-level, and each of which can be seen to be an independent retrieval expert. The task of answering a query can thus be formulated as a data fusion problem. Depending on the query, each expert may perform differently and so retrieval coefficients can be used to weight each expert to increase overall performance. Previous approaches to expert coefficient generation have included query-independent coefficients, identification of query-classes and machine learning methods, to name a few. The approach I propose is different, as it seeks to dynamically create expert coefficients which are query-dependent. This approach is based upon earlier experiments where an initial correlation was observed between the score distribution of a retrieval expert, and its relative performance when compared against other experts for that query. I have created a basic method which leverages these observations to create query-time coefficients which achieve comparable performance to oracle-determined query-independent weights, for the experts and collections used in the aforementioned experiment. Previous research which examinedscore distribution did so with respect to relevance, whereas this work seeks to compare expert scores for a given query to determine relative performance. In my work I aim to explore this correlation by eliminating potential bias from the data collections, the retrieval experts and the queries used in experiments to obtain more robust observations. Using and extending previous investigations into data fusion, I will explore where data fusion succeeds in multimedia retrieval, and where it does not. I then aim to refine and extend my existing techniques for automatic coefficient generation to incorporate the new observations, so as to improve performance. Finally I will combine this approach with existing data fusion methods, such as query-class coefficients, with each approach complimenting the other to achieve further performance improvements.
133213	Developing a theory to guide the process of designing information retrieval systems The dominant approaches to information retrieval system design are based on rational theory and cognitive engineering. However, these theories as well as approaches in other disciplines, reviewed in this paper, do not account for communication, or interaction, among design participants which is critical to design outcomes. This research attempts to develop a descriptive design model that accounts for communication among users, designers, and developers throughout the design process. A pilot study has been completed and a preliminary model that represents a first step in understanding participants' evolving perceptions and expectations of the design process and its outcomes is described in this paper.

1390335	Delighting Chinese users: the Google China experience Google entered China market as a late-comer in late-2005, with no local employees, an inadequate product line, and small market share. This talk will discuss Google China's efforts to build up a team, learn about local user needs, apply its global innovation model, and won over users in the past 2.5 years. This talk will cover the results of our user studies, and our key findings about Chinese users for searching and using the Internet. It will also discuss how these findings were applied to our products, and how these products gained traction in the market place. It will also discuss Google's progress in Chinese search relevance, search user experience, and key technology areas where we innovated. This talk will also discuss the process of internationalization - how Google hired locally, and applied its global 20% project approach to encourage truly relevant local innovations. It will discuss several examples of these innovations - from product innovations like the weather map, the input method editor, SMS greetings search, to research innovations like parallel SVM/SVD. Google China's progress dispelled the myth that multinational Internet companies cannot succeed in China. The key ingredients, like in any other success story, are: focus on the customer, embrace the corporate culture, empower local flexibility, and of course, innovate, innovate, innovate.
1390336	Guilt by association as a search principle The exploitation of fundamental invariants is among the most elegant solutions to many computational problems in a wide variety of domains. One of the more powerful approaches to exploit invariants is the principle of "guilt by association". In particular, the principle of guilt by association is the foundation of remote homolog detection, protein function prediction, disease subtype diagnosis, treatment plan prognosis, and other challenges in computational biology. The principle suggests that two entities are in a specific relationship if they exhibit invariant properties underlying that relationship. For example, a protein is predicted to have a particular biological function if it exhibits the underlying invariant properties of that functional group---viz., guilty by association to other members of that functional group through the shared invariant properties. In my talk, I plan to present several facets of guilt by association in the computational prediction of protein function and draw parallels of these facets in information retrieval. Specifically, I plan to touch on the following facets: (a) the issue of chance associations; (b) novel generalizable forms of association; (c) fusion of multiple heterogeneous sources of evidence; (d) the dichotomy of knowing to a high degree of reliability that two entities are in some relationship and yet not knowing what that relationship is. I hope this talk will be, for the informational retrieval community, a window to the opportunities in computational biology that may benefit from the depth and variety of solutions information retrieval has to offer.
1390452	Exploring evaluation metrics: GMAP versus MAP In retrieval experiments, an effectiveness metrics is used to generate a score for each system-topic pair being tested. It is then usual to average the system-topic scores to obtain a system score, which is used for the purpose of system comparison. In this paper we explore the ramifications of using the geometric mean (GMAP), rather than the arithmetic mean (MAP) when computing an aggregate system score from a set of system-topic scores. We find that GMAP does indeed handle variability in topic difficulty more consistently than does the usual MAP aggregation method.
1390455	Relevance thresholds in system evaluations We introduce and explore the concept of an individual's relevance threshold as a way of reconciling differences in outcomes between batch and user experiments.
1390457	Structuring collections with Scatter/Gather extensions A major component of sense-making is organizing--grouping, labeling, and summarizing--the data at hand in order to form a useful mental model, a necessary precursor to identifying missing information and to reasoning about the data. Previous work has shown the Scatter/Gather model to be useful in exploratory activities that occur when users encounter unknown document collections. However, the topic structure communicated by Scatter/Gather is closely tied to the behavior of the underlying clustering algorithm; this structure may not reflect the mental model most applicable to the information need. In this paper we describe the initial design of a mixed-initiative information structuring tool that leverages aspects of the well-studied Scatter/Gather model but permits the user to impose their own desired structure when necessary.
1390458	Text collections for FIRE The aim of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) is to create a Cranfield-like evaluation framework in the spirit of TREC, CLEF and NTCIR, for Indian Language Information Retrieval. For the first year, six Indian languages have been selected: Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu. This poster describes the tasks as well as the document and topic collections that are to be used at the FIRE workshop.
1390463	Emulating query-biased summaries using document titles Generating query-biased summaries can take up a large part of the response time of interactive information retrieval (IIR) systems. This paper proposes to use document titles as an alternative to queries in the generation of summaries. The use of document titles allows us to pre-generate summaries statically, and thus, improve the response speed of IIR systems. Our experiments suggest that title-biased summaries are a promising alternative to query-biased summaries.
1390464	Hierarchical naive bayes models for representing user profiles In this paper, we show how a user profile can be enhanced when a more detailed description of the products is included. Two main assumptions have been considered: the first implies that the set of features used to describe an item can be organized into a well-defined set of components or categories, and the second is that the user's rating for a given item is obtained by combining user opinions of the relevance of each component.
1390466	The impact of history length on personalized search Personalized search is a promising way to better serve different users' information needs. Search history is one of the major information sources for search personalization. We investigated the impact of history length on the effectiveness of personalized ranking. We carried out task-based user study for Web search, and obtained ranked relevance judgments for all queries. Query contexts derived from previous queries in the same task are used to re-rank results for the current query. Experimental results show that the performance of personalization generally improves as more queries are accumulated, but most of the benefits come from a few immediately preceding queries.
1390467	User preference choices for complex question answering Question answering systems increasingly need to deal with complex information needs that require more than simple factoid answers. The evaluation of such systems is usually carried out using precision- or recall-based system performance metrics. Previous work has demonstrated that when users are shown two search result lists side-by-side, they can reliably differentiate between the qualities of the lists. We investigate the consistency between this user-based approach and system-oriented metrics in the question answering environment. Our initial results indicate that the two methodologies show a high level of disagreement.
1390468	Towards personalized distributed information retrieval Our aim is to investigate if and how the performance of Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems can be improved through personalization. Toward this aim we are building a testbed of document collections and corresponding personalized relevance judgments. In this paper we discuss our intended approach for personalizing the three different phases of the DIR process. We also describe the test collection we are building and discuss our methodology for evaluating personalized DIR using relevance information taken from social bookmarking data.
1390471	Personal vs non-personal blogs: initial classification experiments We address the task of separating personal from non-personal blogs, and report on a set of baseline experiments where we compare the performance on a small set of features across a set of five classifiers. We show that with a limited set of features a performance of up to 90% can be obtained.
1390475	Aggregated click-through data in a homogeneous user community There are many proposed methods for using clickthrough data for common queries to improve the quality of search results returned for that query. In this study we examine the search behaviour of users in a close-knit community on such queries. We argue that the benefit of using aggregated clickthrough data varies from task to task: it may improve document rankings for navigational or specific informational queries, but is less likely to be of value to users issuing a broad informational query.
1390480	SOPING: a Chinese customer review mining system With the booming development of the Web, popular Chinese forums enable people to find experienced customers' reviews for products. In order to get an all-around opinion about one product, users need to go through plenty of web pages, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Consequently, automatic review mining and summarization has become a hot research topic recently. However, previous approaches are not applicable for mining Chinese customer reviews. In this paper, we introduce SOPING, a Chinese customer review mining system that mines reviews from forums. Specifically, we propose a novel search-based approach to extract product features and a feature-oriented sentence orientation determination method. Our experimental results show that our proposed techniques are highly effective.
1390487	Search effectiveness with a breadth-first crawl Previous scalability experiments found that early precision improves as collection size increases. However, that was under the assumption that a collection's documents are all sampled with uniform probability from the same population. We contrast this to a large breadth-first web crawl, an important scenario in real-world Web search, where the early documents have quite different characteristics from the later documents.
1390489	Web page retrieval in ubiquitous sensor environments This paper proposes new concept of query free web search for daily living. We ordinarily benefit from additional information about our daily activities that we are currently engaged in. When washing a coffee maker, for example, we receive the benefit if we obtain such information as 'cleaning a coffee maker with vinegar removes its stain well.' Our proposed method automatically searches for a web page including such information relates to an activity of daily living when the activity is performed. We assume that wireless sensor nodes are attached to daily objects to detect object use; our method makes a query from the names of objects which are used. Then, the method retrieves a web page relates to the activity of daily living by using the query.
1390490	Automatic document prior feature selection for web retrieval Document prior features, such as Pagerank and URL depth, can improve the retrieval effectiveness of Web Information Retrieval (IR) systems. However, not all queries equally benefit from the application of a document prior feature. This paper aims to investigate whether the retrieval performance can be further enhanced by selecting the best document prior feature on a per-query basis. We present a novel method for selecting the best document prior feature on a per-query basis. We evaluate our technique on the TREC .GOV Web test collection and its associated TREC 2003 Web search tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed selection method.
1390491	Using parsimonious language models on web data In this paper we explore the use of parsimonious language models for web retrieval. These models are smaller thus more efficient than the standard language models and are therefore well suited for large-scale web retrieval. We have conducted experiments on four TREC topic sets, and found that the parsimonious language model results in improvement of retrieval effectiveness over the standard language model for all data-sets and measures. In all cases the improvement is significant, and more substantial than in earlier experiments on newspaper/newswire data.
1390496	A word shape coding method for camera-based document images This paper reports a word shape coding method to facilitate retrieval of camera-based document images without OCR. Due to perspective distortion, many reported word shape coding methods fail on camera-based images. In this paper, the problem is addressed by approximating the perspective transformation with an affine transformation, and employing an affine invariant, namely length ratio, to represent the connected components. Components in a document image are classified into a few clusters, each of which is assigned with a representative symbol. Retrieval are based on "words" comprising of symbols. The experiment results showed that the proposed method achieved an average retrieval precision of 93.43% and recall of 94.22%.
1390499	WISA: a novel web image semantic analysis system We present a novel Web Image Semantic Analysis (WISA) system, which explores the problem of adaptively modeling the distributions of the semantic labels of the web image on its surrounding text. To deal with this problem, we employ a new piecewise penalty weighted regression model to learn the weights of the contributions of the different parts of the surrounding text to the semantic labels of images. Experimental results on a real web image data set show that it can improve the performance of web image semantic annotation significantly.
1390500	One-button search extracts wider interests: an empirical study with video bookmarking search This poster presents an overview of the characteristics of a one-button information retrieval interface with closed captions from TV watching activities, which is intended to lighten the burden of remembering and entering query terms while watching TV. We investigated this interface with an experimental system named Video Bookmarking Search , which estimates query terms from closed captions with named-entity recognition and sentence labeling techniques. According to an empirical evaluation for 1,138 search queries from 206 bookmarks using seven actual TV shows on city life, travel, health, and cuisine, we found wider queries and search results are acceptable through the query-input-free interface, despite the fact that the number of queries and search results that are directly relevant to the users' original intentions is not high. The main reason is a watching user's interest is wider than what is expressed with query terms.
1390503	Improving biomedical document retrieval using domain knowledge Research articles typically introduce new results or findings and relate them to knowledge entities of immediate relevance. However, a large body of context knowledge related to the results is often not explicitly mentioned in the article. To overcome this limitation the state-of-the-art information retrieval approaches rely on the latent semantic analysis in which terms in articles are projected to a lower dimensional latent space and best possible matches in this space are identified. However, this approach may not perform well enough if the number of explicit knowledge entities in the articles is too small compared to the amount of knowledge in the domain. We address the problem by exploiting a domain knowledge layer, a rich network of relations among knowledge entities in the domain extracted from a large corpus of documents. The knowledge layer supplies the context knowledge that lets us relate different knowledge entities and hence improve the information retrieval performance. We develop and study a new framework for i) learning and aggregating the relations in the knowledge layer from the literature corpus; ii) and for exploiting these relations to improve the information-retrieval of relevant documents.
1390505	Enhancing keyword-based botanical information retrieval with information extraction Keyword-based retrieval matches search terms and documents via term co-occurrence. Such an approach does not allow matching based on the specific plant characteristic descriptions that are often used in botanical text retrieval. This study applies information extraction techniques to automatically extract plant characteristic information from text and allows users to search using such information in combination with keywords. An evaluation experiment was conducted using actual users. The results indicate that this approach enhances task-based retrieval performance.
1390507	Generating diverse katakana variants based on phonemic mapping In Japanese, it is quite common for the same word to be written in several different ways. This is especially true for katakana words which are typically used for transliterating foreign languages. This ambiguity becomes critical for automatic processing such as information retrieval (IR). To tackle this problem, we propose a simple but effective approach to generating katakana variants by considering phonemic representation of the original language for a given word. The proposed approach is evaluated through an assessment of the variants it generates. Also, the impact of the generated variants on IR is studied in comparison to an existing approach using katakana rewriting rules.
1390510	A scalable assistant librarian: hierarchical subject classification of books In this paper, we discuss our work in progress towards a scalable hierarchical classification system for books using the Library of Congress subject hierarchy. We examine the characteristics of this domain which make the problem very challenging, and we look at several appropriate performance measurements. We show that both Hieron and Hierarchical Support Vector Machines perform moderately well.
1390511	Information retrieval on bug locations by learning co-located bug report clusters Bug locating usually involves intensive search activities and incurs unpredictable cost of labor and time. An issue of information retrieval on bug locations is particularly addressed to facilitate identifying bugs from software code. In this paper, a novel bug retrieval approach with co-location shrinkage (CS) is proposed. The proposed approach has been implemented in open-source software projects collected from real-world repositories, and consistently improves the retrieval accuracy of a state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
1390512	Summarization of compressed text images: an experience on Indic script documents Automatic summarization of JBIG2 coded textual images is discussed. Compressed images are partially decompressed to compute relevant features. The feature extraction method is free from using any character recognition module. Summary sentences are ranked. Experiment considers documents in Indic scripts that lack in having any efficient OCR systems. Script independent aspect of the approach is highlighted through use of two most popular Indic scripts. Sentence selection efficiency of about 61% is achieved when judged against man-made summarization. A nonparametric (distribution-free) rank statistic shows a correlation coefficient of 0.33 as a measure of the (minimum) strength of the associations between sentence ranking by machine and human.
1390515	Improving relevance feedback in language modeling with score regularization We demonstrate that regularization can improve feedback in a language modeling framework.
1390516	Theoretical bounds on and empirical robustness of score regularization to different similarity measures We present theoretical bounds and empirical robustness of score regularization given changes in the similarity measure.
1390522	Exploiting proximity feature in bigram language model for information retrieval Language modeling approaches have been effectively dealing with the dependency among query terms based on N-gram such as bigram or trigram models. However, bigram language models suffer from adjacency-sparseness problem which means that dependent terms are not always adjacent in documents, but can be far from each other, sometimes with distance of a few sentences in a document. To resolve the adjacency-sparseness problem, this paper proposes a new type of bigram language model by explicitly incorporating the proximity feature between two adjacent terms in a query. Experimental results on three test collections show that the proposed bigram language model significantly improves previous bigram model as well as Tao's approach, the state-of-art method for proximity-based method.
1390525	Adaptive label-driven scaling for latent semantic indexing This paper targets on enhancing Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by exploiting category labels. Specifically, in the term-document matrix, the vector for each term either appearing in labels or semantically close to labels is scaled before performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to boost its impact on the generated left singular vectors. As a result, the similarities among documents in the same category are increased. Furthermore, an adaptive scaling strategy is designed to better utilize the hierarchical structure of categories. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to significantly improve the performance of hierarchical text categorization.
1390526	Fixed-threshold SMO for Joint Constraint Learning Algorithm of Structural SVM In this paper, we describe a fixed-threshold sequential minimal optimization (FSMO) for a joint constraint learning algorithm of structural classification SVM problems. Because FSMO uses the fact that the joint constraint formulation of structural SVM has b =0, FSMO breaks down the quadratic programming (QP) problems of structural SVM into a series of smallest QP problems, each involving only one variable. By using only one variable, FSMO is advantageous in that each QP sub-problem does not need subset selection.
1390527	Posterior probabilistic clustering using NMF We introduce the posterior probabilistic clustering (PPC), which provides a rigorous posterior probability interpretation for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and removes the uncertainty in clustering assignment. Furthermore, PPC is closely related to probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI).
1390528	On document splitting in passage detection Passages can be hidden within a text to circumvent their disallowed transfer. Such release of compartmentalized information is of concern to all corporate and governmental organization. We explore the methodology to detect such hidden passages within a document. A document is divided into passages using various document splitting techniques, and a text classifier is used to categorize such passages. We present a novel document splitting technique called dynamic windowing, which significantly improves precision, recall and F1 measure.
1390529	Learning with support vector machines for query-by-multiple-examples We explore an alternative Information Retrieval paradigm called Query-By-Multiple-Examples (QBME) where the information need is described not by a set of terms but by a set of documents. Intuitive ideas for QBME include using the centroid of these documents or the well-known Rocchio algorithm to construct the query vector. We consider this problem from the perspective of text classification , and find that a better query vector can be obtained through learning with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For online queries, we show how SVMs can be learned from one-class examples in linear time. For offline queries, we show how SVMs can be learned from positive and unlabeled examples together in linear or polynomial time. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches have been confirmed by our experiments on four real-world datasets.
1390530	Question classification with semantic tree kernel Question Classification plays an important role in most Question Answering systems. In this paper, we exploit semantic features in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for Question Classification. We propose a semantic tree kernel to incorporate semantic similarity information. A diverse set of semantic features is evaluated. Experimental results show that SVMs with semantic features, especially semantic classes, can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art systems.
1390534	XML-aided phrase indexing for hypertext documents We combine techniques of XML Mining and Text Mining for the benefit of Information Retrieval. By manipulating the word sequence according to the XML structure of the marked-up text, we strengthen phrase boundaries so that they are more obvious to the algorithms that extract multiword sequences from text. Consequently, the quality of the indexed phrases improves, which has a positive effect on the average precision measured by the INEX 2007 standards.
1390540	Utilizing phrase based semantic information for term dependency Previous work on term dependency has not taken into account semantic information underlying query phrases. In this work, we study the impact of utilizing phrase based concepts for term dependency. We use Wikipedia to separate important and less important term dependencies, and treat them accordingly as features in a linear feature-based retrieval model. We compare our method with a Markov Random Field (MRF) model on four TREC document collections. Our experimental results show that utilizing phrase based concepts improves the retrieval effectiveness of term dependency, and reduces the size of the feature set to large extent.
1390543	Site-based dynamic pruning for query processing in search engines Web search engines typically index and retrieve at the page level. In this study, we investigate a dynamic pruning strategy that allows the query processor to first determine the most promising websites and then proceed with the similarity computations for those pages only within these sites.
1390544	Exploiting MDS Projections for Cross-language IR In this paper, we describe some preliminary work on using monolingual projections of document collections for performing cross-language information retrieval tasks. The proposed methodology uses multidimensional scaling for projecting the vector-space representations of a given multilingual document collection into spaces of lower dimensionality. An independent projection is computed for each different language, and the structural similarities of the resulting projections are exploited for information retrieval tasks.
1390545	Local approximation of PageRank and reverse PageRank We consider the problem of approximating the PageRank of a target node using only local information provided by a link server. We prove that local approximation of PageRank is feasible if and only if the graph has low in-degree and admits fast PageRank convergence. While natural graphs, such as the web graph, are abundant with high in-degree nodes, making local PageRank approximation too costly, we show that reverse natural graphs tend to have low indegree while maintaining fast PageRank convergence. It follows that calculating Reverse PageRank locally is frequently more feasible than computing PageRank locally. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of Reverse PageRank in five different applications.

1390554	Clustering search results for mobile terminals Mobile terminals such as cell phones are much more restricted in terms of input/output functionality and, therefore, some special techniques must be incorporated to enable them to be easily used for Web searching. Further, searching for a location name is related to a dazzling variety of topics. We relate these two factors to each other to yield a new search system for map and text information. Presenting search results as clusters is helpful for users, especially in a mobile environment. The system makes mobile web searching easier and more efficient.

1390557	Cross-lingual search over 22 european languages In this paper we present a system for cross-lingual information retrieval, which can handle tens of languages and millions of documents. Functioning of the system is demonstrated on corpus of European Legislation (22 languages, more than 400,000 documents per language). The system uses an interactive web-interface, which can take advantage of a predefined thesaurus allowing the user to dynamically re-rank the retrieval results based on the mapping onto a predefined thesaurus.
1390558	Social recommendations at work Online communities have become popular for publishing and searching content, and also for connecting to other users. User-generated content includes, for example, personal blogs, bookmarks, and digital photos. Items can be annotated and rated by different users, and users can connect to others that are usually friends and/or share common interests. We demonstrate a social recommendation system that takes advantages of users connections and tagging behavior to compute recommendations of items in such communities. The advantages can be verified via comparison to a standard IR technique.

1390563	From concepts to implementation and visualization: tools from a team-based approach to ir Researchers have been studying and developing teaching materials for information retrieval (IR), such as [3]. Toolkits also have been built that provide hands-on experience to students. For example, IR-Toolbox [4] is an effort to close the gap between the students' understanding of IR concepts and real-life indexing and search systems. Such tools might be good for helping students in non-technical areas such as in the Library and Information Science field to develop their conceptual model of search engines. However, they do not cover emerging topics and skills, such as content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and fusion search. Although there is open source software (such as those in http://www.searchtools.com/tools/tools-opensource.html) that can be used to teach basic and advanced IR topics, they require a student to have high-level technical knowledge and to spend a long time to gain a practical understanding of these topics. We present a new and rapid approach to teach basic and advanced IR topics, such as text retrieval, web-based IR, CBIR, and fusion search, to Computer Science (CS) graduate students. We designed projects that would help students grasp the abovementioned IR topics. Students, working in teams, were given a practical application to start with -- the Superimposed Application for Image Description and Retrieval [5]. SAIDR (earlier, SIERRA) allows users to associate parts of images with multimedia information such as text annotations. Also, users may retrieve information in one of two 2 ways: (1) Perform text-based retrieval on annotations; (2) Perform CBIR on images and parts of images that look like a query image (or part of a query image). Each team was asked to build an enhancement for this application, involving text retrieval and/or CBIR, in three weeks time. The sub-projects are described in Table 1. The outcome of this activity was that students learned about IR concepts while being able to relate their applicability to a real world problem (Figure 1). Details of these projects may be found at http://collab.dlib.vt.edu/runwiki/wiki.pl?TabletPcImageRetrievalSuperimposedInformation. We will demonstrate the tools developed along with the IR concepts they illustrate (Table 1). We believe these tools may aid others to learn about basic and advanced topics in IR.
1390565	Exploiting XML structure to improve information retrieval in peer-to-peer systems With the advent of XML as a standard for representation and exchange of structured documents, a growing amount of XML-documents are being stored in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. Cur¬rent research on P2P search engines proposes the use of Informa¬tion Retrieval (IR) techniques to perform content-based search, but does not take into account structural features of documents. P2P systems typically have no central index, thus avoiding single-points-of-failures, but distribute all information among participating peers. Accordingly, a querying peer has only limited access to the index information and should select carefully which peers can help answering a given query by contributing resources such as local index information or CPU time for ranking computations. Bandwidth consumption is a major issue. To guarantee scalability, P2P systems have to reduce the number of peers involved in the retrieval process. As a result, the retrieval quality in terms of recall and precision may suffer substantially. In the proposed thesis, document structure is considered as an extra source of information to improve the retrieval quality of XML-documents in a P2P environment. The thesis centres on the following questions: how can structural information help to improve the retrieval of XML-documents in terms of result quality such as precision, recall, and specificity? Can XML structure support the routing of queries in distributed environments, especially the selection of promising peers? How can XML IR techniques be used in a P2P network while minimizing bandwidth consumption and considering performance aspects? To answer these questions and to analyze possible achievements, a search engine is proposed that exploits structural hints expressed explicitly by the user or implicitly by the self-describing structure of XML-documents. Additionally, more focused and specific results are obtained by providing ranked retrieval units that can be either XML-documents as a whole or the most relevant passages of theses documents. XML information retrieval techniques are applied in two ways: to select those peers participating in the retrieval process, and to compute the relevance of documents. The indexing approach includes both content and structural information of documents. To support efficient execution of multi term queries, index keys consist of rare combinations of (content, structure)-tuples. Performance is increased by using only fixedsized posting lists: frequent index keys are combined with each other iteratively until the new combination is rare, with a posting list size under a pre-set threshold. All posting lists are sorted by taking into account classical IR measures such as term frequency and inverted term frequency as well as weights for potential retrieval units of a document, with a slight bias towards documents on peers with good collections regarding the current index key and with good peer characteristics such as online times, available bandwidth, and latency. When extracting the posting list for a specific query, a re-ordering on the posting list is performed that takes into account the structural similarity between key and query. According to this preranking, peers are selected that are expected to hold information about potentially relevant documents and retrieval units The final ranking is computed in parallel on those selected peers. The computation is based on an extension of the vector space model and distinguishes between weights for different structures of the same content. This allows weighting XML elements with respect to their discriminative power, e.g. a title will be weighted much higher than a footnote. Additionally, relevance is computed as a mixture of content relevance and structural similarity between a given query and a potential retrieval unit. Currently, a first prototype for P2P Information Retrieval of XML-documents called SPIRIX is being implemented. Experiments to evaluate the proposed techniques and use of structural hints will be performed on a distributed version of the INEX Wikipedia Collection.
1390566	Affective feedback: an investigation into the role of emotions in the information seeking process User feedback is considered to be a critical element in the information seeking process. An important aspect of the feedback cycle is relevance assessment that has progressively become a popular practice in web searching activities and interactive information retrieval (IR). The value of relevance assessment lies in the disambiguation of the user's information need, which is achieved by applying various feedback techniques. Such techniques vary from explicit to implicit and help determine the relevance of the retrieved documents. The former type of feedback is usually obtained through the explicit and intended indication of documents as relevant (positive feedback) or irrelevant (negative feedback). Explicit feedback is a robust method for improving a system's overall retrieval performance and producing better query reformulations [1], at the expense of users' cognitive resources. On the other hand, implicit feedback techniques tend to collect information on search behavior in a more intelligent and unobtrusive manner. By doing so, they disengage the users from the cognitive burden of document rating and relevance judgments. Information-seeking activities such as reading time, saving, printing, selecting and referencing have been all treated as indicators of relevance, despite the lack of sufficient evidence to support their effectiveness [2]. Besides their apparent differences, both categories of feedback techniques determine document relevance with respect to the cognitive and situational levels of the interactive dialogue that occurs between the user and the retrieval system [5]. However, this approach does not account for the dynamic interplay and adaptation that takes place between the different dialogue levels, but most importantly it does not consider the affective dimension of interaction. Users interact with intentions, motivations and feelings apart from real-life problems and information objects, which are all critical aspects of cognition and decision-making [3][4]. By evaluating users' affective response towards an information object (e.g. a document), prior and post to their exposure to it, a more accurate understanding of the object's properties and degree of relevance to the current information need may be facilitated. Furthermore, systems that can detect and respond accordingly to user emotions could potentially improve the naturalness of human-computer interaction and progressively optimize their retrieval strategy. The current study investigates the role of emotions in the information seeking process, as the latter are communicated through multi-modal interaction, and reconsiders relevance feedback with respect to what occurs on the affective level of interaction as well.
1390567	Exploring and measuring dependency trees for informationretrieval Natural language processing techniques are believed to hold a tremendous potential to supplement the purely quantitative methods of text information retrieval. This has led to the emergence of a large number of NLP-based IR research projects over the last few years, even though the empirical evidence to support this has often been inadequate. Most contributions of NLP to IR mainly concentrate on document representation and compound term matching strategies. Researchers have noted that the simple term-based representation of document content such as vector representation is usually inadequate for accurate discrimination. The "bag of words" representation does not invoke linguistic considerations and allow modelling of relationships between subsets of words. However, even though a variety of content indicator such as syntactic phrase have been tried and investigated for representing documents rather than single terms in IR systems, the matching strategy over those representation still cannot go beyond traditional statistical techniques that measure term co-occurrence characteristics and proximity in analyzing text structure. In this paper, we propose a novel IR strategy (SIR) with NLP techniques involved at the syntactic level. Within SIR, documents and query representation are built on the basis of a syntactic data structure of the natural language text - the dependency tree, in which syntactic relationships between words are identified and structured in the form of a tree. In order to capture the syntactic relations between words in their hierarchical structural representation, the matching strategy in SIR upgrades from the traditional statistical techniques by introducing a similarity measure method executing on the graph representation level as the key determiner. A basic IR experiment is designed and implemented on the TREC data to evaluate if this novel IR model is feasible. Experimental results indicate that this approach has the potential to outperform the standard bag of words IR model, especially in response to syntactical structured queries.

1390569	Task detection for activity-based desktop search The desktop search tools provide powerful query capabilities and result presentation techniques. However, they do not take the user context into account. We propose to exploit collected information about user activities with desktop files and applications for activity-based desktop search. When I prepare for a project review and type in a search box the name of a colleague, I expect to find her last deliverable draft, but not her email with a paper review or our joint conference presentation. Ideally, the desktop search system should be able to infer my current task from the logs of my previous activities and present task-specific search results.

These vast personal archives (or Human Digital Memories (HDMs)) pose new challenges and opportunities for the research community, not the least of which is developing effective means of retrieval from HDMs. Personal archive retrieval research is still in its infancy and there is much scope for novel research. My PhD proposes to develop effective HDM retrieval algorithms by combining rich sources of context associated with items, such as location and people present data, with information obtained by linking HDM items in novel ways.
1390575	Extending language modeling techniques to models of search and browsing activity in a digital library Users searching for information in a digital library or on the WWW can be modeled as individuals moving through a semantic space by issuing queries and clicking on hyperlinks. As they go, they emit a stream of interaction data. Most of it is linguistic data. Lots of it is captured in logs. Some of it is used to guess what the user is searching for. But to most information retrieval systems, each user interaction is a stateless point in this space. There is a timeline connecting each of these points, but systems seldom make use of this as sequence data, in part because there is no clear way to systematically characterize the meaningful relations within a sequence of user activity. It is a problem of pragmatics as much as it is of semantics--the fact that a user clicked on a particular link, or added a particular term to their query, has meaning primarily in relation to the preceding actions. A remaining challenge in IR is to extract features of the user interaction data that will give meaning to those relations. Meanwhile, from the user's perspective each of these points in time and semantic space are just part of a path of exploration. To the user, the exact terms in a query, or the specific words surrounding a hypertext link, may be less important than the trajectory those terms establish in relation to the user's path. Identifying the meaningful relations between queries and page views within a sequence of activity increases our understanding of users and their information needs. Formally, we can model query and browsing behaviors as surface forms of a hidden process. What is missing is a layer of abstraction for mapping sequences of interaction in a way that is both descriptive of users' needs and useful to automation. The work I describe is an effort to identify features of data in logs of query and browsing activity that are highly predictive of certain types of behavior. Sequences of interaction data from individual users are modeled as sequences of expression. Statistical modeling techniques that are effective for modeling sequences in natural language processing and bioinformatics are examined for their ability to model sequences of interaction between an information searcher and an information retrieval system. Queries and click-throughs in this stream of interaction can be tagged with features such as semantic coordinates, timing, frequency of use, type of action, etc. By analyzing large collections of interaction sequences it is possible to identify frequent patterns of user behavior. From these patterns we can make predictions about future interactions. For example, certain patterns of link following in a digital library are highly predictive of users' next steps while other patterns are not. General models of user interaction are useful for design and evaluation of search interfaces. Individual models of user interaction are useful for personalized search and customized content. Yet very little research has been done to investigate which features are optimal for modeling user queries and browsing as interaction sequences. An important first step is to identify informative features and the relationships between features. I propose to construct models of user behavior based on user data in logs of query and browsing activity and to identify features that are highly predictive of certain types of user behaviors. I examine activity within search sessions on a digital library as a microcosm of larger systems. I expect to find features that are useful in predictive models of user behavior both at an individual and aggregate level. Where possible, I hope to identify meaningful relationships between those features. The work has implications beyond the scope of digital libraries, to larger systems and broader search domains.

345612	Latent semantic indexing model for Boolean query formulation (poster session) A new model named Boolean Latent Semantic Indexing model based on the Singular Value Decomposition and Boolean query formulation is introduced. While the Singular Value Decomposition alleviates the problems of lexical matching in the traditional information retrieval model, Boolean query formulation can help users to make precise representation of their information search needs. Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections seem to show that the proposed model achieves substantial performance gains over the Latent Semantic Indexing model.
345618	Variance based classifier comparison in text catergorization (poster session) Text categorization is one of the key functions for utilizing vast amount of documents. It can be seen as a classification problem, which has been studied in pattern recognition and machine learning fields for a long time and several classification methods have been developed such as statistical classification, decision tree, support vector machines and so on. Many researchers applied those classification methods to text categorization and reported their performance (e.g., decision tree[3], Bayes classifier[2], support vector machine[l]). Yang conducted comprehensive study of comparison or text categorization and reported that k nearest neighbor and support vector machines works well for text categorization[4]. In the previous studies, classification methods were usually compared using single pair of training and test data However, classification method with more complex family of classifiers requires more training data and small training data may result in deriving unreliable classifier, that is, the performance of the derived classifier varies much depending on training data. Therefore, we need to take the size of training data into account when comparing and selecting a classification method. In this paper, we discuss how to select a classifier from those derived by various classification methods and how the size of training data affects the performance of the derived classifier. In order to evaluate the reliability of classification method, we consider the variance of accuracy of derived classifier. We first construct a statistical model. In the text categorization, each document is usually represented with a feature vector that consists of weighted frequencies of terms. In the vector space model, document is a point in high dimensional feature space and a classifier separates the feature space into subspaces each of which is labeled with a category.
345622	Pseudo-frequency method (poster session): an efficient document ranking retrieval method for n-gram indexing Although n-gram ( n successive characters) indexing is widely used in retrieval systems for documents in Japanese and other Asian languages, it is difficult to process ranking retrieval efficiently using n-gram indexing. This is because frequency information for query words needs to be computed using indexed data since this information is not directly available from the n-gram index. To reduce processing costs, this paper proposes a pseudo-frequency method, which uses a word's estimated frequencies instead of precise ones. The results of experiments on NTCIR, a Japanese IR test collection, showed that the proposed method speeded up retrieval without degrading retrieval effectiveness.

345632	Cognitive approach for building user model in an information retrieval context (poster session) The recent development of communication networks and multimedia system provides users with the availability of a huge amount of information making worse the problem of information overload [9]. The evolution of system design is necessary becoming more user centred, and more personally involving. A review of survey studies on Internet users since 1993 confirms that a greater percentage of people are becoming online citizens, and professionals are integrating more online components into their work process. A review of the experimental literature on Internet user's reveals that there is intense interest in humanising the online environment by integrating affective and cognitive components [8]. We are specially in concern with the effects on the evolution on information retrieval. We can notice significant changes in the information retrieval world over the past five or so years due to the emergence of Internet and one of its most important and widely used services, the world wide Web (WWW) or simply the Web. While reviewing the progress of research in information retrieval and user modelling, we can observe that many systems and prtotypes are created [5], [10], [11], but all of them, share some basic limitations: the techniques used to represent knowledge in the user model is based on simple list of keyword, the type of the considered knowledge is very limited, usually restricted to single word, or to (some) structural characteristic: the learning capability are very poor. We aim to propose a cognitive approach for building user model in an information retrieval context. In fact cognitive approach is based on identifying how users process information and what constitutes an appropriate model to represent this process, and because IR, under the cognitive paradigm takes the user into account in a high-priority way [1]. However, within the cognitive paradigm, there is no general model valid for our documentary approach that satisfactorily how user knowledge is represented for the purpose of processing information. The lack of such a model does not allow one to identify a user's cognitive state with regard to his or her information needs and requirements. Methodology adopting the cognitive viewpoint in IR are Synthesised by Daniel [4] in three groups, which comprise the representation of: users and their problem, which stems from the hypothesis proposed by Belkin on the `anomalous states of knowledge' (ASK), according to which the user searches for information search strategy, which compile the different ways search strategies and processes are carried out, depending on the variable involved - user, intermediary, IR systems [6],[7] document and information, which is considered a major goal of current IR research, since it embraces the whole corpus of studies about user models intended to eliminate the intermediary's role in retrieval system. The aim of this approach is to allow users direct access to the system by means of the representation of documents and intelligent interfaces. User-centered paradigm now dominates in studies of information needs and information retrieval. We have the goal of developing new approaches to information retrieval which are based on user modelling techniques for building and managing the representation of the user preferances. In this paper, we describe two complementary approaches which are necessary for building user model and its integration in an information retrieval system: a conceptual one based on the description of knowledge needed by the user in an information retrieval context, a functional approach which deals with dynamic aspects of the model. Within this approach we aim to determine the role played by the model in an information retrieval context. In many studies of IR interesting in user modelling we find different kind of knowledge trying to describe user's need. So our conceptual approach has consisted in enumerating these knowledge and integrating them in their adequate components in information retrieval architecture. Almost of these studies that identified cognitive characteristics have used quantitative methods to measure them. What is needed is a qualitative study and appropriate method to ascertain these cognitive characteristic [12]. Our main objective is the development of techniques for modelling the user as an interactive part of IR, so we propose our functional approach which deals with identifying cognitive characteristic within the role played by the user model in an information retrieval architecture. So we began by presenting the conceptual approach and so the functional one.
345641	Word document density and relevance scoring (poster session) Previous work addressing the issue of word distribution in documents has shown the importance of Word repetitiveness as an indicator of the word content-bearing characteristics. In this paper we propose a simple method using a measure of the tendency of words to repeat within a document to separate the words with similar document frequencies, but different topic discriminating characteristics. We describe the application of the new measure in query-document relevance scoring. Experiments on the TREC Ad Hoc and Spoken Document Retrieval tasks [7] show useful performance improvements.

345652	Exploration of a heuristic approach to threshold learning in adaptive filtering (poster session) In this paper we examine the learning behavior of a heuristic threshold setting approach to information filtering. In particular, we study how different initial threshold settings and different updating parameter settings affect threshold learning. The results on one of the TREC news databases indicate that (1) learning allows recovery from the inevitable non-optimality of the initial conditions, and (2) a greater “willingness to learn” (expressed by a deliberate lowering of the score threshold in the learning stage) does eventually lead to a higher performance in spite of the expected initial performance penalty.

345666	Information access for context-aware appliances (poster session) The emergence of networked context-aware mobile computing appliances potentially offers opportunities for remote access to huge online information resources. Information access in context-aware information appliances can utilize existing techniques developed for effective information retrieval and information filtering; however, practical physical and operational features of these devices and the availability of context information itself suggest that the document selection process should make use of this contextual data.
345667	Finding relevant passages using noun-noun compounds (poster session): coherence vs. proximity Intuitively, words forming phrases are a more precise description of content than words as a sequence of keywords. Yet, evidence that phrases would be more effective for information retrieval is inconclusive. This paper isolates a neglected class of phrases, that is abundant in communication, has an established theoretical foundation, and shows promise for an effective expression of the user's information need: the noun-noun compound ( NNC ). In an experiment, a variety of meaningful NNC s were used to isolate relevant passages in a large and varied corpus. In a first pass, passages were retrieved based on textual proximity of the words or their semantic peers. A second pass retained only passages containing a syntactically coherent structure equivalent to the original NNC . This second pass showed a dramatic increase in precision. Preliminary results show the validity of our intuition about phrases in the special but very productive case of NNC s.

344658	Salton Award lecture: on theoretical argument in information retrieval (summary only): on theoretical argument in information retrieval The last winner of the Salton Award, Tefko Saracevic, gave an acceptance address at SIGIR in Philadelphia in 1997. Previous winners were William Cooper (1994), Cyril Cleverdon (1991), Karen Sparck Jones (1988) and Gerard Salton himself (1985). In this talk, I plan to follow the tradition of acceptance addresses, and present a personal view of and retrospective on some of the areas in which I work. However, I will not be saying much about what are perhaps the two most obvious parts of my work: the probabilistic approach to retrieval and evaluation of retrieval systems. Rather I will attempt to get under the skin of my take on IR, by discussing the nature of theoretical argument in the field, partly through examples. This talk is about the place of theory in the study of information retrieval (in some sense following Bill Cooper's 1994 topic), but not so much Theory with a capital T — rather what might be described as small-t theory. The field has a very strong pragmatic orientation, reflected both in the attitudes of the commercial participants and in the emphasis on formal evaluation in the academic environment. Nevertheless, there are many theoretical ideas buried in, or implied by, the ways we talk about the field — the language we use to discuss it. I will be discussing two areas to illustrate these low-level theoretical ideas: precision devices, and the apparent symmetry between retrieval and filtering. The phrase `precision device' used to have a rather clear meaning in IR, in the days of set-based retrieval systems. In that context, a precision device was a device to enable the restriction of the retrieved set to those most likely (out of the documents originally included) to be useful. These days, with the ubiquitous scoring and ranking methods largely replacing set-based retrieval, the idea has lost its meaning It is worth exploring the formal relationships involved to understand the change a little better. My second area is to do with the relation between filtering and the more traditional type of adhoc information retrieval. There is a tendency and a temptation to see these as the same kind of thing, sometimes with a more specific assumption of duality, based on the inversion of the roles of documents and queries. It is important to see how far this parallel extends, and where it breaks down. I explore the nature of the duality and the kinds of reasons why it does break down. These examples reflect my interest in the basic logical structure of information retrieval systems and the situations in which such systems may be found. I argue for a certain level of logical argument in information retrieval, which might be taken as small-t theory, though not as capital-T Theory. I believe there are reasons to think a Grand Theory of IR to be an unattainable goal — such a theory would have to encompass so many different aspects of retrieval, having to do for example with human cognition and behaviour and the structure of knowledge, as well as with the statistical concepts that inform the probabilistic approach. However, accepting the unattainability of a Grand Theory does not preclude the development of further and more useful models based on particular aspects and lower-level logic The low-level logic is important not only in its own right, but as the basis for linking together more sophisticated theories concerned with more restricted domains. The most elaborate and complete theory of (say) user behaviour is of no use at all without a strong linkage between the parts of that theory and the entities relevant to IR that fall outside its scope. The glue that provides that linkage has to be low-level logic.

511710	Use of dynamic discrimination values in a document retrieval system The use of discrimination values as a term weighting function in document retrieval systems is examined. It is shown that regular discrimination values are too costly to compute after every update to the data base. Dynamic discrimination values that are easy to update are defined for use as approximations to regular values. Experiments are performed comparing regular vs. dynamic discrimination values. Actual user queries from an operational data base are used to evaluate dynamic discrimination values in a production environment. Generalized forms of normalized recall and precision are used as evaluation measures. Retrieval results indicate statistically significant improvements using dynamic discrimination weighting.
511711	An empirical comparison: tree and lattice structures for symbolic data bases Unidirectional trees and lattices may both be used to hold a symbolic data base consisting of lexes, lexemes or other symbol strings. This paper empirically compares placing symbolic information into both trees and lattices (a lattice may be thought of as a unidirectional network with single and initiating and terminating nodes).
511712	Document representation models for retrieval systems Document retrieval system models are presented. Measures to rank the closeness of documents to a query are given. Algorithms to calculate the measures for graph and partition models are provided.
511714	The role of information retrieval in the second computer revolution Information retrieval is conceptually fundamental in human communication as well as in man-computer communication. Computing and Information Retrieval professionals have the opportunity to apply information retrieval techniques within the second computer revolution to foster a new potential revolution in education, brought about by the advent of the personal computer.
511715	Productivity, information technology and the office It is well known that American productivity has advanced very little in the last ten years in contrast to many other countries' rapidly rising productivity. It is becoming evident that major productivity gains can be made, particularly in the office workforce, which constitutes the majority of the American workforce today. Rapidly developing information technologies are making it possible to achieve radically increased productivity in the office. This paper will discuss the specific technologies; the specific major office functions; how they interrelate; and how they are making such radical productivity increases possible. "The Paperless Office", created by Micronet, Inc. in Washington, D.C., will be described. The current project to automate the office activities of the American Productivity Center in Houston, Texas, will be described. Some projections of the significance of these projects will be given.
511717	On the implementation of some models of document retrieval Recently several models of the search process in a document retrieval system have been proposed and retrieval experiments have shown that they will improve system performance. These include models which use relevance judgements to rank documents in order of probability of relevance and models of retrieval from clusters of documents. In this paper various models are compared in terms of the ease with which they could be implemented. An important consideration is how this implementation would be affected by the introduction of new hardware such as content-addressable memories. The main conclusion is that models which concentrate on improving the effectiveness of the search process are not rendered redundant by the availability of new hardware. However, the efficiency of their implementation would be improved.

511719	On-Line Personal Bibliographic Retrieval System The Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) On-Line Personal Bibliographic Retrieval System was developed to assist researchers at the Center in managing personal or project-related collections of reference materials. The system supports on-line entry, storage, and retrieval of bibliographic citations for collections of books, journal articles, reprints, reports, manuscripts, other documents, and audio-visual materials.The NCCC system is intended for relatively small collections of materials (under 10,000 items) and is not intended to duplicate or compete in any way with MEDLARS, CANCERLINE, or any of the other on-line bibliographic retrieval services. It is similar in concept to Mitre's SHOEBOX (1), but is much less complex and requires far less computer resources. The major advantage of the NCCC system is that it is simple, small, and easy to use.None of the techniques used in developing the NCCC system is particularly new or innovative. Rather, several well-known approaches to bibliographic retrieval were combined to produce a system that was easy and inexpensive to develop and is easy and inexpensive to use. The system is now running on the Dartmouth College Computing system's equivalent of a Honeywell 66/DPS-3. The programs are all written in BASIC.

511761	An approach to probabilistic retrieval The objective is to relate the effectiveness of retrieval, the fuzzy set concept and the processing of Boolean query. The use of a probabilistic retrieval scheme is motivated. It is found that there is a correspondence between probabilistic retrieval schmes and fuzzy sets. A fuzzy set corresponding to a potentially optimal probabilistic retrieval scheme is obtained. Then the retrieval scheme for the fuzzy set is constructed.
511763	On the limitations of document ranking algorithms in information retrieval A document retrieval system should rank documents in order of their usefulness or satisfaction to the users. This principle was first explicated in the classic paper by Maron and Kuhns (1). Additional considerations concerning document ranking have been suggested by other researchers (2,3). Particular attention will be given here to the ranking algorithm appropriate for those presenting the same request, but having different information needs. The research on which this report is based identifies limitations associated with sequencing rules that use a probability ranking technique (4). Three basic and somewhat interdependent limitations will be discussed.
511765	Statistical models for unformatted text In this note, we will describe some of the outstanding problems concerning statistical information retrieval models, and the underlying stochastic language production models they assume. The problems can be separated into classes according to the underlying language model, which can be either a sequence model or a grammar model. Both kinds of model are based on a stochastic process, but there is a different filter for the realization. The grammar models use a stochastic context sensitive grammar, and the sequence models use a high order Markov chain.Most of these problems cannot be solved without experimentation with information retrieval concepts and systems. Most information retrieval systems that currently exist have had to make operational assumptions about the answers to these questions. It is expected that more precise knowledge of solutions for these problems will simplify the design and improve the effectiveness of statistical information retrieval systems.
511766	Document classification, indexing and abstracting may be inherently difficult problems The main features of document indexing are abstracted. It is shown that the easy part of indexing, namely the question whether there is a bounded number of descriptors for indexing a document is NP-complete. Thus even the most efficient algorithm for exact indexing is not, at least at the present time, bounded by a polynomial-time function.
511768	Experiments on the application of clustering techniques to data validation (abstract) An abstract is not available.
511769	Dynamic clustering procedures for bibliographic data Clustering is an important tool for efficient retrieval of documents in bibliographic database systems. It can be also used to find research trend from a set of research papers. This paper discusses new clustering procedures called dynamic ones which seem to be suitable for bibliographic data handling. These procedures are developed to solve the following problems.(1) Depending on the characteristics of data, several different clustering procedures are required to obtain good results.(2) Large clusters are tend to be generated.Dynamic clustering procedures are difined to be procedures which change parameter values according to the characteristics of data. Similarity values and threshold values are dynamically modified to handle the above problems. Furthermore, to treat the latter problem data duplication is considered.
511770	Representation issues in information retrieval system design The representation problem confronting information retrieval system designers is outlined in terms of three issues: what to represent, forms of representation, and functions of representation. Questions raised by each of these issues are identified and selected research projects which have begun to explore these questions are described.
511771	Document Contents Representation model of sentence retrieval system SCAT-IR A "Document Contents Representation" (DCR) model is introduced from a formal viewpoint to deal with the entire contents of a document such as individual sentences of a text, bibliography, references, etc. in a scientific information system. A "Mapping Definition Language" (MDL) is proposed to map directly and naturally the document contents into the DCR model. An application of the DCR model and MDL to scientific documents is shown. Some examples of advanced retrieval by SCAT-IR system implemented on the basis of the DCR model and MDL are illustrated.
511772	Spatial representations of knowledge: validity and applications to information science This research examined the relationship between subjects' knowledge of an area and their similarity ratings of pairs of concepts. Knowledge was operationalized as (1) test score performance, and (2) correspondence with an expert's similarity judgments. Subjects (n=55) were exposed to a three-week module on social psychology as part of their introductory psychology course. At the end of this course segment they were administered an examination and, later, a term similarity questionnaire. Students' similarity ratings related to both exam score and similarity ratings of the expert. Furthermore, as expected, test performance was strongly related (r=+.55) to the correlation with the expert's similarity judgments. A model based on term similarity judgments was proposed as a theoretical explanation of how term dependence models influence information retrieval system performance.
511773	Content analysis as a word-processing option A simple content-analysis program incorporated in a word-processing system can display the most significant sentence of a page of text and give a short list of the more important words. This could help authors write titles, summaries, and descriptor lists. The content-analysis program relies on word frequency, precedence, and co-occurrence as indicators of content significance. Test show it performs at least as well as some trained indexers.
511774	Outline of a dynamic self-tuning and adaptive information retrieval system A self-tuning adaptive information retrieval system as an extension of the concept of a "classical" document retrieval system, is outlined. This system accepts documents and search requests in natural language, as well as the system-proposals previously produced by the system itself or prepared by the system operator. It produces a system-proposal that consists of a list of documents ranked according to their relevance to the query.Incorporated into the system is a system valuation subsystem that uses weighted relevance judgements. This subsystem gives as output an effectiveness value and an efficiency value: both together measure the quality of an information retrieval system.The computation of the quality values and the values themselves are independent of a specific implementation. The retrieval process in this system consists of two parts, namely a query-document match and a query-query match.
511795	Hardware systems for text information retrieval As databases become very large, conventional digital computers cannot provide satisfactory response time. This is particularly true for text databases, which must often be several orders of magnitude larger than formatted databases to store a useful amount of information. Even the standard techniques for improving system performance (such as inverted files) may not be sufficient to give the desired performance, and the use of an unconventional hardware organization may become necessary.A variety of different organizations has been proposed to enhance processing of text retrieval operations. Most of these have concentrated on the design of fast, efficient search engines. These can be divided into three classes: associative memories, cellular pattern matchers, and finite state automata. The advantages and disadvantages inherent in each of these approaches are discussed, along with a number of proposed implementations. Finally, the text retrieval system under development at the University of Utah is discussed in more detail.
511796	Artificial intelligence implications for information retrieval Overall, the field of information retrieval is already more aware than many other fields of the relevance of artificial intelligence (AI) [1-6]. Nonetheless there remain exciting applications of artificial intelligence that have been so far overlooked. In this paper we will point out some of the ways artificial intelligence might influence the field of information retrieval. We will then examine one application in more detail to discover the kind of technical problems involved in its fruitful exploitation.Before proceeding, it is important to interject a note of caution. While the promise of artificial intelligence is indeed bright, the time of complete fulfillment of its promise is a long way off. Of course, some of the expected contributions are shorter term than others. However, the more difficult problems will fall only after a good deal of basic research is accomplished. Artificial intelligence researchers have, in the past, been culpable of what can most charitably be described as over-optimism [7,8]. This naivete on the part of even the most respected of researchers stemmed from the profound subtleties underlying intelligent behavior. The problem is compounded by the fact that some of the most difficult of intelligent behavior (i.e. common sense) seems intuitively easy.
511802	Progress report on project information bridge Project Information Bridge is a West German Federal Ministry for Research and Technology supported project. It has been conducted in cooperation with the Gesellschaft für Information und Dokumentation (Society for Information and Documentation) (GID) and the various data base hosts in West Germany. Its goal was to develop and test a working prototype of an add-on package for existing IR systems.This report covers the time period from October 1981 through March 1983 during which the prototype was successfully developed and tested. The principal emphasis was to provide users with search formulation aids applicable to specific document files searchable using differing IR systems. Aids for thesaurus construction for natural language words and for file construction and indexing have not at this date been tested. Should tests be completed prior to the conference date, information concerning these topics will be presented at the conference.
511807	A discrimination gain hypothesis Underlying many of the probabilistic models for information retrieval are assumptions of stochastic dependence or independence of varying degrees of severity for the index terms describing the documents. These models generally specify a matching function, that is a function which compares a query with each document. The form of that function is to a large extent determined by the particular dependence/independence assumption. For example, if the index terms are assumed to be independently distributed over both the set of relevant and non-relevant documents then the matching function will in general be linear, whereas an assumption of dependence will lead to a non-linear function.Irrespective of the form that the matching function may take it is always assumed that the search terms in the query are known. In this paper I wish to address the problem of the choice of search terms and how this choice may be affected by an independence assumption.
511814	End user touch searching for cancer therapy literature: a rule based approach This paper reviews work towards building an expert system for searching the cancer therapy literature on MEDLINE. A modified subset of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) has been stored on a micro-computer and accessed via a touch terminal. Searches, previously requested of the Oncology Information Service at the University of Leeds, have been used to test out the principle of end user searching and the results compared with the searching expertise of a MEDLARS indexer. Original program development was in PASCAL, but a rule-based approach, which is independent of a particular programming language, has been developed for search term and frame selection adopting a 'blackboard' philosophy in tracing the process of selection. Work is progressing on an implementation using the expert systems programming language PROLOG, which has been found a very suitable language for representing rules and provides a ready made rule interpreter. It is suggested that this approach is superior in terms of retrieval performance compared with alternative approaches to end-user searching which fail to exhibit detailed knowledge regarding the subject matter of the search.
511817	The user view of file management: recommendations for a user interface based on analysis of UNIX file system use The structures in which users store their files facilitate retrieval by enabling users to deduce a file's contents from its place in the organization. This study examined structures created by UNIX users to organize their files within a hierarchical directory scheme, and examined the relation between structure and command usage. Users' difficulties in managing the complexity of a hierarchical structure limited the amount of information about files that these structures contained. Tree complexity increased in a negatively accelerating function with the number of files. Users who grouped their files into few directories arranged in shallow trees could navigate through the tree easily, but they sacrificed information: directory names were less specific, and users made more command errors. More sophisticated users created deeper trees. They were able to manage more files but also made extensive use of navigation aids.
511820	A network organization used for document retrieval A network organization for implementing a document retrieval system is proposed. This organization has significant advantages in terms of the range of searches that can be used when compared to either inverted or clustered file organizations. Algorithms for generating and maintaining the network are described together with experiments designed to test their efficiency and effectiveness.
511821	RESEDA, an Information Retrieval system using artificial intelligence and knowledge representation techniques The RESEDA project is concerned with the construction of AI Information Retrieval systems working on databases containing biographical data. There exist in RESEDA two fundamental ways of retrieving information requested by a user. In the first case, the information we wish to obtain is data which already exists in the base. This data can be obtained by direct match with the "search model" corresponding to the user's question. If this is not possible, we can still try to get an answer by using the inference procedures of the "transformation" type. The second method retrieves information which, in contrast, is created ex nihilo by the search procedure itself. It expresses, in fact, the possibility of a new causal relationship, within the base, between an "episode" provided explicitly by the user and one or more "episodes" that the system retrieves by applying an inference procedure of the type "hypothesis".
511823	Current practice in the evaluation of multikey search algorithms File structures and algorithms for multikey searching allow more than a single key to be used in locating a record for use in retrieval or update. Such algorithms are of use in many different kinds of information systems, including database systems, information retrieval systems, and pattern recognition and image processing systems. Such algorithms have received increased attention in recent years. However, they are not as well understood as those which handle single keys.Multikey algorithms are more difficult to evaluate than those based on the use of single keys. There are simply more factors to be considered. The evaluations performed for such algorithms should allow comparisons in order to be useful to a community of researchers and users. Theoretical analyses should be based on reasonable and clearly stated assumptions. Experiments should be repeatable and statistically valid whether they are based on "real" data or on randomly generated data.
511824	Combinatorial compression and partitioning of large dictionaries: theory and experiments A method for compressing large dictionaries is proposed, based on transforming words into lexicographically ordered strings of distinct letters, together with permutation indexes. Algorithms to generate such strings are described. Results of applying the method to the dictionaries of two databases, in Hebrew and English, are presented in detail. The main message is a method of partitioning the dictionary such that the "information bearing fraction" is stored in fast memory, and the bulk in auxiliary memory.
511825	Derived search keys for bibliographic retrieval A principle of information science states that the entropy of a set of symbols is maximised when the probability of occurrence of each becomes the same. This paper presents the results of a number of experiments which utilise this principle to construct fixed length keys from pertinent fields in order to locate and retrieve unique records as well as clusters with lexically homogeneous information. Each key incorporates codes derived by various positional selection methods and their discriminating strength proves to be well over 95%.
511827	An approach to enhancement of statistical survey databases This paper deals with statistical databases that are generated from statistical surveys and that reside in organizations which perform a large number of surveys--some of which are repetitive. Examples of such organizations are Federal statistical agencies such as the Energy Information Administration, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Center for Educational Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, etc; state governments that have bureaus or departments that collect such data; and marketing research departments of most large consumer-oriented companies. Computer processing has provided a powerful tool for storing, manipulating, and analyzing statistical survey data. However, in addition to these advantages, computing has created a major problem in that most data analysts and users have lost touch with the data and their generation. They no longer have the feel and sense for the data that once was possible. In this paper we present an approach to database design that will directly attack this problem and enhance the usefulness of such databases as well.
511828	Knowledge-Based Report Generation: a technique for automatically generating natural language reports from databases Knowledge-Based Report Generation is a technique for automatically generating natural language summaries from databases. It is so named because it applies the tools of knowledge-based expert systems design to the problem of text generation. The technique is currently being applied to the design of an automatic natural language stock report generator. Examples drawn from the implementation of the stock report generator are used to describe the components of a knowledge-based report generator.
511830	Some research problems in automatic information retrieval Information retrieval components are currently incorporated in several types of information systems, including bibliographic retrieval systems, data base management systems and question-answering systems. Some of the problems arising in the real-time environment in which these systems operate are briefly discussed. Certain recent advances in information retrieval research are then mentioned, including the formulation of new probabilistic retrieval models, and the development of automatic document analysis and Boolean query processing techniques.

564377	Landmarks in information retrieval: the message out of the bottle For many years I have wanted to give a talk like this: look back on our subject, identify the high (and perhaps low) points, consider what worked, what did not work, and speculate a little about the future. Now that I at last have the opportunity to give such a talk the realisation has dawned just how difficult it is to do justice to the topic. The only way out of this difficulty for me is to emphasise that this is a personal account, based on my involvement with the field since 1968, and that errors of omission and commission are not deliberate but simply due to lack of knowledge and time on my part. To talk of landmarks is easy but to say what they are in IR is not. They come in various shapes and sizes: events, publications, experiment, ideas, etc. In the course of this presentation I shall be judiciously mixing all of these. However, the emphasis will be on ideas and their subsequent modelling and testing through experimentation. The interaction between theory and experiment will be a recurring theme. I will try and associate these developments with key individuals, thereby running the risk of ignoring some; I apologise for this in advance. The pre-history of our subject can be traced back to the work in the 19th century, perhaps even further, but I will pick it up at the middle of the last century (20th) starting with the work of Robert Fairthorne and Vannevar Bush. This early work emphasised the possibility of using mechanical devices to store and retrieve information. Of course the foundations of modern information retrieval were properly laid after 1945 with the pioneering work of Cleverdon, Salton, Sparck Jones, and others. This work gave rise to a strong experimental methodology for the evaluation of theoretical ideas, which has been sustained to this day. It has been a hallmark of IR research that theory is developed in the context of experimentation. There is no doubt that many disciplines are jealous of the success of TREC. IR research has thrown up a number of successful models. These models have been based on some, often unstated, assumptions (or hypotheses). I will attempt to identify some of the underlying ideas, giving credit where is due, that led to the fruitful exploration of retrieval models. This will include system-oriented as well as user-oriented ideas, especially those concerned with the measurement of retrieval performance. IR has been fortunate in that the subject has grown through the active collaboration between computer scientists and information scientists. This has meant that traditional approaches to the storage and retrieval of information emanating from the library world, for example, have always strongly influenced new developments. This tension between manual (human) processes and automatic computer-based processes in IR has always been fruitful. Even now with the evolution of ideas about meta-data and ontologies needed to enhance web retrieval, the debate about controlled vocabularies versus automatic indexing is relevant. Issues of scalability are particularly important here. One of the strengths that have emerged in our subject is that many of our models can be deployed independently of medium or modality. For example, retrieving images or audio sequences can be handled in ways similar to those used to retrieve text data. This has proved to be great boon to IR. The development of web retrieval through the deployment of various kinds of search engines has been based on the considerable early work in IR although detailing the specific influences is not easy. It is clear that the underlying mathematical and statistical models in IR have been ubiquitous in application. The extreme difficulty encountered in making NLP work for IR forced researchers to develop powerful statistical, probabilistic, geometrical, and logical techniques to complement linguistic ones. This is now paying off because of the similar difficulties encountered in other media. Having given some account of how we got here I will spend a little time talking about where we go from here, how do we extract the message from the bottle?
564378	Is natural language an inconvenience or an opportunity for IR? Natural language (NL) has evolved to facilitate human communication. It enables the speaker to make the listener's mind wander among her experiences and mental associations roughly according to the intentions of the speaker. The speaker and the listener usually share experiences and expectations, and they use mostly the same units and rules of a shared NL. Written language functions similarly, but in a less interactive way, with fewer possibilities for feedback.Both the symbols of NL (i.e. words or morphemes), and their arrangements are meaningful. Not with universal and precise meanings, but similar enough among different speakers and accurate enough for the communication mostly to succeed.NLs are mostly very large systems. Hundreds of thousands of words and infinitely many possible utterances. Even inflection alone might produce huge numbers of forms, e.g. more than ten thousand distinct forms out of every Finnish verb entry.NL processing (for IR or any other purpose) must cope with phenomena like (1) inflection and compounding, (2) synonymy, (3) polysemy, (4) ambiguity, (5) anaphora and (6) head-modifier relations among words and phrases.Language technology can neutralize much of the effect of these 'inconveniences' inherent with NL, but what kinds of advantages could NL have? Redundant use of synonymous expressions can effectively identify new concepts. Multilingual parallel documents may help in identifying their exact content. NLs typically carry connotations, i.e. what is implied but not explicitly said (e.g. attitudes, politeness). Vague associations are easy to express in NL, but not always in formal systems (e.g. "a few years ago there was an article about the rival of Yeltsin - I don't remember his name but - he then went over to some region in Siberia - but what did the guy promise?") Jokes and humor belong to NLs, not to formal systems. .Are there any alternatives for NL? Not really, because any artificial and more precise formalisms fail to adapt to new concepts and they do not easily allow restructuring of previous ideas.One challenge for language technology is to find better solutions for the above 'inconveniences' in order to provide various IR, document classification, indexing and summarizing methods with more accurate and adequate input data. With more accurate input some of the more demanding tasks of IR can perhaps be solved.
564394	Improving realism of topic tracking evaluation Topic tracking and information filtering are models of interactive tasks, but their evaluations are generally done in a way that does not reflect likely usage. The models either force frequent judgments or disallow any at all, assume the user is always available to make a judgment, and do not allow for user fatigue. In this study we extend the evaluation framework for topic tracking to incorporate those more realistic issues. We demonstrate that tracking can be done in a realistic interactive setting with minimal impact on tracking cost and with substantial reduction in required interaction.
564439	Automatic classification in product catalogs In this paper, we present the AutoCat system for product classification. AutoCat uses a vector space model, modified to consider product attributes unavailable in traditional document classification. We present key features of our user interface, developed to assist users with evaluating and editing the output of the classification algorithm. Finally, we present observations about the use of this technology in the field.
564449	Effective collection metasearch in a hierarchical environment: global vs. localized retrieval performance We compare standard global IR searching with user-centric localized techniques to address the database selection problem . We conduct a series of experiments to compare the retrieval effectiveness of three separate search modes applied to a hierarchically structured data environment of textual database representations. The data environment is represented as a tree-like directory containing over 15,000 unique databases and over 100,000 total leaf nodes. Our search modes consist of varying degrees of browse and search , from a global search at the root node to a refined search at a sub-node using dynamically-calculated inverse document frequencies ( idfs ) to score candidate databases for probable relevance. Our findings indicate that a browse and search approach that relies upon localized searching from sub-nodes is capable of producing the most effective results.

564452	How Many Bits are Needed to Store Term Frequencies? Search algorithms in most current text retrieval systems use index data structures extracted from the original text documents. In this paper we focus on reducing the size of the indices by reducing the amount of space dedicated to store term frequencies. In experiments using TREC Ad Hoc [2, 3] corpora and query sets, we show that it is possible to store the term frequency in only two bits without decreasing retrieval performance.
564453	Non-linear reading for a structured web indexation The growth of the Web has posed new challenges for Information Retrieval (IR). Most of the current systems are based on traditional models, which have been developed for atomic and independents documents and are not adapted to the Web. A promising research orientation consists of studying the impact of the Web structure on indexing. The HyperDocument model presented in this article is based on essential aspects of information comprehension: content, composition and linear/non-linear reading.
564459	A new method of parameter estimation for multinomial naive bayes text classifiers Multinomial naive Bayes classifiers have been widely used for the probabilistic text classification. However, their parameter estimation method sometimes generates inappropriate probabilities. In this paper, we propose a topic document model approach for naive Bayes text classification, where their parameters are estimated with an expectation from the training documents. Experiments are conducted on Reuters 21578 and 20 Newsgroup collection, and our proposed approach obtained a significant improvement in performace over the conventional approach.
564460	Study of category score algorithms for k-NN classifier We analyzes category score algorithms for k-NN classifier found in the literature, including majority voting algorithm ( MVA ), simple sum algorithm ( SSA ). MVA and SSA are two mainly used algorithms to estimate score for candidate categories in k-NN classifier systems. Based on the hypothesis that utilization of internal relation between documents and categories could improve system performance, two new weighting score models: concept-based weighting ( CBW ) score model and term independence-based weighting ( IBW ) score model are proposed. Our experimental results confirm our hypothesis and show that in the term of precision average IBW and CBW are better than the other score models, while SSA is higher than MVA . According to macro-average F1 CBW performs best. Rocchio-based algorithm ( RBA ) always performs worst.
564461	Higher precision for two-word queries Queries have specific properties, and may need individualized methods and parameters to optimize retrieval. Length is one property. We look at how two-word queries may attain higher precision by re-ranking using word co-occurrence evidence in retrieved documents. Co-occurrence within document context is not sufficient, but window context including sentence context evidence can provide precision improvements at low recall region of 4 to 10% using initial retrieval results, and positively affects pseudo-relevance feedback.
564466	Converting on-line bilingual dictionaries from human-readable to machine-readable form We describe a language called ABET that allows rapid conversion of on-line human-readable bilingual dictionaries to machine-readable form.
564467	Modeling (in)variability of human judgments for text summarization The paper proposes and empirically motivates an integration of supervised learning with unsupervised learning to deal with human biases in summarization. In particular, we explore the use of probabilistic decision tree within the clustering framework to account for the variation as well as regularity in human created summaries.
564468	Content-based music indexing and organization While electronic music archives are gaining popularity, access to and navigation within these archives is usually limited to text-based queries or manually predefined genre category browsing. We present a system that automatically organizes a music collection according to the perceived sound similarity resembling genres or styles of music. Audio signals are processed according to psychoacoustic models to obtain a time-invariant representation of its characteristics. Subsequent clustering provides an intuitive interface where similar pieces of music are grouped together on a map display.

564471	Building thematic lexical resources by term categorization We discuss the automatic generation of thematic lexicons by means of term categorization , a novel task employing techniques from information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML). Specifically, we view the generation of such lexicons as an iterative process of learning previously unknown associations between terms and themes (i.e. disciplines, or fields of activity). The process is iterative, in that it generates, for each c i in a set C = {c 1 ,...,c m } of themes, a sequence L i 0 ? L i 1 ? ... ? L i n of lexicons, bootstrapping from an initial lexicon L i 0 and a set of text corpora &THgr; = {&thgr; 0 ,...,&thgr; n-1 } given as input. The method is inspired by text categorization , the discipline concerned with labelling natural language texts with labels from a predefined set of themes, or categories. However, while text categorization deals with documents represented as vectors in a space of terms, term categorization deals (dually) with terms represented as vectors in a space of documents, and labels terms (instead of documents) with themes. As a learning device we adopt boosting , since (a) it has demonstrated state-of-the-art effectiveness in a variety of text categorization applications, and (b) it naturally allows for a form of "data cleaning", thereby making the process of generating a thematic lexicon an iteration of generate-and-test steps.
564473	Language model for IR using collection information Information retrieval using meta data can be traced back to the early age of IR where documents are represented by the controlled vocabulary. In this paper, we explore the usage of meta-data information under the framework of language model. We present a new language model that is able to take advantage of the category information for documents to improve the retrieval accuracy. We compare the new language model with the traditional language model over the TREC4 dataset where the collection information for documents is obtained using the k-means clustering method. The new language model outperforms the traditional language model, which verifies our statement.
564477	Selecting indexing strings using adaptation It is not easy to tokenize agglutinative languages like Japanese and Chinese into words. Many IR systems start with a dictionary-based morphology program like ChaSen [4]. Unfortunately, dictionaries cannot cover all possible words; unknown words such as proper nouns are important for IR. This paper proposes a statistical dictionary-free method for selecting index strings based on recent work on adaptive language modeling.
564478	Error correction in a Chinese OCR test collection This article proposes a technique for correcting Chinese OCR errors to support retrieval of scanned documents. The technique uses a completely automatic technique (no manually constructed lexicons or confusion resources) to identify both keywords and confusable terms. Improved retrieval effectiveness on a single term query experiment is demonstrated.
564480	K-tree/forest: efficient indexes for boolean queries In Information Retrieval it is well-known that the complexity of processing boolean queries depends on the size of the intermediate results, which could be huge (and are typically on disk) even though the size of the final result may be quite small. In the case of inverted files the most time consuming operation is the merging or intersection of the list of occurrences [1]. We propose, the Keyword tree (K-tree) and forest, efficient structures to handle boolean queries in keyword-based information retrieval. Extensive simulations show that K-tree is orders-of-magnitude faster (i.e., far fewer I/O's) for boolean queries than the usual approach of merging the lists of occurrences and incurs only a small overhead for single keyword queries. The K-tree can be efficiently parallelized as well. The construction cost of K-tree is comparable to the cost of building inverted files.
564481	Example-based phrase translation in Chinese-English CLIR This paper proposes an example-based phrase translation method in a Chinese to English cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) system. The method can generate much more accurate query translations than dictionary-based and common MT-based methods, and then improves the retrieval performance of our CLIR system.

564487	A system using implicit feedback and top ranking sentences to help users find relevant web documents We present a web search interface designed to encourage users to interact more fully with the results of a web search. Wrapping around a major commercial search engine, the system combines three main features; real-time query-biased web document summarisation, the presentation of sentences highly relevant to the searcher's query, and evidence captured from searcher interaction with the retrieval results.
564488	Indexing, searching, and retrieving of recorded live presentations with the AOF (authoring on the fly) search engine The tremendous amount of data resulting from the regular usage of tools for automatic presentation recording demand for elaborate search functionality. A detailed analysis of the according multimedia documents is required to allow search at a very detailed level. Unfortunately, the produced data differs significantly from traditional documents. In this demo, we discuss the problems appearing in the presentation retrieval scenario and introduce aofSE, a search engine to study and illustrate these problems as well as to develop and present according solutions and new approaches for this task.
564492	Adaptive information extraction for document annotation in amilcare Amilcare is a tool for Adaptive Information Extraction (IE) designed for supporting active annotation of documents for the Semantic Web (SW). It can be used either for unsupervised document annotation or as a support for human annotation. Amilcare is portable to new applications/domains without any knowledge of IE, as it just requires users to annotate a small training corpus with the information to be extracted. It is based on (LP)2, a supervised learning strategy for IE able to cope with different texts types, from newspaper-like texts, to rigidly formatted Web pages and even a mixture of them[1][5].Adaptation starts with the definition of a tag set for annotation, possibly organized as an ontology. Then users have to manually annotate a small training corpus. Amilcare provides a default mouse-based interface called Melita, where annotations are inserted by first selecting a tag from the ontology and then identifying the text area to annotate with the mouse. Differently from similar annotation tools [4, 5], Melita actively supports training corpus annotation. While users annotate texts, Amilcare runs in the background learning how to reproduce the inserted annotation. Induced rules are silently applied to new texts and their results are compared with the user annotation. When its rules reach a (user-defined) level of accuracy, Melita presents new texts with a preliminary annotation derived by the rule application. In this case users have just to correct mistakes and add missing annotations. User corrections are inputted back to the learner for retraining. This technique focuses the slow and expensive user activity on uncovered cases, avoiding requiring annotating cases where a satisfying effectiveness is already reached. Moreover validating extracted information is a much simpler task than tagging bare texts (and also less error prone), speeding up the process considerably. At the end of the corpus annotation process, the system is trained and the application can be delivered. MnM [6] and Ontomat annotizer [7] are two annotation tools adopting Amilcare's learner.In this demo we simulate the annotation of a small corpus and we show how and when Amilcare is able to support users in the annotation process, focusing on the way the user can control the tool's proactivity and intrusivity. We will also quantify such support with data derived from a number of experiments on corpora. We will focus on training corpus size and correctness of suggestions when the corpus is increased.

564494	Souvenir: flexible note-taking tool to pinpoint and share media highlights Digital media audio/video can be difficult to search and share in a personal way. Souvenir is a software system that offers users a flexible and comprehensive way to use their handwritten or text notes to retrieve and share specific media moments. Users can take notes on a variety of devices, such as the paper-based CrossPad, the Palm Pilot and standard keyboard devices. Souvenir segments handwritten notes into an effective media index without the need for handwriting recognition. Users can use their notes to create hyperlinks to random-access media stored in a digital library. Souvenir also has web publishing and email capabilities to enable anyone to access or email media moments directly from a web page. Souvenir annotations capture information that can not be easily inferred by automatic media indexing tools.

564498	CuTeX: a system for extracting data from text tables A wealth of information relevant for e-commerce often appears in text form. This includes specification and performance data sheets of products, financial statements, product offerings etc. Typically these types of product and financial data are published in tabular form. The only separators between items in the table are white spaces and line separators. We will refer to such tables as text tables . Due to the lack of structure in such tables, the information present is not readily queriable using traditional database query languages like SQL. One way to make it amenable to standard database querying techniques is to extract the data items in the tables and create a database out of the extracted data. But extraction from text tables poses difficulties due to the irregularity of the data in the column. Existing techniques like [1] and [3] are based on finding fixed separators between successive columns. However, it is not always possible to find fixed separators. Even if fixed separators exist they may not unambiguously separate columns that have multiword items. Another set of techniques are based on regular expressions. The problems here are: (i) they are difficult to construct and (ii) they depend on lexical similarity between column items. Note that, by visual inspection a casual observer can correctly associate every item in a text table to its corresponding column. This is because all the items belonging to a column appear "clustered" more closely to each other than to items in different columns. Whereas such clusters can be clearly discerned by a human observer, making them machine recognizable is the key to robust automated extraction of data items from text-based tables. Clustering enables us to make associations between items in a column based not merely on examining items in adjacent rows but across all the rows in the table. We have designed and implemented the CuteX system for extracting data from irregular text tables. The input is a file containing only text tables. The output produced by CuteX is an association between every items in a column. Note that CuteX does not do table detection in text. The innovative aspect of CuteX is its clustering-based algorithm that drives the extraction process. In CuteX each line is broken down into a set of tokens. Each token is a contiguous sequence of non white-space characters. The center of any token in a cluster is closer to the center of some other token in the same cluster. Inter-cluster gaps are gaps between the extremal tokens in the clusters. Starting with an initial set of clusters, adjacent clusters are merged into bigger clusters based on the inter-cluster gaps. The algorithm terminates when no more clusters can be merged. We have formalized the notion of a correct extraction and developed a syntactic characterization of tables on which this algorithm will always produce a correct extraction. Details appear in [2]. An unique aspect of the algorithm is its robustness in the presence of misalignments. Precision of extraction can be improved by supplying the minimum separation between columns as a parameter. Such a separator is estimated by sampling a few input tables. The clustering algorithm does not merge adjacent clusters if the gap between them is larger than this parameter value. Note though that the minimum column gap cannot be used as a fixed separator since doing so amounts to doing localized determination, making it brittle to misalignments. CuteX is implemented in Java and is approximately about 3000 lines of code. The system automatically partitions the set of input text tables into directories containing correct and incorrect extractions. At the end of an extraction, the user can examine the directory containing incorrectly extracted tables, sample a few of them, identify if it was caused by an erroneous estimate of the minimum column gap, re-adjust the configuration parameter and start a new extraction on all these tables. Successive iterations can generate a higher extraction yield. The primary focus of the demonstration will be on illustrating the robustness and the iterative process of improving the extraction yield of the clustering algorithm.
564499	YellowPager: a tool for ontology-based mining of service directories from web sources The web has established itself as the dominant medium for doing electronic commerce. Realizing that its global reach provides significant market and business opportunities, service providers, both large and small are advertising their services on the web. A number of them operate their own web sites promoting their services at length while others are merely listed in a referral site. Aggregating all of the providers into a queriable service directory makes it easy for customers to locate the one most suited for his/her needs. YellowPager is a tool for creating service directories by mining web sources. Service directories created by YellowPager have several merits compared to those generated by existing practices, which typically require participation by service providers (e.g. Verizon's SuperYellowPages.com). Firstly, the information content will be rich. Secondly since the process is automated and repeatable the content can always be kept current. Finally the same process can be readily adapted to different domains. YellowPager builds service directories by mining the web through a combination of keyword-based search engines,web agents, text classifiers and novel extraction algorithms.The extraction is driven by a services ontology consisting of a taxonomy of service concepts and their associated attributes (such as names and addresses) and type descriptions for the attributes. In addition the ontology also associates an extractor function with each attribute. Applying the function to a web page will identify all the occurrences of the attribute in that page. YellowPager 's mining algorithm consists of a training step followed by classification and extraction steps. In the training step a classifier is trained to identify web pages relevant to the service of interest. The classification step proceeds by doing a search for the particular service of interest using a keyword based web search engine and retrieves all the matching web pages. From these pages the relevant ones are identified using the classifier. The final step is extraction of attribute values, associated with the service, from these pages. Each web page is parsed into a DOM tree and the extractor functions are applied. All of the attributes corresponding to a service provider are then correctly aggregated. This can pose difficulties especially in the presence of multiple service providers in a page. Using a novel concept of scoring and conflict resolution to prevent erroneous associations of attributes with service provider entities in the page, the algorithm aggregates all the attribute occurrences correctly. The extractor function may not be complete in the sense that it cannot always identify all the attributes in a page. By exploiting the regularity of the sequence in which attributes occurr in referral pages, the mining algorithm automatically learns generalized patterns to locate attributes that the extractor function misses. The distinguishing aspects of YellowPager 's extraction algorithm are: (i) it is unsupervised, and (ii) the attribute values in the pages are extracted independent of any page-specific relationships that may exist among the markup tags. YellowPager has been used by a large pet food producer to build a directory of veterinarian service providers in the United States. The resulting database was found to be much larger and richer than that found in Vetquest, Vetworld, and the Super Yellow pages. YellowPager is implemented in JAVA and is interfaced to Rainbow, a library utility in C that is used for classification. The tool will demonstrate the creation of a service directory for any service domain by mining web sources.
383986	Empirical investigations on query modification using abductive explanations In this paper we report on a series of experiments designed to investigate query modification techniques motivated by the area of abductive reasoning. In particular we use the notion of abductive explanation, explanations being a description of data that highlight important features of the data. We describe several methods of creating abductive explanations, exploring term reweighting and query reformulation techniques and demonstrate their suitability for relevance feedback.
384031	Anchor text mining for translation extraction of query terms This paper presents an approach to automatically extracting the bilingual translations of many Web query terms through mining the Web anchor texts. Some preliminary experiments are conducted on using 109,416 Web pages containing both Chinese and English anchor texts in their in-links to extract Chinese translations of 200 English queries selected from popular query terms in Taiwan. It is found that the effective translations of 75% of the popular query terms can be extracted, in which 87.2% cannot be obtained in common translation dictionaries.
384038	Unitary operators for fast latent semantic indexing (FLSI) Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) dramatically reduces the dimension of the document space by mapping it into a space spanned by conceptual indices. Empirically, the number of concepts that can represent the documents are far fewer than the great variety of words in the textual representation. Although this almost obviates the problem of lexical matching, the mapping incurs a high computational cost compared to document parsing, indexing, query matching, and updating. This paper shows how LSI is based on a unitary transformation, for which there are computationally more attractive alternatives. This is exemplified by the Haar transform, which is memory efficient, and can be computed in linear to sublinear time. The principle advantages of LSI are thus preserved while the computational costs are drastically reduced.

384067	A homogeneous framework to model relevance feedback Relevance feedback is an appreciated process to produce increasingly better retrieval. Usually, positive feedback plays a fundamental role in the feedback process whereas the role of negative feedback is limited. We think that negative feedback is a promising precision oriented mechanism and we propose a logical framework in which positive and negative feedback are homogeneously modeled. Evaluation results against small test collections are provided.
384069	Browsing in a digital library collecting linearly arranged documents A method of assisting a user in finding the required documents effectively is proposed. A user being informed which documents are worth examining can browse in a digital library (DL) in a linear fashion. Computational evaluations were carried out, and a DL and its navigator are designed and constructed.
384073	Perpetual consistency improves image retrieval performance An ideal retrieval system should retrieve images that satisfy the user's need, and should, therefore, measure image similarity in a manner consistent with human's perception. However, existing computational similarity measures are not perceptually consistent. This paper proposes an approach of improving retrieval performance by improving the perceptual consistency of computational similarity measures for textures based on relevance feedback judgments.
384074	Intelligent object-based image retrieval suing cluster-driven personal preference learning This paper introduces a personalization method for image retrieval based on the learning of personal preferences. The proposed system indexes objects based on shape and groups them into a set of clusters, or prototypes. Our personalization method refines corresponding prototypes from objects provided by the user in the foreground, and simultaneously adapts the database index in the background.
384075	Construction of a hierarchical classifier schema using a combination of text-based and image-based approaches Web document hierarchical classification approaches often rely on textual features alone even though web pages include multimedia data. We propose a new hierarchical integrated web classification approach that combines image-based and text-based approaches. Instead of using a flat classifier to combine text and image classification, we perform classification on a hierarchy differently on different levels of the tree, using text for branches and images only at leaves. The results of our experiments show that the use of the hierarchical structure improved web document classification performance significantly.
384090	Cite me, cite my references?: (Scholarly use of the ACM SIGIR proceedings based on two citation indexes) A three-part study was designed to document Internet use in scholarly research, using the Annual SIGIR Conference Proceedings from 1997 through 1999. The results suggest an increasing trend toward electronic self-publishing. Furthermore, while electronic availability did not insure that one would be cited, the most highly cited articles were available on the "free" web. The study also found that electronic availability has not, in most cases, decreased the length of time between publication and citation.
384092	Building interoperable digital library services: MARIAN, open archives, and the NDLTD In this demonstration, we present interoperable and personalized search services for the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD). Using standard protocols and software, including those specified by the Open Archives Initiative (OAI), distributed sites can share metadata easily. On top of these harvesting protocols, we implement a union collection of theses managed by the MARIAN digital library system. Our demonstration covers aspects of NDLTD, OAI, and MARIAN.

The system is currently being used to build and search distributed indexes for databases with disparate structured data (SGML and XML). We use the Z39.50 Explain Database to determine the databases and indexes of a given server, then use the Z39.50 SCAN facility to extract the contents of the indexes. This information is used to build collection documents that can be retrieved using probabilistic retrieval algorithms.
384097	Searching the deep web: distributed explorit directed query applications In 1999 a directed query distributed search engine was integrated into a new Department of Energy Virtual Library of Energy Science and Technology.

384099	MS read: user modeling in the web environment MS Read is a prototype application implemented as an extension of the Web Browser that creates an evolving model of the users topic of interest. It uses that model to analyze documents that are accessed while searching and browsing the Web. In the presented version of MS Read the model is used to highlight topic related terminology in the documents. MS Read model of the user need is created by applying natural language processing to search queries captured within the Browser and to topic descriptions explicitly provided by the user while browsing and reading documents. It is semantically enhanced using linguistic and custom knowledge resources.
636814	The Semantic Binary Relationship Model of information The Semantic Binary Relationship Model (SBRM) is a first-order formalism which combines an organisationally simple basis (i.e. binary relationships) with the capabilities of semantic networks and logical integrity and deduction rules. The aim is to permit the efficient modelling of practical enterprises In a DBMS context, whilst accommodating the requirements of knowledge-based systems. The theoretical foundations of the SBRM are described, with particular attention to inheritance hierarchies and rule representation. The low-level unit of SBRM information is the triple. A 4Mbyte associatively-accessed triple store is being constructed, and will form the heart of a smart information machine based on the SBRM.
636815	Shared processing with an advanced intelligent terminal We have built a prototype distributed information retrieval system known as TBIRD, based on an inverted file and shared between a personal computer, acting as an advanced intelligent terminal, and a timeshared mainframe. It was developed to study the response and cost in comparison with a conventional system based on an unintelligent terminal. It is shown, by the transfer of most of the processing to the personal computer, that the computing costs can be reduced by a substantial factor and that the response time need not be degraded except when the mainframe is lightly used or when the communications channel between the processors is slow (< 2,400 bps).
636817	Development of the BDS online information retrieval system Beijing Document Service(BDS) is a new-type information service providing online information retrieval service mainly in Beijing and other cities besides. This paper presents the background, goals, design considerations of the BDS system and what have been done in achieving the goal of loading the NTIS Bibliographic Data Base into the system and providing its online service to the public. System appraisal is covered and in light of problems experienced by BDS, possible approaches of how modernized information retrieval systems might be developed in China are also discussed.
636818	A global approach to record clustering and file reorganization We present an integrated method for record clustering and reorganization which can be applied to any set of queries whose frequencies of request are known. The clustering algorithm works by splitting and merging current clusters and, furthermore, produces a new assignment of these clusters to pages in secondary storage. The reorganization algorithm is an on-line, incremental procedure for allocating the records to their new physical locations such that the number of pages swapped in and out of the memory buffer is as small as possible.
636819	A document-document similarity measure based on cited titles and probability theory, and its application to relevance feedback retrieval The use of cited title terms of a scientific document for automatic indexing is explored. It offers a means of index term selection as well as term relevance weighting, based on author-provided relevance information and Bayes Theorem as in probabilistic retrieval. The latter quantitative consideration leads to a new measure of document-document similarity measure which is shown to have importance both for initial search and in relevance feedback retrieval, by offering a choice of iterative strategies.Extension of the concept of cited title terms to citing title terms shows that these two approaches are compatible with the current two competing models of probability of relevance for document retrieval (Robertson <u>et al</u>. 1982), if a document can also be regarded as a query. Their term usage may therefore provide the necessary statistics for parameter estimation to test both theories.
636820	Two axioms for evaluation measures in information retrieval In this paper evaluation measures for information retrieval system outputs are investigated from a measurement theoretic point of view. Two axioms are introduced: the axiom of monoto-nicity and the Archimedian axiom. It is shown that the measures fullfilling these axioms are exactly the measures equivalent to some measure of the form ?a + ?d where a is the number of relevant retrieved documents and d is the number of nonrelevant not retrieved documents. Some consequences for retrieval tests are discussed.
636822	Bridging the gap between AI and IR Information retrieval, in the broadest sense of the term, includes a concern with 'expert' or 'knowledge-based' systems and their potential future successors. It is unlikely that sophisticated systems of this sort can be developed in such a way as to use an entire natural language without the assistance of an advanced, unified theory of language and logic. The need for and probable character of such a theory are discussed.
636823	Knowledge based systems versus thesaurus: an architecture problem about expert systems design The use of expert systems (ES) within information retrieval systems (IRS) seems to be an interesting way, particularly for the query process. Nevertheless we must examine what knowledge we need. We think that the thesaurus may be the kernel of which knowledge : for this, we must define it larger than in classical IRS.After some recalls about what may be the principal features of a query ES, we discuss about the relationship between thesaurus and a query expert system. The problem is to determine if the thesaurus must be integrated within the knowledge base.In fact this choice is an architecture problem of the ES. We analyze, in parallel, the effects of this choice about thesaurus representation, ES functionnalities, ES architecture.The choice of an architecture depends on the goal searched: ie a general IR expert system able to handle a set of thesauri (independent thesaurus) or a specialized IR expert system which can be very performant but strongly tied to a specific area (integrated thesaurus).
636824	Some remarks about the inference techniques of RESEDA, an intelligent information retrieval system The aim of this paper is to provide some details about the inference procedures of RESEDA, an "intelligent" Information Retrieval system using techniques borrowed from Knowledge Engineering. A RESEDA prototype has been operational for over a year : amongst its characteristics are a "case grammar" like knowledge representation language, intensive use of temporal data, use of the notion of "type", automatic generation of logical links, etc. First, the paper makes it clear what is meant in RESEDA by "level zero inference". Subsequently, it provides an informal description of the two kinds of high level inference operation, relying on information in the rule base, that are implemented in the system : these are known as "transformations" and "hypotheses". Finally, the article describes in some detail the computational structure of the "machines" which enable RESEDA's inference engine to execute this type of high level operation.
636825	Situational nearness in intellectual data bases The notions of a situation and a distance between situations in a narrow subject domain are introduced. An approach to the construction of an intellectual data base is suggested. The main task of this data base is to find situations which are near to the one fixed by user. The theory of finite groups is considered as an example.
636826	Dependency parsing for information retrieval This paper describes the development of a parser based on the Moulton and Robinson (1981) dependency theory of syntax, and several strategies by which we are attempting to apply the outputs of this parser to the processes of Information Retrieval. We first discuss the limits of present Information Retrieval theory and the potential benefits of linguistic analysis for Information Retrieval. Next we briefly present the Moulton and Robinson theory, contrast it to rewrite rule based theories, and outline its general advantages as an approach to natural language processing. Next we describe the parser we have implemented based on the Moulton and Robinson theory, and some of the implementation issues we have addressed. Finally, we discuss several strategies by which this parser could be applied to Information Retrieval, and the problems involved in this application.
636827	Computerised information retrieval systems for open learning The paper starts with a theoretical consideration of the requirements for a computerised information retrieval system to aid open learning within an educational establishment. The requirements for such a system include consideration of the need to fulfill information retrieval objectives and also educational objectives. These requirements are then considered in the context of the theoretical information retrieval work which has been carried out by Belkin and others and takes into account the representation of the user's anomalous state of knowledge. The paper then considers the practical problems of trying to implement such a system. Attention is focussed on the use of current and developing information technology to fulfill both information retrieval and educational objectives. It is shown that current systems as exemplified by PRESTEL, DIALOG, BROWSE and STAF individually will not fulfill the requirements of this system. However, in combination these types of systems should be quite suitable. Another solution is the use of an expert system. The paper also considers the use of an expert system to "replace" the traditional teacher.
636828	Computing text constituency: an algorithmic approach to the generation of text graphs An algorithm for text summarization (automatic abstracting) is presented which constitutes the text condensation component of TOPIC, a knowledge-based text information system. Based on the results of text parsing knowledge representation structures of text segments are evaluated in order to determine dominant concepts. By means of an interpretation schema dominant concepts are related in terms of thematic units indicative of the topic(s) of the text segment under consideration. The mutual compatibility of topics of adjacent text segments is determined and corresponding text constituents are constructed. Finally, a text graph is generated linking appropriate text constituents on various levels of text constituency. Accordingly, facilities for text-oriented information retrieval will be based on the manipulation of these text graphs.
636830	Term conflation for information retrieval This paper describes two experiments concerned with term conflation for information retrieval, and the CATALOG retrieval system designed utilizing the results of the experiments. The experiments performed here has as their aim 1) finding a theoretical basis and method for maximizing the effect of conflation, and 2) determining if conflation can be automated with no loss of system performance.Experimental results indicate that,1. Experienced searchers generally truncate terms at root morpheme boundaries. When searchers do not truncate at root boundaries, the deviations are small.2. Small deviations from root boundaries do not significantly affect retrieval performance.3. There is no significant performance difference between automatic conflation and manual conflation carried out by experienced searchers.4. Based on 3, term conflation can be automated in a retrieval system with no average loss of performance, thus allowing easier and user access to the system.A retrieval system incorporating the information in 4 is described, and shown to be feasible.
636831	Retrieval test evaluation of a rule based automatic indexing (AIR/PHYS) The automatic indexing system AIR/PHYS and its evaluation by means of a retrieval test with 309 requests and 15,000 documents is described. First, the underlying conception of a rule based approach is given which is suited to the task of a controlled-vocabulary indexing of even large subject fields. Preconditions, performance and results of the retrieval test are described, including first results of retrieval runs with weighted automatic indexing.
636832	The automatic extraction of words from texts especially for input into information retrieval systems based on inverted files The automatic extraction of words from texts to form the input for information retrieval systems based on inverted files is partly considered on a theoretical basis, and partly in relation to experience gained from developing what has become an operational system. This system was developed to operate on abstracted texts, but is being modified to handle more extended texts either for input into an inverted file or as a stage in creating pre-coordinate indexes. The system is capable of handling compound words, homographs, and synonyms and identifying particular forms of text (such as authors) on the basis of what are termed semantic markers.
636833	Advances in a Bayesian decision model of user stopping behavior for scanning the output of an information retrieval system The formal modeling of information storage and retrieval systems has been an important element in the analysis and design of these systems. The retrieval mechanism has been viewed as a probablistic decision problem, often involving utilities. One key element is the evaluation of such retrieval systems. In this paper, we focus on the impact of the stopping rule, which determines when the user chooses to stop scanning the list of records retrieved in response to a given query. We shall first trace the evolution of the modelling and use of the stopping rule approach. Then, we shall briefly report on some recent results in our attempt to better model the generation of stopping rules.

636715	FAKYR: a method base system for education and research in information retrieval An information retrieval system FAKYR is described which incorporates a variety of methods for organizing and retrieving information and for evaluating retrieval effectiveness. The system has been developed in order to support education and research in the area of information retrieval. With respect to this purpose FAKYR is a comfortable and large method data base.
636716	LIARS: a software environment for testing query processing strategies This paper describes the Louisiana Information Access and Retrieval System, LIARS, a software system which provides an environment within which various strategies for query processing (and, to a certain extent, document indexing) can be empirically tested.
636717	The implementation of a document retrieval system The significant advances made in theoretical and experimental research in information retrieval have many implications for system design. One possible design for a document retrieval system based on these advances is presented. A major part of this system design has been implemented as a bibliography filing and retrieval system for the Computer Science department at the University of Massachusetts. The implementation issues considered here are functionality, user interface and file organization. The main point of this implementation was to demonstrate that an efficient, effective and flexible system can be constructed using modern techniques.
636719	Messidor: a distributed information retrieval system MESSIDOR is an interactive retrieval system. It differs from current systems in that it allows the <u>simultaneous search of several bibliographic databases</u>. The databases may be on different sites such as ESA in Frascati, TELESYSTEMES in Sophia Antipolis... The databases may use different query languages such as QUEST, MISTRAL... However a user converses with the system MESSIDOR with <u>a single language</u>, the MESSIDOR language.The system's prototype is implemented on a MICRAL 80--30 micro-computer.
636720	Adapting a data organization to the structure of stored information A data organization for information retrieval (IR) systems is described which uses the structures imposed on the stored information. Trees are used as the main structure of data as information contents are often hierarchically structured (e.g. classifications, thesauri). However, these trees have been expanded to pseudo networks by so-called cross connecting paths. So-called data connecting paths link the information structures and the main data file. Terms occurring in the query formulation may be weighted. These weights are interpreted and then used by both the retrieval and ranking algorithm. One of the paramount problems is how to combine weighted query terms. Since the well-known IR schemes (Boolean retrieval, fuzzy retrieval etc.) do not work in our environment, a specific IR model was developed which allows to deduct suitable query and ranking evaluation algorithms.

636733	Information retrieval by voice input and output Voice recognition and synthesis will become increasinglyimportant in the 1980's for both data input and output to many computer systems. However, they are still only successful for special applications where the syntax of the language is precisely defined and the number of words in the language is limited. Such a case is a modified form of the Query Language for an Information Retrieval System. Some early experience with a micro-based Information Retrieval system developed at Belfast, called Micro-BIRD, shows that it is not difficult to build a simple voice interface at low cost, but its usefulness is still limited with current technology.
636734	Is text compression by prefixes and suffixes practical? One approach to text compression is to replace high-frequency variable-length fragments of words by fixed-length codes pointing to a <u>compression table</u> containing these high-frequency fragments. It is shown that the problem of optimal fragment compression is NP-hard even if the fragments are restricted to prefixes and suffixes. This seems to be a simplest fragment compression problem which is NP-hard, since a polynomial algorithm for compressing by prefixes only (or suffixes only) has been found recently. Various compression heuristics based on using both prefixes and suffixes have been tested on large Hebrew and English texts. The best of these heuristics produce a net compression of some 37% for Hebrew and 45% for English using a prefix/suffix compression table of size 256.
636806	Framework for the development of an experimental mixed-mode message system We describe a framework for the development of a mixed-mode message system for an office environment. Messages may be composed of attributes, text, images, and voice. Message retrieval is based on content. We discuss several issues related to the development of such systems. Text retrieval techniques are important for content retrieval in this environment.
636807	Evaluation of access methods to text documents in office systems This paper compares two different approaches for indexing archived text documents. The first approach is based on inversion of words in the text, the second on the generation of a signature file representing the text content. A system reflecting the word inversion approach is compared against two systems reflecting the signature scanning approach and using, alternatively, superimposed coding and the concatenation of word signatures. Performances are estimated using analytical models of these systems. Characteristics are evaluated in function of office environment requirements. The evaluations derive from a model for estimating the statistical parameters of text archives.This work has been partially developed as part of the EEC ESPRIT project on "Mixed-Mode Message Filing System" in the Office Systems area.
636808	An interactive database end user facility for the definition and manipulation of forms A system is presented which makes possible the definition and manipulation of views by users who are not familiar with the overall organization of the database. The method used is interactive "conversation" and the user's view of data is an "abstract form" represented by a set of hierarchically related dataitems. A view is specified only in terms of a set of dataitems and the mappings required to materialize the data are automatically generated as the result of this conversation. The form becomes then the basis for accessing the database. Queries are submmited by specifying selection conditions on the fields of a form. Selected occurrences are retrieved from the database and may be scanned as conventional paper forms.
636809	Nested transactions in a combined IRS-DBMS architecture The possibility to put an Information Retrieval System (IRS)on top of a Data Base Management System (DBMS) is investigated with respect to concurrency control and recovery. The simple mapping of one IRS transaction to one DBMS transaction is analyzed and found to be unsatisfactory. Therefore, the idea of generating a sequence of DBMS transactions for a single IRS transaction is discussed. This notion of "nested" transactions assumes standard concurrency control technology but is applied twice: in the underlaying DBMS layer and in the IRS layer. The consequence is that multi-user control and recovery is also necessary in the IRS layer but it utilizes the concurrency control and recovery function of the DBMS.
636810	A semantic model and schema notation for bibliographic retrieval systems Logical models or schema are used to represent the entities, relationships, and transformations of an information system. The relational model and the relational algebra have been developed to perform this function for database systems, but until recently only a few writers (e.g., Crawford, MacLeod, Schek) have studied logical models for bibliographic retrieval systems. This paper examines an extension of the relational model, called a semantic model, as a schema for bibliographic systems. An alternative notation is suggested for the semantic model, based on the Warnier/Orr diagram. An experimental semantic model user interface, which has been developed for an experimental microcomputer information retrieval system, is briefly described.
636811	The use of adaptive mechanisms for selection of search strategies in document retrival systems A document retrieval system can incorporate many types of flexibility. One example of this is the ability to choose a search strategy that is appropriate for a particular user and query. This paper investigates the use of adaptive mechanisms to control the selection of search strategies. The experimental results indicate that, although an adaptive mechanism is capable of learning the appropriate response in simple situations, there are serious problems with using them to make complex decisions in a document retrieval system.
636812	Query enhancement by user profiles We describe a theoretical model and an on-going series of experiments aimed at a priori query enhancement. The model presents a synthesis of concepts from retrospective and current awareness retrieval systems, employing the user profile as a factor in interpreting a query. It is expected that this will provide a more personalized response to queries.
636813	The Utah Text Retrieval Project: a status report The Utah Text Retrieval Project addresses a number of areas in information retrieval, including basic system structure, user interfaces integrating information retrieval with word processing, indexing techniques, and the use of specialized backend processors. Although the work on the development of a high-speed text search engine is generally the best known, probably the most exciting aspect of the project is the message-based architecture, which provides an adaptable testbed for information retrieval techniques. It can support a variety of index and search strategies, while instrumenting their performance so that they can be accurately compared in an identical environment.This paper describes the goals and design decisions for the Utah Retrieval System Architecture (URSA). It discusses the prototype system's features and limitations, and the changes that will be made to produce the production version.
62459	Optimum probability estimation based on expectations Probability estimation is important for the application of probabilistic models as well as for any evaluation in IR. We discuss the interdependencies between parameter estimation and other properties of probabilistic models. Then we define an optimum estimate which can be applied to various typical estimation problems in IR. A method for the computation of this estimate is described which uses expectations from empirical distributions. Some experiments show the applicability of our method, whereas comparable approaches are partially based on false assumptions or yield estimates with systematic errors.
62473	Retrieval based on user behaviour This paper gives an overview of the ongoing research in the Active Data Bases project at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. In this project we are specifying and building a system that helps a user in his search for useful and interesting information in large, complex information systems. The system is able to do this, because it learns from the interaction about the users and the data it contains. The indications of the users are expressed in terms of interests in the data, which serve as building blocks for user and data models. These models are then used to improve the search for interesting data.
62479	IR-NLI II: applying man-machine interaction and artificial intelligence conceptsto information retrieval This paper addresses the problem of building expert interfaces to information retrieval systems. In particular, the problem of augmenting the capabilities of such interfaces with user modeling features is discussed and the main benefits of this approach are outlined. The paper presents a prototype system called IR-NLI II, devoted to model by means of artificial intelligence techniques the human intermediary to information retrieval systems. The overall organization of the IR-NLI II system is presented, together with a short description of the two main modules implemented so far, namely the Information Retrieval Expert Subsystem and the User Modeling Subsystem. An example of interaction with IR-NLI II is described. Perspectives and future research directions are finally outlined.
62481	Intelligent support for interface systems This paper describes how a language for building interfaces to information systems, that is being developed by the Office of Research at OCLC, can be linked to an artificial intelligence environment, Poplog. A demonstration system, showing how Poplog could provide some intelligent support for a D interface, has been developed. It is suggested that this could form the basis for intelligent support for interface systems.
62482	A parallel multiprocessor machine dedicated to relational and deductive data bases Efficiency in databases is a major requirement. This paper presents some solutions to cope with this problem. One solution is to execute operations in parallel: this is done in the “Delta Driven Computer” DDC, which is a multiprocessor machine with distributed memory dedicated to relational and deductive databases. In DDC, relations are distributed among the nodes of the machine, and the data are processed asynchronously in each node. To do that in an efficient way, a coprocessor, specialized for relational operations, is also proposed. It is called &mgr;SyC, for “microprogrammable Symbolic Coprocessor”. This paper is divided into two parts. The first part describes DDC, presenting the architecture, the languages, and an original computational model. The second part describes &mgr;SyC, its architecture, instruction set and the data structures used at the &mgr;SyC level.
62483	Flexible selection among objects: a framework based on fuzzy sets Up to now, most of the retrieving systems are founded on a Boolean selection mechanism. It appears that this way of doing is not powerful enough to deal with some applications, especially when the size (number) of the results must be controlled. In that case, some kind of flexibility is needed in query expression. In this paper, we suggest the use of a fuzzy sets based approach. The basic principles of this approach are presented and compared to more conventional solutions providing only limited extensions. Moreover, the implementation aspects related to our approach are discussed to show that reasonable performances can be expected.
62485	The document management component of a multimedia data model We describe ESTRELLA a multimedia object oriented data model developed by MATRA. This model is based upon objects, classes (organized in a lattice) and functions (allow to dynamically implement operations on data and new data types). The valid states of the data base are described by a set of integrity constraints. We propose a document model capable to manage structured documents and to index them with a superimposed codes method. We present as well the associated data manipulation language with a navigational interface and content search operators
62494	French textual information systems: the contribution of extensional and intentional logics An abstract is not available.
62495	An information structure dealing with term dependance and polysemy An information structure (IS) that is regarded as a formal description of a domain of discourse is proposed. This IS is aimed at increasing the effectiveness of an information retrieval system. It is shown how the retrieval algorithm can take into account the term dependencies that are provided by the IS. Moreover, these term dependencies can be used by an automatic indexing procedure in order to interpret polysemic terms. The theoretical framework of our IS has some favorable properties. As a consequence, the construction and maintenance of such an IS is simpler than that of a thesaurus.
62496	Planning in an expert system for automated information retrieval Searching online databases requires an information retrieval strategy formalized in the EURISKO expert system. This search strategy is based on different kinds of planning: at the highest level a plan orders a linear and hierarchical planning for the request interrogation and a dynamic planning for the request modification. The recent development of the system has allowed to supply some new judgements on this approach.
62497	Conceptual representation for knowledge bases and << intelligent >> information retrieval systems This paper describes the “conceptual” Knowledge Representation Language (KRL) proper to an environment for the construction and use of large Knowledge Bases and/or “Intelligent” Information Retrieval Systems. In the KRL, we separate the treatment of the episodic memory (extensional, assertional data = “Snoopy is Charlie Brown's beagle”) from the treatment of the semantic memory (intensional, terminological data = A beagle is a sort of hound / a hound is a dog …). A compromise between an “object-oriented approach” and a “logic-oriented approach” is proposed for implementation purposes.
62499	Set oriented retrieval The broad way in which we look at how an IRS functions influences the types of questions we ask about it and the ways we try to improve performance. In the recent past, retrieval methodologies have been based on retrieving documents one at a time. In this paper we are introducing a set oriented view. We observe that this view is quite consistent with the single-document or sequential methods, and define a precise model to capture the set-oriented approach. We then examine a number consequences of the model, such as the limitations implied by a finite index vocabulary. Finally, we discuss various ways in which the set orientation can influence our thinking about IR.
62501	Active memory for text information retrieval A Symbolic Associative Processor (SAP), capable of supporting parallel Keyword Match and Record Match functions, is proposed to select and streamline textual data for information retrieval. Consequently, high volume text data could be analysed on-the-fly before being channelled to CPU, and thus, cushion the impact of Von Neumann bottleneck commonly experienced in applications requiring high I/O bandwidth. This paper identifies some of the system requirements to support text information retrieval using SAP with the aid of simplified examples.
62502	Access by content of documents in an office information system This paper presents the integration of retrieval functions of an Information Retrieval System, IOTA, in an Office Information Server. Besides the linear scanning of the text (using a software and a hardware filter), two access methods are proposed. The first one is based on a simple indexing of documents based on signatures. Here, texts are treated as character strings. We call this method Textual Search. The second one is based on the extention of Signature Methods for implementing the Indexing Relation of IOTA, where meaningful terms (noun groups, for example) are identified in the text together with grammatical information. We call this method of signature computation the Indexing-Term Signature. The resulting access method is called Semantic Search. We present the current experimentations using the SCHUSS hardware filter as a scanning accelerator and the results of different alternatives of implementation of these Retrieval functions .
62503	Development of a large, concept-oriented database for information retrieval The development of concept-oriented databases using AI knowledge representation schemes is proposed as a step towards improving the precision and recall of information retrieval systems. Currently underway is the augmentation of a 238,000 citation database, Chemical Abstracts (CA) Volume 105, by addition of detailed conceptual information in the form of frames and hierarchies. The initial text data is parsed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create frames describing the semantics of the index entries in the database, with the slots in the frames being pointers into a very large semantic network of conceptual objects (956,000 objects). To examine the resultant knowledge base (KB), a simple hypertext system is proposed, with the conceptual information serving as pathways to connect related citations .

511286	Introduction and perspectives for the 1971 ACM Information Storage and Retrieval Symposium An introduction and some prospectives are provided for the 1971 ACM Information Storage and Retrieval Symposium held at the University of Maryland on April 1 and 2, 1971. The symposium, sponsored by the University of Maryland, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR) of the ACM, focuses on advances in techniques in the computer oriented technology of information retrieval. Early developments and the status of recent efforts in document retrieval, quesiton-answering and data management systems are reviewed briefly.
511292	CUE: a preprocessor system for restricted, natural English CUE, an input interface system which permits the computer to utilize natural but restricted English as input, is presented. In addition, an experimental model for CUE, Proto-RELADES, which can "understand" and execute English sentences about the content of the library at IBM's Boston Programming Center is described. These sentences can be query, command, or conditional sentences. The linguistic component of the system is based on a transformational grammar of English that performs a full syntactic and semantic analysis of each input sentence and translates it into relevant computer operations. The capabilities and limitations of this system are described.
511295	Quantification in query systems Questions which involve 'all', 'every', 'some', or the indefinite article, pose some peculiar problems when presented to a computerized question-answering system where ambiguities cannot be tolerated. These problems vary from the nature of the correct answer in special cases to the very admissibility of the question itself. To deal with these problems it is convenient to divide questions into two classes---extensional questions whose answers are to name things or truth values, intensional questions whose answers are to give meanings. This paper examines extensional questions. For these, the interpretative problems arising with 'all' and 'every' can be solved by introducing a new kind of quantification, extensional universal quantification, that has the meaning of 'all F' together with a secondary meaning that the class F is not empty. Formal rules for this quantification are given, and it is shown that the so-called definite formulas (which explicate permissible queries) are closed under the new operator.
511296	The relational data file and the decision problem for classes of proper formulas The Relational Data File (RDF) of The Rand Corporation is among the most developed of question-answering systems. The "information language" of this system is an applied predicate calculus. The atomic units of information are binary relational sentences. The system has an inference-making capacity.As part of the actual construction and implementation of the RDF, a theory was developed by J. L. Kuhns to identify those formulas of the predicate calculus which represent the "reasonable" inquiries to put to this system. Accordingly, the classes of definite and proper formulus were defined, and their properties studied. The definite formulas share a semantic property Kuhns judged as necessarily possessed by a reasonable question to be processed by the RDF. The author has previously shown that the decision problem for the class of definite formulas is recursively unsolvable. The proper formulas are definite, and satisfy additional syntactic conditions intended to make them especially suitable for machine processing. The class of proper formulas depends on which logical primitives are employed. Different primitives give rise to different classes of formulas. A formula which can be effectively transformed into a proper equivalent is admissible. Kuhns conjectures that with respect to one particular class of proper formulas, all definite formulas are admissible. In the paper it is shown that the decision problem for several classes of proper formulas is solvable. The following results are established. Theorem 1: The class of proper formulas in prenex form on any complete set of connectives is recursive. Theorem 2: The class of proper formulas on ¬, ?, ? is recursive. Theorem 3: The class of proper formulas on ¬, ?, ? is recursive. Theorem 4: The class of proper formulas on ¬, ?, ?, ?, is recursive. Thus, there is a mechanical decision procedure which determines whether an arbitrary formula is a member of the class. It follows that the analogues of Kuhns' conjecture for these classes are false.
511298	Managing semantic data in an associative net This paper describes the design and implementation of a general associative net structure to be used in an interactive information system, and presents a scheme designed to manage large quantities of semantic data stored in a data base on disc. The associative-net-structured data base is functionally divided into two pools: the hierarchy pool and the linguistic pool. The network of items in the hierarchy pool represents the descriptive information about documents and the network of items in the linguistic pool represents the syntactic and semantic properties of the items in the hierarchy pool. Two search functions and a general search algorithm are presented in this paper. In the implementation, the data base is a regional data set on disc. Items and their associated labeled links are stored on disc tracks. The system establishes a directory to keep track of the items which have associated information stored on more than one track. The use of the directory eliminates unnecessary disc accesses and allows the system to move a proper track into core storage for data processing.
511299	A heathkit method for building data management programs One of the difficulties faced in implementing information management and retrieval systems is that each case seems to present its own special complexities. As a result information retrieval systems typically fall behind their programming schedule and have many bugs when delivered. In this paper a set of basic operations on types of files are defined. These operations are intended to fulfill the same role for information retrieval systems programmers that functions such as LOG(X) fill for mathematical applications programmers.. they should make the job very much easier. The file operations have been implemented as a run-time package written in FORTRAN IV and Burroughs Extended Algol. The approach has been used to develop three different information management systems; an APL interactive computing system, a generalized information retrieval system, and a specialized information retrieval system for map oriented data. These systems are described.
511300	File structure determination An approach to determining an appropriate file structure for a given application is presented, by outlining a methodology for comparing some important aspects of data management system performance. The aspect chosen for analysis is the processing time required to evaluate Boolean functions defined on data values contained within a file structure and select elements from the structure satisfying the expression.Two file structures are studied. The structures are each combinations of hierarchical and inverted file organizations, which differ in the use of the pointers contained in the inverted file. In one case they link a value to nodes corresponding to its occurrence in the data hierarchy and in the second they link a value to the entry which contains the node corresponding to an occurrence.Algorithms for processing within each of the structures are discussed. Each algorithm is then modeled, and approximating models developed for simulation of the algorithms.
511302	An approach to research in file organization Research in file organization is a problem in which the unstructured efforts of many individual researchers have not produced results commensurate with the effort expended. The paper briefly examines some of the reasons for this and suggests a structure consisting of a language and terminology for communication, a model of information processing systems and tools for studying and analyzing problems related to such systems. The ISDOS project is outlined as a coordinated approach which may serve as the beginning in the development of a satisfactory structure.
511307	Efficient utilization of limited access archival storage in a time shared environment The public storage in any time sharing system tends to continually grow. This necessitates the implementation of certain measures to maintain public storage. One of these possibilities is creation of an archival level of storage called "migrated" storage. Data that have not been referenced recently are moved or "migrated" to a less accessible level of external storage. Since these data are not accessed by the users directly, i.e., the data must be restored to public storage before being used, a certain variable length coding technique, viz., Huffman Coding, is used to compact and store these data. The ideas presented have been implemented on a version of TSS/360 Time Sharing System and are presently being used in a real environment. The overall compaction rate achieved was 3. 16 to 1. Further details on compaction rates and timings are also presented.
511308	Data compression techniques for economic processing of large commercial files The application of compact coding, differencing and other techniques to indexed sequential files is discussed. The effects on system performance are discussed and reductions of almost 80% in mass storage requirements for a particular file are reported.
511309	Optimal classification and its consequences A particular classification and retrieval model are considered. A notion is introduced which indicates the extent to which retrieval performance may be improved by a suitable choice of classification within the model. A method for determining the optimal performance for the model is outlined together with an algorithm for constructing the classification which allows this limit to be attained. A treatment of the mathematical preliminaries for a particular class of match function is given. The relevance of the analysis in research on information retrieval systems is discussed.

62440	The use of anaphoric resolution for document description in information retrieval This study investigated two hypotheses concerning the use of anaphors in information retrieval. The first hypothesis, that anaphors tend to refer to integral concepts rather than to peripheral concepts, was well supported. Two samples of documents, one in psychology and the other in computer science, were examined by subject experts who judged the centrality of phrases which were referred to anaphorically. The second hypothesis, that various term weighting schemes are affected differently by anaphoric resolution, was also well supported. It was found that schemes which incorporate document length into the calculations produce much smaller increases in term weights for terms occurring in anaphoric resolutions than do those which do not consider document length. It is concluded that although anaphoric resolution has potential for better representing the “aboutness” of a document, care must be taken in choosing both the anaphoric classes to be resolved and the term weighting schemes to be used in measuring a document's topicality.

62444	Precedental data bases: how and why they are worked out and used The concept of a “precedental data base” is introduced. It is a linguistic data base consisting of a dictionary of lexical patterns (clishes) and a dictionary of discourses. Some algorithms for textual information processing using precedental data bases are discussed in detail. These systems are installed on mainframe and minicomputers for test runs.
62445	How do the experts do it? The use of ethnographic methods as an aid to understanding the cognitive processing and retrieval of large bodies of text This paper explores an important problem in information retrieval: that of rapidly increasing amounts of full-text storage that is difficult to file and retrieve effectively. The author suggests that a possible avenue for improving full-text retrieval would include in-depth studies of the ways in which individual users cope with large amounts of written information, stored chiefly on paper in their offices. Relevant literature in cognitive psychology is reviewed and some recent and continuing studies are described that have used anthropological methods to approach this problem. It is argued that historians are a good group to study, due to their reliance on the examination and processing of texts, and the broad scope of their inquiries. Examinations of the ways in which this one group of information workers categorize documents could lead us to a better understanding of human problems in processing and retrieving textual information.
62449	BABEL: a base for an experimental library This report discusses the implementation of a knowledge base for a library information system. It is done using a typed logic programming language—LOGIN—where type inheritance is built in. The knowledge base is structured in a hierarchical taxonomy of library object classes where each class is represented in a FRAME style knowledge structure and inherits the properties of its parents, and where infrastructural inference rules have been established through typed Horn clauses. Also in this document, some programming techniques aimed at using the power of inheritance as taxonomic inference are discussed.
62450	ALLOY: an amalgamation of expert, linguistic and statistical indexing methods In this paper we report progress on the development of ALLOY, a system that simplifies automatic document indexing and retrieval by combining techniques from several different approaches: expert, linguistic and statistical. The system is being designed to allow a panel of experts to create an ALLOY system for a given field by providing the necessary input that ALLOY needs to automatically index documents and to set up a convenient user interface. The input provided by the experts includes a hierarchy of concepts and an expert dictionary. The amount of information that the panel must provide for given field is considerably less than the amount required to build a complete thesaurus or knowledge base about that field.
75343	Optimum polynomial retrieval functions We show that any approach to develop optimum retrieval functions is based on two kinds of assumptions: first, a certain form of representation for documents and requests, and second, additional simplifying assumptions that predefine the type of the retrieval function. Then we describe an approach for the development of optimum polynomial retrieval functions: request-document pairs (ƒ l , d m ) are mapped onto description vectors @@@@ (ƒ l , d m ), and a polynomial function of the form @@@@ T · @@@@ ( @@@@ ) is developed such that it yields estimates of the probability of relevance P ( R | @@@@ (ƒ l , d m )) with minimum square errors. We give experimental results for the application of this approach to documents with weighted indexing as well as to documents with complex representations. In contrast to other probabilistic models, our approach yields estimates of the actual probabilities, it can handle very complex representations of documents and requests, and it can be easily applied to multi-valued relevance scales. On the other hand, this approach is not suited to log-linear probabilistic models, and it needs large samples of relevance feedback data for its application.
75346	An optical system for full text search In this paper we propose a full text search system based on optics. The storage and processing of the textual data are performed by an optical back-end system to an electronic computer. In this way we can take advantage of the speed and parallelism of digital optical processing. Using the proposed configuration we show how one might implement a set of text processing operations using lasers, spatial light modulators and photodetectors .

860436	Keynote Address - exploring, modeling, and using the web graph The Web graph, meaning the graph induced by Web pages as nodes and their hyperlinks as directed edges, has become a fascinating object of study for many people: physicists, sociologists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and information retrieval specialists.Recent results range from theoretical (e.g.: models for the graph, semi-external algorithms), to experimental (e.g.: new insights regarding the rate of change of pages, new data on the distribution of degrees), to practical (e.g.: improvements in crawling technology).Recent results range from theoretical (e.g.: models for the graph, semi-external algorithms), to experimental (e.g.: new insights regarding the rate of change of pages, new data on the distribution of degrees), to practical (e.g.: improvements in crawling technology).The goal of this talk is to convey an introduction to the state of the art in this area and to sketch the current issues in collecting, representing, analyzing, and modeling this graph. Although graph analytic methods are essential tools in the Web IR arsenal, they are well known to the SIGIR community and will not be discussed here in any detail; instead, we will explore some challenges and opportunities for using IR methods and techniques in the exploration of the Web graph, in particular in dealing with legitimate and "spam" perturbations of the "natural" process of birth and death of nodes and links, and conversely, the challenges and opportunities of using graph methods in support of IR on the Web and in the enterprise.
860513	Searchers' criteria For assessing web pages We investigate the criteria used by online searchers when assessing the relevance of web pages to information-seeking tasks. Twenty four searchers were given three tasks each, and indicated the features of web pages which they employed when deciding about the usefulness of the pages. These tasks were presented within the context of a simulated work-task situation. The results of this study provide a set of criteria used by searchers to decide about the utility of web pages. Such criteria have implications for the design of systems that use or recommend web pages, as well as to authors of web pages.

860526	Discovering and structuring information flow among bioinformatics resources In this poster, we present a model of the flow of information among bioinformatics resources in the context of a specific scientific problem. Combining task analysis with traditional, qualitative research, we determined the extent to which the bioinformatics analysis process could be automated. The model represents a semi-automated process, involving fourteen distinct data processing steps, and forms the framework for an interface to bioinformatics information.
860533	Classification of source code archives The World Wide Web contains a number of source code archives. Programs are usually classified into various categories within the archive by hand. We report on experiments for automatic classification of source code into these categories. We examined a number of factors that affect classification accuracy. Weighting features by expected entropy loss makes a significant improvement in classification accuracy. We show a Support Vector Machine can be trained to classify source code with a high degree of accuracy. We feel these results show promise for software reuse.

860539	Assessing the effectiveness of pen-based input queries In this poster, we describe an experiment exploring the effectiveness of a pen based text input device for use in query construction. Standard TREC queries were written, recognised, and subsequently retrieved upon. Comparisons between retrieval effectiveness based on the recognised writing and a typed text baseline were made. On average, effectiveness was 75% of the baseline. Other statistics on the quality and nature of recognition are also reported. .
860540	A light weight PDA-friendly collection fusion technique This short paper presents a light weight technique to merge results lists obtained from querying different databases. The motivation for such a technique is a general purpose search engine for Palm-OS based PDAs.
860541	Speech-based and video-supported indexing of multimedia broadcast news This paper describes an automatic content indexing system for news programs, with a special emphasis on its segmentation process. The process can successfully segment an entire news program into topic-centered news stories; the primary tool is a linguistic topic segmentation algorithm. Experiments show that the resulting speech-based segments are fairly accurate, and scene change points supplied by an external video processor can be of help in improving segmentation effectiveness.
860542	Summary evaluation and text categorization In general terms the evaluation of a summary depends on how close it is to the chief points in the source text. This begets the question as to what are the chief points in the source text and how is this information used in itself in identifying the source text. This is crucially important when we discuss automatic evaluation of summaries. So the question of main points is the source text. Typically, this would be around a nucleus of keywords. However, the salience, the frequency, and the relationship of the text with other texts in the collection (of these keywords is perhaps) are important. Text categorisation using neural networks explicates these points well and also has a practical impact.
860544	HAT: a hardware assisted TOP-DOC inverted index component A novel Hardware Assisted Top-Doc (HAT) component is disclosed. HAT is an optimized content indexing device based on a modified inverted index structure. HAT accommodates patterns of different lengths and supports a varied posting list versus term count feature sustaining high reusability and efficiency. The developed component can be used either as an internal slave component or as an external co-processor and is efficient in resource demands as the component controllers take only a minimal percentage of the target device space leaving the majority of the space to term and posting entries. A Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is used to model the HAT system.
860546	Optimizing term vectors for efficient and robust filtering We describe an efficient, robust method for selecting and optimizing terms for a classification or filtering task. Terms are extracted from positive examples in training data based on several alternative term-selection algorithms, then combined additively after a simple term-score normalization step to produce a merged and ranked master term vector. The score threshold for the master vector is set via beta-gamma regulation over all the available training data. The process avoids para-meter calibrations and protracted training. It also results in compact profiles for run-time evaluation of test (new) documents. Results on TREC-2002 filtering-task datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over TREC-median results and rival both idealized IR-based results and optimized (and expensive) SVM-based classifiers in general effectiveness.
860547	The TREC-like evaluation of music IR systems This poster reports upon the ongoing efforts being made to establish TREC-like and other comprehensive evaluation paradigms within the Music IR (MIR) and Music Digital Library (MDL) research communities. The proposed research tasks are based upon expert opinion garnered from members of the Information Retrieval (IR), MDL and MIR communities with regard to the construction and implementation of scientifically valid evaluation frameworks.

With the original structured query processing engine and the IR extensions built into the system, Timber is well suited for efficiently and effectively processing queries with both structural and textual content constraints.

860558	Document retrieval from user-selected web sites We present a new tool for gathering textual information according to a query (texts) on arbitrary web sites specified by an information-seeking user. This tool is helpful in any knowledge-intensive area. Its technology is based on the vector space model with optimized feature definition. .
860559	eArchivarius: accessing collections of electronic mail We present eArchivarius an interactive system for accessing collections of electronic mail. The system combines search, clustering visualization, and time-based visualization of email messages and people who send or received the messages.
803133	Augmented Transition Networks as a design tool for personalized database systems This paper illustrates the use of Augmented Transition Networks (ATNs) as a design tool for constructing document retrieval systems for those personalized applications which are too small or specialized to attract a commercial vendor. ATNs, which are explained in the context of this application, are used not only to improve the human/computer interface with the retrieval system but also to conceptually organize its structure.
803134	Mediator: An integrated approach to Information Retrieval Mediator: An Integrated Approach to Information Retrieval The Mediator is a pseudo intelligent software controller which accomplishes two ends. First, it -&-ldquo;mediates-&-rdquo; between an Information Retrieval System and its end-user. On the assumption that the user of such a system will have at best a minimal knowledge of the operations of computers, it hides from him the internal complexities of the system, and presents to him a simplified -&-ldquo;abstract-&-rdquo; of the operations of the system. The Mediator allows the end-user to communicate with any application program in his own terms and to carry out operations of any degree of complexity which can be defined within those terms. Secondly, the controller enables a single system to extract unified information from data-banks of both data base management and textual environments. The Mediator is driven by a combination of hierarchically structured internal and external tables. The external tables contain a vocabulary selected by the user for his personal communication with the system; the internal tables contain directives which determine the appropriate path to be followed by the retrieval system in accomplishing the user's request.
803135	Analysis of an inverted data base structure An inverted data base organization is analyzed. The inverted directory is viewed realistically as another large data base. Algorithms and formulations are derived to estimate the average number of accesses for insertion, retrieval and deletion of items from the data base. An average load time is also presented for the inverted data base.
803136	A file organization for cluster-based retrieval A file organization for cluster-based retrieval is presented and tested. This file organization is based on the bottom-up search which, in contrast to the more usual top-down search, starts at the lowest level of a cluster hierarchy (the documents) and looks at progressively larger clusters. This approach enables most of the efficiency problems previously associated with clustered file organizations to be avoided. There are two parts to this file organization - a compact cluster hierarchy representation which does not store cluster representatives and a compact inverted file which is used to provide a starting point for the bottom-up search. Retrieval experiments show that the bottom-up search using this file organization can be more effective than a serial search, especially if high precision results are required.
803137	Record block allocation for retrieval on secondary keys Query retrieval based on secondary keys is an important operation in retrieval systems. Such a query generally retrieves more than one data record which satisfies the query criterion. This paper studies the problem of record address allocation in disk-like devices so as to facilitate the fast retrieval of a set of records which are jointly accessed by a query. A heuristic scheme, using the proposed minimal access retrieval property, is designed to assign records to blocks. Some experimental results are also presented.
803138	A Block Structured Query Language for accessing a relational data base This paper describes a B lock S tructured Q uery L anguage (BSQL) to be used with relational data bases. The syntax of the language is presented and discussed. Facilities of the language are illustrated by examples of actual queries. In particular we demonstrate the ability of BSQL to obtain useful information from a relational data base that is incomplete. A relational calculus is then presented which forms a basis for a formalism which precisely describes the semantics of BSQL. Finally, comparative examples with other query languages are given.
803140	Experiments on the determination of the relationships between terms The retrieval effectiveness of an automatic method that uses relevance judgements for the determination of positive as well as negative relationships between terms is evaluated. The term relationships are incorporated into the retrieval process by using a generalized similarity function that has a term match component, a positive term relationship component, and a negative term relationship component. Two strategies, query partitioning and query clustering, for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the term relationships are investigated. The latter appears to be more attractive from linguistic as well as economic points of view. The positive and the negative relationships are verified to be effective both when used individually, and in combination. The importance attached to the term relationship components relative to that of term match component is found to have a substantial effect on the retrieval performance. The usefulness of discriminant analysis as a technique for determining the relative importance of these components is investigated.
803142	INQUIRE system overview INQUIRE is a versatile database management system with integrated information retrieval and full-text processing capabilities. Designed primarily for the end-user of information, INQUIRE features rapid start-up of applications and has a broad range of facilities for both technical and non-technical users. INQUIRE is operational on IBM System 360 or 370, Amdahl 470, or equivalent, under OS, VS, MVS, or CMS.
803143	INSPECTOR INSPECTOR is a proprietary software system that is designed to be used in an information retrieval environment. Specifically, it is oriented toward the on-line retrieval of microfilmed documents through the indexing of certain key terms relating to the document itself. Items such as date, account number, name, customer name or number, purchase order number, etc. might be considered as key descriptive terms. Thus by indexing these elements on a randomly accessible disk drive, the location of the filmed image of all original documents pertaining to a particular descriptive term may be quickly located by the computer and the location displayed to the operator. Alternatively, if used in conjunction with the Eastman Kodak IC-5/PR-1 microfilm retrieval unit, the computer system will cause the film display unit to automatically advance to the correct frame(s), keeping operator intervention to an absolute minimum.
803144	MAGIC MAGIC is a simple, elegant, and time-saving system for retrieving, manipulating, and displaying time series data. The user of MAGIC is not required to know anything about file structures or computer programming. Finished reports and graphs suitable for reproduction are attainable after minimal experience with the MAGIC system.
803145	SIRE SIRE (Syracuse Information Retrieval Experiment) is an interactive bibliographic retrieval system. It was developed at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. It is implemented in SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language), an ALGOL like language, on a DEC KL-10. SIRE presently has two data bases; 1) one issue of Physics Abstracts with 7146 documents; and 2) a sign language linguistics data base from Gallaudet College with 490 documents.
803146	WEIRD: An approach to concept-based information retrieval WEIRD is an automatic document retrieval system designed and implemented at Syracuse University, which attempts to advance the art of computerized retrieval from word-matching to judging conceptual similarity. WEIRD uses a vector space model to represent the relations among terms and documents. Items in the space are located according to their -&-ldquo;meaning-&-rdquo;, which is their proximity to all other items in the data base as measured by co-occurrence frequencies. This is done without manipulating large matrices. The dimensions of the space are not used to define relations; items are defined solely by their position relative to the other items. Retrieval is determined by Euclidean distance from the plotted query. In the first section of the paper the basic characteristics of WEIRD are described. Second, the results of a preliminary evaluation are reported. Alternatives for further development of WEIRD are then considered.
42008	Some considerations for using approximate optimal queries An optimal query has been defined as one which will recover all the known relevant documents of a query in their best probability of relevance ranking. We have slightly modified the definition so that it also allows one to trace its evolution from the original to the optimal via the various feedback stages. Such a query can be constructed by modifying the original query with terms from the known relevant documents. It is pointed out that such a term addition strategy differs materially from other approaches that add terms based on term association with all query terms, and calculated from the whole document collection. The effect of viewing a document as constituted of components, and hence affecting the weighting and retreival results of of the optimal query, is also discussed.
42011	Enriched knowledge representation for information retrieval In this paper we identify the need for a new theory of information. An information model is developed which distinguishes between data, as directly observable facts, information, as structured collections of data, and knowledge as methods of using information. The model is intended to support a wide range of information systems. In the paper we develop the use of the model for a semantic information retrieval system using the concept of semantic categories. The likely benefits of this area discussed, though as yet no detailed evaluation has been conducted.
42013	Generating an individualized user interface A model of the interface to an information retrieval system is developed based on the semantic data model. Using this framework, a method of developing customized user interfaces is described, in general terms and in a specific implementation in the Interface Builder module of the Western Information Retrieval System.
42015	Illustrated description of an interactive knowledge based indexing system This report discusses the Indexing Aid Project for conducting research in interactive knowledge-based indexing of the medical literature. After providing an overview and background, we describe and illustrate the Indexing Aid System using an extended example, highlighting the knowledge-based capabilities of the system, namely, inheritance and internal retrieval, enforcement of restrictions, and other functions implemented by procedural attachments, which are characteristic of frame-based knowledge representation languages. A feature which generates reports for evaluating the system is also shown. The paper concludes with discussion of the research plan. The project is part of the Automated Classification and Retrieval Program at the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, the research and development arm of the National Library of Medicine.
42024	Random and best-first document selection models Most document retrieval systems based on probabilistic models of feature distributions assume random selection of documents for retrieval. The assumptions of these models are met when documents are randomly selected from the database or when retrieving all available documents. A more suitable model for retrieval of a single document assumes that the best document available is to be retrieved first. Models of document retrieval systems assuming random selection and best-first selection are developed and compared under binary independence and two Poisson independence feature distribution models. Under the best-first model, feature discrimination varies with the number of documents in each relevance class in the database. A weight similar to the Inverse Document Frequency weight and consistent with the best-first model is suggested which does not depend on knowledge of the characteristics of relevant documents.

42027	An advanced full-text retrieval and analysis system MICROARRAS is an advanced full-text retrieval and analysis system. It supports fast, efficient browsing of a document's vocabulary as well as its text, recursive analytic categories, Boolean search with flexible context specifications, evaluation of arithmetic expressions, and graphical display of various numeric distributions. The system is designed to work with large textbases stored on remote mainframes or on a local store for a micro-computer or workstation. The description covers system architecture, design principals, as well as user functions.
42029	A VLSI chip for efficient transmission and retrieval of information In this paper, we present a functional description of a VLSI chip aimed at reducing the cost of data transmission and data access within information processing machines and distributed information systems. The chip maps standard character codes (e.g., ASCII) into more efficient codes (e.g., Huffman's codes) using a tree module of basic cells. In bit-serial communication controllers, for example, the parallel-to-serial transformation unit can be simply replaced by the proposed chip. The VLSI design can provide speeds that far exceed current and projected peak transfer rates of high-speed disks and communication controllers.
42030	File organizations & incrementally specified queries Queries to information retrieval systems are often incrementally specified as a result of user interaction with the system. However, most discussions of file organizations consider only completely specified queries. The choice of file organizations to support such incremental specification is discussed qualitatively in this extended abstract. (Quantitative comparisons are partially complete and are not presented here.) Organizations which are advantageous for completely specified queries are not necessarily so for incrementally specified queries (and vice versa).
42032	Determining online retrieval system display size This paper outlines a problem in commercial online retrieval systems, provides a review of the relevant literature, and presents a solution for a special case of the problem. Previous investigators have considered how to best determine, for a ranked list of records retrieved from an online retrieval system, whether or not the user should continue to display the output. This paper examines the problem of how effective display size can be estimated as a means of assisting the users of commercial online retrieval systems. Although no experimental results are as yet available, the approach presented here will provide a guide to and prolegomenon for systematic study of the problem, as well as a method for providing the estimated number of relevant records remaining in a retrieved set ranked by a retrieval status value.
42036	Towards an expert system for bibliographical retrieval: a Prolog prototype A prototype Prolog system has been developed for online bibliographic retrieval. Most online bibliographic retrieval systems may be characterized by queries based on the occurrence of keywords and by databases consisting of possibly millions of records. Such systems have very fast response times but generally lack any deductive reasoning capability. An expert system for online bibliographic retrieval, developed in Prolog, would provide enhanced retrieval capabilities through the application of deductive reasoning. Such a system would permit knowledge-type queries to be asked in addition to the traditional keyword-type of queries. A concern with using Prolog to perform an online search of a million-record data base is that the response time would be unacceptable. In order to overcome this drawback two alternatives are examined: a special-purpose hardware device and an extended Prolog capability.
98219	Using syntactic analysis in a document retrieval system that uses signature files Our work involves the study of the extent to which natural language processing techniques aid the automatic indexing and retrieval of documents. In this paper we describe the use of signature files in large text retrieval systems. We show that good performance can be obtained without requiring the significant overheads required for the inverted file technique. We examine the use of syntactic analysis of the text in all stages of retrieval and argue that an initial Boolean query should be performed that provides a subset of documents, which are then ranked. We then give an algorithm for generating such queries, taking into account the syntactic structure of the queries.
98226	Surrogate subsets: a free space management strategy for the index of a text retrieval system This paper presents a new data structure and an associated strategy to be utilized by indexing facilities for text retrieval systems. The paper starts by reviewing some of the goals that may be considered when designing such an index and continues with a small survey of various current strategies. It then presents an indexing strategy referred to as surrogate subsets discussing its appropriateness in the light of the specified goals. Various design issues and implementation details are discussed. Our strategy requires that a surrogate file be divided into a large number of subsets separated by free space which will allow the index to expand when new material is appended to the database. Experimental results report on the utilization of free space when the database is enlarged.
98231	Evaluation of an expert system for searching in full text This paper presents a prototype expert system which provides online search assistance. The expert system automatically reformulates queries, using an online thesaurus as the source of domain knowledge, and a knowledge base of domain-independent search tactics. The expert system works with a full-text database which requires no syntactic or semantic pre-processing. In addition, the expert system ranks the retrieved passages in decreasing order of probable relevance. Users' search performance using the expert system was compared with their search performance on their own, and their search performance using the online thesaurus. The following conclusions were reached: 1) The expert system significantly reduced the number of queries necessary to find relevant passages compared with the user searching alone or with the thesaurus. 2) The expert system produced marginally significant improvements in precision compared with the user searching on their own. There was no significant difference in the recall achieved by the three system configurations. 3) Overall, the expert system ranked relevant passages above irrelevant passages.
98234	On the interrelationship of dictionary size and completeness When dictionaries for specific applications or subject fields are derived from a text collection, the frequency distribution of the terms in the collection gives information about the expected completeness of the dictionary. If only a subset of the terms in the collection is to be included in the dictionary, the completeness of the dictionary can be optimized with respect to dictionary size. In this paper, formulas for the relationship between the frequency distribution of the terms in the collection and expected dictionary completeness are derived. First we regard one-dimensional dictionaries where the (non-trivial) terms occurring in the texts are to be included in the dictionary. Then we describe the case of two-dimensional dictionaries, which are needed for example for automatic indexing with a controlled vocabulary; here relationships between text terms and descriptors from the prescribed vocabulary have to be stored in the dictionary. For both cases, formulas for the interpolation and extrapolation with respect to different collection sizes are derived. We give experimental results for one-dimensional dictionaries and show how the completeness can be estimated and optimized.
98237	On hypertext This panel will employ two different interpretations of the phrase “growing up” to address areas of common interest between hypertext and information retrieval researchers. First, the panelists will question whether or not hypertext is “growing up” as a scientific discipline; They will discuss characteristics that separate hypertext research from other related disciplines. Second, the panelists will discuss the problems encountered when a hypertext system “grows up” in size and complexity; They will discuss the very real problems expected when representing and integrating large knowledge bases, accommodating multiple users, and distributing single logical hypertexts across multiple physical sites. The panelists will not lecture, but they will advance a number of themes including “the Myth of Modularity” (Frisse), “New Architectures Employing Hyperconcept Databases” (Agosti), “Hypertext in Software Engineering” (Bruandet), “Automatic Hypertext Generation” (Hahn), and “Large-Scale Hypertexts” (Weiss).
98254	A new method for information retrieval, based on the theory of relative concentration This paper introduces a new method for information retrieval of documents that are represented by a vector. The novelty of the algorithm lies in the fact that no (generalized) p-norms are used as a matching function between the query and the document (as is done e.g. by Salton and others) but a function that measures the relative dispersion of the terms between a document and a query. This function originates from an earlier paper of the author where a good measure of relative concentration was introduced, used in informetrics to measure the degree of specialization of a journal w.r.t. the entire subject. This new information retrieval algorithm is shown to have many desirable properties (in the sense of the new Cater-Kraft wish list) including those of the original cosine-matching function of Salton. In addition the property of the cosine-matching function that, if one only uses weights 0 to 1, one is reduced to Boolean IR, is refined in the sense that one takes into consideration the broadness or specialization of a document and a query. Our new matching function satisfies these additional properties.
98255	Extended boolean retrieval: a heuristic approach? We show that the similarity measures for p-norm retrieval, as defined by Salton, Fox and Wu have some undesirable mathematical properties. We propose a new function that remedies some of these drawbacks. Still, even for this new similarity measure the extended Boolean model has some properties which can only be described as 'heuristic'.
2348529	Methods for mining and summarizing text conversations More and more today, people are engaging in conversations via email, blogs, discussion forums, text messaging and other social media. A person may want to archive these conversations and later retrieve information about what was discussed, or analyze a conversation in real-time. What topics are covered in these conversations? What opinions are people expressing? Have any decisions been made? Have action items been assigned? This tutorial will present various natural language processing (NLP) techniques that can help answer these questions, thus creating numerous new and valuable applications that can support people in more effectively participating in these conversation. The tutorial is based on a book that we have recently published, Methods for Mining and Summarizing Text Conversations.
2348528	Beyond bag-of-words: machine learning for query-document matching in web search 
2348526	$100,000 prize jackpot. call now!: identifying the pertinent features of SMS spam Mobile SMS spam is on the rise and is a prevalent problem. While recent work has shown that simple machine learning techniques can distinguish between ham and spam with high accuracy, this paper explores the individual contributions of various textual features in the classification process. Our results reveal the surprising finding that simple is better: using the largest spam corpus of which we are aware, we find that using simple textual features is sufficient to provide accuracy that is nearly identical to that achieved by the best known techniques, while achieving a twofold speedup.
2348524	Want a coffee?: predicting users' trails Twitter and Foursquare are two well-connected platforms for sharing information where growing numbers of users post location-related messages. In contrast to the longitude-latitude geotags commonly used online, e.g., on photos and tweets, new place-tags containing category information show more human-readable high-level information rather than a pair of coordinates. This grants an opportunity for better understanding users' physical locations which can be used as context to facilitate other applications, e.g., location context-aware advertisement. In this paper, we verify the assumption that users' current trails contain cues of their future routes. The results from the preliminary experiments show promising performance of a basic Markov Chain-based model.
2348523	Utilizing inter-document similarities in federated search We demonstrate the merits of using inter-document similarities for federated search. Specifically, we study a results merging method that utilizes information induced from clusters of similar documents created across the lists retrieved from the collections. The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art results merging approaches.
2348522	Using PageRank to infer user preferences Recently, researchers have shown interest in the use of preference judgments for evaluation in IR literature. Although preference judgments have several advantages over absolute judgment, one of the major disadvantages is that the number of judgments needed increases polynomially as the number of documents in the pool increases. We propose a novel method using PageRank to minimize the number of judgments required to evaluate systems using preference judgments. We test the proposed hypotheses using the TREC 2004 to 2006 Terabyte dataset to show that it is possible to reduce the evaluation cost considerably. Further, we study the susceptibility of the methods due to assessor errors.
2348530	Crowdsourcing for search evaluation and social-algorithmic search The first computers were people. Today, Internet-based access to 24/7 online human crowds has led to a renaissance of research in human computation and the advent of crowdsourcing. These new opportunities have brought a disruptive shift to research and practice for how we build intelligent systems today. Not only can labeled data for training and evaluation be collected faster, cheaper, and easier than ever before, but we now see human computation being integrated into the systems themselves, operating in concert with automation. This tutorial introduces opportunities and challenges of human computation and crowdsourcing, particularly for search evaluation and developing hybrid search solutions that integrate human computation with traditional forms of automated search. We review methodology and findings of recent research and survey current generation crowdsourcing platforms now available, analyzing methods, potential, and limitations across platforms.
2348531	(Big) usage data in web search 
2348532	A new look at old tricks: the fertile roots of current research 
2348538	Visual information retrieval using Java and LIRE Visual information retrieval (VIR) is an active and vibrant research area, which attempts at providing means for organizing, indexing, annotating, and retrieving visual information (images and videos) form large, unstructured repositories. The goal of VIR is to retrieve the highest number of relevant matches to a given query (often expressed as an example image and/or a series of keywords). In its early years (1995-2000) the research efforts were dominated by content-based approaches contributed primarily by the image and video processing community. During the past decade, it was widely recognized that the challenges imposed by the semantic gap (the lack of coincidence between an image's visual contents and its semantic interpretation) required a clever use of textual metadata (in addition to information extracted from the image's pixel contents) to make image and video retrieval solutions efficient and effective. The need to bridge (or at least narrow) the semantic gap has been one of the driving forces behind current VIR research. Additionally, other related research problems and market opportunities have started to emerge, offering a broad range of exciting problems for computer scientists and engineers to work on. In this tutorial, we present an overview of visual information retrieval (VIR) concepts, techniques, algorithms, and applications. Several topics are supported by examples written in Java, using Lucene (an open-source Java-based indexing and search implementation) and LIRE (Lucene Image REtrieval), an open-source Java-based library for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) written by Mathias Lux. After motivating the topic, we briefly review the fundamentals of information retrieval, present the most relevant and effective visual descriptors currently used in VIR, the most common indexing approaches for visual descriptors, the most prominent machine learning techniques used in connection with contemporary VIR solutions, as well as the challenges associated with building real-world, large scale VIR solutions, including a brief overview of publicly available datasets used in worldwide challenges, contests, and benchmarks. Throughout the tutorial, we integrate examples using LIRE, whose main features and design principles are also discussed. Finally, we conclude the tutorial with suggestions for deepening the knowledge in the topic, including a brief discussion of the most relevant advances, open challenges, and promising opportunities in VIR and related areas. The tutorial is primarily targeted at experienced Information Retrieval researchers and practitioners interested in extending their knowledge of document-based IR to equivalent concepts, techniques, and challenges in VIR. The acquired knowledge should allow participants to derive insightful conclusions and promising avenues for further investigation.
2348539	Large-scale graph mining and learning for information retrieval For many information retrieval applications, we need to deal with the ranking problem on very large scale graphs. However, it is non-trivial to perform efficient and effective ranking on them. On one aspect, we need to design scalable algorithms. On another aspect, we also need to develop powerful computational infrastructure to support these algorithms. This tutorial aims at giving a timely introduction to the promising advances in the aforementioned aspects in recent years, and providing the audiences with a comprehensive view on the related literature.
2348534	Experimental methods for information retrieval 
2348533	Aspect-based opinion mining from product reviews "What other people think" has always been an important piece of information for most of us during the decision-making process. Today people tend to make their opinions available to other people via the Internet. As a result, the Web has become an excellent source of consumer opinions. There are now numerous Web resources containing such opinions, e.g., product reviews forums, discussion groups, and blogs. But, it is really difficult for a customer to read all of the reviews and make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It is also difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and manage customer opinions. Also, focusing on just user ratings (stars) is not a sufficient source of information for a user or the manufacturer to make decisions. Therefore, mining online reviews (opinion mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction. Extracting aspects and the corresponding ratings is an important challenge in opinion mining. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, e.g. 'zoom' for a digital camera. A rating is an intended interpretation of the user satisfaction in terms of numerical values. Reviewers usually express the rating of an aspect by a set of sentiments, e.g. 'great zoom'. In this tutorial we cover opinion mining in online product reviews with the focus on aspect-based opinion mining. This problem is a key task in the area of opinion mining and has attracted a lot of researchers in the information retrieval community recently. Several opinion related information retrieval tasks can benefit from the results of aspect-based opinion mining and therefore it is considered as a fundamental problem. This tutorial covers not only general opinion mining and retrieval tasks, but also state-of-the-art methods, challenges, applications, and also future research directions of aspect-based opinion mining.
2348536	Patent information retrieval: an instance of domain-specific search The tutorial aims to provide the IR researchers with an understanding of how the patent system works, the challenges that patent searchers face in using the existing tools and in adopting new methods developed in academia. At the same time, the tutorial will inform the IR researcher about the unique opportunities that the patent domain provides: a large amount of multi-lingual and multi-modal documents, the widest possible span of covered domains, a highly annotated corpus and, very importantly, relevance judgements created by experts in the fields and recorded electronically in the documents. The combination of these two objectives leads to the main purpose of the tutorial: to create awareness and to encourage more emphasis on the patent domain in the IR community. Table 1 provides details on how the tutorial covers the topics of the SIGIR conference.
2348535	IR models: foundations and relationships In IR research it is essential to know IR models. Research over the past years has consolidated the foundations of IR models. Moreover, relationships have been reported that help to use and position IR models. Knowing about the foundations and relationships of IR models can significantly improve building information management systems. The first part of this tutorial presents an in-depth consolidation of the foundations of the main IR models (TF-IDF, BM25, LM). Particular attention will be given to notation and probabilistic roots. The second part crystallises the relationships between models. Does LM embody IDF? How "heuristic" is TF-IDF? What are the probabilistic roots? How are LM and the probability of relevance related? What are the components shared by the main IR models? After the tutorial, attendees will be familiar with a consolidated view on IR models. The tutorial will be illustrative and interactive, providing opportunities to exchange controversial issues and research challenges.
2348542	Advances on the development of evaluation measures The goal of the tutorial is to provide attendees with a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the development of information retrieval evaluation measures and discuss the current challenges in the area. A number of topics are covered, including background in traditional evaluation paradigm and traditional evaluation measures, evaluation measures based on user models, advanced models of user interaction with search engines, measures based on these models, measures for novelty and diversity, and session-based measures.
2348540	Query performance prediction for IR The goal of this tutorial is to expose participants to current research on query performance prediction. Participants will become familiar with state-of-the-art performance prediction methods, with common evaluation methodologies of prediction quality, and with potential applications that can utilize performance predictors. In addition, some open issues and challenges in the field will be discussed. This tutorial is an updated version of the SIGIR 2010 tutorial presented by David Carmel and Elad Yom-Tov on the same subject. This year we intend to expand on new results in the field, in particular focusing on recently developed frameworks that provide a unified model for performance prediction.
2348541	Collaborative information seeking: art and science of achieving 1+1&#62;2 in IR The assumption of information seekers being independent and IR problem being individual has been challenged often in the recent past, with an argument that the next big leap in search and retrieval will come through incorporating social and collaborative aspects of information seeking. This half-day tutorial will introduce the student to theories, methodologies, and tools that focus on information retrieval/seeking in collaboration. The student will have an opportunity to learn about the social aspect of IR with a focus on collaborative information seeking (CIS) situations, systems, and evaluation techniques. The course is intended for those interested in social and collaborative aspects of IR (from both academia and industry), and requires only a general understanding of IR systems and evaluation.
2348502	Parallelizing ListNet training using spark As ever-larger training sets for learning to rank are created, scalability of learning has become increasingly important to achieving continuing improvements in ranking accuracy. Exploiting independence of "summation form" computations, we show how each iteration in ListNet gradient descent can benefit from parallel execution. We seek to draw the attention of the IR community to use Spark, a newly introduced distributed cluster computing system, for reducing training time of iterative learning to rank algorithms. Unlike MapReduce, Spark is especially suited for iterative and interactive algorithms. Our results show near linear reduction in ListNet training time using Spark on Amazon EC2 clusters.
2348503	Predicting lifespans of popular tweets in microblog In microblog like Twitter, popular tweets are usually retweeted by many users. For different tweets, their lifespans (i.e., how long they will stay popular) vary. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to predict the lifespans of popular tweets based on their static characteristics and dynamic retweeting patterns. For a potentially popular tweet, we generate a time series based on its first-hour retweeting information, and compare it with those of historic tweets of the same author and post time (at the granularity of hour). The top-k historic tweets are identified, whose mean lifespan is estimated as the lifespan of the new tweet. Our experiments on a three-month real data set from Tencent Microblog demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
2348500	Optimizing parameters of the expected reciprocal rank Most popular IR metrics are parameterized. Usually parameters of these metrics are chosen on the basis of general considerations and not adjusted by experiments with real users. Particularly, the parameters of the Expected Reciprocal Rank measure are the normalized parameters of the DCG metric, and the latter are chosen in an ad-hoc manner. We suggest an approach for adjusting parameters of the ERR metric that allows to reach maximum agreement with the real users behavior. More exactly, we optimized the parameters by maximizing Pearson weighted correlation between ERR and several online click metrics. For each click metric we managed to find the parameters of ERR that result into its higher correlation with the given online click metric.
2348501	Ousting ivory tower research: towards a web framework for providing experiments as a service With its close ties to the Web, the IR community is destined to leverage the dissemination and collaboration capabilities that the Web provides today. Especially with the advent of the software as a service principle, an IR community is conceivable that publishes experiments executable by anyone over the Web. A review of recent SIGIR papers shows that we are far away from this vision of collaboration. The benefits of publishing IR experiments as a service are striking for the community as a whole, and include potential to boost research profiles and reputation. However, the additional work must be kept to a minimum and sensitive data must be kept private for this paradigm to become an accepted practice. To foster experiments as a service in IR, we present a Web framework for experiments that addresses the outlined challenges and possesses a unique set of compelling features in comparison to existing solutions. We also describe how our reference implementation is already used officially as an evaluation platform for an established international plagiarism detection competition.
2348506	Retrieval evaluation on focused tasks Ranking of retrieval systems for focused tasks requires large number of relevance judgments. We propose an approach that minimizes the number of relevance judgments, where the performance measures are approximated using a Monte-Carlo sampling technique. Partial measures are taken using relevance judgments, whereas the remaining part of passages are annotated using a generated relevance probability distribution based on result rank. We define two conditions for stopping the assessment procedure when the ranking between systems is stable.
2348507	Rewarding term location information to enhance probabilistic information retrieval We investigate the effect of rewarding terms according to their locations in documents for probabilistic information retrieval. The intuition behind our approach is that a large amount of authors would summarize their ideas in some particular parts of documents. In this paper, we focus on the beginning part of documents. Several shape functions are defined to simulate the influence of term location information. We propose a Reward Term Retrieval model that combines the reward terms' information with BM25 to enhance probabilistic information retrieval performance.
2348504	Preliminary study of technical terminology for the retrieval of scientific book metadata records Books only represented by brief metadata (book records) are particularly hard to retrieve. One way of improving their retrieval is by extracting retrieval enhancing features from them. This work focusses on scientific (physics) book records. We ask if their technical terminology can be used as a retrieval enhancing feature. A study of 18,443 book records shows a strong correlation between their technical terminology and their likelihood of relevance. Using this finding for retrieval yields &#62;+5% precision and recall gains.
2348508	Scheduling queries across replicas For increased efficiency, an information retrieval system can split its index into multiple shards, and then replicate these shards across many query servers. For each new query, an appropriate replica for each shard must be selected, such that the query is answered as quickly as possible. Typically, the replica with the lowest number of queued queries is selected. However, not every query takes the same time to execute, particularly if a dynamic pruning strategy is applied by each query server. Hence, the replica's queue length is an inaccurate indicator of the workload of a replica, and can result in inefficient usage of the replicas. In this work, we propose that improved replica selection can be obtained by using query efficiency prediction to measure the expected workload of a replica. Experiments are conducted using 2.2k queries, over various numbers of shards and replicas for the large GOV2 collection. Our results show that query waiting and completion times can be markedly reduced, showing that accurate response time predictions can improve scheduling accuracy and attesting the benefit of the proposed scheduling algorithm.
2348509	Re-examining search result snippet examination time for relevance estimation Previous studies of web search result examination have provided valuable insights in understanding and modelling searcher behavior. Yet, recent work (e.g., [3]) has been developed based on the assumption that the time a searcher spends examining a particular result abstract or snippet, correlates with result relevance. While this idea is intuitively attractive, to the best of our knowledge it has not been empirically tested. This poster investigates this hypothesis empirically, in a controlled setting, using eye tracking equipment to compare search result examination time with result relevance. Interestingly, while we replicate previous findings showing examination time to be indicative of whole-page relevance, we find that viewing time of individual results alone is a poor indicator of either absolute result relevance or even of pairwise preferences. Our results should not be taken as negating the usefulness of modeling searcher examination behavior, but rather to emphasize that snippet examination time is not in itself a good indicator of relevance.
2348510	Sentiment identification by incorporating syntax, semantics and context information This paper proposes a method based on conditional random fields to incorporate sentence structure (syntax and semantics) and context information to identify sentiments of sentences within a document. It also proposes and evaluates two different active learning strategies for labeling sentiment data. The experiments with the proposed approach demonstrate a 5-15% improvement in accuracy on Amazon customer reviews compared to existing supervised learning and rule-based methods.
2348512	Summarizing the differences from microblogs With the rapid growth of social media websites, microblogging has become a popular way to spread instant news and events. Due to the dynamic and social nature of microblogs, extracting useful information from microblogs is more challenging than from the traditional news articles. In this paper we study the problem of summarizing the differences from microblogs. Given a collection of microblogs discussing an event/topic, we propose to generate a short summary delivering the differences among these microblogs, such as the different points of view for a news topic and the changes and evolution of an ongoing event.
2348513	Survival analysis of click logs Click logs from search engines provide a rich opportunity to acquire implicit feedback from users. Patterns derived from the time between a posted query and a click provide information on the ranking quality, reflecting the perceived relevance of a retrieved URL. This paper applies the Kaplan-Meier estimator to study click patterns. The visualization of click curves demonstrates the interaction between the relevance and the rank position of URLs. The observed results demonstrate the potential of using click curves to predict the quality of the top-ranked results.
2348515	Time to judge relevance as an indicator of assessor error When human assessors judge documents for their relevance to a search topic, it is possible for errors in judging to occur. As part of the analysis of the data collected from a 48 participant user study, we have discovered that when the participants made relevance judgments, the average participant spent more time to make errorful judgments than to make correct judgments. Thus, in relevance assessing scenarios similar to our user study, it may be possible to use the time taken to judge a document as an indicator of assessor error. Such an indicator could be used to identify documents that are candidates for adjudication or reassessment.
2348516	Towards alias detection without string similarity: an active learning based approach Entity aliases commonly exist and accurately detecting these aliases plays a vital role in various applications. In this paper, we use an active-learning-based method to detect aliases without string similarity. To minimize the cost on pairwise comparison, a subset-based method restricts the alias selection within a small-scale entity set. Within each generated entity set, an active learning based logistic regression classifier is employed to predict whether a candidate is the alias of a given entity. The experimental results on three datasets clearly demonstrate that our proposed approach can effectively detect this kind of entity aliases.
2348517	Towards zero-click mobile IR evaluation: knowing what and knowing when In this poster, we propose two evaluation tasks for mobile information access. The first task evaluates the system's ability to guess what the user's query should be given a context ("Knowing What"). The second task evaluates the system's ability to decide when to proactively deploy a given query ("Knowing When"). We conduct a preliminary manual analysis of a mobile query log to limit the space of possible queries so as to design feasible and practical evaluation tasks.
2348415	A knowledge-based approach for summarising opinions Automatic Document Summarisation plays a central role in the process of providing the user with a quick access to information. Applications range from the generation of news headlines, to the aggregation of opinions extracted from reviews. Traditional topic-based summarisation systems are not always able to capture the sentiments expressed in a review. Major efforts in sentiment analysis have been put in the tasks of mining and classifying reviews according to their polarity. In this research, we investigate the use of summarisation techniques applied to reviews, and we propose a knowledge-based approach to summarisation, in the context of sentiment analysis. The proposed research is focused on three different aspects. Firstly, we investigate the application of summarisation techniques to sentiment classification. Capturing the key passage of a review can be beneficial for both a sentiment classifier, and for a user who could potentially understand the polarity of a review without reading the full text. Secondly, we investigate how to combine knowledge extracted from the reviews or integrated from external sources, with the purpose of producing opinion-oriented summaries. Thirdly, we analyse the possibility of generating personalised (user-oriented or query-biased) opinion-based summaries.
2348418	Building reputation and trust using federated search and opinion mining The term online reputation addresses trust relationships amongst agents in dynamic open systems. These can appear as ratings, recommendations, referrals and feedback. Several reputation models and rating aggregation algorithms have been proposed. However, finding a trusted entity on the web is still an issue as all reputation systems work individually. The aim of this project is to introduce a global reputation system for electronic product reviews that aggregates people's opinions from different resources (e.g. e-commerce websites, and review) with the help federated search techniques and generate a high quality and trusted result. The first step is to choose a range of product review collections from e-commerce review systems (e.g. Amazon), online review sites (e.g. Epinions), social networks (e.g. Facebook), question and answering sites (e.g. Yahoo! Answers), and blog (e.g. My Nokia Blog) resources. By using a federated search approach the query (product name) will be broadcasted to the selected resources and the result will be a list of reputation data with various formats including star rating, text reviews, voting, video, and so on. The focus of this work is on review text data and star ratings. A number of challenges including comparison issues (e.g. scale of star ratings: five-star vs. ten-star), hierarchical reviews (e.g. comments about reviews), choice of resources (e.g. choosing relevant sources deepens upon query), display issue (e.g. easy for the user), generalization issue (e.g. apply it on other domains), synchronization problem (e.g. generate up-to-date results), and high quality and trusted reviews will be addressed. A sentiment analysis approach is subsequently used to extract high quality opinions and inform how to increase trust in the search result. The extracted opinions will be used to generate facets for the global reputation system.
2348419	Enhancing knowledge base with knowledge transfer A Knowledge Base (KB) stores, organizes, and shares information pertinent to entities (i.e. KB nodes) such as people, organizations, and events. A large KB system, such as Wikipedia, relies on human curators to create and maintain the content in the systems. However, it has become challenging for human curators to sift through the rapidly growing amount of information and filter out the information irrelevant to a KB node. The area of Knowledge Base Enhancement (KBE) aims to explore and identify automatic methods to assist human curators to accelerate the process. KBE can be viewed as a special case of Information Filtering (IF). However, the lack of high-quality labelled data introduces a major challenge to train a satisfying model for the task. Transfer learning provides solutions to the problem and has explored applications in the area of text mining, whereas direct application to KBE or IF remains absent. Transfer learning is a research area in machine learning, emphasizing the reuse of previously acquired knowledge to another applicable task. The method is particularly useful in the situations where labeled instances are absent or difficult to obtain. To accelerate the growth of a KB, a transfer learning approach enables leveraging the heuristics and models learned from one KB node to another. For example, reusing the learned filtering models from Willie Nelson, a famous country singer, to Eddie Rabbitt, another country singer. Transfer learning requires three components: the target task (e.g. the problem to be solved), the source task(s) (e.g. auxiliary data, previously studied problem), and criteria to select appropriate source tasks. The objectives of my dissertation are twofold. First, it explores methods to identify informative source nodes from which to transfer. Second, it constructs a knowledge transfer network to represent the transfer learning relationship between KB nodes. This proposed research applies a transfer learning method -- Segmented Transfer (ST) -- and a knowledge representation -- Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN) -- to approach the area of KBE. The primary research questions include: What are the transferable objects in information filtering algorithms? What are the KB nodes of high transferability? What are the factors that determine the transfer learning relationship? Does it manifest on a knowledge transfer network representation? This interdisciplinary research crosses the study area of information filtering, machine learning, knowledge representation, and network analysis. This proposal motivates the problem of KBE, discusses the research methodology and proposed experiments, and reviews related works in information filtering and transfer learning. This line of research hopes to extend the application of transfer learning to KBE and to explore a new dimension of IF. The proposed ST and KTN intends to bring interdisciplinary approaches in the emerging field of KBE.
2348416	Adaptive IR for exploratory search support Most Information Retrieval (IR) software is designed to fit a general user where users are submitting queries and the retrieval system returns a ranked list of results. Regardless of the user, the query always returns the same list of results. Individual aspects like age, gender, profession or experience are often not taken into account, for example the difference in searching between children and adults. Although long challenged by works such as Bates' berrypicking model [1], common systems still assume that the user has a static information need which remains unchanged during the seeking process. Moreover many systems are strongly optimized for lookup searches, expecting that the user is only interested in facts and not in complex problem solving. But in many everyday situations people search for information to gain knowledge which allows them to fulfill a specific work task (e.g., [3]), like answering research questions, investigating for a publication or thesis, comparing different products or learning a language. Such complex tasks can be divided into sub-tasks and generally include multiple exploratory search sessions, in which the user strongly interacts with the system. This is a longitudinal process where the searcher necessarily gathers, collects, aggregates, interprets, processes, and evaluates information objects from one or more sources. In such complex search scenarios all three activities lookup, learn, and investigate are used in conjunction with one another to bridge the users knowledge gap [2]. In each step of this process, the user faces a new situation in which knowledge and information need changes. This inuences the relevance of information objects and may direct the user to different topics, domains, or also tasks. The goal of this research is to effectively assist at fulfilling complex (work) tasks consisting of multi-session exploratory search activities. To achieve this, information retrieval needs personalization and has to close the gaps between the different search sessions. This can be done by enabling the user to collect information objects into a personal reference library and visualizing past search activities in a kind of breadcrumb or time line. Thinking one step further, a personalized IR system (PIR) has to adapt to relevant factors and commit itself to the specific user and the personal search behavior. This means the system needs to guide the user through the searching process, suggesting useful search actions like effective search strategies or query formulations and has to recommend information objects relevant to the work task and the users current situation. Thereby the system has to be aware of the user and specific contextual circumstances. General information about the user like gender or age can be fetched explicitly, allowing to adapt in a more coarse grained way (i.e. decide the way of presenting results based on the user group). Moreover integrating used applications or providing other ways to let the user explicitly manage tasks will help to understand the goal of the users search activities and will provide much better ways of user assistance. To close the gap between user and system, both behavioral and contextual information are necessary. Information about the search behavior and indirectly the users knowledge and expertise can be conveyed by logging (e.g. query logs) and examining system interactions. The fetched data should be made transparent to the user, showing what kind of information has been gathered so far. The implicit information has to be refined with other contextual information collected implicitly from different interfaces or sensors (e.g. time, location) and explicitly by direct user input from e.g. relevance feedback interactions. This will allow a more fine grained way of system adaption and offers new options in assisting the user during the long-term search activities showing personalized search strategies and possible next steps appropriate to the information need and level of experience.
2348417	Adversarial content manipulation effects We address a question that has been somewhat overlooked throughout the transition from classical ad hoc retrieval to Web search: how is the performance of classical retrieval approaches affected by the presence of content manipulation? Our initial experiments have shown that the relative performance patterns of some classical retrieval strategies might change in the transition from non-manipulated to manipulated corpora. A natural future venue to explore is how to mix these strategies and make (some of) them more robust under presumed content manipulation conditions.
2348411	A utility-theoretic ranking method for semi-automated text classification In Semi-Automated Text Classification (SATC) an automatic classifier F labels a set of unlabelled documents D, following which a human annotator inspects (and corrects when appropriate) the labels attributed by F to a subset D' of D, with the aim of improving the overall quality of the labelling. An automated system can support this process by ranking the automatically labelled documents in a way that maximizes the expected increase in effectiveness that derives from inspecting D. An obvious strategy is to rank D so that the documents that F has classified with the lowest confidence are top-ranked. In this work we show that this strategy is suboptimal. We develop a new utility-theoretic ranking method based on the notion of inspection gain, defined as the improvement in classification effectiveness that would derive by inspecting and correcting a given automatically labelled document. We also propose a new effectiveness measure for SATC-oriented ranking methods, based on the expected reduction in classification error brought about by partially inspecting a list generated by a given ranking method. We report the results of experiments showing that, with respect to the baseline method above, and according to the proposed measure, our ranking method can achieve substantially higher expected reductions in classification error.
2348410	Confidence-aware graph regularization with heterogeneous pairwise features Conventional classification methods tend to focus on features of individual objects, while missing out on potentially valuable pairwise features that capture the relationships between objects. Although recent developments on graph regularization exploit this aspect, existing works generally assume only a single kind of pairwise feature, which is often insufficient. We observe that multiple, heterogeneous pairwise features can often complement each other and are generally more robust in modeling the relationships between objects. Furthermore, as some objects are easier to classify than others, objects with higher initial classification confidence should be weighed more towards classifying related but more ambiguous objects, an observation missing from previous graph regularization techniques. In this paper, we propose a Dirichlet-based regularization framework that supports the combination of heterogeneous pairwise features with confidence-aware prediction using limited labeled training data. Next, we showcase a few applications of our framework in information retrieval, focusing on the problem of query intent classification. Finally, we demonstrate through a series of experiments the advantages of our framework on a large-scale real-world dataset.
2348406	Extending BM25 with multiple query operators Traditional probabilistic relevance frameworks for informational retrieval refrain from taking positional information into account, due to the hurdles of developing a sound model while avoiding an explosion in the number of parameters. Nonetheless, the well-known BM25F extension of the successful Okapi ranking function can be seen as an embryonic attempt in that direction. In this paper, we proceed along the same line, defining the notion of virtual region: a virtual region is a part of the document that, like a BM25F-field, can provide a (larger or smaller, depending on a tunable weighting parameter) evidence of relevance of the document; differently from BM25F fields, though, virtual regions are generated implicitly by applying suitable (usually, but not necessarily, positional-aware) operators to the query. This technique fits nicely in the eliteness model behind BM25 and provides a principled explanation to BM25F; it specializes to BM25(F) for some trivial operators, but has a much more general appeal. Our experiments (both on standard collections, such as TREC, and on Web-like repertoires) show that the use of virtual regions is beneficial for retrieval effectiveness.
2348407	Rhetorical relations for information retrieval Typically, every part in most coherent text has some plausible reason for its presence, some function that it performs to the overall semantics of the text. Rhetorical relations, e.g. contrast, cause, explanation, describe how the parts of a text are linked to each other. Knowledge about this so-called discourse structure has been applied successfully to several natural language processing tasks. This work studies the use of rhetorical relations for Information Retrieval (IR): Is there a correlation between certain rhetorical relations and retrieval performance? Can knowledge about a document's rhetorical relations be useful to IR? We present a language model modification that considers rhetorical relations when estimating the relevance of a document to a query. Empirical evaluation of different versions of our model on TREC settings shows that certain rhetorical relations can benefit retrieval effectiveness notably (&gt;10% in mean average precision over a state-of-the-art baseline).
2348438	RDF Xpress: a flexible expressive RDF search engine We demonstrate RDF Xpress, a search engine that enables users to effectively retrieve information from large RDF knowledge bases or Linked Data Sources. RDF Xpress provides a search interface where users can combine triple patterns with keywords to form queries. Moreover, RDF Xpress supports automatic query relaxation and returns a ranked list of diverse query results.
2348439	Sketch-based image similarity search with a pen and paper interface We present a novel and innovative user interface for query-by-sketching based image retrieval that exploits emergent interactive paper and digital pen technology. Users can draw sketches with a digital pen on interactive paper in a user-friendly way. The pen is able to capture the stroke vectors and to interactively stream them to the underlying content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system via the pen's Bluetooth interface. We present the integration of interactive paper/digital pen technology with QbS, our CBIR system tailored to Query-by-Sketching, and we demonstrate the use of the paper and pen interface together with QbS for three different collections: MIRFLICKR-25K, a cartoon collection, and a collection of medieval paper watermarks.
2348436	Pictune: situational music recommendation from geotagged pictures 
2348434	myDJ: recommending karaoke songs from one's own voice In this demo, we present myDJ, a karaoke recommendation system which recommends the songs people are capable to sing. Different from the existing song recommendation systems which recommend songs people like to listen, myDJ can recommend proper songs according to a subject's physical phonation area. It consists of a singer profiler to analyze the subject's phonation characters. In addition, the song profile for each song in database is extracted. To learn a ranking function, the learning to rank algorithm Listnet is applied under a list of predefined features extracted from each singer-song profile pair. In the results, proper songs which are suitable but challenging for the subject are recommended.
2348435	PageFetch: a retrieval game for children (and adults) Children often struggle with information retrieval tasks as searching for information often requires a developed vocabulary and strong categorisation skills; neither of which are particularly developed in children under the age of 12. In a study conducted by Druin et al, it was found that in an experimental setting many children are often uninterested in searching for information online or are only interested in searching for information that is relevant to their personal interests. Consequently, children who were unmotivated were the least successful in completing information retrieval tasks in their study. It was suggested that a more effective means of engaging child participants in search studies must be developed in order to gain further insights into the searching behaviours of children. To this end we have developed a game called PageFetch which aims to engage children (aged 8 to 80) in completing search tasks through a fun and interactive search-like interface.
2348433	MaSe: create your own mash-up search interface MaSe provides a sandbox environment for high school students to create their own personalised search interface. It has been designed with two major goals in mind: (1) as a hands-on tutorial for school children, to excite them about programming and computing science through the development of a practical application, and (2) to enable children to design and create their own search interface without extensive programming knowledge or prior experience. Consequently, MaSe provides a way to ascertain what children would like from a search engine interface in an exploratory and creative way as they can create a working prototype. This approach contrasts with previous work on exploring children's requirements of IR systems which attempts to directly elicit user needs through more traditional methods (i.e. surveys, interviews, focus groups, etc). However, we have attempted to incorporate the design guidelines for children as identified by Large (2006) into MaSe, where: we make use of bright colours, large text fonts, spell checking and the use of icons to represent search services, as well as including a thematic experience as suggested by Large (2006), with the use of a puppy avatar and puppy dog footprints.
2348432	Integrative online research-data management In support of our research projects in information retrieval, we have developed an integrated multi-process software system that shepherds research data from induction through aggregation, analysis, and presentation. We combine public-domain code libraries with our own software to provide a flexible, easily- configured modular system that exposes data online for easier collaboration. The goal is to create a single online infrastructure that allows colleagues to submit, process, analyze and visualize data, and discuss and prioritize issues through a single integrated interface. We demonstrate our system within the context of the large data set provided by the Indexer's Legacy project [1].
2348431	Distilling and exploring nuggets from a corpus This paper describes a live and scalable system that automatically extracts information nuggets for entities/topics from a continuously updated corpus for effective exploration and analysis. A nugget is a piece of semantic information that (1) must be mapped semantically to the transitive closure of a pre-defined ontology, (2) is explicitly supported by text, and (3) has a natural language description that completely conveys its semantic to a user. Fig. 1 shows a type of nugget "involvement in events" for a person entity (Leon Panetta): each nugget has a short description ("meeting", "news conference") with a list of supporting passages. Our key contributions are (1) We extract nuggets and remove redundancy to produce a summary of salient information with supporting clusters of passages. (2) We present an entity/topic centric exploration interface that also allows users to navigate to other entities involved in a nugget. (3) We use the statistical NLP technologies developed over the years in the ACE ,GALE and TAC-KBP programs, including parsing, mention detection, within and cross document coreference resolution, relation detection and slot filler extraction. (4) Our system is flexible and easily adaptable across domains as demonstrated on two corpora: generic news and scientific papers. Search engines such as Google News and Scholar do not retrieve nuggets, and only remove redundancy at document level. News aggregation applications such as Evri categorize news articles based on the entities of topics but do not extract nuggets. Other systems extract richer information, but not all of it has clear semantics; e.g., Silobreaker presents results as "the relationship between X and Y in the context of [keyphrase]", leaving users with the task of interpreting the semantics as it is not tied to a clear ontology. In contrast we remove redundancy, summarize results and present nuggets that have clear semantics.
2348430	CrowdTerrier: automatic crowdsourced relevance assessments with terrier In this demo, we present CrowdTerrier, an infrastructure extension to the open source Terrier IR platform that enables the semi-automatic generation of relevance assessments for a variety of document ranking tasks using crowdsourcing. The aim of CrowdTerrier is to reduce the time and expertise required to effectively Crowdsource relevance assessments by abstracting away from the complexities of the crowdsourcing process. It achieves this by automating the assessment process as much as possible, via a close integration of the IR system that ranks the documents (Terrier) and the crowdsourcing marketplace that is used to assess those documents (Amazon's Mechanical Turk).
2348427	A visual tool for bayesian data analysis: the impact of smoothing on naive bayes text classifiers Naive-Bayes (NB) classifiers are simple probabilistic classifiers still widely used in supervised learning due to their tradeoff between efficient model training and good empirical results. One of the drawbacks of these classifiers is that in situations of data sparsity (i.e. when the size of training set is small) the maximum likelihood estimation of the probability of unseen features in these situations is equal to zero causing arithmetic anomalies. To prevent this undesirable behavior, a number of smoothing techniques have been proposed. Among these, the Bayesian approach incorporates smoothing in terms of prior knowledge about the parameters of the model usually called hyper-parameters. Our research question is: can a visualization tool help researchers to quickly assess the goodness of the performance of NB classifiers by setting optimal smoothing parameters?
2348428	ALF: a client side logger and server for capturing user interactions in web applications This demonstration paper introduces ALF which provides a light-weight client side logging application and a server for collecting user interaction data. ALF has been designed as a loosely coupled independent service that runs in parallel with the IR web application that requires logging
2348429	ChatNoir: a search engine for the ClueWeb09 corpus We present the ChatNoir search engine which indexes the entire English part of the ClueWeb09 corpus. Besides Carnegie Mellon's Indri system, ChatNoir is the second publicly available search engine for this corpus. It implements the classic BM25F information retrieval model including PageRank and spam likelihood. The search engine is scalable and returns the first results within three seconds, which is significantly faster than Indri. A convenient API allows for implementing reproducible experiments based on retrieving documents from the ClueWeb09 corpus. The search engine has successfully accomplished a load test involving 100,000 queries.
2348423	Exploiting temporal topic models in social media retrieval Many of user generated contents in the Web 2.0 center around real-world incidents such as Japanese tsunami, or general concerns such as recent economic downturn. Such type of information is always of interest to users. For instance, when a user reads a news article about a tsunami in Japan, she wants to see related Flickr photos or more tweets about it. Conventional keyword-based search is inappropriate, since it is not always trivial to formulate ad-hoc interests about the event and material. In some cases, the user might want to explore emerging topics that dominate different sources. Present systems fail to connect topically documents across media, and the user has to examine individual sources to infer the topics herself. In this work, we address a special type of user information need, temporal topic, which refers to any abstract matter active within some points or periods of time. A temporal topic can be a real-world event, e.g. the Arab Spring revolution, but can also be a less conceivable subject, e.g. the study of vacuum tube computers in 1950s. Topics can also be recurrent such as the US presidency campaigns. There are extensive studies on how to detect topics from a collection of documents, but little uses temporal topics as part of user interest to retrieve documents. We believe that temporal topic-based retrieval is a one solution to improve user experience of present IR systems, as well as to benefit other applications (e.g. topic-sensitive online advertisement). Our research goal can be defined in three research questions. The first question involves finding latent temporal topics in a social media stream, where documents are well equipped with meta-data (timestamps, geo-spatial data, etc.). Following mixture models such as LDA, we treat each document as a mix of different temporal topic models, each model is incorporated with time. A temporal topic consists of at least two types of attributes - time and representing words, as similar to [4]. The dynamics of temporal topics can be characterized in a timeline fashion [4], or using hierarchical structures [1]. The challenge lies in devising a model flexible enough to diverse and rapidly changing data without many parameter assumptions. For this, we see Bayesian nonpara-metrics [3] as one promising solution, and will extend it to temporal dimension. The second research question is how to retrieve and rank documents from different social media sites, based on their relevance to one or several given temporal topics. We identify some following challenges. The first one is representing temporal topics as queries: although there have been attempts using keywords and time window separately [2], we aim to unify time and (topical) words in a single query model. The second challenge is integrating temporal topic models into ranking models. Inspired by our previous work [4], we will use language models to capture the relevance scores between documents and topics, and investigate advanced methods to index the scores effectively. Our last question involves connecting a given document to documents in other sources (data streams or corpora) that shared one of its latent temporal topics. This task does not only provide unified insight into different social media sites, but also help improve the quality of models by data in diverse sources. However, formalizing the semantics of "similarity" for documents in different settings based on temporal topcis is tricky. One baseline method is to apply Kullback-Leibler divergence on comparable features (TF-IDF, n-grams, photo tags, timestamps,..). We can also use language models [5] to construct a language model for each candidate document, then estimate how likely it generates the document of interest within a given temporal topic.
2348424	The essence of time: considering temporal relevance as an intent-aware ranking problem Real-time news and social media quickly reflect large-scale phenomena and events. As users become exposed to this information, time plays a central role in prompting both information authorship and seeking activities. The objective of this research is to develop a retrieval system which can anticipate a user's likely temporal intent(s), considering recent or ongoing real-world events. Such a system should not only provide recent news when relevant, but also higher rank non-timestamped or even older documents which are temporally pertinent as they cover aspects related to recent event topics. Key challenges to be addressed in this work include: a suitable source and method for event detection and tracking, an intent-aware ranking approach and an evaluation methodology.
2348426	A framework for manipulating and searching multiple retrieval types Conventional retrieval systems view documents as a unit and look at different retrieval types within a document. We introduce Proteus, a frame-work for seamlessly navigating books as dynamic collections which are defined on the fly. Proteus allows us to search various retrieval types. Navigable types include pages, books, named persons, locations, and pictures in a collection of books taken from the Internet Archive. The demonstration shows the value of multi-type browsing in dynamic collections to peruse new data.
2348420	Improving e-discovery using information retrieval E-discovery is the requirement that the documents and information in electronic form stored in corporate systems be produced as evidence in litigation. It has posed great challenges for legal experts. Legal searchers have always looked to find "any and all" evidence for a given case. Thus, a legal search system would essentially be a recall-oriented system. It has been a common practice among expert searchers to formulate Boolean queries to represent their information need. We want to work on three basic problems: Boolean query formulation - Our primary goal is to study Boolean query formulation in the light of the E-discovery task. This will include automatic Boolean query generation, expansion and learning the effect of proximity operators in Boolean searches. Data fusion - We would also like to explore the effectiveness of data fusion techniques in improving recall. Error modeling - Finally, we will work on error modeling methods for noisy legal documents.
2348422	Relevance as a subjective and situational multidimensional concept Relevance is the central concept of information retrieval. Although its important role is unanimously accepted among researchers, numerous different definitions of the term have emerged over the years. Considerable effort has been put into creating consistent and universally applicable descriptions of relevance in the form of relevance frameworks. Across these various formal systems of relevance, a wide range of relevance criteria has been identified. The probably most frequently used single criterion, that in some applications even becomes a synonym for relevance, is topicality. It expresses a document's topical overlap with the user's information need. For textual resources, it is often estimated based on term co-occurrences between query and document. There is, however, a significant number of further noteworthy relevance criteria. Prominent specimen are: (Currency) determines how recent and up to date the document is. Outdated information may have become invalid over time. (Availability) expresses how easy it is to obtain the document. Users might not want to invest more than a threshold amount of resources (e.g., disk space, downloading time or money) to get the document. (Readability) describes the document's readability and understandability. A document with a high topical relevance towards a given information need can become irrelevant if the user is not able to extract the desired information from it. (Credibility) contains criteria such as the document author's expertise, the publication's reputation and the document's general trustworthiness. (Novelty) describes the document's contribution to satisfying an information need with respect to the user's context. E.g., previous search results or general knowledge about the domain. It is evident that these criteria can have very different scopes. Some of them are static characteristics of the document or the author, others depend on the concrete information need at hand or even the user's search context. Currently, state-of-the-art retrieval models often treat relevance (regardless which interpretation of the term was chosen) as an atomic concept that can be expressed through topical overlap between document and query or a plain linear combination of multiple scores. Considering the broad audiences a web search engine has to serve, such a method does not seem optimal as the concrete composition of relevance will vary from person to person depending on social and educational context. Furthermore, each individual can be expected to have situational preference for certain combinations of relevance facets depending on the information need at hand. We investigate combination schemes which respect the dimension-specific relevance distributions. In particular, we developed a risk-aware method of combining relevance criteria inspired by the economic Portfolio theory. As a first stage, we applied this method for result set diversification across dimensions.
2348421	Opinion influence and diffusion in social network Nowadays, more and more people tend to make decisions based on the opinion information from the Internet, in addition to recommendations from offline friends or parents. For example, we may browse the resumes and comments on election candidates to determine if one candidate is qualified, or consult the consumer reports or reviews on special e-commercial websites to decide which brand of computer is suitable for one's needs. Though opinion information is rich on the Internet, [2] points out that 58% of American Internet users deem that online information is irretrievable, confusing, or conflicting with each other. Early works on opinion mining help to classify opinion polarity, to extract specific opinions and to summarize opinion texts. However, all these works are usually based on plain texts (reviews, comments or news articles). With the explosion of Web 2.0 applications, especially social network applications like blogs, discussion forums, micro-blogs, the massive individual users go to the major media websites, which leads to much more opinion materials posted on the Internet by user-shared experiences or views [3]. These opinion-rich and social network-based applications bring new perspectives for opinion mining as well. First, in addition to plain texts (reviews, newswire) in traditional opinion mining, we see new types of cyber-based text, like personal diary blogs, cyber-SMS tweets. Second, if we regard the opinions in plain text as static, the dynamic change of opinions in the social network is a new promising area, and catch increasing attention of worldwide researchers. In the social network, the opinion held by one individual is not static, but changes, which can be influenced by others. A serial of changes among different users forms the opinion propagation or diffusion in the network. This paper and my doctoral work focus on the opinion influence and diffusion in the social network, which explore the detailed process of one-to-one influence and the opinion diffusion process in the social network. The significance of this work is it can benefit many other related researches, like information maximum, viral marketing. Now some pioneering works have been conducted to investigate the role of social networks in information diffusion and influencers in the social network. These works are usually based on information diffusion models, like the cascade model (CM) or epidemic model (EM). However, we argue that it is not enough to simply apply these models to opinion influence and diffusion. 1) For both CM and EM, status shift is along specific directions, from inactive to active (CM) or from susceptible to infectious, and then, to recovered (EM). But opinion influence is more complex.
2348490	Lightweight contrastive summarization for news comment mining We develop and discuss a news comment miner that presents distinct viewpoints on a given theme or event. Given a query, the system uses metasearch techniques to find relevant news articles. Relevant articles are then scraped for both article content and comments. Snippets from the comments are sampled and presented to the user, based on theme popularity and contrastiveness to previously selected snippets. The system design focuses on being quicker and more lightweight than recent topic modelling approaches, while still focusing on selecting orthogonal snippets.
2348493	New assessment criteria for query suggestion Query suggestion is a useful tool to help users express their information needs by supplying alternative queries. When evaluating the effectiveness of query suggestion algorithms, many previous studies focus on measuring whether a suggestion query is relevant or not to the input query. This assessment criterion is too simple to describe users' requirements. In this paper, we introduce two scenarios of query suggestion. The first scenario represents cases where the search result of the input query is unsatisfactory. The second scenario represents cases where the search result is satisfactory but the user may be looking for alternative solutions. Based on the two scenarios, we propose two assessment criteria. Our labeling results indicate that the new assessment criteria provide finer distinctions among query suggestions than the traditional relevance-based criterion.
2348492	Making results fit into 40 characters: a study in document rewriting With the increasing popularity of mobile and hand-held devices, automatic approaches for adapting results to the limited screen size of mobile devices are becoming more important. Traditional approaches for reducing the length of textual results include summarization and snippet extraction. In this study, we investigate document rewriting techniques which retain the meaning and readability of the original text. Evaluations on different document sets show that i) rewriting documents considerably reduces document length and thus, scrolling effort on devices with limited screen size, and ii) the rewritten documents have a higher readability.
2348494	On automatically tagging web documents from examples An emerging need in information retrieval is to identify a set of documents conforming to an abstract description. This task presents two major challenges to existing methods of document retrieval and classification. First, similarity based on overall content is less effective because there may be great variance in both content and subject of documents produced for similar functions, e.g. a presidential speech or a government ministry white paper. Second, the function of the document can be defined based on user interests or the specific data set through a set of existing examples, which cannot be described with standard categories. Additionally, the increasing volume and complexity of document collections demands new scalable computational solutions. We conducted a case study using web-archived data from the Latin American Government Documents Archive (LAGDA) to illustrate these problems and challenges. We propose a new hybrid approach based on Na&#239;ve Bayes inference that uses mixed n-gram models obtained from a training set to classify documents in the corpus. The approach has been developed to exploit parallel processing for large scale data set. The preliminary work shows promising results with improved accuracy for this type of retrieval problem.
2348497	On the mathematical relationship between expected n-call@k and the relevance vs. diversity trade-off It has been previously noted that optimization of the n-call@k relevance objective (i.e., a set-based objective that is 1 if at least n documents in a set of k are relevant, otherwise 0) encourages more result set diversification for smaller n, but this statement has never been formally quantified. In this work, we explicitly derive the mathematical relationship between expected n-call@k and the relevance vs. diversity trade-off --- through fortuitous cancellations in the resulting combinatorial optimization, we show the trade-off is a simple and intuitive function of n (notably independent of the result set size k e n), where diversification increases as n approaches 1.
2348496	On judgments obtained from a commercial search engine In information retrieval, relevance judgments play an important role as they are required both for evaluating the quality of retrieval systems and for training learning to rank algorithms. In recent years, numerous papers have been published using judgments obtained from a commercial search engine by researchers in industry. As typically no information is provided about the quality of these judgments, their reliability for evaluating/training retrieval systems remains questionable. In this paper, we analyze the reliability of such judgments for evaluating the quality of retrieval systems by comparing them to judgments by NIST judges at TREC.
2348499	Opinion summarisation through sentence extraction: an investigation with movie reviews In on-line reviews, authors often use a short passage to describe the overall feeling about a product or a service. A review as a whole can mention many details not in line with the overall feeling, so capturing this key passage is important to understand the overall sentiment of the review. This paper investigates the use of extractive summarisation in the context of sentiment classification. The aim is to find the summary sentence, or the short passage, which gives the overall sentiment of the review, filtering out potential noisy information. Experiments on a movie review data-set show that subjectivity detection plays a central role in building summaries for sentiment classification. Subjective extracts carry the same polarity of the full text reviews, while statistical and positional approaches are not able to capture this aspect.
2348498	On real-time ad-hoc retrieval evaluation Lab-based evaluations typically assess the quality of a retrieval system with respect to its ability to retrieve documents that are relevant to the information need of an end user. In a real-time search task however users not only wish to retrieve the most relevant items but the most recent as well. The current evaluation framework is not adequate to assess the ability of a system to retrieve both recent and relevant items, and the one proposed in the recent TREC Microblog Track has certain flaws that quickly became apparent to the organizers. In this poster, we redefine the experiment for a real-time ad-hoc search task, by setting new submission requirements for the submitted systems/runs, proposing metrics to be used in evaluating the submissions, and suggesting a pooling strategy to be used to gather relevance judgments towards the computation of the described metrics. The proposed task can indeed assess the quality of a retrieval system with regard to retrieving both relevant and timely information.
2348480	Genre classification for million song dataset using confidence-based classifiers combination We proposed a method to classify songs in the Million Song Dataset according to song genre. Since songs have several data types, we trained sub-classifiers by different types of data. These sub-classifiers are combined using both classifier authority and classification confidence for a particular instance. In the experiments, the combined classifier surpasses all of these sub-classifiers and the SVM classifier using concatenated vectors from all data types. Finally, the genre labels for the Million Song Dataset are provided.
2348484	Impact of assessor disagreement on ranking performance We consider the impact of inter-assessor disagreement on the maximum performance that a ranker can hope to achieve. We demonstrate that even if a ranker were to achieve perfect performance with respect to a given assessor, when evaluated with respect to a different assessor, the measured performance of the ranker decreases significantly. This decrease in performance may largely account for observed limits on the performance of learning-to-rank algorithms.
2348482	How query extensions reflect search result abandonments It is often considered that high abandonment rate corresponds to poor IR system performance. However several studies suggested that there are so called good abandonments, i.e. situations when search engine result page contains enough details to satisfy the user information need without necessity to click on search results. In this work we propose to look at query extensions. We see that an extension by itself might motivate abandonment type (good or bad) for the underlying query to some degree. We also propose a way to find potentially good abandonment extensions in an automated manner.
2348481	GLASE 0.1: eyes tell more than mice This paper proposes a prototype system called Gaze-Learning-Access-and-Search-Engine 0.1 (GLASE), which can perform image relevance ranking based on gaze data and within-session learning. We developed a search user interface that uses an eye-tracker as an input device and employed a relevance re-ranking algorithm based on the gaze length. The preliminary experimental results showed that using our gaze-driven system reduced the task completion time an average of 13.7% in a search session.
2348488	Learning to select a time-aware retrieval model Time-aware retrieval models exploit one of two time dimensions, namely, (a) publication time or (b) content time (temporal expressions mentioned in documents). We show that the effectiveness for a temporal query (e.g., illinois earthquake 1968) depends significantly on which time dimension is factored into ranking results. Motivated by this, we propose a machine learning approach to select the most suitable time-aware retrieval model for a given temporal query. Our method uses three classes of features obtained from analyzing distributions over two time dimensions, a distribution over terms, and retrieval scores within top-k result documents. Experiments on real-world data with crowdsourced relevance assessments show the potential of our approach.
2348487	Investigating performance predictors using monte carlo simulation and score distribution models The standard deviation of scores in the top k documents of a ranked list has been shown to be significantly correlated with average precision and has been the basis of a number of query performance predictors. In this paper, we outline two hypotheses that aid in understanding this correlation. Using score distribution (SD) models with known parameters, we create a large number of document rankings using Monte Carlo simulation to test the validity of these hypotheses.
2348486	Inferring missing relevance judgments from crowd workers via probabilistic matrix factorization In crowdsourced relevance judging, each crowd worker typically judges only a small number of examples, yielding a sparse and imbalanced set of judgments in which relatively few workers influence output consensus labels, particularly with simple consensus methods like majority voting. We show how probabilistic matrix factorization, a standard approach in collaborative filtering, can be used to infer missing worker judgments such that all workers influence output labels. Given complete worker judgments inferred by PMF, we evaluate impact in unsupervised and supervised scenarios. In the supervised case, we consider both weighted voting and worker selection strategies based on worker accuracy. Experiments on crowd judgments from the 2010 TREC Relevance Feedback Track show promise of the PMF approach merits further investigation and analysis.
2348485	Incorporating statistical topic information in relevance feedback Most of the relevance feedback algorithms only use document terms as feedback (local features) in order to update the query and re-rank the documents to show to the user. This approach is limited by the terms of those documents without any global context. We propose to use statistical topic modeling techniques in relevance feedback to incorporate a better estimate of context by including global information about the document. This is particularly helpful for difficult queries where learning the context from the interactions with the user is crucial. We propose to use the topic mixture information obtained to characterize the documents and learn their topics. Then, we rank documents incorporating positive and negative feedback by fitting a latent distribution for each class of documents online and combining all the features using Bayesian Logistic Regression. We show results using the OHSUMED dataset for 3 different variants and obtain higher performance, up to 12.5% in Mean Average Precision (MAP).
2348489	Learning-based time-sensitive re-ranking for web search To model time-dependent user intent for Web search, this paper proposes a novel method using machine learning techniques to exploit temporal features for effective time-sensitive search result re-ranking. We propose models to incorporate users' click through information for queries that are seen in the training data, and then further extend the model to deal with unseen queries considering the relationship between queries. Experiment shows significant improvement on search result ranking over original search outputs.
2348451	A hybrid model for ad-hoc information retrieval Many information retrieval (IR) techniques have been proposed to improve the performance, and some combinations of these techniques has been demonstrated to be effective. However, how to effectively combine them is largely unexplored. It is possible that a method reduces the positive influence of the other one even if both of them are effective separately. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid model which can simply and flexibly combine components of three different IR techniques under a uniform framework. Extensive experiments on the TREC standard collections indicate that our proposed model can outperform the best TREC systems consistently in the ad-hoc retrieval. It shows that the combination strategy in our proposed model is very effective. Meanwhile, this method is also re-useable for other researchers to test whether their new methods are additive to the current technologies.
2348452	Exploiting paths for entity search in RDF graphs The field of entity search using Semantic Web (RDF) data has gained more interest recently. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic entity retrieval model for RDF graphs using paths in the graph. Unlike previous work which assumes that all descriptions of an entity are directly linked to the entity node, we assume that an entity can be described with any node that can be reached from the entity node by following paths in the RDF graph. Our retrieval model simulates the generation process of query terms from an entity node by traversing the graph. We evaluate our approach using a standard evaluation framework for entity search.
2348454	A topic model of clinical reports Clinical narrative in the medical record provides perhaps the most detailed account of a patient's history. However, this information is documented in free-text, which makes it challenging to analyze. Efforts to index unstructured clinical narrative often focus on identifying predefined concepts from clinical terminologies. Less studied is the problem of analyzing the text as a whole to create temporal indices that capture relationships between learned clinical events. Topic models provide a method for analyzing large corpora of text to discover semantically related clusters of words. This work presents a topic model tailored to the clinical reporting environment that allows for individual patient timelines. Results show the model is able to identify patterns of clinical events in a cohort of brain cancer patients.
2348455	Active query selection for learning rankers Methods that reduce the amount of labeled data needed for training have focused more on selecting which documents to label than on which queries should be labeled. One exception to this (Long et al. 2010) uses expected loss optimization (ELO) to estimate which queries should be selected but is limited to rankers that predict absolute graded relevance. In this work, we demonstrate how to easily adapt ELO to work with any ranker and show that estimating expected loss in DCG is more robust than NDCG even when the final performance measure is NDCG.
2348459	Cluster-based one-class ensemble for classification problems in information retrieval A number of relevant information retrieval classification problems are one-class classification problems at heart. I.e., labeled data is only available for one class, the so-called target class, and common discrimination-based classification approaches, be them binary or multiclass, are not applicable. Achieving a high effectiveness when solving one-class problems is difficult anyway and it becomes even more challenging when the target class data is multimodal, which is often the case. To address these concerns we propose a cluster-based one-class ensemble that consists of four steps: (1) applying a clustering algorithm to the target class data, (2) training an individual one-class classifier for each of the identified clusters, (3) aggregating the decisions of the individual classifiers, and (4) selecting the best fitting clustering model. We evaluate our approach with four datasets: an artificially generated dataset, a dataset compiled from a known multiclass text corpus, and two datasets related to one-class problems that received much attention recently, namely authorship verification and quality flaw prediction. Our approach outperforms a one-class SVM on all four datasets.

2348443	Multi-platform image search using tag enrichment The number of images available online is growing steadily and current web search engines have indexed more than 10 billion images. Approaches to image retrieval are still often text-based and operate on image annotations and captions. Image annotations (i.e. image tags) are typically short, user-generated, and of varying quality, which increases the mismatch problem between query terms and image tags. For example, a user might enter the query "wedding dress" while all images are annotated with "bridal gown" or "wedding gown". This demonstration presents an image search system using reduction and expansion of image annotations to overcome vocabulary mismatch problems by enriching the sparse set of image tags. Our image search application accepts a written query as input and produces a ranked list of result images and annotations (i.e. image tags) as output. The system integrates methods to reduce and expand the image tag set, thus decreasing the effect of sparse image tags. It builds on different image collections such as the Wikipedia image collection (http://www.imageclef.org/wikidata) and the Microsoft Office.com ClipArt collection (http://office.microsoft.com/), but can be applied to social collections such as Flickr as well. Our demonstration system runs on PCs, tablets, and smartphones, making use of advanced user interface capabilities on mobile devices.
2348441	TweetSpector: entity-based retrieval of tweets TweetSpector is a tool for demonstrating entity-based of retrieval of tweets. The various features of this tool include: entity profile creation, real-time tweet classification, active improvement of the created profiles through user feedback, and the dashboard displaying different metrics.
2348442	YooSee: a video browsing application for young children Nowadays children as young as two years old can easily interact with mobile touch screen devices and personal computers to watch online videos through services such as YouTube. However, such services present a number of challenges for young children (e.g. fine grain gestures/interactions and good typing/literacy skills). In addition, when children use such services there is a risk that they may stumble upon content that is inappropriate. YooSee is a web-based application developed using the PuppyIR framework and designed for children aged between two and six years old. YooSee enables children to: (1) search and browse through video content using an engaging, novel interaction paradigm, and (2) be able to safely enjoy moderated video content.
2348448	CloudSearch and the democratization of information retrieval Amazon CloudSearch is a new hosted search service, built on top of many cloud-based AWS services, and based on the same technology that powers search on Amazon's retail sites. Because of its ease of configuration and scalability, CloudSearch represents the next step in the democratization of information retrieval. This democratization process, increasing access to search for both end users and potential search providers, has continued over several decades, through technologies like early online metered search services, enterprise search software, web search, and open source search tools. CloudSearch further reduces barriers to entry, allowing a person or organization to basically say "make my content searchable" and have it happen automatically. CloudSearch may also offer an opportunity to overcome the stagnation that has occurred in search user experiences over the past 15 years. When you no longer need to be a search expert to make your content available, you're not stuck with ten blue links. Instead, you can focus on providing the kind of interaction that makes sense for your application and your users. CloudSearch enables a flowering of search applications that need not be tied to the web, and an opportunity to explore new ways of interacting with information retrieval technology.
2348447	Putting context into search and search into context It is very challenging task to understand a short query, especially if that query is considered in isolation. Luckily, queries do magically appear in a search box -- rather, they are issued by real people, trying to accomplish a task, at a given point in time and space, and this "context" can be used to aid query understanding. Traditionally search engines have returned the same results to everyone who asks the same question. However, using a single ranking for everyone, in every context limits how well a search engine can do. In this talk I outline a framework to quantify the "potential for personalization", that can be used to characterize the extent to which different people have the same (or different) intents for a query. I then describe several examples of how we represent and use different kinds of context to improve search quality. Finally I conclude by highlighting some important challenges in developing such systems at Web scale including system optimization, evaluation, transparency and serendipity.
2348446	Watson: the Jeopardy! challenge and beyond Watson, named after IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, was built by a team of IBM researchers who set out to accomplish a grand challenge-build a computing system that rivals a human's ability to answer questions posed in natural language with speed, accuracy and confidence. The quiz show Jeopardy! provided the ultimate test of this technology because the game's clues involve analyzing subtle meaning, irony, riddles and other complexities of natural language in which humans excel and computers traditionally fail. Watson passed its first test on Jeopardy!, beating the show's two greatest champions in a televised exhibition match, but the real test will be in applying the underlying natural language processing and analytics technology in business and across industries. In this talk I will introduce the Jeopardy! grand challenge, present an overview of Watson and the DeepQA technology upon which Watson is built, and explore future applications of this technology.
2348445	IR paradigms in computational advertising The central problem in the emerging discipline of computational advertising is to find the "best match" between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement. The context could be a user entering a query in a search engine ("sponsored search"), a user reading a web page ("content match" and "display ads"), a user streaming a movie, and so on. In some situations, it is desirable to solve the "dual" optimization problem: rather then find the best ad given a user in a context, the goal is to identify the "best audience", i.e. the most receptive set of users and/or the most suitable contexts for a given advertising campaign. The information about the user can vary from scarily detailed to practically nil. The number of potential advertisements might be in the billions. Thus, depending on the definition of "best match" and "best audience" these problems lead to a variety of massive optimization problems, with complicated constraints, and challenging data representation and access issues. In general, the direct problem is solved in two stages: first a rough filtering is used to identify a relatively small set of ads to be considered as potential matches, followed by a more sophisticated secondary ranking where economics considerations take center stage. Historically, the filtering has been conceived as a database selection problem, and was done using simple Boolean formulae, for instance, in sponsored search the filter could be "all ads that provide a specific bid for the present query string or a subset of it". Similarly for the dual problem (audience definition) for, say, a sports car ad, the filter could be "all males in California, aged 40 or less". This "database approach" for the direct problem has been recently supplanted by an "IR approach" based on a similarity search between a carefully constructed query that captures the advertising opportunity and an annotated document corpus that represents the potential ads. Similarly, in the dual problem, the newer approach is to devise an efficient and effective representation of the users, then form a query that represents a prototypical ideal user, and finally find the users most similar to the prototype. The aim of this talk is to discuss the penetration of the IR paradigms in computational advertising and present some research challenges and opportunities in this area of enormous economic importance.
2348449	Entity sentiment extraction using text ranking Entity extraction and sentiment classification are among the most common types of information derived from documents, but the problem of directly associating entities and sentiment has received less attention. We use TextRank on a graph linking entities and sentiment-laden words and phrases. We extract from the resulting eigenvector the final sentiment weights of the entities. We then explore the algorithm's performance and accuracy, compared to a baseline.
2348474	Fast on-line learning for multilingual categorization Multiview learning has been shown to be a natural and efficient framework for supervised or semi-supervised learning of multilingual document categorizers. The state-of-the-art co-regularization approach relies on alternate minimizations of a combination of language-specific categorization errors and a disagreement between the outputs of the monolingual text categorizers. This is typically solved by repeatedly training categorizers on each language with the appropriate regularizer. We extend and improve this approach by introducing an on-line learning scheme, where language-specific updates are interleaved in order to iteratively optimize the global cost in one pass. Our experimental results show that this produces similar performance as the batch approach, at a fraction of the computational cost.
2348476	Finding readings for scientists from social websites Current search systems are designed to find relevant articles, especially topically relevant ones, but the notion of relevance largely depends on search tasks. We study the specific task that scientists are searching for worth-reading articles beneficial for their research. Our study finds: users' perception of relevance and preference of reading are only moderately correlated; current systems can effectively find readings that are highly relevant to the topic, but 36% of the worth-reading articles are only marginally relevant or even non-relevant. Our system can effectively find those worth-reading but marginally relevant or non-relevant articles by taking advantages of scientists' recommendations in social websites.
2348477	Finding web appearances of social network users via latent factor model With the rapid growing of Web 2.0, people spend more time on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. In order to know the people they are interacting with, finding the web appearances of them will help the social network users to a great extent. We propose a novel and effective latent factor model to find web appearances of target social network users. Our method solves the name ambiguity problem by simultaneously exploring the link structure of social networks and the web. Experiments on real-world data show the superiority of our method over several baselines.
2348470	Explaining neighborhood-based recommendations Recommender Systems (RS) attempt to discover users' preferences, and to learn about them in order to anticipate their needs. The main task normally associated with a RS is to offer suggestions for items. However, for most users, RSs are black boxes, computerized oracles that give advice, but cannot be questioned. In order to improve the quality of predictions and the satisfaction of the users, explanations facilities are needed. We present a novel methodology to explain recommendations: showing predictions over a set of observed items. Our proposal has been validated by means of user studies and lab experiments using MovieLens dataset.
2348472	Exploring example-based person search in email This paper describes an entity ranking model for example-based person search in email. Evaluation by comparison to manually resolved named references in Enron email yield results that correspond to typically placing the correct entity in the first or second rank.
2348473	Exploring tag relevance for image tag re-ranking In this paper, we propose to explore the relevance between tags for image tag re-ranking. The key component is to define a global tag-tag similarity matrix, which is achieved by analysis in both semantic and visual aspects. The text semantic relevance is explored by the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model [1].For the visual information, the tag-relevance can be propagated by reconstructing exemplar images with visually and semantically consistent images. Based on our tag relevance matrix, a random-walk approach is leveraged to discover the significance of each tag. Finally, all tags in an image are re-ranked by their significance values. Extensive experiments show its effectiveness on an image dataset with a large tags vocabulary.
2348479	Gender-aware re-ranking In this paper we study usefulness of users' gender information for improving ranking of ambiguous queries in personalized and non-contextual settings. This study is performed as a sequence of offline re-ranking experiments and it demonstrates that the proposed gender-aware ranking features provide improvements in ranking quality. It is also shown that the proposed personalized features exhibit performance superior to non-contextual ones.
2348478	Fixed versus dynamic co-occurrence windows in TextRank term weights for information retrieval TextRank is a variant of PageRank typically used in graphs that represent documents, and where vertices denote terms and edges denote relations between terms. Quite often the relation between terms is simple term co-occurrence within a fixed window of k terms. The output of TextRank when applied iteratively is a score for each vertex, i.e. a term weight, that can be used for information retrieval (IR) just like conventional term frequency based term weights. So far, when computing TextRank term weights over co-occurrence graphs, the window of term co-occurrence is always fixed. This work departs from this, and considers dynamically adjusted windows of term co-occurrence that follow the document structure on a sentence- and paragraph-level. The resulting TextRank term weights are used in a ranking function that re-ranks 1000 initially returned search results in order to improve the precision of the ranking. Experiments with two IR collections show that adjusting the vicinity of term co-occurrence when computing TextRank term weights can lead to gains in early precision.
2348466	Effects of expertise differences in synchronous social Q&#38;A Synchronous social question-and-answer (Q&#38;A) systems match askers to answerers and support real-time dialog between them to resolve questions. These systems typically find answerers based on the degree of expertise match with the asker's initial question. However, since synchronous social Q&#38;A involves a dialog between asker and answerer, differences in expertise may also matter (e.g., extreme novices and experts may have difficulty establishing common ground). In this poster we use data from a live social Q&#38;A system to explore the impact of expertise differences on answer quality and aspects of the dialog itself. The findings of our study suggest that synchronous social Q&#38;A systems should consider the relative expertise of candidate answerers with respect to the asker, and offer interactive dialog support to help establish common ground between askers and answerers.
2348463	Detecting candidate named entities in search queries The information extraction task of Named Entities Recognition (NER) has been recently applied to search engine queries, in order to better understand their semantics. Here we concentrate on the task prior to the classification of the named entities (NEs) into a set of categories, which is the problem of detecting candidate NEs via the subtask of query segmentation.We present a novel method for detecting candidate NEs using grammar annotation and query segmentation with the aid of top-n snippets from search engine results and a web n-gram model, to accurately identify NE boundaries. The proposed method addresses the problem of accurately setting boundaries of NEs and the detection of multiple NEs in queries.
2348464	Effect of dynamic pruning safety on learning to rank effectiveness A dynamic pruning strategy, such as WAND, enhances retrieval efficiency without degrading effectiveness to a given rank K, known as safe-to-rank-K. However, it is also possible for WAND to obtain more efficient but unsafe retrieval without actually significantly degrading effectiveness. On the other hand, in a modern search engine setting, dynamic pruning strategies can be used to efficiently obtain the set of documents to be re-ranked by the application of a learned model in a learning to rank setting. No work has examined the impact of safeness on the effectiveness of the learned model. In this work, we investigate the impact of WAND safeness through experiments using 150 TREC Web track topics. We find that unsafe WAND is biased towards documents with lower docids, thereby impacting effectiveness.
2348461	Creating temporally dynamic web search snippets Content on the Internet is always changing. We explore the value of biasing search result snippets towards new webpage content. We present results from a user study comparing traditional query-focused snippets with snippets that emphasize new page content for two query types: general and trending. Our results indicate that searchers prefer the inclusion of temporal information for trending queries but not for general queries, and that this is particularly valuable for pages that have not been recently crawled.
2348462	Dependency trigram model for social relation extraction from news articles We propose a kernel-based model to automatically extract social relations such as economic relations and political relations between two people from news articles. To determine whether two people are structurally associated with each other, the proposed model uses an SVM (support vector machine) tree kernel based on trigrams of head-dependent relations between them. In the experiments with the automatic content extraction (ACE) corpus and a Korean news corpus, the proposed model outperformed the previous systems based on SVM tree kernels even though it used more shallow linguistic knowledge.
2348460	Collaborative filtering with short term preferences mining Recently, recommender systems have fascinated researchers and benefited a variety of people's online activities, enabling users to survive the explosive web information. Traditional collaborative filtering techniques handle the general recommendation well. However, most such approaches usually focus on long term preferences. To discover more short term factors influencing people's decisions, we propose a short term preferences model, implemented with implicit user feedback. We conduct experiments comparing the performances of different short term models, which show that our model outperforms significantly compared to those long term models.
2348469	Estimating the magic barrier of recommender systems: a user study Recommender systems are commonly evaluated by trying to predict known, withheld, ratings for a set of users. Measures such as the Root-Mean-Square Error are used to estimate the quality of the recommender algorithms. This process does however not acknowledge the inherent rating inconsistencies of users. In this paper we present the first results from a noise measurement user study for estimating the magic barrier of recommender systems conducted on a commercial movie recommendation community. The magic barrier is the expected squared error of the optimal recommendation algorithm, or, the lowest error we can expect from any recommendation algorithm. Our results show that the barrier can be estimated by collecting the opinions of users on already rated items.
2348468	Emotion tagging for comments of online news by meta classification with heterogeneous information sources With the rapid growth of online news services, users can actively respond to online news by making comments. Users often express subjective emotions in comments such as sadness, surprise and anger. Such emotions can help understand the preferences and perspectives of individual users, and therefore may facilitate online publishers to provide users with more relevant services. This paper tackles the task of predicting emotions for the comments of online news. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work for addressing the task. In particular, this paper proposes a novel Meta classification approach that exploits heterogeneous information sources such as the content of the comments and the emotion tags of news articles generated by users. The experiments on two datasets from online news services demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
2348467	Efficient estimation of aspect weights Many websites encourage people to submit reviews of various products and services. We present and evaluate a novel approach to efficiently model and analyze the text within user reviews to estimate how much reviewers care about different aspects of a product (i.e., amenities, food, location, room, etc. of a hotel). Our approach performs statistically quite similar to the best existing method. However, our method for computing aspect weights is a linear time method while the current state of the art solution requires cubic time at best.
2348319	Optimizing positional index structures for versioned document collections Versioned document collections are collections that contain multiple versions of each document. Important examples are Web archives, Wikipedia and other wikis, or source code and documents maintained in revision control systems. Versioned document collections can become very large, due to the need to retain past versions, but there is also a lot of redundancy between versions that can be exploited. Thus, versioned document collections are usually stored using special differential (delta) compression techniques, and a number of researchers have recently studied how to exploit this redundancy to obtain more succinct full-text index structures. In this paper, we study index organization and compression techniques for such versioned full-text index structures. In particular, we focus on the case of positional index structures, while most previous work has focused on the non-positional case. Building on earlier work in [zs:redun], we propose a framework for indexing and querying in versioned document collections that integrates non-positional and positional indexes to enable fast top-k query processing. Within this framework, we define and study the problem of minimizing positional index size through optimal substring partitioning. Experiments on Wikipedia and web archive data show that our techniques achieve significant reductions in index size over previous work while supporting very fast query processing.
2348315	User evaluation of query quality Although a great deal of research has been conducted about automatic techniques for determining query quality, there have been relatively few studies about how people judge query quality. This study investigated this topic through a laboratory experiment with 40 subjects. Subjects were shown eight information problems (five fact-finding and three exploratory) and asked to evaluate queries for these problems according to several quality attributes. Subjects then evaluated search engine results pages (SERPs) for each query, which were manipulated to exhibit different levels of performance. Following this, subjects reevaluated the queries, were interviewed about their evaluation approaches and repeated the rating procedure for two information problems. Results showed that for fact-finding information problems, longer queries received higher ratings (both initial and post-SERP), and that post-SERP query ratings were more affected by the proportion of relevant documents viewed to all documents viewed rather than the ranks of the relevant documents. For exploratory information problems, subjects' ratings were highly correlated with the number of relevant documents in the SERP as well as the proportion of relevant documents viewed. Subjects adopted several approaches when evaluating query quality, which led to different quality ratings. Finally, during the reliability check subjects' initial evaluations were fairly stable, but their post-SERP evaluations significantly increased.
2348305	Retrieving similar discussion forum threads: a structure based approach Online forums are becoming a popular way of finding useful information on the web. Search over forums for existing discussion threads so far is limited to keyword-based search due to the minimal effort required on part of the users. However, it is often not possible to capture all the relevant context in a complex query using a small number of keywords. Example-based search that retrieves similar discussion threads given one exemplary thread is an alternate approach that can help the user provide richer context and vastly improve forum search results. In this paper, we address the problem of finding similar threads to a given thread. Towards this, we propose a novel methodology to estimate similarity between discussion threads. Our method exploits the thread structure to decompose threads in to set of weighted overlapping components. It then estimates pairwise thread similarities by quantifying how well the information in the threads are mutually contained within each other using lexical similarities between their underlying components. We compare our proposed methods on real datasets against state-of-the-art thread retrieval mechanisms wherein we illustrate that our techniques outperform others by large margins on popular retrieval evaluation measures such as NDCG, MAP, Precision@k and MRR. In particular, consistent improvements of up to 10% are observed on all evaluation measures.
2348394	Reactive index replication for distributed search engines Distributed search engines comprise multiple sites deployed across geographically distant regions, each site being specialized to serve the queries of local users. When a search site cannot accurately compute the results of a query, it must forward the query to other sites. This paper considers the problem of selecting the documents indexed by each site focusing on replication to increase the fraction of queries processed locally. We propose RIP, an algorithm for replicating documents and posting lists that is practical and has two important features. RIP evaluates user interests in an online fashion and uses only local data of a site. Being an online approach simplifies the operational complexity, while locality enables higher performance when processing queries and documents. The decision procedure, on top of being online and local, incorporates document popularity and user queries, which is critical when assuming a replication budget for each site. Having a replication budget reflects the hardware constraints of any given site. We evaluate RIP against the approach of replicating popular documents statically, and show that we achieve significant gains, while having the additional benefit of supporting incremental indexes.
2348392	Content-based retrieval for heterogeneous domains: domain adaptation by relative aggregation points We introduce the problem of domain adaptation for content-based retrieval and propose a domain adaptation method based on relative aggregation points (RAPs). Content-based retrieval including image retrieval and spoken document retrieval enables a user to input examples as a query, and retrieves relevant data based on the similarity to the examples. However, input examples and relevant data can be dissimilar, especially when domains from which the user selects examples and from which the system retrieves data are different. In content-based geographic object retrieval, for example, suppose that a user who lives in Beijing visits Kyoto, Japan, and wants to search for relatively inexpensive restaurants serving popular local dishes by means of a content-based retrieval system. Since such restaurants in Beijing and Kyoto are dissimilar due to the difference in the average cost and areas' popular dishes, it is difficult to find relevant restaurants in Kyoto based on examples selected in Beijing. We propose a solution for this problem by assuming that RAPs in different domains correspond, which may be dissimilar but play the same role. A RAP is defined as the expectation of instances in a domain that are classified into a certain class, e.g. the most expensive restaurant, average restaurant, and restaurant serving the most popular dishes. Our proposed method constructs a new feature space based on RAPs estimated in each domain and bridges the domain difference for improving content-based retrieval in heterogeneous domains. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we evaluated various methods with a test collection developed for content-based geographic object retrieval. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieved significant improvements over baseline methods. Moreover, we observed that the search performance of content-based retrieval in heterogeneous domains was significantly lower than that in homogeneous domains. This finding suggests that relevant data for the same search intent depend on the search context, that is, the location where the user searches and the domain from which the system retrieves data.
2348389	Category hierarchy maintenance: a data-driven approach Category hierarchies often evolve at a much slower pace than the documents reside in. With newly available documents kept adding into a hierarchy, new topics emerge and documents within the same category become less topically cohesive. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic approach to modifying a given category hierarchy by redistributing its documents into more topically cohesive categories. The modification is achieved with three operations (namely, sprout, merge, and assign) with reference to an auxiliary hierarchy for additional semantic information; the auxiliary hierarchy covers a similar set of topics as the hierarchy to be modified. Our user study shows that the modified category hierarchy is semantically meaningful. As an extrinsic evaluation, we conduct experiments on document classification using real data from Yahoo! Answers and AnswerBag hierarchies, and compare the classification accuracies obtained on the original and the modified hierarchies. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves much larger classification accuracy improvement compared with several baseline methods for hierarchy modification.
2348375	See-to-retrieve: efficient processing of spatio-visual keyword queries The wide proliferation of powerful smart phones equipped with multiple sensors, 3D graphical engine, and 3G connection has nurtured the creation of a new spectrum of visual mobile applications. These applications require novel data retrieval techniques which we call What-You-Retrieve-Is-What-You-See (WYRIWYS). However, state-of-the-art spatial retrieval methods are mostly distance-based and thus inapplicable for supporting WYRIWYS. Motivated by this problem, we propose a novel query called spatio-visual keyword (SVK) query, to support retrieving spatial Web objects that are both visually conspicuous and semantically relevant to the user. To capture the visual features of spatial Web objects with extents, we introduce a novel visibility metric which computes object visibility in a cumulative manner. We propose an incremental method called Complete Occlusion-map based Retrieval (COR) to answer SVK queries. This method exploits effective heuristics to prune the search space and construct a data structure called Occlusion-Map. Then the method adopts the best-first strategy to return relevant objects incrementally. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data sets suggest that our method is effective and efficient when processing SVK queries.
2348351	What reviews are satisfactory: novel features for automatic helpfulness voting This paper focuses on exploring the features of product reviews that satisfy users, by which to improve the automatic helpfulness voting for the reviews on commercial websites. Compared to the previous work, which single-mindedly adopts the textual features to assess the review helpfulness, we propose that user preferences are more explicit clues to infer the opinions of users on the review helpfulness. By using the user-preference based features, we firstly implement a binary helpfulness based review classification system to divide helpful reviews and useless, and on the basis, we secondly build a Ranking SVM based automatic helpfulness voting system (AHV) which rank reviews based on their helpfulness. Experiments used a large scale dataset containing over 34,266 reviews on 1289 products to test the systems, which achieves promising performances with accuracy of up to 0.72 and NDCG@10 of 0.25, and at least 9% accuracy improvement compared to the textual-feature based helpfulness assessment.
2348347	Finding translations in scanned book collections This paper describes an approach for identifying translations of books in large scanned book collections with OCR errors. The method is based on the idea that although individual sentences do not necessarily preserve the word order when translated, a book must preserve the linear progression of ideas for it to be a valid translation. Consider two books in two different languages, say English and German. The English book in the collection is represented by the sequence of words (in the order they appear in the text) which appear only once in the book. Similarly, the book in German is represented by its sequence of words which appear only once. An English-German dictionary is used to transform the word sequence of the English book into German by translating individual words in place. It is not necessary to translate all the words and this method works even with small dictionaries. Both sequences are now in German and can, therefore, be aligned using a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. We describe two scoring functions TRANS-cs and TRANS-its which account for both the LCS length and the lengths of the original word sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TRANS-its is particularly successful in finding translations of books and outperforms several baselines including metadata search based on matching titles and authors. Experiments performed on a Europarl parallel corpus for four language pairs, English-Finnish, English-French, English-German, English-Spanish, and a scanned book collection of 50K English-German books show that the proposed method retrieves translations of books with an average MAP score of 1.0 and a speed of 10K book pair comparisons per second on a single core.
2348334	SimFusion+: extending simfusion towards efficient estimation on large and dynamic networks SimFusion has become a captivating measure of similarity between objects in a web graph. It is iteratively distilled from the notion that "the similarity between two objects is reinforced by the similarity of their related objects". The existing SimFusion model usually exploits the Unified Relationship Matrix (URM) to represent latent relationships among heterogeneous data, and adopts an iterative paradigm for SimFusion computation. However, due to the row normalization of URM, the traditional SimFusion model may produce the trivial solution; worse still, the iterative computation of SimFusion may not ensure the global convergence of the solution. This paper studies the revision of this model, providing a full treatment from complexity to algorithms. (1) We propose SimFusion+ based on a notion of the Unified Adjacency Matrix (UAM), a modification of the URM, to prevent the trivial solution and the divergence issue of SimFusion. (2) We show that for any vertex-pair, SimFusion+ can be performed in O(1) time and O(n) space with an O(km)-time precomputation done only once, as opposed to the O(kn3) time and O(n2) space of its traditional counterpart, where n, m, and k denote the number of vertices, edges, and iterations respectively. (3) We also devise an incremental algorithm for further improving the computation of SimFusion+ when networks are dynamically updated, with performance guarantees for similarity estimation. We experimentally verify that these algorithms scale well, and the revised notion of SimFusion is able to converge to a non-trivial solution, and allows us to identify more sensible structure information in large real-world networks.
2348338	Fighting against web spam: a novel propagation method based on click-through data Combating Web spam is one of the greatest challenges for Web search engines. State-of-the-art anti-spam techniques focus mainly on detecting varieties of spam strategies, such as content spamming and link-based spamming. Although these anti-spam approaches have had much success, they encounter problems when fighting against a continuous barrage of new types of spamming techniques. We attempt to solve the problem from a new perspective, by noticing that queries that are more likely to lead to spam pages/sites have the following characteristics: 1) they are popular or reflect heavy demands for search engine users and 2) there are usually few key resources or authoritative results for them. From these observations, we propose a novel method that is based on click-through data analysis by propagating the spamicity score iteratively between queries and URLs from a few seed pages/sites. Once we obtain the seed pages/sites, we use the link structure of the click-through bipartite graph to discover other pages/sites that are likely to be spam. Experiments show that our algorithm is both efficient and effective in detecting Web spam. Moreover, combining our method with some popular anti-spam techniques such as TrustRank achieves improvement compared with each technique taken individually.
2348337	Detecting quilted web pages at scale Web-based advertising and electronic commerce, combined with the key role of search engines in driving visitors to ad-monetized and e-commerce web sites, has given rise to the phenomenon of web spam: web pages that are of little value to visitors, but that are created mainly to mislead search engines into driving traffic to target web sites. A large fraction of spam web pages is automatically generated, and some portion of these pages is generated by stitching together parts (sentences or paragraphs) of other web pages. This paper presents a scalable algorithm for detecting such "quilted" web pages. Previous work by the author and his collaborators introduced a sampling-based algorithm that was capable of detecting some, but by far not all quilted web pages in a collection. By contrast, the algorithm presented in this work identifies all quilted web pages, and it is scalable to very large corpora. We tested the algorithm on the half-billion page English-language subset of the ClueWeb09 collection, and evaluated its effectiveness in detecting web spam by manually inspecting small samples of the detected quilted pages. This manual inspection guided us in iteratively refining the algorithm to be more efficient in detecting real-world spam.
2348329	Multi-aspect query summarization by composite query Conventional search engines usually return a ranked list of web pages in response to a query. Users have to visit several pages to locate the relevant parts. A promising future search scenario should involve: (1) understanding user intents; (2) providing relevant information directly to satisfy searchers' needs, as opposed to relevant pages. In this paper, we present a search paradigm to summarize a query's information from different aspects. Query aspects could be aligned to user intents. The generated summaries for query aspects are expected to be both specific and informative, so that users can easily and quickly find relevant information. Specifically, we use a Composite Query for Summarization" method, where a set of component queries are used for providing additional information for the original query. The system leverages the search engine to proactively gather information by submitting multiple component queries according to the original query and its aspects. In this way, we could get more relevant information for each query aspect and roughly classify information. By comparative mining the search results of different component queries, it is able to identify query (dependent) aspect words, which help to generate more specific and informative summaries. The experimental results on two data sets, Wikipedia and TREC ClueWeb2009, are encouraging. Our method outperforms two baseline methods on generating informative summaries.
2348288	Adaptation of the concept hierarchy model with search logs for query recommendation on intranets A concept hierarchy created from a document collection can be used for query recommendation on Intranets by ranking terms according to the strength of their links to the query within the hierarchy. A major limitation is that this model produces the same recommendations for identical queries and rebuilding it from scratch periodically can be extremely inefficient due to the high computational costs. We propose to adapt the model by incorporating query refinements from search logs. Our intuition is that the concept hierarchy built from the collection and the search logs provide complementary conceptual views on the same search domain, and their integration should continually improve the effectiveness of recommended terms. Two adaptation approaches using query logs with and without click information are compared. We evaluate the concept hierarchy models (static and adapted versions) built from the Intranet collections of two academic institutions and compare them with a state-of-the-art log-based query recommender, the Query Flow Graph, built from the same logs. Our adaptive model significantly outperforms its static version and the query flow graph when tested over a period of time on data (documents and search logs) from two institutions' Intranets.
2348285	Salton award lecture: information retrieval as engineering science 
2348286	Retrieving information from the book of humanity: the personalized medicine data tsunami crashes on the beach of jeopardy From a mute but eloquent alphabet of 4 characters emerges a complex biological 'literature' whose highest expression is human existence. The rapidly advancing technologies of 'nextgen sequencing' will soon make it possible to inexpensively acquire and store the characters of our complete personal genetic instruction set and make it available for health assessment and disease management. This uniquely personal form of 'big data' brings with it challenges that will be discussed in this keynote presentation. Topics will include a brief introduction to the linguistic challenges of 'biology as literature', the impact of personal molecular variation on traditional approaches to disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and the challenges of information retrieval when a large volume of primary observations is made that is associated with an evanescent and rapidly changing corpus of scientific interpretation of those primary observations. Experience with extracting high quality pheonotypes from electronic medical records has shown that Natural Language Processing capability is an essential information extraction function for correlation of clinical events with personal genetic variation. Any powerful set of information can be used or misused, and put those who depend upon it in jeopardy. These issues, and a lesson from the long running Jeopardy TV series, will be discussed.
2348298	AspecTiles: tile-based visualization of diversified web search results A diversified search result for an underspecified query generally contains web pages in which there are answers that are relevant to different aspects of the query. In order to help the user locate such relevant answers, we propose a simple extension to the standard Search Engine Result Page (SERP) interface, called AspecTiles. In addition to presenting a ranked list of URLs with their titles and snippets, AspecTiles visualizes the relevance degree of a document to each aspect by means of colored squares ("tiles"). To compare AspecTiles with the standard SERP interface in terms of usefulness, we conducted a user study involving 30 search tasks designed based on the TREC web diversity task topics as well as 32 participants. Our results show that AspecTiles has some advantages in terms of search performance, user behavior, and user satisfaction. First, AspecTiles enables the user to gather relevant information significantly more efficiently than the standard SERP interface for tasks where the user considers several different aspects of the query to be important at the same time (multi-aspect tasks). Second, AspecTiles affects the user's information seeking behavior: with this interface, we observed significantly fewer query reformulations, shorter queries and deeper examinations of ranked lists in multi-aspect tasks. Third, participants of our user study found AspecTiles significantly more useful for finding relevant information and easy to use than the standard SERP interface. These results suggest that simple interfaces like AspecTiles can enhance the search performance and search experience of the user when their queries are underspecified.
2484048	Competence-based song recommendation Singing is a popular social activity and a good way of expressing one's feelings. One important reason for unsuccessful singing performance is because the singer fails to choose a suitable song. In this paper, we propose a novel singing competence-based song recommendation framework. It is distinguished from most existing music recommendation systems which rely on the computation of listeners' interests or similarity. We model a singer's vocal competence as singer profile, which takes voice pitch, intensity, and quality into consideration. Then we propose techniques to acquire singer profiles. We also present a song profile model which is used to construct a human annotated song database. Finally, we propose a learning-to-rank scheme for recommending songs by singer profile. The experimental study on real singers demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over two baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study competence-based song recommendation.
2484043	Toward self-correcting search engines: using underperforming queries to improve search Search engines receive queries with a broad range of different search intents. However, they do not perform equally well for all queries. Understanding where search engines perform poorly is critical for improving their performance. In this paper, we present a method for automatically identifying poorly-performing query groups where a search engine may not meet searcher needs. This allows us to create coherent query clusters that help system design-ers generate actionable insights about necessary changes and helps learning-to-rank algorithms better learn relevance signals via spe-cialized rankers. The result is a framework capable of estimating dissatisfaction from Web search logs and learning to improve per-formance for dissatisfied queries. Through experimentation, we show that our method yields good quality groups that align with established retrieval performance metrics. We also show that we can significantly improve retrieval effectiveness via specialized rankers, and that coherent grouping of underperforming queries generated by our method is important in improving each group.
2484044	Exploiting hybrid contexts for Tweet segmentation Twitter has attracted hundred millions of users to share and disseminate most up-to-date information. However, the noisy and short nature of tweets makes many applications in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP) challenging. Recently, segment-based tweet representation has demonstrated effectiveness in named entity recognition (NER) and event detection from tweet streams. To split tweets into meaningful phrases or segments, the previous work is purely based on external knowledge bases, which ignores the rich local context information embedded in the tweets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for tweet segmentation in a batch mode, called HybridSeg. HybridSeg incorporates local context knowledge with global knowledge bases for better tweet segmentation. HybridSeg consists of two steps: learning from off-the-shelf weak NERs and learning from pseudo feedback. In the first step, the existing NER tools are applied to a batch of tweets. The named entities recognized by these NERs are then employed to guide the tweet segmentation process. In the second step, HybridSeg adjusts the tweet segmentation results iteratively by exploiting all segments in the batch of tweets in a collective manner. Experiments on two tweet datasets show that HybridSeg significantly improves tweet segmentation quality compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm. We also conduct a case study by using tweet segments for the task of named entity recognition from tweets. The experimental results demonstrate that HybridSeg significantly benefits the downstream applications.
2484040	Learning to name faces: a multimodal learning scheme for search-based face annotation Automated face annotation aims to automatically detect human faces from a photo and further name the faces with the corresponding human names. In this paper, we tackle this open problem by investigating a search-based face annotation (SBFA) paradigm for mining large amounts of web facial images freely available on the WWW. Given a query facial image for annotation, the idea of SBFA is to first search for top-n similar facial images from a web facial image database and then exploit these top-ranked similar facial images and their weak labels for naming the query facial image. To fully mine those information, this paper proposes a novel framework of Learning to Name Faces (L2NF) -- a unified multimodal learning approach for search-based face annotation, which consists of the following major components: (i) we enhance the weak labels of top-ranked similar images by exploiting the "label smoothness" assumption; (ii) we construct the multimodal representations of a facial image by extracting different types of features; (iii) we optimize the distance measure for each type of features using distance metric learning techniques; and finally (iv) we learn the optimal combination of multiple modalities for annotation through a learning to rank scheme. We conduct a set of extensive empirical studies on two real-world facial image databases, in which encouraging results show that the proposed algorithms significantly boost the naming accuracy of search-based face annotation task.
2484034	Deciding on an adjustment for multiplicity in IR experiments We evaluate statistical inference procedures for small-scale IR experiments that involve multiple comparisons against the baseline. These procedures adjust for multiple comparisons by ensuring that the probability of observing at least one false positive in the experiment is below a given threshold. We use only publicly available test collections and make our software available for download. In particular, we employ the TREC runs and runs constructed from the Microsoft learning-to-rank (MSLR) data set. Our focus is on non-parametric statistical procedures that include the Holm-Bonferroni adjustment of the permutation test p-values, the MaxT permutation test, and the permutation-based closed testing. In TREC-based simulations, these procedures retain from 66% to 92% of individually significant results (i.e., those obtained without taking other comparisons into account). Similar retention rates are observed in the MSLR simulations. For the largest evaluated query set size (i.e., 6400), procedures that adjust for multiplicity find at most 5% fewer true differences compared to unadjusted tests. At the same time, unadjusted tests produce many more false positives.
2484065	Faster upper bounding of intersection sizes There is a long history of developing efficient algorithms for set intersection, which is a fundamental operation in information retrieval and databases. In this paper, we describe a new data structure, a Cardinality Filter, to quickly compute an upper bound on the size of a set intersection. Knowing an upper bound of the size can be used to accelerate many applications such as top-k query processing in text mining. Given finite sets A and B, the expected computation time for the upper bound of the size of the intersection |A cap B| is O( (|A| + |B|) w), where w is the machine word length. This is much faster than the current best algorithm for the exact intersection, which runs in O((|A| + |B|) / &#8730;w + |A cap B|) expected time. Our performance studies show that our implementations of Cardinality Filters are from 2 to 10 times faster than existing set intersection algorithms, and the time for a top-k query in a text mining application can be reduced by half.
2484061	An information-theoretic account of static index pruning In this paper, we recast static index pruning as a model induction problem under the framework of Kullback's principle of minimum cross-entropy. We show that static index pruning has an approximate analytical solution in the form of convex integer program. Further analysis on computation feasibility suggests that one of its surrogate model can be solved efficiently. This result has led to the rediscovery of emph{uniform pruning}, a simple yet powerful pruning method proposed in 2001 and later easily ignored by many of us. To empirically verify this result, we conducted experiments under a new design in which prune ratio is strictly controlled. Our result on standard ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks has confirmed that uniform pruning is robust to high prune ratio and its performance is currently state of the art.
2484062	An unsupervised topic segmentation model incorporating word order We present a new unsupervised topic discovery model for a collection of text documents. In contrast to the majority of the state-of-the-art topic models, our model does not break the document's structure such as paragraphs and sentences. In addition, it preserves word order in the document. As a result, it can generate two levels of topics of different granularity, namely, segment-topics and word-topics. In addition, it can generate n-gram words in each topic. We also develop an approximate inference scheme using Gibbs sampling method. We conduct extensive experiments using publicly available data from different collections and show that our model improves the quality of several text mining tasks such as the ability to support fine grained topics with n-gram words in the correlation graph, the ability to segment a document into topically coherent sections, document classification, and document likelihood estimation.
2484054	Query representation for cross-temporal information retrieval This paper addresses the problem of long-term language change in information retrieval (IR) systems. IR research has often ignored lexical drift. But in the emerging domain of massive digitized book collections, the risk of vocabulary mismatch due to language change is high. Collections such as Google Books and the Hathi Trust contain text written in the vernaculars of many centuries. With respect to IR, changes in vocabulary and orthography make 14th-Century English qualitatively different from 21st-Century English. This challenges retrieval models that rely on keyword matching. With this challenge in mind, we ask: given a query written in contemporary English, how can we retrieve relevant documents that were written in early English? We argue that search in historically diverse corpora is similar to cross-language retrieval (CLIR). By considering "modern" English and "archaic" English as distinct languages, CLIR techniques can improve what we call cross-temporal IR (CTIR). We focus on ways to combine evidence to improve CTIR effectiveness, proposing and testing several ways to handle language change during book search. We find that a principled combination of three sources of evidence during relevance feedback yields strong CTIR performance.
2484058	Query expansion using path-constrained random walks This paper exploits Web search logs for query expansion (QE) by presenting a new QE method based on path-constrained random walks (PCRW), where the search logs are represented as a labeled, directed graph, and the probability of picking an expansion term for an input query is computed by a learned combination of constrained random walks on the graph. The method is shown to be generic in that it covers most of the popular QE models as special cases and flexible in that it provides a principled mathematical framework in which a wide variety of information useful for QE can be incorporated in a unified way. Evaluation is performed on the Web document ranking task using a real-world data set. Results show that the PCRW-based method is very effective for the expansion of rare queries, i.e., low-frequency queries that are unseen in search logs, and that it outperforms significantly other state-of-the-art QE meth-ods.
2484050	Aggregated search interface preferences in multi-session search tasks Aggregated search interfaces provide users with an overview of results from various sources. Two general types of display exist: tabbed, with access to each source in a separate tab, and blended, which combines multiple sources into a single result page. Multi-session search tasks, e.g., a research project, consist of multiple stages, each with its own sub-tasks. Several factors involved in multi-session search tasks have been found to influence user search behavior. We investigate whether user preference for source presentation changes during a multi-session search task. The dynamic nature of multi-session search tasks makes the design of a controlled experiment a non-trivial challenge. We adopt a methodology based on triangulation and conduct two types of observational study: a longitudinal study and a laboratory study. In the longitudinal study we follow the use of tabbed and blended displays by 25 students during a project. We find that while a tabbed display is used more than a blended display, subjects repeatedly switch between displays during the project. Use of the tabbed display is motivated by a need to zoom in on a specific source, while the blended display is used to explore available material across sources whenever the information need changes. In a laboratory study 44 students completed a multi-session search task composed of three sub-tasks, the first with a tabbed display, the second and third with blended displays. The tasks were manipulated by either providing three task about the same topic or about three different topics. We find that a stable information need over multiple sub-tasks negatively influences perceived usability of the blended displays, while we do not find an influence when the information need changes.
2484087	A candidate filtering mechanism for fast top-k query processing on modern cpus A large amount of research has focused on faster methods for finding top-k results in large document collections, one of the main scalability challenges for web search engines. In this paper, we propose a method for accelerating such top-k queries that builds on and generalizes methods recently proposed by several groups of researchers based on Block-Max Indexes. In particular, we describe a system that uses a new filtering mechanism, based on a combination of block maxima and bitmaps, that radically reduces the number of documents that have to be further evaluated. Our filtering mechanism exploits the SIMD processing capabilities of current microprocessors, and it is optimized through caching policies that select and store suitable filter structures based on properties of the query load. Our experimental evaluation shows that the mechanism results in very significant speed-ups for disjunctive top-k queries under several state-of-the-art algorithms, including a speed-up of more than a factor of 2 over the fastest previously known methods.
2484082	Modeling click-through based word-pairs for web search Statistical translation models and latent semantic analysis (LSA) are two effective approaches to exploiting click-through data for Web search ranking. While the former learns semantic relationships between query terms and document terms directly, the latter maps a document and the queries for which it has been clicked to vectors in a lower dimensional semantic space. This paper presents two document ranking models that combine the strengths of both the approaches by explicitly modeling word-pairs. The first model, called PairModel, is a monolingual ranking model based on word-pairs derived from click-through data. It maps queries and documents into a concept space spanned by these word-pairs. The second model, called Bilingual Paired Topic Model (BPTM), uses bilingual word translations and can jointly model query-document collections written in multiple languages. This model uses topics to capture term dependencies and maps queries and documents in multiple languages into a lower dimensional semantic sub-space spanned by the topics. These models are evaluated on the Web search task using real world data sets in three different languages. Results show that they consistently outperform various state-of-the-art baseline models, and the best result is obtained by interpolating PairModel and BPTM.
2484085	Fast document-at-a-time query processing using two-tier indexes In this paper we present two new algorithms designed to reduce the overall time required to process top-k queries. These algorithms are based on the document-at-a-time approach and modify the best baseline we found in the literature, Blockmax WAND (BMW), to take advantage of a two-tiered index, in which the first tier is a small index containing only the higher impact entries of each inverted list. This small index is used to pre-process the query before accessing a larger index in the second tier, resulting in considerable speeding up the whole process. The first algorithm we propose, named BMW-CS, achieves higher performance, but may result in small changes in the top results provided in the final ranking. The second algorithm, named BMW-t, preserves the top results and, while slower than BMW-CS, it is faster than BMW. In our experiments, BMW-CS was more than 40 times faster than BMW when computing top 10 results, and, while it does not guarantee preserving the top results, it preserved all ranking results evaluated at this level.
2484080	News vertical search: when and what to display to users News reporting has seen a shift toward fast-paced online reporting in new sources such as social media. Web Search engines that support a news vertical have historically relied upon articles published by major newswire providers when serving news-related queries. In this paper, we investigate to what extent real-time content from newswire, blogs, Twitter and Wikipedia sources are useful to return to the user in the current fast-paced news search setting. In particular, we perform a detailed user study using the emerging medium of crowdsourcing to determine when and where integrating news-related content from these various sources can better serve the user's news need. We sampled approximately 300 news-related search queries using Google Trends and Bitly data in real-time for two time periods. For these queries, we have crowdsourced workers compare Web search rankings for each, with similar rankings integrating real-time news content from sources such as Twitter or the blogosphere. Our results show that users exhibited a preference for rankings integrating newswire articles for only half of our queries, indicating that relying solely on newswire providers for news-related content is now insufficient. Moreover, our results show that users preferred rankings that integrate tweets more often than those that integrate newswire articles, showing the potential of using social media to better serve news queries.
2484079	Document identifier reassignment and run-length-compressed inverted indexes for improved search performance Text search engines are a fundamental tool nowadays. Their efficiency relies on a popular and simple data structure: the inverted indexes. Currently, inverted indexes can be represented very efficiently using index compression schemes. Recent investigations also study how an optimized document ordering can be used to assign document identifiers (docIDs) to the document database. This yields important improvements in index compression and query processing time. In this paper we follow this line of research, yet from a different perspective. We propose a docID reassignment method that allows one to focus on a given subset of inverted lists to improve their performance. We then use run-length encoding to compress these lists (as many consecutive 1s are generated). We show that by using this approach, not only the performance of the particular subset of inverted lists is improved, but also that of the whole inverted index. Our experimental results indicate a reduction of about 10% in the space usage of the whole index docID reassignment was focused. Also, decompression speed is up to 1.22 times faster if the runs must be explicitly decompressed and up to 4.58 times faster if implicit decompression of runs is allowed. Finally, we also improve the Document-at-a-Time query processing time of AND queries (by up to 12%), WAND queries (by up to 23%) and full (non-ranked) OR queries (by up to 86%).
2484077	Cache-conscious performance optimization for similarity search All-pairs similarity search can be implemented in two stages. The first stage is to partition the data and group potentially similar vectors. The second stage is to run a set of tasks where each task compares a partition of vectors with other candidate partitions. Because of data sparsity, accessing feature vectors in memory for runtime comparison in the second stage, incurs significant overhead due to the presence of memory hierarchy. This paper proposes a cache-conscious data layout and traversal optimization to reduce the execution time through size-controlled data splitting and vector coalescing. It also provides an analysis to guide the optimal choice for the parameter setting. Our evaluation with several application datasets verifies the performance gains obtained by the optimization and shows that the proposed scheme is upto 2.74x as fast as the cache-oblivious baseline.
2484073	A mutual information-based framework for the analysis of information retrieval systems We consider the problem of information retrieval evaluation and the methods and metrics used for such evaluations. We propose a probabilistic framework for evaluation which we use to develop new information-theoretic evaluation metrics. We demonstrate that these new metrics are powerful and generalizable, enabling evaluations heretofore not possible. We introduce four preliminary uses of our framework: (1) a measure of conditional rank correlation, information tau, a powerful meta-evaluation tool whose use we demonstrate on understanding novelty and diversity evaluation; (2) a new evaluation measure, relevance information correlation, which is correlated with traditional evaluation measures and can be used to (3) evaluate a collection of systems simultaneously, which provides a natural upper bound on metasearch performance; and (4) a measure of the similarity between rankers on judged documents, information difference, which allows us to determine whether systems with similar performance are in fact different.
2484072	Exploiting user feedback to learn to rank answers in q&#38;a forums: a case study with stack overflow Collaborative web sites, such as collaborative encyclopedias, blogs, and forums, are characterized by a loose edit control, which allows anyone to freely edit their content. As a consequence, the quality of this content raises much concern. To deal with this, many sites adopt manual quality control mechanisms. However, given their size and change rate, manual assessment strategies do not scale and content that is new or unpopular is seldom reviewed. This has a negative impact on the many services provided, such as ranking and recommendation. To tackle with this problem, we propose a learning to rank (L2R) approach for ranking answers in Q&#38;A forums. In particular, we adopt an approach based on Random Forests and represent query and answer pairs using eight different groups of features. Some of these features are used in the Q&#38;A domain for the first time. Our L2R method was trained to learn the answer rating, based on the feedback users give to answers in Q&#38;A forums. Using the proposed method, we were able (i) to outperform a state of the art baseline with gains of up to 21% in NDCG, a metric used to evaluate rankings; we also conducted a comprehensive study of the features, showing that (ii) review and user features are the most important in the Q&#38;A domain although text features are useful for assessing quality of new answers; and (iii) the best set of new features we proposed was able to yield the best quality rankings.
2484092	How do users respond to voice input errors?: lexical and phonetic query reformulation in voice search Voice search offers users with a new search experience: instead of typing, users can vocalize their search queries. However, due to voice input errors (such as speech recognition errors and improper system interruptions), users need to frequently reformulate queries to handle the incorrectly recognized queries. We conducted user experiments with native English speakers on their query reformulation behaviors in voice search and found that users often reformulate queries with both lexical and phonetic changes to previous queries. In this paper, we first characterize and analyze typical voice input errors in voice search and users' corresponding reformulation strategies. Then, we evaluate the impacts of typical voice input errors on users' search progress and the effectiveness of different reformulation strategies on handling these errors. This study provides a clearer picture on how to further improve current voice search systems.
2484091	Search result diversification in resource selection for federated search Prior research in resource selection for federated search mainly focused on selecting a small number of information sources that are most relevant to a user query. However, result novelty and diversification are largely unexplored, which does not reflect the various kinds of information needs of users in real world applications. This paper proposes two general approaches to model both result relevance and diversification in selecting sources, in order to provide more comprehensive coverage of multiple aspects of a user query. The first approach focuses on diversifying the document ranking on a centralized sample database before selecting information sources under the framework of Relevant Document Distribution Estimation (ReDDE). The second approach first evaluates the relevance of information sources with respect to each aspect of the query, and then ranks the sources based on the novelty and relevance that they offer. Both approaches can be applied with a wide range of existing resource selection algorithms such as ReDDE, CRCS, CORI and Big Document. Moreover, this paper proposes a learning based approach to combine multiple resource selection algorithms for result diversification, which can further improve the performance. We propose a set of new metrics for resource selection in federated search to evaluate the diversification performance of different approaches. To our best knowledge, this is the first piece of work that addresses the problem of search result diversification in federated search. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches has been demonstrated by an extensive set of experiments on the federated search testbed of the Clueweb dataset.
2484143	Time-aware structured query suggestion Most commercial search engines have a query suggestion feature, which is designed to capture various possible search intents behind the user's original query. However, even though different search intents behind a given query may have been popular at different time periods in the past, existing query suggestion methods neither utilize nor present such information. In this study, we propose Time-aware Structured Query Suggestion (TaSQS) which clusters query suggestions along a timeline so that the user can narrow down his search from a temporal point of view. Moreover, when a suggested query is clicked, TaSQS presents web pages from query-URL bipartite graphs after ranking them according to the click counts within a particular time period. Our experiments using data from a commercial search engine log show that the time-aware clustering and the time-aware document ranking features of TaSQS are both effective.
2484144	What can pictures tell us about web pages?: improving document search using images Traditional Web search engines do not use the images in the HTML pages to find relevant documents for a given query. Instead, they typically operate by computing a measure of agreement between the keywords provided by the user and only the text portion of each page. In this paper we study whether the content of the pictures appearing in a Web page can be used to enrich the semantic description of an HTML document and consequently boost the performance of a keyword-based search engine. We present a Web-scalable system that exploits a pure text-based search engine to find an initial set of candidate documents for a given query. Then, the candidate set is reranked using semantic information extracted from the images contained in the pages. The resulting system retains the computational efficiency of traditional text-based search engines with only a small additional storage cost needed to encode the visual information. We test our approach on the TREC 2009 Million Query Track, where we show that our use of visual content yields improvement in accuracies for two distinct text-based search engines, including the system with the best reported performance on this benchmark.
2484141	Browse with a social web directory Browse with either web directories or social bookmarks is an important complementation to search by keywords in web information retrieval. To improve users' browse experiences and facilitate the web directory construction, in this paper, we propose a novel browse system called Social Web Directory (SWD for short) by integrating web directories and social bookmarks. In SWD, (1) web pages are automatically categorized to a hierarchical structure to be retrieved efficiently, and (2) the popular web pages, hottest tags, and expert users in each category are ranked to help users find information more conveniently. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SWD system.
2484142	The bag-of-repeats representation of documents n-gram representations of documents may improve over a simple bag-of-word representation by relaxing the independence assumption of word and introducing context. However, this comes at a cost of adding features which are non-descriptive, and increasing the dimension of the vector space model exponentially. We present new representations that avoid both pitfalls. They are based on sound theoretical notions of stringology, and can be computed in optimal asymptotic time with algorithms using data structures from the suffix family. While maximal repeats have been used in the past for similar tasks, we show how another equivalence class of repeats -- largest-maximal repeats -- obtain similar or better results, with only a fraction of the features. This class acts as a minimal generative basis of all repeated substrings. We also report their use for topic modeling, showing easier to interpret models.
2484147	Pursuing insights about healthcare utilization via geocoded search queries Mobile devices provide people with a conduit to the rich infor-mation resources of the Web. With consent, the devices can also provide streams of information about search activity and location that can be used in population studies and real-time assistance. We analyzed geotagged mobile queries in a privacy-sensitive study of potential transitions from health information search to in-world healthcare utilization. We note differences in people's health infor-mation seeking before, during, and after the appearance of evidence that a medical facility has been visited. We find that we can accu-rately estimate statistics about such potential user engagement with healthcare providers. The findings highlight the promise of using geocoded search for sensing and predicting activities in the world.
2484148	Estimating topical context by diverging from external resources Improving query understanding is crucial for providing the user with information that suits her needs. To this end, the retrieval system must be able to deal with several sources of knowledge from which it could infer a topical context. The use of external sources of information for improving document retrieval has been extensively studied. Improvements with either structured or large sets of data have been reported. However, in these studies resources are often used separately and rarely combined together. We experiment in this paper a method that discounts documents based on their weighted divergence from a set of external resources. We present an evaluation of the combination of four resources on two standard TREC test collections. Our proposed method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art Mixture of Relevance Models on one test collection, while no significant differences are detected on the other one.
2484145	Relating retrievability, performance and length Retrievability provides a different way to evaluate an Information Retrieval (IR) system as it focuses on how easily documents can be found. It is intrinsically related to retrieval performance because a document needs to be retrieved before it can be judged relevant. In this paper, we undertake an empirical investigation into the relationship between the retrievability of documents, the retrieval bias imposed by a retrieval system, and the retrieval performance, across different amounts of document length normalization. To this end, two standard IR models are used on three TREC test collections to show that there is a useful and practical link between retrievability and performance. Our findings show that minimizing the bias across the document collection leads to good performance (though not the best performance possible). We also show that past a certain amount of document length normalization the retrieval bias increases, and the retrieval performance significantly and rapidly decreases. These findings suggest that the relationship between retrievability and effectiveness may offer a way to automatically tune systems.
2484140	Document classification by topic labeling In this paper, we propose Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [1] based document classification algorithm which does not require any labeled dataset. In our algorithm, we construct a topic model using LDA, assign one topic to one of the class labels, aggregate all the same class label topics into a single topic using the aggregation property of the Dirichlet distribution and then automatically assign a class label to each unlabeled document depending on its "closeness" to one of the aggregated topics. We present an extension to our algorithm based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and a naive Bayes classifier. We show effectiveness of our algorithm on three real world datasets.
2484138	Mapping queries to questions: towards understanding users' information needs In this paper, for the first time, we study the problem of mapping keyword queries to questions on community-based question answering (CQA) sites. Mapping general web queries to questions enables search engines not only to discover explicit and specific information needs (questions) behind keywords queries, but also to find high quality information (answers) for answering keyword queries. In order to map queries to questions, we propose a ranking algorithm containing three steps: Candidate Question Selection, Candidate Question Ranking, and Candidate Question Grouping. Preliminary experimental results using 60 queries from search logs of a commercial engine show that the presented approach can efficiently find the questions which capture user's information needs explicitly.
2484139	Building a web test collection using social media Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms contain a large number of questions and associated answers. Answerers sometimes include URLs as part of the answers to provide further information. This paper describes a novel way of building a test collection for web search by exploiting the link information from this type of social media data. We propose to build the test collection by regarding CQA questions as queries and the associated linked web pages as relevant documents. To evaluate this approach, we collect approximately ten thousand CQA queries, whose answers contained links to ClueWeb09 documents after spam filtering. Experimental results using this collection show that the relative effectiveness between different retrieval models on the ClueWeb-CQA query set is consistent with that on the TREC Web Track query sets, confirming the reliability of our test collection. Further analysis shows that the large number of queries generated through this approach compensates for the sparse relevance judgments in determining significant differences.
2484130	Using social annotations to enhance document representation for personalized search In this paper, we present a contribution to IR modeling. We propose an approach that computes on the fly, a Personalized Social Document Representation (PSDR) of each document per user based on his social activities. The PSDRs are used to rank documents with respect to a query. This approach has been intensively evaluated on a large public dataset, showing significant benefits for personalized search.
2484133	Finding impressive social content creators: searching for SNS illustrators using feedback on motifs and impressions We propose a method for finding impressive creators in online social network sites (SNSs). Many users are actively engaged in publishing their own works, sharing visual content on sites such as YouTube or Flickr. In this paper, we focus on the Japanese illustration-sharing SNS, Pixiv. We implement an illustrator search system based on user impression categories. The impressions of illustrators are estimated from clues in the crowdsourced social-tag annotations on their illustrations. We evaluated our system in terms of normalized discounted cumulative gain and found that using feedback on motifs and impressions for illustrations of relevant illustrators improved illustrator search by 11%.
2484134	Self reinforcement for important passage retrieval In general, centrality-based retrieval models treat all elements of the retrieval space equally, which may reduce their effectiveness. In the specific context of extractive summarization (or important passage retrieval), this means that these models do not take into account that information sources often contain lateral issues, which are hardly as important as the description of the main topic, or are composed by mixtures of topics. We present a new two-stage method that starts by extracting a collection of key phrases that will be used to help centrality-as-relevance retrieval model. We explore several approaches to the integration of the key phrases in the centrality model. The proposed method is evaluated using different datasets that vary in noise (noisy vs clean) and language (Portuguese vs English). Results show that the best variant achieves relative performance improvements of about 31% in clean data and 18% in noisy data.
2484135	Shame to be sham: addressing content-based grey hat search engine optimization We present an initial study identifying a form of content-based grey hat search engine optimization, in which a Web page contains both potentially relevant content and manipulated content: we call such pages sham documents, because they lie in the grey area between 'ham' (clearly normal) and 'spam' (clearly fake). Sham documents are often ranked artificially high in response to certain queries, but also may contain some useful information and cannot be considered as absolute spam. We report a novel annotation effort performed with the ClueWeb09 benchmark where pages were labeled as being spam, sham, or legitimate content. Significant inter-annotator agreement rates support the claim that there are sham documents that are highly ranked by a very effective retrieval approach, yet are not spam. We also present an initial study of predictors that may indicate whether a query is the target of shamming.
2484136	Linking transcribed conversational speech As large collections of historically significant recorded speech become increasingly available, scholars are faced with the challenge of making sense of what they hear. This paper proposes automatically linking conversational speech to related resources as one way of supporting that sense-making task. Experiment results with transcribed conversations suggest that this kind of linking has promise for helping to contextualize recordings of detail-oriented conversations, and that simple sliding-window bag-of-words techniques can identify some useful links.
2484137	Flat vs. hierarchical phrase-based translation models for cross-language information retrieval Although context-independent word-based approaches remain popular for cross-language information retrieval, many recent studies have shown that integrating insights from modern statistical machine translation systems can lead to substantial improvements in effectiveness. In this paper, we compare flat and hierarchical phrase-based translation models for query translation. Both approaches yield significantly better results than either a token-based or a one-best translation baseline on standard test collections. The choice of model manifests interesting tradeoffs in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and model compactness.
2484127	Bias-variance decomposition of ir evaluation It has been recognized that, when an information retrieval (IR) system achieves improvement in mean retrieval effectiveness (e.g. mean average precision (MAP)) over all the queries, the performance (e.g., average precision (AP)) of some individual queries could be hurt, resulting in retrieval instability. Some stability/robustness metrics have been proposed. However, they are often defined separately from the mean effectiveness metric. Consequently, there is a lack of a unified formulation of effectiveness, stability and overall retrieval quality (considering both). In this paper, we present a unified formulation based on the bias-variance decomposition. Correspondingly, a novel evaluation methodology is developed to evaluate the effectiveness and stability in an integrated manner. A case study applying the proposed methodology to evaluation of query language modeling illustrates the usefulness and analytical power of our approach.
2484125	Here and there: goals, activities, and predictions about location from geotagged queries A significant portion of Web search is performed in mobile settings. We explore the links between users' queries on mobile devices and their locations and movement, with a focus on interpreting queries about addresses. We find that users tend to have a primary location, likely corresponding to home or workplace, and that a user's location relative to this primary location systematically influences the patterns of address searches. We apply our findings to construct a statistical model that can predict with high accuracy whether a user will be soon observed at an address that had been recently retrieved via search. Such an ability to predict that a user will transition to a location can be harnessed for multiple uses including provision of directions and traffic information, the rendering of competitive advertising, and guiding the opportunistic completion of pending tasks that can be accomplished en route to a target location.
2484126	Optimizing top-n collaborative filtering via dynamic negative item sampling Collaborative filtering techniques rely on aggregated user preference data to make personalized predictions. In many cases, users are reluctant to explicitly express their preferences and many recommender systems have to infer them from implicit user behaviors, such as clicking a link in a webpage or playing a music track. The clicks and the plays are good for indicating the items a user liked (i.e., positive training examples), but the items a user did not like (negative training examples) are not directly observed. Previous approaches either randomly pick negative training samples from unseen items or incorporate some heuristics into the learning model, leading to a biased solution and a prolonged training period. In this paper, we propose to dynamically choose negative training samples from the ranked list produced by the current prediction model and iteratively update our model. The experiments conducted on three large-scale datasets show that our approach not only reduces the training time, but also leads to significant performance gains.
2484123	Explicit feedback in local search tasks Modern search engines make extensive use of people's contextual information to finesse result rankings. Using a searcher's location provides an especially strong signal for adjusting results for certain classes of queries where people may have clear preference for local results, without explicitly specifying the location in the query direct-ly. However, if the location estimate is inaccurate or searchers want to obtain many results from a particular location, they have limited control on the location focus in the search results returned. In this paper we describe a user study that examines the effect of offering searchers more control over how local preferences are gathered and used. We studied providing users with functionality to offer explicit relevance feedback (ERF) adjacent to results automatically identi-fied as location-dependent (i.e., more from this location). They can use this functionality to indicate whether they are interested in a particular search result and desire more results from that result's location. We compared the ERF system against a baseline (NoERF) that used the same underlying mechanisms to retrieve and rank results, but did not offer ERF support. User performance was as-sessed across 12 experimental participants over 12 location-sensitive topics, in a fully counter-balanced design. We found that participants interacted with ERF frequently, and there were signs that ERF has the potential to improve success rates and lead to more efficient searching for location-sensitive search tasks than NoERF.
2484124	Mining web search topics with diverse spatiotemporal patterns Mining the latent topics from web search data and capturing their spatiotemporal patterns have many applications in information retrieval. As web search is heavily influenced by the spatial and temporal factors, the latent topics usually demonstrate a variety of spatiotemporal patterns. In the face of the diversity of these patterns, existing models are increasingly ineffective, since they capture only one dimension of the spatiotemporal patterns (either the spatial or temporal dimension) or simply assume that there exists only one kind of spatiotemporal patterns. Such oversimplification risks distorting the latent data structure and hindering the downstream usage of the discovered topics. In this paper, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Search Topic Model (SSTM) to discover the latent topics from web search data with capturing their diverse spatiotemporal patterns simultaneously. The SSTM can flexibly support diverse spatiotemporal patterns and seamlessly integrate the unique features in web search such as query words, URLs, timestamps and search sessions. The SSTM is demonstrated as an effective exploratory tool for large-scale web search data and it performs superiorly in quantitative comparisons to several state-of-the-art topic models.
2484121	Composition of TF normalizations: new insights on scoring functions for ad hoc IR Previous papers in ad hoc IR reported that scoring functions should satisfy a set of heuristic retrieval constraints, providing a mathematical justification for the normalizations historically applied to the term frequency (TF). In this paper, we propose a further level of abstraction, claiming that the successive normalizations are carried out through composition. Thus we introduce a principled framework that fully explains BM25 as a variant of TF-IDF with an inverse order of function composition. Our experiments over standard datasets indicate that the respective orders of composition chosen in the original papers for both TF-IDF and BM25 are the most effective ones. Moreover, since the order is different between the two models, they also demonstrated that the order is instrumental in the design of weighting models. In fact, while considering more complex scoring functions such as BM25+, we discovered a novel weighting model in terms of order of composition that consistently outperforms all the rest. Our contribution here is twofold: we provide a unifying mathematical framework for IR and a novel scoring function discovered using this framework.
2484122	Interoperability ranking for mobile applications At present, most major app marketplaces perform ranking and recommendation based on search relevance features or marketplace ``popularity'' statistics. For instance, they check similarity between app descriptions and user search queries, or rank-order the apps according to statistics such as number of downloads, user ratings etc. Rankings derived from such signals, important as they are, are insufficient to capture the dynamics of the apps ecosystem. Consider for example the questions: In a particular user context, is app A more likely to be launched than app B? Or does app C provide complementary functionality to app D-- Answering these questions requires identifying and analyzing the dependencies between apps in the apps ecosystem. Ranking mechanisms that reflect such interdependences are thus necessary. In this paper we introduce the notion of interoperability ranking for mobile applications. Intuitively, apps with high rank are such apps which are inferred to be somehow important to other apps in the ecosystem. We demonstrate how interoperability ranking can help answer the above questions and also provide the basis for solving several problems which are rapidly attracting the attention of both researchers and the industry, such as building personalized real-time app recommender systems or intelligent mobile agents. We describe a set of methods for computing interoperability ranks and analyze their performance on real data from the Windows Phone app marketplace.
2484120	Commodity query by snapping Commodity information such as prices and public reviews is always the concern of consumers. Helping them conveniently acquire these information as an instant reference is often of practical significance for their purchase activities. Nowadays, Web 2.0, linked data clouds, and the pervasiveness of smart hand held devices have created opportunities for this demand, i.e., users could just snap a photo of any commodity that is of interest at anytime and anywhere, and retrieve the relevant information via their Internet-linked mobile devices. Nonetheless, compared with the traditional keyword-based information retrieval, extracting the hidden information related to the commodities in photos is a much more complicated and challenging task, involving techniques such as pattern recognition, knowledge base construction, semantic comprehension, and statistic deduction. In this paper, we propose a framework to address this issue by leveraging on various techniques, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this framework with experiments on a prototype.
2484117	Report from the NTCIR-10 1CLICK-2 Japanese subtask: baselines, upperbounds and evaluation robustness The One Click Access Task (1CLICK) of NTCIR requires systems to return a concise multi-document summary of web pages in response to a query which is assumed to have been submitted in a mobile context. Systems are evaluated based on information units (or iUnits), and are required to present important pieces of information first and to minimise the amount of text the user has to read. Using the official Japanese results of the second round of the 1CLICK task from NTCIR-10, we discuss our task setting and evaluation framework. Our analyses show that: (1) Simple baseline methods that leverage search engine snippets or Wikipedia are effective for 'lookup' type queries but not necessarily for other query types; (2) There is still a substantial gap between manual and automatic runs; and (3) Our evaluation metrics are relatively robust to the incompleteness of iUnits.
2484118	Leveraging viewer comments for mood classification of music video clips This short paper proposes a method to classify music video clips uploaded to a video sharing service into music mood categories such as 'cheerful,' 'wistful,' and 'aggressive.' The method leverages viewer comments posted to the music video clips for the music mood classification. It extracts specific features from the comments: (1) adjectives in comments, (2) lengthened words in comments, and (3) comments in chorus sections. Our experimental results classifying 695 video clips into six mood categories showed that our method outperformed the baseline in terms of macro and micro averaged F-measures. In addition, our method outperformed the existing approaches that utilize lyrics and audio signals of songs.
2484112	Displaying relevance scores for search results Internet search engines typically compute a relevance score for webpages given the query terms, and then rank the pages by decreasing relevance scores. The popular search engines do not, however, present the relevance scores that were computed during this process. We suggest that these relevance scores may contain information that can help users make conscious decisions. In this paper we evaluate in a user study how users react to the display of such scores. The results indicate that users understand graphical displays of relevance, and make decisions based on these scores. Our results suggest that in the context of exploratory search, relevance scores may cause users to explore more search results.
2484113	Ranking-oriented nearest-neighbor based method for automatic image annotation Automatic image annotation plays a critical role in keyword-based image retrieval systems. Recently, the nearest-neighbor based scheme has been proposed and achieved good performance for image annotation. Given a new image, the scheme is to first find its most similar neighbors from labeled images, and then propagate the keywords associated with the neighbors to it. Many studies focused on designing a suitable distance metric between images so that all labeled images can be ranked by their distance to the given image. However, higher accuracy in distance prediction does not necessarily lead to better ordering of labeled images. In this paper, we propose a ranking-oriented neighbor search mechanism to rank labeled images directly without going through the intermediate step of distance prediction. In particular, a new learning to rank algorithm is developed, which exploits the implicit preference information of labeled images and underlines the accuracy of the top-ranked results. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image annotation.
2484114	IRWR: incremental random walk with restart Random Walk with Restart (RWR) has become an appealing measure of node proximities in emerging applications eg recommender systems and automatic image captioning. In practice, a real graph is typically large, and is frequently updated with small changes. It is often cost-inhibitive to recompute proximities from scratch via emph{batch} algorithms when the graph is updated. This paper focuses on the incremental computations of RWR in a dynamic graph, whose edges often change over time. The prior attempt of RWR [1] deploys kdash to find top-$k$ highest proximity nodes for a given query, which involves a strategy to incrementally emph{estimate} upper proximity bounds. However, due to its aim to prune needless calculation, such an incremental strategy is emph{approximate}: in $O(1)$ time for each node. The main contribution of this paper is to devise an emph{exact} and fast incremental algorithm of RWR for edge updates. Our solution, IRWR!, can incrementally compute any node proximity in $O(1)$ time for each edge update without loss of exactness. The empirical evaluations show the high efficiency and exactness of IRWR for computing proximities on dynamic networks against its batch counterparts.
2484115	Interpretation of coordinations, compound generation, and result fusion for query variants We investigate interpreting coordinations (e.g. word sequences connected with coordinating conjunctions such as "and" and "or") as logical disjunctions of terms to generate a set of disjunctionfree query variants for information retrieval (IR) queries. In addition, so-called hyphen coordinations are resolved by generating full compound forms and rephrasing the original query, e.g. "rice im-and export" is transformed into "rice import and export". Query variants are then processed separately and retrieval results are merged using a standard data fusion technique. We evaluate the approach on German standard IR benchmarking data. The results show that: i) Our proposed approach to generate compounds from hyphen coordinations produces the correct results for all test topics. ii) Our proposed heuristics to identify coordinations and generate query variants based on shallow natural language processing (NLP) techniques is highly accurate on the topics and does not rely on parsing or part-of-speech tagging. iii) Using query variants to produce multiple retrieval results and merging the results decreases precision at top ranks. However, in combination with blind relevance feedback (BRF), this approach can show significant improvement over the standard BRF baseline using the original queries.
2484110	An LDA-smoothed relevance model for document expansion: a case study for spoken document retrieval Document expansion (DE) in information retrieval (IR) involves modifying each document in the collection by introducing additional terms into the document. It is particularly useful to improve retrieval of short and noisy documents where the additional terms can improve the description of the document content. Existing approaches to DE assume that documents to be expanded are from a single topic. In the case of multi-topic documents this can lead to a topic bias in terms selected for DE and hence may result in poor retrieval quality due to the lack of coverage of the original document topics in the expanded document. This paper proposes a new DE technique providing a more uniform selection and weighting of DE terms from all constituent topics. We show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the most recently reported relevance model based DE method on a spoken document retrieval task for both manual and automatic speech recognition transcripts.
2484111	Kinship contextualization: utilizing the preceding and following structural elements The textual context of an element, structurally, contains traces of evidences. Utilizing this context in scoring is called contextualization. In this study we hypothesize that the context of an XML-element originated from its textit{preceding} and textit{following} elements in the sequential ordering of a document improves the quality of retrieval. In the tree form of the document's structure, textit{kinship} contextualization means, contextualization based on the horizontal and vertical elements in the textit{kinship tree,} or elements in closer to a wider structural kinship. We have tested several variants of kinship contextualization and verified notable improvements in comparison with the baseline system and gold standards in the retrieval of focused elements.
2484104	Summary of the NTCIR-10 INTENT-2 task: subtopic mining and search result diversification The NTCIR INTENT task comprises two subtasks: {em Subtopic Mining}, where systems are required to return a ranked list of {em subtopic strings} for each given query; and {em Document Ranking}, where systems are required to return a diversified web search result for each given query. This paper summarises the novel features of the Second INTENT task at NTCIR-10 and its main findings, and poses some questions for future diversified search evaluation.
2484103	Timeline generation with social attention Timeline generation is an important research task which can help users to have a quick understanding of the overall evolution of any given topic. It thus attracts much attention from research communities in recent years. Nevertheless, existing work on timeline generation often ignores an important factor, the attention attracted to topics of interest (hereafter termed "social attention"). Without taking into consideration social attention, the generated timelines may not reflect users' collective interests. In this paper, we study how to incorporate social attention in the generation of timeline summaries. In particular, for a given topic, we capture social attention by learning users' collective interests in the form of word distributions from Twitter, which are subsequently incorporated into a unified framework for timeline summary generation. We construct four evaluation sets over six diverse topics. We demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to generate both informative and interesting timelines. Our work sheds light on the feasibility of incorporating social attention into traditional text mining tasks.
2484102	Modeling the uniqueness of the user preferences for recommendation systems In this paper we propose a novel framework for modeling the uniqueness of the user preferences for recommendation systems. User uniqueness is determined by learning to what extent the user's item preferences deviate from those of an "average user" in the system. Based on this framework, we suggest three different recommendation strategies that trade between uniqueness and conformity. Using two real item datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our uniqueness based recommendation framework.
2484108	Tagcloud-based explanation with feedback for recommender systems Personalized recommender systems aim to push only the relevant items and information directly to the users without requiring them to browse through millions of web resources. The challenge of these systems is to achieve a high user acceptance rate on their recommendations. In this paper, we aim to increase the user acceptance of recommendations by providing more intuitive tag-based explanations of why the items are recommended. Tags are used as intermediary entities that not only relate target users to the recommended items but also understand users' intents. Our system also allows tag-based online relevance feedback. Experiment results on the Movielens dataset show that the proposed approach is able to increase the acceptance rate of recommendations and improve user satisfaction.
2484107	Estimating query representativeness for query-performance prediction The query-performance prediction (QPP) task is estimating retrieval effectiveness with no relevance judgments. We present a novel probabilistic framework for QPP that gives rise to an important aspect that was not addressed in previous work; namely, the extent to which the query effectively represents the information need for retrieval. Accordingly, we devise a few query-representativeness measures that utilize relevance language models. Experiments show that integrating the most effective measures with state-of-the-art predictors in our framework often yields prediction quality that significantly transcends that of using the predictors alone.
2484106	A novel topic model for automatic term extraction Automatic term extraction (ATE) aims at extracting domain-specific terms from a corpus of a certain domain. Termhood is one essential measure for judging whether a phrase is a term. Previous researches on termhood mainly depend on the word frequency information. In this paper, we propose to compute termhood based on semantic representation of words. A novel topic model, namely i-SWB, is developed to map the domain corpus into a latent semantic space, which is composed of some general topics, a background topic and a documents-specific topic. Experiments on four domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ATE approaches.
2484109	Finding knowledgeable groups in enterprise corpora The task of finding groups is a natural extension of search tasks aimed at retrieving individual entities. We introduce a group finding task: given a query topic, find knowledgeable groups that have expertise on that topic. We present four general strategies to this task. The models are formalized using generative language models. Two of the models aggregate expertise scores of the experts in the same group for the task, one locates documents associated with experts in the group and then determines how closely the documents are associated with the topic, whilst the remaining model directly estimates the degree to which a group is a knowledgeable group for a given topic. We construct a test collections based on the TREC 2005 and 2006 Enterprise collections. We find significant differences between different ways of estimating the association between a topic and a group. Experiments show that our knowledgeable group finding models achieve high absolute scores.
2484195	Searching in the city of knowledge: challenges and recent developments Today plenty of data is emerging from various city systems. Beyond the classical Web resources, large amounts of data are retrieved from sensors, devices, social networks, governmental applications, or service networks. In such a diversity of information, answering specific information needs of city inhabitants requires holistic IR techniques, capable of harnessing different types of city data and turned it into actionable insights to answer different queries. This tutorial will present deep insights, challenges, opportunities and techniques to make heterogeneous city data searchable and show how emerging IR techniques models can be employed to retrieve relevant information for the citizens.
2484194	Multimedia recommendation: technology and techniques In recent years, we have witnessed a rapid growth in the availability of digital multimedia on various application platforms and domains. Consequently, the problem of information overload has become more and more serious. In order to tackle the challenge, various multimedia recommendation technologies have been developed by different research communities (e.g., multimedia systems, information retrieval, machine learning and computer version). Meanwhile, many commercial web systems (e.g., Flick, YouTube, and Last.fm) have successfully applied recommendation techniques to provide users personalized content and services in a convenient and flexible way. When looking back, the information retrieval (IR) community has a long history of studying and contributing recommender system design and related issues. It has been proven that the recommender systems can effectively assist users in handling information overload and provide high-quality personalization. While several courses were dedicated to multimedia retrieval in the recent decade, to the best of our knowledge, the tutorial is the first one specifically focusing on multimedia recommender systems and their applications on various domains and media contents. We plan to summarize the research along this direction and provide an impetus for further research on this important topic
2484193	Music similarity and retrieval This tutorial serves as an introductory course to the field of and state-of-the-art in music information retrieval (MIR) and in particular to music similarity estimation which is an essential component of music retrieval. Apart from explaining approaches that estimate similarity based on acoustic properties of an audio signal, we review methods that exploit (mostly textual) meta-data from the Web to build representations of music then used for similarity calculation. Additionally, topics such as (large-scale) music indexing, information extraction for music, personalization in music retrieval, and evaluation of MIR systems are addressed.
2484192	The cluster hypothesis in information retrieval 
2484191	Designing search usability Search is not just a box and ten blue links. Search is a journey: an exploration where what we encounter along the way changes what we seek. But in order to guide people along this journey, we must understand both the art and science of search experience design. The aim of this tutorial is to deliver a course grounded in good scholarship, integrating the latest research findings with insights derived from the practical experience of designing and optimizing an extensive range of commercial search applications. It focuses on the development of transferable, practical skills that can be learnt and practiced within a half-day session.
2484190	Building test collections: an interactive tutorial for students and others without their own evaluation conference series While existing test collections and evaluation conference efforts may sufficiently support one's research, one can easily find oneself wanting to solve problems no one else is solving yet. But how can research in IR be done (or be published!) without solid data and experiments? Not everyone can talk TREC, CLEF, INEX, or NTCIR into running a track to build a collection. This tutorial aims to teach how to build a test collection using resources at hand, how to measure the quality of that collection, how to understand its limitations, and how to communicate them. The intended audience is advanced students who find themselves in need of a test collection, or actually in the process of building a test collection, to support their own research. The goal of this tutorial is to lay out issues, procedures, pitfalls, and practical advice.
2484198	SearchResultFinder: federated search made easy Building a federated search engine based on a large number existing web search engines is a challenge: implementing the programming interface (API) for each search engine is an exacting and time-consuming job. In this demonstration we present SearchResultFinder, a browser plugin which speeds up determining reusable XPaths for extracting search result items from HTML search result pages. Based on a single search result page, the tool presents a ranked list of candidate extraction XPaths and allows highlighting to view the extraction result. An evaluation with 148 web search engines shows that in 90% of the cases a correct XPath is suggested.
2484199	BATC: a benchmark for aggregation techniques in crowdsourcing As the volumes of AI problems involving human knowledge are likely to soar, crowdsourcing has become essential in a wide range of world-wide-web applications. One of the biggest challenges of crowdsourcing is aggregating the answers collected from crowd workers; and thus, many aggregate techniques have been proposed. However, given a new application, it is difficult for users to choose the best-suited technique as well as appropriate parameter values since each of these techniques has distinct performance characteristics depending on various factors (e.g. worker expertise, question difficulty). In this paper, we develop a benchmarking tool that allows to (i) simulate the crowd and (ii) evaluate aggregate techniques in different aspects (accuracy, sensitivity to spammers, etc.). We believe that this tool will be able to serve as a practical guideline for both researchers and software developers. While researchers can use our tool to assess existing or new techniques, developers can reuse its components to reduce the development complexity.
2484196	Kernel-based learning to rank with syntactic and semantic structures Kernel Methods (KMs) are powerful machine learning techniques that can alleviate the data representation problem as they substitute scalar product between feature vectors with similarity functions (kernels) directly defined between data instances, e.g., syntactic trees, (thus features are not needed any longer). This tutorial aims at introducing essential and simplified theory of Support Vector Machines and KMs for the design of practical applications. It will describe effective kernels for easily engineering automatic classifiers and learning to rank algorithms using structured data and semantic processing. Some examples will be drawn from Question Answering, Passage Re-ranking, Short and Long Text Categorization, Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, Co-Reference Resolution. Moreover, some practical demonstrations will be given using the SVM-Light-TK (tree kernel) toolkit.
2484197	Accurate and robust text detection: a step-in for text retrieval in natural scene images We propose and implement a robust text detection system, which is a prominent step-in for text retrieval in natural scene images or videos. Our system includes several key components: (1) A fast and effective pruning algorithm is designed to extract Maximally Stable Extremal Regions as character candidates using the strategy of minimizing regularized variations. (2) Character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm, where distance weights and threshold of clustering are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm. (3) The posterior probabilities of text candidates corresponding to non-text are estimated with an character classifier; text candidates with high probabilities are then eliminated and finally texts are identified with a text classifier. The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition dataset and a publicly available multilingual dataset; the f measures are over 76% and 74% which are significantly better than the state-of-the-art performances of 71% and 65%, respectively.
2484180	A weakly-supervised detection of entity central documents in a stream Filtering a time-ordered corpus for documents that are highly relevant to an entity is a task receiving more and more attention over the years. One application is to reduce the delay between the moment an information about an entity is being first observed and the moment the entity entry in a knowledge base is being updated. Current state-of-the-art approaches are highly supervised and require training examples for each entity monitored. We propose an approach which does not require new training data when processing a new entity. To capture intrinsic characteristics of highly relevant documents our approach relies on three types of features: document centric features, entity profile related features and time features. Evaluated within the framework of the "Knowledge Base Acceleration" track at TREC 2012, it outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.
2484181	From keywords to keyqueries: content descriptors for the web We introduce the concept of keyqueries as dynamic content descriptors for documents. Keyqueries are defined implicitly by the index and the retrieval model of a reference search engine: keyqueries for a document are the minimal queries that return the document in the top result ranks. Besides applications in the fields of information retrieval and data mining, keyqueries have the potential to form the basis of a dynamic classification system for future digital libraries---the modern version of keywords for content description. To determine the keyqueries for a document, we present an exhaustive search algorithm along with effective pruning strategies. For applications where a small number of diverse keyqueries is sufficient, two tailored search strategies are proposed. Our experiments emphasize the role of the reference search engine and show the potential of keyqueries as innovative document descriptors for large, fast evolving bodies of digital content such as the web.
2484183	Competition-based networks for expert finding Finding experts in question answering platforms has important applications, such as question routing or identification of best answers. Addressing the problem of ranking users with respect to their expertise, we propose Competition-Based Expertise Networks (CBEN), a novel community expertise network structure based on the principle of competition among the answerers of a question. We evaluate our approach on a very large dataset from Yahoo! Answers using a variety of centrality measures. We show that it outperforms state-of-the-art network structures and, unlike previous methods, is able to consistly outperform simple metrics like best answer count. We also analyse question answering forums in Yahoo! Answers, and show that they can be characterised by factual or subjective information seeking behavior, social discussions and the conducting of polls or surveys. We find that the ability to identify experts greatly depends on the type of forum, which is directly reflected in the structural properties of the expertise networks.
2484184	#trapped!: social media search system requirements for emergency management professionals Social media provides a new and potentially rich source of information for emergency management services. However, extracting the relevant information from such streams poses a number of difficult challenges. In this short paper, we survey emergency management professionals to ascertain how social media is used when responding to incidents, the search strategies that they undertake, and the challenges that they face when using social media streams. This research indicates that emergency management professionals employ two main strategies when searching social media streams: keyword-centric and account-centric search strategies. Furthermore, current search interfaces are inadequate regarding the requirements of command and control environments in the emergency management domain, where the process of information seeking is collaborative in nature and needs to support multiple information seekers.
2484186	Fresh BrowseRank In the last years, a lot of attention was attracted by the problem of page authority computation based on user browsing behavior. However, the proposed methods have a number of limitations. In particular, they run on a single snapshot of a user browsing graph ignoring substantially dynamic nature of user browsing activity, which makes such methods recency unaware. This paper proposes a new method for computing page importance, referred to as Fresh BrowseRank. The score of a page by our algorithm equals to the weight in a stationary distribution of a flexible random walk, which is controlled by recency-sensitive weights of vertices and edges. Our method generalizes some previous approaches, provides better capability for capturing the dynamics of the Web and users behavior, and overcomes essential limitations of BrowseRank. The experimental results demonstrate that our method enables to achieve more relevant and fresh ranking results than the classic BrowseRank.
2484185	Studying page life patterns in dynamical web With the ever-increasing speed of content turnover on the web, it is particularly important to understand the patterns that pages' popularity follows. This paper focuses on the dynamical part of the web, i.e. pages that have a limited lifespan and experience a short popularity outburst within it. We classify these pages into five patterns based on how quickly they gain popularity and how quickly they lose it. We study the properties of pages that belong to each pattern and determine content topics that contain disproportionately high fractions of particular patterns. These developments are utilized to create an algorithm that approximates with reasonable accuracy the expected popularity pattern of a web page based on its URL and, if available, prior knowledge about its domain's topics.
2484188	Entity linking and retrieval This full-day tutorial presents a comprehensive introduction to entity linking and retrieval. Part I provides a detailed overview of entity linking: identifying and disambiguating entity occurrences in unstructured text. Part II focuses on entity retrieval, by first considering scenarios where explicit representations of entities are available, and then moving to a setting where evidence needs to be collected and aggregated from multiple documents or even collections, thereby combining techniques from both entity linking and entity retrieval. Part III concludes the tutorial with an overview and hands-on comparative analysis of applications and publicly available toolkits and web services.
2484187	Diversity and novelty in information retrieval This tutorial aims to provide a unifying account of current research on diversity and novelty in different IR domains, namely, in the context of search engines, recommender systems, and data streams.
2484170	A document rating system for preference judgements High quality relevance judgments are essential for the evaluation of information retrieval systems. Traditional methods of collecting relevance judgments are based on collecting binary or graded nominal judgments, but such judgments are limited by factors such as inter-assessor disagreement and the arbitrariness of grades. Previous research has shown that it is easier for assessors to make pairwise preference judgments. However, unless the preferences collected are largely transitive, it is not clear how to combine them in order to obtain document relevance scores. Another difficulty is that the number of pairs that need to be assessed is quadratic in the number of documents. In this work, we consider the problem of inferring document relevance scores from pairwise preference judgments by analogy to tournaments using the Elo rating system. We show how to combine a linear number of pairwise preference judgments from multiple assessors to compute relevance scores for every document.
2484171	Query change as relevance feedback in session search Session search is the Information Retrieval (IR) task that performs document retrieval for an entire session. During a session, users often change queries to explore and investigate the information needs. In this paper, we propose to use query change as a new form of relevance feedback for better session search. Evaluation conducted over TREC 2012 Session Track shows that query change is a highly effective form of feedback as compared with existing relevance feedback methods. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art relevance feedback methods for the TREC 2012 Session Track by a significant improvement of &#62;25%.
2484177	Learning to combine representations for medical records search The complexity of medical terminology raises challenges when searching medical records. For example, 'cancer', 'tumour', and 'neoplasms', which are synonyms, may prevent a traditional search system from retrieving relevant records that contain only synonyms of the query terms. Prior works use bag-of-concepts approaches, to deal with this by representing medical terms sharing the same meanings using concepts from medical resources (e.g. MeSH). The relevance scores are then combined with a traditional bag-of-words representation, when inferring the relevance of medical records. Even though the existing approaches are effective, the predicted retrieval effectiveness of either the bag-of-words or bag-of-concepts representation, which may be used to effectively model the score combination and hence improve retrieval performance, is not taken into account. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework that models the importance of the bag-of-words and the bag-of-concepts representations, combining their scores on a per-query basis. Our proposed framework leverages retrieval performance predictors, such as the clarity score and AvIDF, calculated on both representations as learning features. We evaluate our proposed framework using the TREC Medical Records track's test collections. As our proposed framework can significantly outperform an existing approach that linearly merges the relevance scores, we conclude that retrieval performance predictors can be effectively leveraged when combining the relevance scores.
2484176	Collaborative factorization for recommender systems Recommender system has become an effective tool for information filtering, which usually provides the most useful items to users by a top-k ranking list. Traditional recommendation techniques such as Nearest Neighbors (NN) and Matrix Factorization (MF) have been widely used in real recommender systems. However, neither approaches can well accomplish recommendation task since that: (1) most NN methods leverage the neighbor's behaviors for prediction, which may suffer the severe data sparsity problem; (2) MF methods are less sensitive to sparsity, but neighbors' influences on latent factors are not fully explored, since the latent factors are often used independently. To overcome the above problems, we propose a new framework for recommender systems, called collaborative factorization. It expresses the user as the combination of his own factors and those of the neighbors', called collaborative latent factors, and a ranking loss is then utilized for optimization. The advantage of our approach is that it can both enjoy the merits of NN and MF methods. In this paper, we take the logistic loss in RankNet and the likelihood loss in ListMLE as examples, and the corresponding collaborative factorization methods are called CoF-Net and CoF-MLE. Our experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that they are more effective than several state-of-the-art recommendation methods.
2484175	An adaptive evidence weighting method for medical record search In this paper, we present a medical record search system which is useful for identifying cohorts required in clinical studies. In particular, we propose a query-adaptive weighting method that can dynamically aggregate and score evidence in multiple medical reports (from different hospital departments or from different tests within the same department) of a patient. Furthermore, we explore several informative features for learning our retrieval model.
2484174	Boosting novelty for biomedical information retrieval through probabilistic latent semantic analysis In information retrieval, we are interested in the information that is not only relevant but also novel. In this paper, we study how to boost novelty for biomedical information retrieval through probabilistic latent semantic analysis. We conduct the study based on TREC Genomics Track data. In TREC Genomics Track, each topic is considered to have an arbitrary number of aspects, and the novelty of a piece of information retrieved, called a passage, is assessed based on the amount of new aspects it contains. In particular, the aspect performance of a ranked list is rewarded by the number of new aspects reached at each rank and penalized by the amount of irrelevant passages that are rated higher than the novel ones. Therefore, to improve aspect performance, we should reach as many aspects as possible and as early as possible. In this paper, we make a preliminary study on how probabilistic latent semantic analysis can help capture different aspects of a ranked list, and improve its performance by re-ranking. Experiments indicate that the proposed approach can greatly improve the aspect-level performance over baseline algorithm Okapi BM25.
2484179	Informational friend recommendation in social media It is well recognized that users rely on social media (e.g. Twitter or Digg) to fulfill two common needs (i.e. social need and informational need) that is to keep in touch with their friends in the real world and to have access to information they are interested in. Traditional friend recommendation methods in social media mainly focus on a user's social need, but seldom address their informational need (i.e. suggesting friends that can provide information one may be interested in but have not been able to obtain so far). In this paper, we propose to recommend friends according to the informational utility, which stands for the degree to which a friend satisfies the target user's unfulfilled informational need, called informational friend recommendation. In order to capture users' informational need, we view a post in social media as an item and utilize collaborative filtering techniques to predict the rating for each post. The candidate friends are then ranked according to their informational utility for recommendation. In addition, we also show how to further consider diversity in such recommendations. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform the traditional friend recommendation methods under informational evaluation measures.
2484178	Characterizing stages of a multi-session complex search task through direct and indirect query modifications Search systems use context to effectively satisfy a user's information need as expressed by a query. Tasks are important factors in determining user context during search and many studies have been conducted that identify tasks and task stages through users' interaction behavior with search systems. The type of interaction available to users, however, depends on the type of search interface features available. Queries are the most pervasive input from users to express their information need regardless of the input method, e.g., typing keywords or clicking facets. Instead of characterizing interaction behavior in terms of interface specific components, we propose to characterize users' search behavior in terms of two types of query modification: (i) direct modification, which refers to reformulations of queries; and (ii) indirect modification, which refers to user operations on additional input components provided by various search interfaces. We investigate the utility of characterizing task stages through direct and indirect query reformulations in a case study and find that it is possible to effectively differentiate subsequent stages of the search task. We found that describing user interaction behavior in such a generic form allowed us to relate user actions to search task stages independent from the specific search interface deployed. The next step will then be to validate this idea in a setting with a wider palette of search tasks and tools.
2484160	On contextual photo tag recommendation Image tagging is a growing application on social media websites, however, the performance of many auto-tagging methods are often poor. Recent work has exploited an image's context (e.g. time and location) in the tag recommendation process, where tags which co-occur highly within a given time interval or geographical area are promoted. These models, however, fail to address how and when different image contexts can be combined. In this paper, we propose a weighted tag recommendation model, building on an existing state-of-the-art, which varies the importance of time and location in the recommendation process, based on a given set of input tags. By retrieving more temporally and geographically relevant tags, we achieve statistically significant improvements to recommendation accuracy when testing on 519k images collected from Flickr. The result of this paper is an important step towards more effective image annotation and retrieval systems.
2484162	Neighbourhood preserving quantisation for LSH We introduce a scheme for optimally allocating multiple bits per hyperplane for Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Existing approaches binarise LSH projections by thresholding at zero yielding a single bit per dimension. We demonstrate that this is a sub-optimal bit allocation approach that can easily destroy the neighbourhood structure in the original feature space. Our proposed method, dubbed Neighbourhood Preserving Quantization (NPQ), assigns multiple bits per hyperplane based upon adaptively learned thresholds. NPQ exploits a pairwise affinity matrix to discretise each dimension such that nearest neighbours in the original feature space fall within the same quantisation thresholds and are therefore assigned identical bits. NPQ is not only applicable to LSH, but can also be applied to any low-dimensional projection scheme. Despite using half the number of hyperplanes, NPQ is shown to improve LSH-based retrieval accuracy by up to 65% compared to the state-of-the-art.
2484169	Temporal variance of intents in multi-faceted event-driven information needs Time is often important for understanding user intent during search activity, especially for information needs related to event-driven topics. Diversity for multi-faceted information needs ensures that ranked documents optimally cover multiple facets when a user's intent is uncertain. Effective diversity is reliant on methods to (i) discover and represent facets, and (ii) determine how likely each facet is the user's intent (i.e., its popularity). Past work has developed several techniques addressing these issues, however, they have concentrated on static approaches which do not consider the temporal nature of new and evolving intents and their popularity. In many cases, what a user expects may change dramatically over time as events develop. In this work we study the temporal variance of search intents for event-driven information needs using Wikipedia. First, we model intents based upon the structure represented by the section hierarchy of Wikipedia articles closely related to the information need. Using this technique, we investigate whether temporal changes in the content structure, i.e. in a section's text, reflect the temporal popularity of the intent. We map intents taken from a query-log (as ground-truth) to Wikipedia article sections and found that a large proportion are indeed reflected in topic-related article structure. By correlating the change activity of each section with the use of the intent query over time, we found that section change activity does reflect temporal popularity of many intents. Furthermore, we show that popularity between intents changes over time for event-driven topics.
2484164	Towards retrieving relevant information graphics Information retrieval research has made significant progress in the retrieval of text documents and images. However, relatively little attention has been given to the retrieval of information graphics (non-pictorial images such as bar charts and line graphs) despite their proliferation in popular media such as newspapers and magazines. Our goal is to build a system for retrieving bar charts and line graphs that reasons about the content of the graphic itself in deciding its relevance to the user query. This paper presents the first steps toward such a system, with a focus on identifying the category of intended message of potentially relevant bar charts and line graphs. Our learned model achieves accuracy higher than 80% on a corpus of collected user queries.
2484159	Sequential testing in classifier evaluation yields biased estimates of effectiveness It is common to develop and validate classifiers through a process of repeated testing, with nested training and/or test sets of increasing size. We demonstrate in this paper that such repeated testing leads to biased estimates of classifier effectiveness. Experiments on a range of text classification tasks under three sequential testing frameworks show all three lead to optimistic estimates of effectiveness. We calculate empirical adjustments to unbias estimates on our data set, and identify directions for research that could lead to general techniques for avoiding bias while reducing labeling costs.
2484158	Who will retweet me?: finding retweeters in twitter An important aspect of communication in Twitter (and other Social Network is message propagation -- people creating posts for others to share. Although there has been work on modelling how tweets in Twitter are propagated (retweeted), an untackled problem has been who will retweet a message. Here we consider the task of finding who will retweet a message posted on Twitter. Within a learning to-rank framework, we explore a wide range of features, such as retweet history, followers status, followers active time and followers interests. We find that followers who retweeted or mentioned the author's tweets frequently before and have common interests are more likely to be retweeters.
2484157	Author disambiguation by hierarchical agglomerative clustering with adaptive stopping criterion Entity disambiguation is an important step in many information retrieval applications. This paper proposes new research for entity disambiguation with the focus of name disambiguation in digital libraries. In particular, pairwise similarity is first learned for publications that share the same author name string (ANS) and then a novel Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering approach with Adaptive Stopping Criterion (HACASC) is proposed to adaptively cluster a set of publications that share a same ANS to individual clusters of publications with different author identities. The HACASC approach utilizes a mixture of kernel ridge regressions to intelligently determine the threshold in clustering. This obtains more appropriate clustering granularity than non-adaptive stopping criterion. We conduct a large scale empirical study with a dataset of more than 2 million publication record pairs to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed HACASC approach.
2484155	Recommending personalized touristic sights using google places The purpose of the Contextual Suggestion track, an evaluation task at the TREC 2012 conference, is to suggest personalized tourist activities to an individual, given a certain location and time. In our content-based approach, we collected initial recommendations using the location context as search query in Google Places. We first ranked the recommendations based on their textual similarity to the user profiles. In order to improve the ranking of popular sights, we combined the initial ranking with rankings based on Google Search, popularity and categories. Finally, we performed filtering based on the temporal context. Overall, our system performed well above average and median, and outperformed the baseline - Google Places only -- run.
2484154	A study on the accuracy of Flickr's geotag data Obtaining geographically tagged multimedia items from social Web platforms such as Flickr is beneficial for a variety of applications including the automatic creation of travelogues and personalized travel recommendations. In order to take advantage of the large number of photos and videos that do not contain (GPS-based) latitude/longitude coordinates, a number of approaches have been proposed to estimate the geographic location where they were taken. Such location estimation methods rely on existing geotagged multimedia items as training data. Across application and usage scenarios, it is commonly assumed that the available geotagged items contain (reasonably) accurate latitude/longitude coordinates. Here, we consider this assumption and investigate how accurate the provided location data is. We conduct a study of Flickr images and videos and find that the accuracy of the geotag information is highly dependent on the popularity of the location: images/videos taken at popular (unpopular) locations, are likely to be geotagged with a high (low) degree of accuracy with respect to the ground truth.
2484153	Exploring semi-automatic nugget extraction for Japanese one click access evaluation Building test collections based on nuggets is useful evaluating systems that return documents, answers, or summaries. However, nugget construction requires a lot of manual work and is not feasible for large query sets. Towards an efficient and scalable nugget-based evaluation, we study the applicability of semi-automatic nugget extraction in the context of the ongoing NTCIR  One Click Access (1CLICK) task. We compare manually-extracted and semi-automatically-extracted Japanese nuggets to demonstrate the coverage and efficiency of the semi-automatic nugget extraction. Our findings suggest that the manual nugget extraction can be replaced with a direct adaptation of the English semi-automatic nugget extraction system, especially for queries for which the user desires broad answers from free-form text.
2484152	Is uncertain logical-matching equivalent to conditional probability? Logic-based Information Retrieval (IR) models represent the retrieval decision as a logical implication d-&#62;q between a document d and a query q, where d and q are logical sentences. However, d-&#62;q is a binary decision, we thus need a measure to estimate the degree to which d implies q, denoted P(d-&#62;q). In this study, we revisit the Van Rijsbergen's assumptions about: 1- the logical implication -&#62;' is not the material one, and 2- P(d-&#62;q) could be estimated by the conditional probability P(q|d). More precisely, we claim that the material implication is an appropriate implication for IR, and also we mathematically prove that replacing P(d-&#62;q) by P(q|d) is a correct choice. In order to prove the Van Rijsbergen's assumption, we use the Propositional Logic and the Lattice theory. We also exploit the notion of degree of implication that is proposed by Knuth.
2491801	Exploration, navigation and retrieval of information in cultural heritage: ENRICH 2013 The Exploration, Navigation and Retrieval of Information in Cultural Heritage Workshop (ENRICH 2013) offers a forum to 1) discuss the challenges and opportunities in Information Retrieval research in the area of Cultural Heritage; 2) encourage collaboration between researchers engaged in work in this specialist area of Information Retrieval, and to foster the formation of a research community; and 3) identify a set of actions which the community should undertake to progress the research agenda. The workshop will foster a new stream of Information Retrieval research and support the design of search tools that can help end-users fully exploit the wonderful Cultural Heritage material that is available across the globe.
2491802	SIGIR 2013 workshop on time aware information access (#TAIA2013) Web content increasingly reflects the current state of the physical and social world, manifested both in traditional news media sources along with user-generated publishing sites such as Twitter, Foursquare, and Facebook. At the same time, web searching increasingly reflects problems grounded in the real world. As a result of this blending of the web with the real world, we observe that the web, both in its composition and use, has incorporated many of the dynamics of the real world. Few of the problems associated with searching dynamic collections are well understood, such as defining time-sensitive relevance, understanding user query behavior over time and understanding why certain web content changes. We believe that, just as static collections often benefit from modeling topics, dynamic collections will likely benefit from temporal modeling of events and time-sensitive user interests and intents, which were rarely addressed in the literature. There have been preliminary efforts in the research and industrial communities to address algorithms, architectures, evaluation methodologies and metrics. We aim to bring together practitioners and researchers to discuss their recent breakthroughs and the challenges with addressing time-aware information access, both from the algorithmic and the architectural perspectives. This workshop is a successor to the successful SIGIR 2012 Workshop on Time Aware Information Access (#TAIA2012). Where the 2012 edition was the first to bring together a broad set of academic and industrial researchers around the topic of time-aware information access, the specific focus of this workshop is on the many time-aware benchmarking activities that are ongoing in 2013.
2484233	Semantic models for answer re-ranking in question answering The task of Question Answering (QA) is to find correct answers to users' questions expressed in natural language. In the last few years non-factoid QA received more attention. It focuses on causation, manner and reason questions, where the expected answer has the form of a passage of text. The presence of question and answers corpora allows the adoption of Learning to Rank (MLR) algorithms in order to out- put a sensible ranking of the candidate answers. The importance and effectiveness of linguistically motivated features, obtained from syntax, lexical semantics and semantic role labeling, was shown in literature [2-4], but there are still several different possible semantic features that have not been taken into account so far and our goal is to find out if their use could lead to performance improvement. In particular features coming from Semantic Models (SM) like Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs), Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) induced topics have never been applied to the task so far. Based on the usefulness that those models show in other tasks, we think that SM can have a significant role in improving current state-of-the-art systems' performance in answer re-ranking. The questions this research wants to answer are: 1) Do semantic features bring information that is not present in the bag-of-words and syntactic features? 2) Do they bring different information or does it overlap with that of other features? 3) Are additional semantic features useful for answer re-ranking? Does their adoption improve systems' performance? 4) Which of them is more effective and under which circumstances? We performed a preliminary evaluation of DSMs on the ResPubliQA 2010 Dataset. We built a DSM based answer scorer that represents the question and the answer as the sums of the vectors of their terms taken term-term co-occurrence matrix and calculates their cosine similarity. We replaced the term-term matrix with the ones obtained by Random Indexing (RI), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and LSA over the RI. Considering each DSM on its own, the results prove that all the DSMs are better than the baseline (the standard term-term co-occurrence matrix), and the improvement is always significant. The best improvement for the MRR in English is obtained by LSA (+180%), while in Italian by LSARI (+161%). We also showed that combining the DSMs with overlap based measures via CombSum the ranking is significantly better than the baseline obtained by the overlap measures alone. For English we have obtained an improvement in MRR of about 16% and for Italian, we achieve a even higher improvement in MRR of 26%. Finally, adopting RankNet for combining the overlap features and the DSMs features, improves the MRR of about 13%. More details can be found in [1]. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the semantic features, we still need to incorporate other semantic features, such as ESA, LDA and other state-of-the-art linguistic features. Other operators for semantic compositionality, like product, tensor product and circular convolution, will also be investigated. Moreover we will experiment on different datasets, focus- ing mainly on non-factoid QA. The Yahoo! Answers Manner Questions datasets are a good starting point. A new dataset will also be collected with questions from the users of Wikiedi (a QA system over Wikipedia articles, www.wikiedi.it) and answers in the form of paragraphs from Wikipedia pages.
2484234	Indexing and querying overlapping structures Structural information retrieval is mostly based on hierarchy. However, in real life information is not purely hierarchical and structural elements may overlap each other. The most common example is a document with two distinct structural views, where the logical view is section/ subsection/ paragraph and the physical view is page/ line. Each single structural view of this document is a hierarchy and the components are either disjoint or nested inside each other. The overlapping issue arises when one structural element cannot be neatly nested into others. For instance, when a paragraph starts in one page and terminates in the next page. Similar situations can appear in videos and other multimedia contents, where temporal or spatial constituents of a media file may overlap each other. Querying over overlapping structures is one of the challenges of large scale search engines. For instance, FSIS (FAST Search for Internet Sites) [1] is a Microsoft search platform, which encounters overlaps while analysing content of textual data. FSIS uses a pipeline process to extract structure and semantic information of documents. The pipeline contains several components, where each component writes annotations to the input data. These annotations consist of structural elements and some of them may overlap each other. Handling overlapping structures in search engines will add a novel capability of searching, where users can ask queries such as "Find all the words that overlap two lines" or "Find the music played during Intro scene of Avatar movie". There are also other use cases, where the user of the search engine is not a person, but is a specific program with complex, non-traditional information retrieval needs. This research attempts to index overlapping structures and provide efficient query processing for large-scale search engines. The current research on overlapping structures revolves around encoding and modelling data, while indexing and query processing methods need investigations. Moreover, due to intrinsic complexity of overlaps, XML indexing and query processing techniques cannot be used for overlapping structures. Hence, my research on overlapping structures comprises three main parts: (1) an indexing method that supports both hierarchies and overlaps; (2) a query processing method based on the indexing technique and (3) a query language that is close to natural language and supports both full text and structural queries. Our approach for indexing overlaps is to adapt the PrePost [3] XML indexing method to overlapping structures. This method labels each node with its start and end positions and requires modest storage space. However, PrePost indexing cannot be used for overlapping nodes. To overcome this issue, we need to define a data model for overlapping structures. Since hierarchies are not sufficient to describe overlapping components, several data structures have been introduced by scholars. One of the most interesting data models is GODDAG [2]. GODDAG is a tree-like graph, where nodes can have multiple parentage. This model can support overlaps as well as simple inheritance. Our proposed data model for indexing overlaps is such a tree-like structure, where we can define overlapping, parent-child and ancestor-descendant relationships.
2484235	Group-support for task-based information searching: a knowledge-based approach 
2484236	Task differentiation for personal search evaluation 
2484230	Effective approaches to retrieving and using expertise in social media Expert retrieval has been widely studied especially after the introduction of Expert Finding task in the TREC's Enterprise Track in 2005 [3]. This track provided two different test collections crawled from two organizations' public-facing websites and internal emails which led to the development of many state-of-the-art algorithms on expert retrieval [1]. Until recently, these datasets were considered good representatives of the information resources available within enterprise. However, the recent growth of social media also influenced the work environment, and social media became a common communication and collaboration tool within organizations. According to a recent survey by McKinsey Global Institute [2], 29% of the companies use at least one social media tool for matching their employees to tasks, and 26% of them assess their employees' performance by using social media. This shows that intra-organizational social media became an important resource to identify expertise within organizations. In recent years, in addition to the intra-organizational social media, public social media tools like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn also became common environments for searching expertise. These tools provide an opportunity for their users to show their specific skills to the world which motivates recruiters to look for talented job candidates on social media, or writers and reporters to find experts for consulting on specific topics they are working on. With these motivations in mind, in this work we propose to develop expert retrieval algorithms for intra-organizational and public social media tools. Social media datasets have both challenges and advantages. In terms of challenges, they do not always contain context on one specific domain, instead one social media tool may contain discussions on technical stuff, hobbies or news concurrently. They may also contain spam posts or advertisements. Compared to well-edited enterprise documents, they are much more informal in language. Furthermore, depending on the social media platform, they may have limits on the number of characters used in posts. Even though they include the challenges stated above, they also bring some unique authority signals, such as votes, comments, follower/following information, which can be useful in estimating expertise. Furthermore, compared to previously used enterprise documents, social media provides clear associations between documents and candidates in the context of authorship information. In this work, we propose to develop expert retrieval approaches which will handle these challenges while making use of the advantages. Expert retrieval is a very useful application by itself; furthermore, it can be a step towards improving other social media applications. Social media is different than other web based tools mainly because it is dependent on its users. In social media, users are not just content consumers, but they are also the primary and sometimes the only content creators. Therefore, the quality of any user-generated content in social media depends on its creator. In this thesis, we propose to use expertise of users in order to improve the existing applications so that they can estimate the relevancy of a content not just based on the content, but also based on the expertise of the content creator. By using expertise of the content generator, we also hope to boost contents that are more reliable. We propose to apply this user's expertise information in order to improve ad-hoc search and question answering applications in social media. In this work, previous TREC enterprise datasets, available intra-organizational social media and public social media datasets will be used to test the proposed algorithms.
2484231	The role of current working context in professional search Today's working world of knowledge workers is changing rapidly. The available information that they need to process is ever growing. In addition, the characteristics of their work are changing as people can and do their work from home. This has resulted in the need to support knowledge workers in order to prevent burnouts. The project SWELL (http://www.swell-project.net) targets this by developing systems that support user's mental and physical well-being at work and at home. In the PhD project presented in this abstract we aim at maintaining well-being at work through information support.

2484237	Segmentation strategies for passage retrieval in audio-visual documents The importance of Information Retrieval (IR) in audio-visual recordings has been increasing with steeply growing numbers of audio-visual documents available on-line. Compared to traditional IR methods, this task requires specific techniques, such as Passage Retrieval which can accelerate the search process by retrieving the exact relevant passage of a recording instead of the full document. In Passage Retrieval, full recordings are divided into shorter segments which serve as individual documents for the further IR setup. This technique also allows normalizing document length and applying positional information. It was shown that it can even improve retrieval results. In this work, we examine two general strategies for Passage Retrieval: blind segmentation into overlapping regular-length passages and segmentation into variable-length passages based on semantics of their content. Time-based segmentation was already shown to improve retrieval of textual documents and audio-visual recordings. Our experiments performed on the test collection used in the Search subtask of the Search and Hyperlinking Task in MediaEval Benchmarking 2012 confirm those findings and show that parameters (segment length and shift) tuning for a specific test collection can further improve the results. Our best results on this collection were achieved by using 45-second long segments with 15-second shifts. Semantic-based segmentation can be divided into three types: similarity-based (producing segments with high intra-similarity and low inter-similarity), lexical-chain-based (producing segments with frequent lexically connected words), and feature-based (combining various features which signalize a segment break in a machine-learning setting). In this work, we mainly focus on feature-based segmentation which allows exploiting various features from all modalities of the data (including segment length) in a single trainable model and produces segments which can eventually overlap. Our preliminary results show that even simple semantic-based segmentation outperforms regular segmentation. Our model is a decision tree incorporating the following features: shot segments, output of TextTiling algorithm, cue words (well, thanks, so, I, now), sentence breaks, and the length of the silence after the previous word. In terms of the MASP, the relative improvement over regular segmentation is more than 19%.
2484209	Answering natural language queries over linked data graphs: a distributional semantics approach This paper demonstrates Treo, a natural language query mechanism for Linked Data graphs. The approach uses a distributional semantic vector space model to semantically match user query terms with data, supporting vocabulary-independent (or schema-agnostic) queries over structured data.
2484208	Match the news: a firefox extension for real-time news recommendation We present Match the News, a browser extension for real time news recommendation. Our extension works on the client side to recommend in real time recently published articles that are relevant to the web page the user is currently visiting. Match the News is fed from Google News RSS and applies syntactic matching to find the relevant articles. We implement an innovative weighting function to perform the keyword extraction task, BM25H. With BM25H we extract keywords not only relevant to currently browsed web page, but also novel with respect to the user's recent browsing history. The novelty feature in keyword extraction task results in meaningful news recommendations with regards to the web page the users currently visits. Moreover the extension offers a salient visualization of the terms corresponding to the users recent browsing history making thus the extension a comprehensive tool for real time news recommendation and self assessment.
2484207	A framework for specific term recommendation systems In this paper we present the IRSA framework that enables the automatic creation of search term suggestion or recommendation systems (TS). Such TS are used to operationalize interactive query expansion and help users in refining their information need in the query formulation phase. Our recent research has shown TS to be more effective when specific to a certain domain. The presented technical framework allows owners of Digital Libraries to create their own specific TS constructed via OAI-harvested metadata with very little effort.
2484206	YaLi: a crowdsourcing plug-in for NERD We demonstrate the YaLi browser plug-in which discovers named entities in Web pages and provides background knowledge about them. The plug-in is implemented with two purposes. From a user perspective, it enriches the browsing experience with entities, helping users with their information needs. From the research perspective, we aim to improve the methods that are used for named entity recognition and disambiguation (NERD) by leveraging the plug-in as an implicit crowdsourcing platform. YaLi tracks the system's errors and the users' corrections, and also gathers implicit training data for improving NERD accuracy.
2484205	ProductSeeker: entity-based product retrieval for e-commerce The retrieval results of online products information in e-commerce web sites are often difficult for users to use because of different descriptions for the same product. This paper proposes ProductSeeker, a product retrieval system organizing results according to their referring real-world entities for the conveniences of users. In the demonstration, we will present our system providing friendly interface to retrieve fresh product information and refining results according to feedback.
2484204	Online matching of web content to closed captions in IntoNow IntoNow is a mobile application that provides a second-screen experience to television viewers. IntoNow uses the microphone of the companion device to sample the audio coming from the TV set, and compares it against a database of TV shows in order to identify the program being watched. The system we demonstrate is activated by IntoNow for specific types of shows. It retrieves information related to the program the user is watching by using closed captions, which are provided by each broadcasting network along the TV signal. It then matches the stream of closed captions in real-time against multiple sources of content. More specifically, during news programs it displays links to online news articles and the profiles of people and organizations in the news, and during music shows it displays links to songs. The matching models are machine-learned from editorial judgments, and tuned to achieve approximately 90% precision.
2484203	Spacious: an interactive mental search interface We introduce in this work a novel approach for semantic indexing and mental image search. Given semantic concepts defined by few training examples, our formulation is transductive and learns a mapping from an initial ambient space, related to low level visual features, to an output space spanned by a well defined semantic basis where data can be easily explored. With this method, searching for a mental visual target reduces to scanning data according to their coordinates in the learned semantic space. We illustrate the proposed method through our graphical user interface "Spacious", for the purpose of visualization and interactive navigation in generic image databases and satellite images.
2484202	TopicVis: a GUI for topic-based feedback and navigation This paper describes a search system which includes topic model visualization to improve the user search experience. The system graphically renders the topics in a retrieved set of documents, enables a user to selectively refine search results and allows easy navigation through information on selective topics within documents.
2484201	A multilingual and multiplatform application for medicinal plants prescription from medical symptoms This paper presents an application for medicinal plants prescription based on text classification techniques. The system receives as an input a free text describing the symptoms of a user, and retrieves a ranked list of medicinal plants related to those symptoms. In addition, a set of links to Wikipedia are also provided, enriching the information about every medicinal plant presented to the user. In order to improve the accessibility to the application, the input can be written in six different languages, adapting the results accordingly. The application interface can be accessed from different devices and platforms.
2484200	X-ENS: semantic enrichment of web search results at real-time While more and more semantic data are published on the Web, an important question is how typical web users can access and exploit this body of knowledge. Although, existing interaction paradigms in semantic search hide the complexity behind an easy-to-use interface, they have not managed to cover common search needs. In this paper, we present X-ENS (eXplore ENtities in Search), a web search application that enhances the classical, keyword-based, web searching with semantic information, as a means to combine the pros of both Semantic Web standards and common Web Searching. X-ENS identifies entities of interest in the snippets of the top search results which can be further exploited in a faceted interaction scheme, and thereby can help the user to limit the - often very large - search space to those hits that contain a particular piece of information. Moreover, X-ENS permits the exploration of the identified entities by exploiting semantic repositories.
2484229	Beyond relevance: on novelty and diversity in tag recommendation We propose to explicitly exploit issues related to novelty and diversity in tag recommendation tasks, an unexplored research avenue (only relevance issues have been investigated so far), in order to improve user experience and satisfaction. We propose new tag recommendation strategies to cover these issues and highlight the involved challenges.
2484228	A query and patient understanding framework for medical records search Electronic medical records (EMRs) are being increasingly used worldwide to facilitate improved healthcare services [2,3]. They describe the clinical decision process relating to a patient, detailing the observed symptoms, the conducted diagnostic tests, the identified diagnoses and the prescribed treatments. However, medical records search is challenging, due to the implicit knowledge inherent within the medical records - such knowledge may be known by medical practitioners, but hidden to an information retrieval (IR) system [3]. For instance, the mention of a treatment such as a drug may indicate to a practitioner that a particular diagnosis has been made even if this was not explicitly mentioned in the patient's EMRs. Moreover, the fact that a symptom has not been observed by a clinician may rule out some specific diagnoses. Our work focuses on searching EMRs to identify patients with medical histories relevant to the medical condition(s) stated in a query. The resulting system can be beneficial to healthcare providers, administrators, and researchers who may wish to analyse the effectiveness of a particular medical procedure to combat a specific disease [2,4]. During retrieval, a healthcare provider may indicate a number of inclusion criteria to describe the type of patients of interest. For example, the used criteria may include personal profiles (e.g. age and gender) or some specific medical symptoms and tests, allowing to identify patients that have EMRs matching the criteria. To attain effective retrieval performance, we hypothesise that, in such a medical IR system, both the information needs and patients should be modelled based on how the medical process is developed. Specifically, our thesis states that since the medical decision process typically encompasses four aspects (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis, and treatment), a medical search system should take into account these aspects and apply inferences to recover possible implicit knowledge. We postulate that considering these aspects and their derived implicit knowledge at different levels of the retrieval process (namely, sentence, record, and inter-record level) enhances the retrieval performance. Indeed, we propose to build a query and patient understanding framework that can gain insights from EMRs and queries, by modelling and reasoning during retrieval in terms of the four aforementioned aspects (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis, and treatment) at three different levels of the retrieval process.
2484227	Diversified relevance feedback The need for a search engine to deal with ambiguous queries has been known for a long time (diversification). However, it is only recently that this need has become a focus within information retrieval research. How to respond to indications that a result is relevant to a query (relevance feedback) has also been a long focus of research. When thinking about the results for a query as being clustered by topic, these two areas of information retrieval research appear to be opposed to each other. Interestingly though, they both appear to improve the performance of search engines, raising the question: they can be combined or made to work with each other? When presented with an ambiguous query there are a number of techniques that can be employed to better select results. The primary technique being researched now is diversification, which aims to populate the results with a set of documents that cover different possible interpretations for the query, while maintaining a degree of relevance, as determined by the search engine. For example, given a query of "java" it is unclear whether the user, without any other information, means the programming language, the coffee, the island of Indonesia or a multitude of other meanings. In order to do this the assumption that documents are independent of each other when assessing potential relevance has to be broken. That is, a documents relevance, as calculated by the search engine, is no longer dependent only on the query, but also the other documents that have been selected. How a document is identified as being similar to previously selected documents, and the trade off between estimated relevance and topic coverage are current areas for information retrieval research. For unambiguous queries, or for search engines that do not perform diversification, it is possible to improve the results selected by reacting to information identifying a given result as truly relevant or not. This mechanism is known as relevance feedback. The most common response to relevance feedback is to investigate the documents for their most content-bearing terms, and either add, or subtract, their influence to a newly formed query which is then re-run on the remaining documents to re-order them. There has been a scant amount of research into the combination of these methods. However, Carbonell et al. [1] show that an initially diverse result set can provide a better approach for identifying the topic a user is interested in for a relevance feedback style approach. This approach was further extended by Raman et al. [4]. An important aspect of relevance feedback is the selection of documents to use. In the 2008 TREC relevance feedback track, Meij et al. [3] generated a diversified result set which outperformed other rankings as a source of feedback documents. The use of pseudo-relevance feedback (assuming the top ranked documents are relevant) to extract sub-topics for use in diversification was explored by Santos et al. [5]. These previous approaches suggest that these two ideas are more linked than expected. The ATIRE search engine [6] will be used to further explore the relationship between diversification and relevance feedback. ATIRE was selected because it is developed locally, and is designed to be small and fast. ATIRE also produces a competitive baseline, which would have placed 6th in the 2011 TREC diversity task while performing no diversification and index-time spam filtering [2], although we concede this is not equivalent to submitting a run.
2484221	Internet advertising: theory and practice Internet advertising, a form of advertising that utilizes the Internet to deliver marketing messages and attract customers, has seen exponential growth since its inception around twenty years ago; it has been pivotal to the success of the World Wide Web. The dramatic growth of internet advertising poses great challenges to information retrieval, machine learning, data mining and game theory, and it calls for novel technologies to be developed. The main purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners in the area of Internet Advertising and enable them to share their latest research results, to express their opinions, and to discuss future directions.
2484220	Workshop on health search and discovery: helping users and advancing medicine This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia to discuss search and discovery in the medi-cal domain. The event focuses on ways to make medical and health information more accessible to laypeople (including enhancements to ranking algorithms and search interfaces), and how we can dis-cover new medical facts and phenomena from information sought online, as evidenced in query streams and other sources such as social media. This domain also offers many opportunities for appli-cations that monitor and improve quality of life of those affected by medical conditions, by providing tools to support their health-related information behavior.

2484216	Flex-BaseX: an XML engine with a flexible extension of Xquery full-text XML is the most used language for structuring data and documents, besides being the de-facto standard for data exchange. Keyword based search has been implemented by the XQuery Full-Text language extension, allowing document fragments to be retrieved and ranked via keyword-based matching in the Information Retrieval style. In this demo the implementation of an XQuery extension allowing users to express their vague knowledge of the underlying XML structure is presented. The integration has been performed on top of the BaseX query engine; the work, as initially done by Panzeri at al. in IIR 2013 as a proof-of-concept has been further enhanced and extended.
2484215	ThemeStreams: visualizing the stream of themes discussed in politics The political landscape is fluid. Discussions are always ongoing and new "hot topics" continue to appear in the headlines. But what made people start talking about that topic? And who started it? Because of the speed at which discussions sometimes take place this can be difficult to track down. We describe ThemeStreams: a demonstrator that maps political discussions to themes and influencers and illustrate how this mapping is used in an interactive visualization that shows us which themes are being discussed, and that helps us answer the question "Who put this issue on the map?" in streams of political data.
2484218	Removing the mismatch headache in XML keyword search In this demo, we study one category of query refinement problems in the context of XML keyword search, where what users search for do not exist in the data while useless results are returned by the search engine. It is a hidden but important problem. We refer to it as the MisMatch problem. We propose a practical yet efficient way to detect the MisMatch problem and generate helpful suggestions to users, namely MisMatch detector and suggester. Our approach can be viewed as a post-processing job of query evaluation. An online XML keyword search engine embedding the MisMatch detector and suggester has been built and is available at [1].
2484217	A portable multilingual medical directory by automatic categorization of Wikipedia articles Wikipedia has become one of the most important sources of information available all over the world. However, the categorization of Wikipedia articles is not standardized and the searches are mainly performed on keywords rather than concepts. In this paper we present an application that builds a hierarchical structure to organize all Wikipedia entries, so that medical articles can be reached from general to particular, using the well known Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus. Moreover, the language links between articles will allow using the directory created in different languages. The final system can be packed and ported to mobile devices as a standalone offline application.
2484219	A geolinguistic web application based on linked open data Digital Geolinguistic systems encourage collaboration between linguists, historians, archaeologists, ethnographers, as they explore the relationship between language and cultural adaptation and change. In this demo, we propose a Linked Open Data approach for increasing the level of interoperability of geolinguistic applications and the reuse of the data. We present a case study of a geolinguistic project named Atlante Sintattico d'Italia, Syntactic Atlas of Italy (ASIt).
2484210	Information seeking in digital cultural heritage with PATHS Current Information Retrieval systems for digital cultural heritage support only the actual search aspect of the information seeking process.

2484211	Live nuggets extractor: a semi-automated system for text extraction and test collection creation The Live Nugget Extractor system provides users with a method of efficiently and accurately collecting relevant information for any web query rather than providing a simple ranked lists of documents. The system utilizes an online learning procedure to infer relevance of unjudged documents while extracting and ranking information from judged documents. This creates a set of judged and inferred relevance scores for both documents and text fragments, which can be used for test collections, summarization, and other tasks where high accuracy and large collections with minimal human effort are needed.
2484213	InfoLand: information lay-of-land for session search Search result clustering (SRC) is a post-retrieval process that hierarchically organizes search results. The hierarchical structure offers overview for the search results and displays an "information lay-of-land" that intents to guide the users throughout a search session. However, SRC hierarchies are sensitive to query changes, which are common among queries in the same session. This instability may leave users seemly random overviews throughout the session. We present a new tool called InfoLand that integrates external knowledge from Wikipedia when building SRC hierarchies and increase their stability. Evaluation on TREC 2010-2011 Session Tracks shows that InfoLand produces more stable results organization than a commercial search engine.
2494492	Riding the multimedia big data wave In this talk we present a perspective across multiple industry problems, including safety and security, medical, Web, social and mobile media, and motivate the need for large-scale analysis and retrieval of multimedia data. We describe a multi-layer architecture that incorporates capabilities for audio-visual feature extraction, machine learning and semantic modeling and provides a powerful framework for learning and classifying contents of multimedia data. We discuss the role semantic ontologies for representing audio-visual concepts and relationships, which are essential for training semantic classifiers. We discuss the importance of using faceted classification schemes in particular for organizing multimedia semantic concepts in order to achieve effective learning and retrieval. We also show how training and scoring of multimedia semantics can be implemented on big data distributed computing platforms to address both massive-scale analysis and low-latency processing. We describe multiple efforts at IBM on image and video analysis and retrieval, including IBM Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System (IMARS), and show recent results for semantic-based classification and retrieval. We conclude with future directions for improving analysis of multimedia through interactive and curriculum-based techniques for multimedia semantics-based learning and retrieval.
