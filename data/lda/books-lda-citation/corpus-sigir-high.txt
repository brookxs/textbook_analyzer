1571945	Context-aware query classification Understanding users'search intent expressed through their search queries is crucial to Web search and online advertisement. Web query classification (QC) has been widely studied for this purpose. Most previous QC algorithms classify individual queries without considering their context information. However, as exemplified by the well-known example on query "jaguar", many Web queries are short and ambiguous, whose real meanings are uncertain without the context information. In this paper, we incorporate context information into the problem of query classification by using conditional random field (CRF) models. In our approach, we use neighboring queries and their corresponding clicked URLs (Web pages) in search sessions as the context information. We perform extensive experiments on real world search logs and validate the effectiveness and effciency of our approach. We show that we can improve the F1 score by 52% as compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.
1571946	Refined experts: improving classification in large taxonomies While large-scale taxonomies--especially for web pages--have been in existence for some time, approaches to automatically classify documents into these taxonomies have met with limited success compared to the more general progress made in text classification. We argue that this stems from three causes: increasing sparsity of training data at deeper nodes in the taxonomy, error propagation where a mistake made high in the hierarchy cannot be recovered, and increasingly complex decision surfaces in higher nodes in the hierarchy. While prior research has focused on the first problem, we introduce methods that target the latter two problems--first by biasing the training distribution to reduce error propagation and second by propagating up "first-guess" expert information in a bottom-up manner before making a refined top down choice. Finally, we present an empirical study demonstrating that the suggested changes lead to 10--30% improvements in F1 scores versus an accepted competitive baseline, hierarchical SVMs.
1571947	Dynamicity vs. effectiveness: studying online clustering for scatter/gather We proposed and implemented a novel clustering algorithm called LAIR2, which has constant running time average for on-the-fly Scatter/Gather browsing [4]. Our experiments showed that when running on a single processor, the LAIR2 on-line clustering algorithm was several hundred times faster than a parallel Buckshot algorithm running on multiple processors [11]. This paper reports on a study that examined the effectiveness of the LAIR2 algorithm in terms of clustering quality and its impact on retrieval performance. We conducted a user study on 24 subjects to evaluate on-the-fly LAIR2 clustering in Scatter/Gather search tasks by comparing its performance to the Buckshot algorithm, a classic method for Scatter/Gather browsing [4]. Results showed significant differences in terms of subjective perceptions of clustering quality. Subjects perceived that the LAIR2 algorithm produced significantly better quality clusters than the Buckshot method did. Subjects felt that it took less effort to complete the tasks with the LAIR2 system, which was more effective in helping them in the tasks. Interesting patterns also emerged from subjects' comments in the final open-ended questionnaire. We discuss implications and future research.
1571950	Global ranking by exploiting user clicks It is now widely recognized that user interactions with search results can provide substantial relevance information on the documents displayed in the search results. In this paper, we focus on extracting relevance information from one source of user interactions, i.e., user click data, which records the sequence of documents being clicked and not clicked in the result set during a user search session. We formulate the problem as a global ranking problem, emphasizing the importance of the sequential nature of user clicks, with the goal to predict the relevance labels of all the documents in a search session. This is distinct from conventional learning to rank methods that usually design a ranking model defined on a single document; in contrast, in our model the relational information among the documents as manifested by an aggregation of user clicks is exploited to rank all the documents jointly. In particular, we adapt several sequential supervised learning algorithms, including the conditional random field (CRF), the sliding window method and the recurrent sliding window method, to the global ranking problem. Experiments on the click data collected from a commercial search engine demonstrate that our methods can outperform the baseline models for search results re-ranking.
1571951	Good abandonment in mobile and PC internet search Query abandonment by search engine users is generally considered to be a negative signal. In this paper, we explore the concept of good abandonment. We define a good abandonment as an abandoned query for which the user's information need was successfully addressed by the search results page, with no need to click on a result or refine the query. We present an analysis of abandoned internet search queries across two modalities (PC and mobile) in three locales. The goal is to approximate the prevalence of good abandonment, and to identify types of information needs that may lead to good abandonment, across different locales and modalities. Our study has three key findings: First, queries potentially indicating good abandonment make up a significant portion of all abandoned queries. Second, the good abandonment rate from mobile search is significantly higher than that from PC search, across all locales tested. Third, classified by type of information need, the major classes of good abandonment vary dramatically by both locale and modality. Our findings imply that it is a mistake to uniformly consider query abandonment as a negative signal. Further, there is a potential opportunity for search engines to drive additional good abandonment, especially for mobile search users, by improving search features and result snippets.
1571954	Query dependent pseudo-relevance feedback based on wikipedia Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) via query-expansion has been proven to be eÂ®ective in many information retrieval (IR) tasks. In most existing work, the top-ranked documents from an initial search are assumed to be relevant and used for PRF. One problem with this approach is that one or more of the top retrieved documents may be non-relevant, which can introduce noise into the feedback process. Besides, existing methods generally do not take into account the significantly different types of queries that are often entered into an IR system. Intuitively, Wikipedia can be seen as a large, manually edited document collection which could be exploited to improve document retrieval effectiveness within PRF. It is not obvious how we might best utilize information from Wikipedia in PRF, and to date, the potential of Wikipedia for this task has been largely unexplored. In our work, we present a systematic exploration of the utilization of Wikipedia in PRF for query dependent expansion. Specifically, we classify TREC topics into three categories based on Wikipedia: 1) entity queries, 2) ambiguous queries, and 3) broader queries. We propose and study the effectiveness of three methods for expansion term selection, each modeling the Wikipedia based pseudo-relevance information from a different perspective. We incorporate the expansion terms into the original query and use language modeling IR to evaluate these methods. Experiments on four TREC test collections, including the large web collection GOV2, show that retrieval performance of each type of query can be improved. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method out-performs the baseline relevance model in terms of precision and robustness.
1571955	Segment-level display time as implicit feedback: a comparison to eye tracking We examine two basic sources for implicit relevance feedback on the segment level for search personalization: eye tracking and display time. A controlled study has been conducted where 32 participants had to view documents in front of an eye tracker, query a search engine, and give explicit relevance ratings for the results. We examined the performance of the basic implicit feedback methods with respect to improved ranking and compared their performance to a pseudo relevance feedback baseline on the segment level and the original ranking of a Web search engine. Our results show that feedback based on display time on the segment level is much coarser than feedback from eye tracking. But surprisingly, for re-ranking and query expansion it did work as well as eye-tracking-based feedback. All behavior-based methods performed significantly better than our non-behavior-based baseline and especially improved poor initial rankings of the Web search engine. The study shows that segment-level display time yields comparable results as eye-tracking-based feedback. Thus, it should be considered in future personalization systems as an inexpensive but precise method for implicit feedback.
1571963	Portfolio theory of information retrieval This paper studies document ranking under uncertainty. It is tackled in a general situation where the relevance predictions of individual documents have uncertainty, and are dependent between each other. Inspired by the Modern Portfolio Theory, an economic theory dealing with investment in financial markets, we argue that ranking under uncertainty is not just about picking individual relevant documents, but about choosing the right combination of relevant documents. This motivates us to quantify a ranked list of documents on the basis of its expected overall relevance (mean) and its variance; the latter serves as a measure of risk, which was rarely studied for document ranking in the past. Through the analysis of the mean and variance, we show that an optimal rank order is the one that balancing the overall relevance (mean) of the ranked list against its risk level (variance). Based on this principle, we then derive an efficient document ranking algorithm. It generalizes the well-known probability ranking principle (PRP) by considering both the uncertainty of relevance predictions and correlations between retrieved documents. Moreover, the benefit of diversification is mathematically quantified; we show that diversifying documents is an effective way to reduce the risk of document ranking. Experimental results in text retrieval confirm performance.
1571965	A statistical comparison of tag and query logs We investigate tag and query logs to see if the terms people use to annotate websites are similar to the ones they use to query for them. Over a set of URLs, we compare the distribution of tags used to annotate each URL with the distribution of query terms for clicks on the same URL. Understanding the relationship between the distributions is important to determine how useful tag data may be for improving search results and conversely, query data for improving tag prediction. In our study, we compare both term frequency distributions using vocabulary overlap and relative entropy. We also test statistically whether the term counts come from the same underlying distribution. Our results indicate that the vocabulary used for tagging and searching for content are similar but not identical. We further investigate the content of the websites to see which of the two distributions (tag or query) is most similar to the content of the annotated/searched URL. Finally, we analyze the similarity for different categories of URLs in our sample to see if the similarity between distributions is dependent on the topic of the website or the popularity of the URL.
1571966	Simultaneously modeling semantics and structure of threaded discussions: a sparse coding approach and its applications The huge amount of knowledge in web communities has motivated the research interests in threaded discussions. The dynamic nature of threaded discussions poses lots of challenging problems for computer scientists. Although techniques such as semantic models and structural models have been shown to be useful in a number of areas, they are inefficient in understanding threaded discussions due to three reasons: (I) as most of users read existing messages before posting, posts in a discussion thread are temporally dependent on the previous ones; It causes the semantics and structure to be coupled with each other in threaded discussions; (II) in online discussion threads, there are a lot of junk posts which are useless and may disturb content analysis; and (III) it is very hard to judge the quality of a post. In this paper, we propose a sparse coding-based model named SMSS to Simultaneously Model Semantics and Structure of threaded discussions. The model projects each post into a topic space, and approximates each post by a linear combination of previous posts in the same discussion thread. Meanwhile, the model also imposes two sparse constraints to force a sparse post reconstruction in the topic space and a sparse post approximation from previous posts. The sparse properties effectively take into account the characteristics of threaded discussions. Towards the above three problems, we demonstrate the competency of our model in three applications: reconstructing reply structure of threaded discussions, identifying junk posts, and finding experts in a given board/sub-board in web communities. Experimental results show encouraging performance of the proposed SMSS model in all these applications.
1571967	Enhancing cluster labeling using wikipedia This work investigates cluster labeling enhancement by utilizing Wikipedia, the free on-line encyclopedia. We describe a general framework for cluster labeling that extracts candidate labels from Wikipedia in addition to important terms that are extracted directly from the text. The "labeling quality" of each candidate is then evaluated by several independent judges and the top evaluated candidates are recommended for labeling. Our experimental results reveal that the Wikipedia labels agree with manual labels associated by humans to a cluster, much more than with significant terms that are extracted directly from the text. We show that in most cases even when human's associated label appears in the text, pure statistical methods have difficulty in identifying them as good descriptors. Furthermore, our experiments show that for more than 85% of the clusters in our test collection, the manual label (or an inflection, or a synonym of it) appears in the top five labels recommended by our system.
1571969	Compressing term positions in web indexes Large search engines process thousands of queries per second on billions of pages, making query processing a major factor in their operating costs. This has led to a lot of research on how to improve query throughput, using techniques such as massive parallelism, caching, early termination, and inverted index compression. We focus on techniques for compressing term positions in web search engine indexes. Most previous work has focused on compressing docID and frequency data, or position information in other types of text collections. Compression of term positions in web pages is complicated by the fact that term occurrences tend to cluster within documents but not across document boundaries, making it harder to exploit clustering effects. Also, typical access patterns for position data are different from those for docID and frequency data. We perform a detailed study of a number of existing and new techniques for compressing position data in web indexes. We also study how to efficiently access position data for ranking functions that take proximity features into account.
1571970	Brute force and indexed approaches to pairwise document similarity comparisons with MapReduce This paper explores the problem of computing pairwise similarity on document collections, focusing on the application of "more like this" queries in the life sciences domain. Three MapReduce algorithms are introduced: one based on brute force, a second where the problem is treated as large-scale ad hoc retrieval, and a third based on the Cartesian product of postings lists. Each algorithm supports one or more approximations that trade effectiveness for efficiency, the characteristics of which are studied experimentally. Results show that the brute force algorithm is the most efficient of the three when exact similarity is desired. However, the other two algorithms support approximations that yield large efficiency gains without significant loss of effectiveness.
1571971	Efficiency trade-offs in two-tier web search systems Search engines rely on searching multiple partitioned corpora to return results to users in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper we analyze the standard two-tier architecture for Web search with the difference that the corpus to be searched for a given query is predicted in advance. We show that any predictor better than random yields time savings, but this decrease in the processing time yields an increase in the infrastructure cost. We provide an analysis and investigate this trade-off in the context of two different scenarios on real-world data. We demonstrate that in general the decrease in answer time is justified by a small increase in infrastructure cost.
1571973	A classification-based approach to question answering in discussion boards Discussion boards and online forums are important platforms for people to share information. Users post questions or problems onto discussion boards and rely on others to provide possible solutions and such question-related content sometimes even dominates the whole discussion board. However, to retrieve this kind of information automatically and effectively is still a non-trivial task. In addition, the existence of other types of information (e.g., announcements, plans, elaborations, etc.) makes it difficult to assume that every thread in a discussion board is about a question. We consider the problems of identifying question-related threads and their potential answers as classification tasks. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance in both question detection and answer finding subtasks. We also do a careful comparison of how different types of features contribute to the final result and show that non-content features play a key role in improving overall performance. Finally, we show that a ranking scheme based on our classification approach can yield much better performance than prior published methods.
1571974	Ranking community answers by modeling question-answer relationships via analogical reasoning The method of finding high-quality answers has significant impact on user satisfaction in community question answering systems. However, due to the lexical gap between questions and answers as well as spam typically existing in user-generated content, filtering and ranking answers is very challenging. Previous solutions mainly focus on generating redundant features, or finding textual clues using machine learning techniques; none of them ever consider questions and their answers as relational data but instead model them as independent information. Moreover, they only consider the answers of the current question, and ignore any previous knowledge that would be helpful to bridge the lexical and semantic gap. We assume that answers are connected to their questions with various types of latent links, i.e. positive indicating high-quality answers, negative links indicating incorrect answers or user-generated spam, and propose an analogical reasoning-based approach which measures the analogy between the new question-answer linkages and those of relevant knowledge which contains only positive links; the candidate answer which has the most analogous link is assumed to be the best answer. We conducted experiments based on 29.8 million Yahoo!Answer question-answer threads and showed the effectiveness of our approach.
1571975	A syntactic tree matching approach to finding similar questions in community-based qa services While traditional question answering (QA) systems tailored to the TREC QA task work relatively well for simple questions, they do not suffice to answer real world questions. The community-based QA systems offer this service well, as they contain large archives of such questions where manually crafted answers are directly available. However, finding similar questions in the QA archive is not trivial. In this paper, we propose a new retrieval framework based on syntactic tree structure to tackle the similar question matching problem. We build a ground-truth set from Yahoo! Answers, and experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional bag-of-word or tree kernel based methods by 8.3% in mean average precision. It further achieves up to 50% improvement by incorporating semantic features as well as matching of potential answers. Our model does not rely on training, and it is demonstrated to be robust against grammatical errors as well.
1571977	On social networks and collaborative recommendation Social network systems, like last.fm, play a significant role in Web 2.0, containing large amounts of multimedia-enriched data that are enhanced both by explicit user-provided annotations and implicit aggregated feedback describing the personal preferences of each user. It is also a common tendency for these systems to encourage the creation of virtual networks among their users by allowing them to establish bonds of friendship and thus provide a novel and direct medium for the exchange of data. We investigate the role of these additional relationships in developing a track recommendation system. Taking into account both the social annotation and friendships inherent in the social graph established among users, items and tags, we created a collaborative recommendation system that effectively adapts to the personal information needs of each user. We adopt the generic framework of Random Walk with Restarts in order to provide with a more natural and efficient way to represent social networks. In this work we collected a representative enough portion of the music social network last.fm, capturing explicitly expressed bonds of friendship of the user as well as social tags. We performed a series of comparison experiments between the Random Walk with Restarts model and a user-based collaborative filtering method using the Pearson Correlation similarity. The results show that the graph model system benefits from the additional information embedded in social knowledge. In addition, the graph model outperforms the standard collaborative filtering method.
1571978	Learning to recommend with social trust ensemble As an indispensable technique in the field of Information Filtering, Recommender System has been well studied and developed both in academia and in industry recently. However, most of current recommender systems suffer the following problems: (1) The large-scale and sparse data of the user-item matrix seriously affect the recommendation quality. As a result, most of the recommender systems cannot easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. (2) The traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the connections among users, which is not consistent with the real world recommendations. Aiming at modeling recommender systems more accurately and realistically, we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis framework, which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favors together. In this framework, we coin the term Social Trust Ensemble to represent the formulation of the social trust restrictions on the recommender systems. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches.
1571979	Fast nonparametric matrix factorization for large-scale collaborative filtering With the sheer growth of online user data, it becomes challenging to develop preference learning algorithms that are sufficiently flexible in modeling but also affordable in computation. In this paper we develop nonparametric matrix factorization methods by allowing the latent factors of two low-rank matrix factorization methods, the singular value decomposition (SVD) and probabilistic principal component analysis (pPCA), to be data-driven, with the dimensionality increasing with data size. We show that the formulations of the two nonparametric models are very similar, and their optimizations share similar procedures. Compared to traditional parametric low-rank methods, nonparametric models are appealing for their flexibility in modeling complex data dependencies. However, this modeling advantage comes at a computational price--it is highly challenging to scale them to large-scale problems, hampering their application to applications such as collaborative filtering. In this paper we introduce novel optimization algorithms, which are simple to implement, which allow learning both nonparametric matrix factorization models to be highly efficient on large-scale problems. Our experiments on EachMovie and Netflix, the two largest public benchmarks to date, demonstrate that the nonparametric models make more accurate predictions of user ratings, and are computationally comparable or sometimes even faster in training, in comparison with previous state-of-the-art parametric matrix factorization models.
1571981	Building enriched document representations using aggregated anchor text It is well known that anchor text plays a critical role in a variety of search tasks performed over hypertextual domains, including enterprise search, wiki search, and web search. It is common practice to enrich a document's standard textual representation with all of the anchor text associated with its incoming hyperlinks. However, this approach does not help match relevant pages with very few inlinks. In this paper, we propose a method for overcoming anchor text sparsity by enriching document representations with anchor text that has been aggregated across the hyperlink graph. This aggregation mechanism acts to smooth, or diffuse, anchor text within a domain. We rigorously evaluate our proposed approach on a large web search test collection. Our results show the approach significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, especially for longer, more difficult queries.
1571986	Learning in a pairwise term-term proximity framework for information retrieval Traditional ad hoc retrieval models do not take into account the closeness or proximity of terms. Document scores in these models are primarily based on the occurrences or non-occurrences of query-terms considered independently of each other. Intuitively, documents in which query-terms occur closer together should be ranked higher than documents in which the query-terms appear far apart. This paper outlines several term-term proximity measures and develops an intuitive framework in which they can be used to fully model the proximity of all query-terms for a particular topic. As useful proximity functions may be constructed from many proximity measures, we use a learning approach to combine proximity measures to develop a useful proximity function in the framework. An evaluation of the best proximity functions show that there is a significant improvement over the baseline ad hoc retrieval model and over other more recent methods that employ the use of single proximity measures.
1571989	Named entity recognition in query This paper addresses the problem of Named Entity Recognition in Query (NERQ), which involves detection of the named entity in a given query and classification of the named entity into predefined classes. NERQ is potentially useful in many applications in web search. The paper proposes taking a probabilistic approach to the task using query log data and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We consider contexts of a named entity (i.e., the remainders of the named entity in queries) as words of a document, and classes of the named entity as topics. The topic model is constructed by a novel and general learning method referred to as WS-LDA (Weakly Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation), which employs weakly supervised learning (rather than unsupervised learning) using partially labeled seed entities. Experimental results show that the proposed method based on WS-LDA can accurately perform NERQ, and outperform the baseline methods.
1571993	A proximity language model for information retrieval The proximity of query terms in a document is a very important information to enable ranking models go beyond the "bag of word" assumption in information retrieval. This paper studies the integration of term proximity information into the unigram language modeling. A new proximity language model (PLM) is proposed which views query terms' proximity centrality as the Dirichlet hyper-parameter that weights the parameters of the unigram document language model. Several forms of proximity measure are developed to be used in PLM which could compute a query term's proximate centrality in a specific document. In experiments, the proximity language model is compared with the basic language model and previous works that combine the proximity information with language model using linear score combination. The experiment results show that the proposed model performs better in both top precision and average precision.
1571994	Positional language models for information retrieval Although many variants of language models have been proposed for information retrieval, there are two related retrieval heuristics remaining "external" to the language modeling approach: (1) proximity heuristic which rewards a document where the matched query terms occur close to each other; (2) passage retrieval which scores a document mainly based on the best matching passage. Existing studies have only attempted to use a standard language model as a "black box" to implement these heuristics, making it hard to optimize the combination parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel positional language model (PLM) which implements both heuristics in a unified language model. The key idea is to define a language model for each position of a document, and score a document based on the scores of its PLMs. The PLM is estimated based on propagated counts of words within a document through a proximity-based density function, which both captures proximity heuristics and achieves an effect of "soft" passage retrieval. We propose and study several representative density functions and several different PLM-based document ranking strategies. Experiment results on standard TREC test collections show that the PLM is effective for passage retrieval and performs better than a state-of-the-art proximity-based retrieval model.
160722	Retrieval from hierarchical texts by partial patterns Structured texts (for example dictionaries and user manuals) typically have a heirarchical (tree-like) structure. We describe a query language for retrieving information from collections of hierarchical text. The language is based on a tree pattern matching notion called tree inclusion. Tree inclusion allows easy expression of queries that use the structure and the content of the document. In using it a user need not be aware of the whole structure of the database. Thus a language based on tree inclusion is data independent, a property made necessary because of the great variance in the structure of the texts.
160728	A comparison of indexing techniques for Japanese text retrieval A series of Japanese full-text retrieval experiments were conducted using an inference network document retrieval model. The retrieval performance of two major indexing methods, character-based and word-based, were evaluated. Using structured queries, the character-based indexing performed retrieval as well as, or slightly better, than the word-based system. This result has practical significance since the character-based indexing speed is considerably faster than the traditional word-based indexing. All the queries in this experiment were automatically formulated from natural language input.
160730	Development of a modern OPAC: from REVTOLC to MARIAN Since 1986 we have investigated the problems and possibilities of applying modern information retrieval methods to large online public access library catalogs (OPACs). In the Retrieval ExperimentâVirginia Tech OnLine Catalog (REVTOLC) study we carried out a large pilot test in 1987 and a larger, controlled investigation in 1990, with 216 users and roughly 500,000 MARC records. Results indicated that a forms-based interface coupled with vector and relevance feedback retrieval methods would be well received. Recent efforts developing the Multiple Access and Retrieval of Information with Annotations (MARIAN) system have involved used of a specially developed object-oriented DBMS, construction of a client running under NeXTSTEP, programming of a distributed server with a thread assigned to each user session to increase concurrency on a small network of NeXTs, refinement of algorithms to use objects and stopping rules for greater efficiency, usability testing and iterative interface refinement.
160738	An application of least squares fit mapping to text information retrieval This paper describes a unique example-based mapping method for document retrieval. We discovered that the knowledge about relevance among queries and documents can be used to obtain empirical connections between query terms and the canonical concepts which are used for indexing the content of documents. These connections do not depend on whether there are shared terms among the queries and documents; therefore, they are especially effective for a mapping from queries to the documents where the concepts are relevant but the terms used by article authors happen to be different from the terms of database users. We employ a Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) technique to compute such connections from a collection of queries and documents where the relevance is assigned by humans, and then use these connections in the retrieval of documents where the relevance is unknown. We tested this method on both retrieval and indexing with a set of MEDLINE documents which has been used by other information retrieval systems for evaluations. The effectiveness of the LLSF mapping and the significant improvement over alternative approaches was evident in the tests.
160741	On the evaluation of Boolean operators in the extended Boolean retrieval framework The retrieval models based on the extended boolean retrieval framework, e.g., the fuzzy set model and the extended boolean model have been proposed in the past to provide the conventional boolean retrieval system with the document ranking facility. However, due to undesirable properties of evaluation formulas for the AND and OR operations, the former generates incorrect ranked output in certain cases and the latter suffers from the complexity of computation. There have been a variety of fuzzy operators to replace the evaluation formulas. In this paper we first investigate the behavioral aspects of the fuzzy operators and address important issues to affect retrieval effectiveness. We then define an operator class called positively compensatory operators giving high retrieval effectiveness, and present a pair of positively compensatory operators providing high retrieval efficiency as well as high retrieval effectiveness. All the claims are justified through experiments.
160753	A model of information retrieval based on a terminological logic An abstract is not available.
160754	A probabilistic relational model for the integration of IR and databases In this paper, a probabilistic relational model is presented which combines relational algebra with probabilistic retrieval. Based on certain independence assumptions, the operators of the relational algebra are redefined such that the probabilistic algebra is a generalization of the standard relational algebra. Furthermore, a special join operator implementing probabilistic retrieval is proposed. When applied to typical document databases, queries can not only ask for documents, but for any kind of object in the database. In addition, an implicit ranking of these objects is provided in case the query relates to probabilistic indexing or uses the probabilistic join operator. The proposed algebra is intended as a standard interface to combined database and IR systems, as a basis for implementing user-friendly interfaces.
160756	SPIDER: a multiuser information retrieval system for semistructured and dynamic data The access structure, the retrieval model, and the system architecture of the SPIDER information retrieval system are described. The access structure provides efficient weighted retrieval on dynamic data collections. It is based on signatures and non-inverted item descriptions. The signatures provide upper bounds for the exact retrieval status values such that only a small number of exact retrieval status values have to be computed. SPIDER's retrieval model is a probabilistic retrieval model that is capable to exploit the database scheme of semistructured data collections. This model can be considred as a further development of the Binary Independence Indexing (BII) model. The system architecture was derived systematically from a given set of requirements such as effective and efficient retrieval on dynamic data collections, exploitation of the database scheme, computed views, and the integration of information retrieval functionality and database functionality.
160758	Using statistical testing in the evaluation of retrieval experiments The standard strategies for evaluation based on precision and recall are examined and their relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed. In particular, it is suggested that relevance feedback be evaluated from the perspective of the user. A number of different statistical tests are described for determining if differences in performance between retrieval methods are significant. These tests have often been ignored in the past because most are based on an assumption of normality which is not strictly valid for the standard performance measures. However, one can test this assumption using simple diagnostic plots, and if it is a poor approximation, there are a number of non-parametric alternatives.
160760	The effect multiple query representations on information retrieval system performance An abstract is not available.
1571997	Sources of evidence for vertical selection Web search providers often include search services for domain-specific subcollections, called verticals, such as news, images, videos, job postings, company summaries, and artist profiles. We address the problem of vertical selection, predicting relevant verticals (if any) for queries issued to the search engine's main web search page. In contrast to prior query classification and resource selection tasks, vertical selection is associated with unique resources that can inform the classification decision. We focus on three sources of evidence: (1) the query string, from which features are derived independent of external resources, (2) logs of queries previously issued directly to the vertical, and (3) corpora representative of vertical content. We focus on 18 different verticals, which differ in terms of semantics, media type, size, and level of query traffic. We compare our method to prior work in federated search and retrieval effectiveness prediction. An in-depth error analysis reveals unique challenges across different verticals and provides insight into vertical selection for future work.
1571998	Adaptation of offline vertical selection predictions in the presence of user feedback Web search results often integrate content from specialized corpora known as verticals. Given a query, one important aspect of aggregated search is the selection of relevant verticals from a set of candidate verticals. One drawback to previous approaches to vertical selection is that methods have not explicitly modeled user feedback. However, production search systems often record a variety of feedback information. In this paper, we present algorithms for vertical selection which adapt to user feedback. We evaluate algorithms using a novel simulator which models performance of a vertical selector situated in realistic query traffic.
1572001	Entropy-biased models for query representation on the click graph Query log analysis has received substantial attention in recent years, in which the click graph is an important technique for describing the relationship between queries and URLs. State-of-the-art approaches based on the raw click frequencies for modeling the click graph, however, are not noise-eliminated. Nor do they handle heterogeneous query-URL pairs well. In this paper, we investigate and develop a novel entropy-biased framework for modeling click graphs. The intuition behind this model is that various query-URL pairs should be treated differently, i.e., common clicks on less frequent but more specific URLs are of greater value than common clicks on frequent and general URLs. Based on this intuition, we utilize the entropy information of the URLs and introduce a new concept, namely the inverse query frequency (IQF), to weigh the importance (discriminative ability) of a click on a certain URL. The IQF weighting scheme is never explicitly explored or statistically examined for any bipartite graphs in the information retrieval literature. We not only formally define and quantify this scheme, but also incorporate it with the click frequency and user frequency information on the click graph for an effective query representation. To illustrate our methodology, we conduct experiments with the AOL query log data for query similarity analysis and query suggestion tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with our entropy-biased models. Moreover, our method can also be applied to other bipartite graphs.

Ideally, this content should be displayed only when it is highly relevant to the search query, as it competes for space with "regular" results and advertisements. One measure of the relevance to the search query is the click-through rate the specialized content achieves when displayed; hence, if we can predict this click-through rate accurately, we can use this as the basis for selecting when to show specialized content. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the click-through rate for dedicated news search results. For queries for which news results have been displayed repeatedly before, the click-through rate can be tracked online; however, the key challenge for which previously unseen queries to display news results remains. In this paper we propose a supervised model that offers accurate prediction of news click-through rates and satisfies the requirement of adapting quickly to emerging news events.
1572003	Smoothing clickthrough data for web search ranking Incorporating features extracted from clickthrough data (called clickthrough features) has been demonstrated to significantly improve the performance of ranking models for Web search applications. Such benefits, however, are severely limited by the data sparseness problem, i.e., many queries and documents have no or very few clicks. The ranker thus cannot rely strongly on clickthrough features for document ranking. This paper presents two smoothing methods to expand clickthrough data: query clustering via Random Walk on click graphs and a discounting method inspired by the Good-Turing estimator. Both methods are evaluated on real-world data in three Web search domains. Experimental results show that the ranking models trained on smoothed clickthrough features consistently outperform those trained on unsmoothed features. This study demonstrates both the importance and the benefits of dealing with the sparseness problem in clickthrough data.
1572005	Predicting user interests from contextual information Search and recommendation systems must include contextual information to effectively model users' interests. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the effectiveness of five variant sources of contextual information for user interest modeling. Post-query navigation and general browsing behaviors far outweigh direct search engine interaction as an information-gathering activity. Therefore we conducted this study with a focus on Website recommendations rather than search results. The five contextual information sources used are: social, historic, task, collection, and user interaction. We evaluate the utility of these sources, and overlaps between them, based on how effectively they predict users' future interests. Our findings demonstrate that the sources perform differently depending on the duration of the time window used for future prediction, and that context overlap outperforms any isolated source. Designers of Website suggestion systems can use our findings to provide improved support for post-query navigation and general browsing behaviors.
1572006	A comparison of query and term suggestion features for interactive searching Query formulation is one of the most difficult and important aspects of information seeking and retrieval. Two techniques, term relevance feedback and query suggestion, provide methods to help users formulate queries, but each is limited in different ways. In this research we combine these two techniques by automatically creating query suggestions using term relevance feedback techniques. To evaluate our approach, we conducted an interactive information retrieval study with 55 subjects and 20 topics. Each subject completed four topics, half with a term suggestion system and half with a query suggestion system. We also investigated the source of the suggestions: approximately half of all subjects were provided with system-generated suggestions, while half were provided with user-generated suggestions. Results show that subjects used more query suggestions than term suggestions and saved more documents with these suggestions, even though there were no significant differences in performance. Subjects preferred the query suggestion system and rated it higher along a number of dimensions including its ability to help them think of new approaches to searching. Qualitative data provided insight into subjects' usage and ratings, and indicated that subjects often used the suggestions even when they did not click on them.
1572009	Combining audio content and social context for semantic music discovery When attempting to annotate music, it is important to consider both acoustic content and social context. This paper explores techniques for collecting and combining multiple sources of such information for the purpose of building a query-by-text music retrieval system. We consider two representations of the acoustic content (related to timbre and harmony) and two social sources (social tags and web documents). We then compare three algorithms that combine these information sources: calibrated score averaging (CSA), RankBoost, and kernel combination support vector machines (KC-SVM). We demonstrate empirically that each of these algorithms is superior to algorithms that use individual information sources.
1572010	Automatic video tagging using content redundancy The analysis of the leading social video sharing platform YouTube reveals a high amount of redundancy, in the form of videos with overlapping or duplicated content. In this paper, we show that this redundancy can provide useful information about connections between videos. We reveal these links using robust content-based video analysis techniques and exploit them for generating new tag assignments. To this end, we propose different tag propagation methods for automatically obtaining richer video annotations. Our techniques provide the user with additional information about videos, and lead to enhanced feature representations for applications such as automatic data organization and search. Experiments on video clustering and classification as well as a user evaluation demonstrate the viability of our approach.
1572011	CompositeMap: a novel framework for music similarity measure With the continuing advances in data storage and communication technology, there has been an explosive growth of music information from different application domains. As an effective technique for organizing, browsing, and searching large data collections, music information retrieval is attracting more and more attention. How to measure and model the similarity between different music items is one of the most fundamental yet challenging research problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on a multimodal and adaptive similarity measure for various applications. Distinguished from previous approaches, our system can effectively combine music properties from different aspects into a compact signature via supervised learning. In addition, an incremental Locality Sensitive Hashing algorithm has been developed to support efficient retrieval processes with different kinds of queries. Experimental results based on two large music collections reveal various advantages of the proposed framework including effectiveness, efficiency, adaptiveness, and scalability.
1572013	Quantifying performance and quality gains in distributed web search engines Distributed search engines based on geographical partitioning of a central Web index emerge as a feasible solution to the immense growth of the Web, user bases, and query traffic. However, there is still lack of research in quantifying the performance and quality gains that can be achieved by such architectures. In this paper, we develop various cost models to evaluate the performance benefits of a geographically distributed search engine architecture based on partial index replication and query forwarding. Specifically, we focus on possible performance gains due to the distributed nature of query processing and Web crawling processes. We show that any response time gain achieved by distributed query processing can be utilized to improve search relevance as the use of complex but more accurate algorithms can now be enabled for document ranking. We also show that distributed Web crawling leads to better Web coverage and try to see if this improves the search quality. We verify the validity of our claims over large, real-life datasets via simulations.
1572014	SUSHI: scoring scaled samples for server selection Modern techniques for distributed information retrieval use a set of documents sampled from each server, but these samples have been underutilised in server selection. We describe a new server selection algorithm, SUSHI, which unlike earlier algorithms can make full use of the text of each sampled document and which does not need training data. SUSHI can directly optimise for many common cases, including high precision retrieval, and by including a simple stopping condition can do so while reducing network traffic. Our experiments compare SUSHI with alternatives and show it achieves the same effectiveness as the best current methods while being substantially more efficient, selecting as few as 20% as many servers.
1572017	On rank correlation and the distance between rankings Rank correlation statistics are useful for determining whether a there is a correspondence between two measurements, particularly when the measures themselves are of less interest than their relative ordering. Kendall's - in particular has found use in Information Retrieval as a "meta-evaluation" measure: it has been used to compare evaluation measures, evaluate system rankings, and evaluate predicted performance. In the meta-evaluation domain, however, correlations between systems confound relationships between measurements, practically guaranteeing a positive and significant estimate of - regardless of any actual correlation between the measurements. We introduce an alternative measure of distance between rankings that corrects this by explicitly accounting for correlations between systems over a sample of topics, and moreover has a probabilistic interpretation for use in a test of statistical significance. We validate our measure with theory, simulated data, and experiment.
1572019	Towards methods for the collective gathering and quality control of relevance assessments Growing interest in online collections of digital books and video content motivates the development and optimization of adequate retrieval systems. However, traditional methods for collecting relevance assessments to tune system performance are challenged by the nature of digital items in such collections, where assessors are faced with a considerable effort to review and assess content by extensive reading, browsing, and within-document searching. The extra strain is caused by the length and cohesion of the digital item and the dispersion of topics within it. We propose a method for the collective gathering of relevance assessments using a social game model to instigate participants' engagement. The game provides incentives for assessors to follow a predefined review procedure and makes provisions for the quality control of the collected relevance judgments. We discuss the approach in detail, and present the results of a pilot study conducted on a book corpus to validate the approach. Our analysis reveals intricate relationships between the affordances of the system, the incentives of the social game, and the behavior of the assessors. We show that the proposed game design achieves two designated goals: the incentive structure motivates endurance in assessors and the review process encourages truthful assessment.
1572021	On the local optimality of LambdaRank A machine learning approach to learning to rank trains a model to optimize a target evaluation measure with repect to training data. Currently, existing information retrieval measures are impossible to optimize directly except for models with a very small number of parameters. The IR community thus faces a major challenge: how to optimize IR measures of interest directly. In this paper, we present a solution. Specifically, we show that LambdaRank, which smoothly approximates the gradient of the target measure, can be adapted to work with four popular IR target evaluation measures using the same underlying gradient construction. It is likely, therefore, that this construction is extendable to other evaluation measures. We empirically show that LambdaRank finds a locally optimal solution for mean NDCG@10, mean NDCG, MAP and MRR with a 99% confidence rate. We also show that the amount of effective training data varies with IR measure and that with a sufficiently large training set size, matching the training optimization measure to the target evaluation measure yields the best accuracy.
1572022	Document selection methodologies for efficient and effective learning-to-rank Learning-to-rank has attracted great attention in the IR community. Much thought and research has been placed on query-document feature extraction and development of sophisticated learning-to-rank algorithms. However, relatively little research has been conducted on selecting documents for learning-to-rank data sets nor on the effect of these choices on the efficiency and effectiveness of learning-to-rank algorithms. In this paper, we employ a number of document selection methodologies, widely used in the context of evaluation--depth-k pooling, sampling (infAP, statAP), active-learning (MTC), and on-line heuristics (hedge). Certain methodologies, e.g. sampling and active-learning, have been shown to lead to efficient and effective evaluation. We investigate whether they can also enable efficient and effective learning-to-rank. We compare them with the document selection methodology used to create the LETOR datasets. Further, all of the utilized methodologies are different in nature, and thus they construct training data sets with different properties, such as the proportion of relevant documents in the data or the similarity among them. We study how such properties affect the efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness of learning-to-rank collections.
1572023	An improved markov random field model for supporting verbose queries Recent work in supervised learning of term-based retrieval models has shown significantly improved accuracy can often be achieved via better model estimation. In this paper, we show retrieval accuracy with Metzler and Croft's Markov random field (MRF) approach can be similarly improved via supervised learning. While the original MRF method estimates a parameter for each of its three feature classes from data, parameters within each class are set via a uniform weighting scheme adopted from the standard unigram. We conjecture greater MRF retrieval accuracy should be possible by better estimating within-class parameters, particularly for verbose queries employing natural language terms. Retrieval experiments with these queries on three TREC document collections show our improved MRF consistently out-performs both the original MRF and supervised unigram baselines. Additional experiments using blind-feedback and evaluation with optimal weighting demonstrate both the immediate value and further potential of our method.
1572025	Placing flickr photos on a map In this paper we investigate generic methods for placing photos uploaded to Flickr on the World map. As primary input for our methods we use the textual annotations provided by the users to predict the single most probable location where the image was taken. Central to our approach is a language model based entirely on the annotations provided by users. We define extensions to improve over the language model using tag-based smoothing and cell-based smoothing, and leveraging spatial ambiguity. Further we demonstrate how to incorporate GeoNamesfootnote{http://www.geonames.org visited May 2009}, a large external database of locations. For varying levels of granularity, we are able to place images on a map with at least twice the precision of the state-of-the-art reported in the literature.
1572027	CrowdReranking: exploring multiple search engines for visual search reranking Most existing approaches to visual search reranking predominantly focus on mining information within the initial search results. However, the initial ranked list cannot provide enough cues for reranking by itself due to the typically unsatisfying visual search performance. This paper presents a new method for visual search reranking called CrowdReranking, which is characterized by mining relevant visual patterns from image search results of multiple search engines which are available on the Internet. Observing that different search engines might have different data sources for indexing and methods for ranking, it is reasonable to assume that there exist different search results yet certain common visual patterns relevant to a given query among those results. We first construct a set of visual words based on the local image patches collected from multiple image search engines. We then explicitly detect two kinds of visual patterns, i.e., salient and concurrent patterns, among the visual words. Theoretically, we formalize reranking as an optimization problem on the basis of the mined visual patterns and propose a close-form solution. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on several real-world search engines and one benchmark dataset, and show that the proposed CrowdReranking is superior to the state-of-the-art works.
1572029	Including summaries in system evaluation In batch evaluation of retrieval systems, performance is calculated based on predetermined relevance judgements applied to a list of documents returned by the system for a query. This evaluation paradigm, however, ignores the current standard operation of search systems which require the user to view summaries of documents prior to reading the documents themselves. In this paper we modify the popular IR metrics MAP and P@10 to incorporate the summary reading step of the search process, and study the effects on system rankings using TREC data. Based on a user study, we establish likely disagreements between relevance judgements of summaries and of documents, and use these values to seed simulations of summary relevance in the TREC data. Re-evaluating the runs submitted to the TREC Web Track, we find the average correlation between system rankings and the original TREC rankings is 0.8 (Kendall ?), which is lower than commonly accepted for system orderings to be considered equivalent. The system that has the highest MAP in TREC generally remains amongst the highest MAP systems when summaries are taken into account, but other systems become equivalent to the top ranked system depending on the simulated summary relevance. Given that system orderings alter when summaries are taken into account, the small amount of effort required to judge summaries in addition to documents (19 seconds vs 88 seconds on average in our data) should be undertaken when constructing test collections.
1572030	When more is less: the paradox of choice in search engine use In numerous everyday domains, it has been demonstrated that increasing the number of options beyond a handful can lead to paralysis and poor choice and decrease satisfaction with the choice. Were this so-called paradox of choice to hold in search engine use, it would mean that increasing recall can actually work counter to user satisfaction if it implies choice from a more extensive set of result items. The existence of this effect was demonstrated in an experiment where users (N=24) were shown a search scenario and a query and were required to choose the best result item within 30 seconds. Having to choose from six results yielded both higher subjective satisfaction with the choice and greater confidence in its correctness than when there were 24 items on the results page. We discuss this finding in the wider context of "choice architecture"--that is, how result presentation affects choice and satisfaction.
1572031	Where to stop reading a ranked list?: threshold optimization using truncated score distributions Ranked retrieval has a particular disadvantage in comparison with traditional Boolean retrieval: there is no clear cut-off point where to stop consulting results. This is a serious problem in some setups. We investigate and further develop methods to select the rank cut-off value which optimizes a given effectiveness measure. Assuming no other input than a system's output for a query--document scores and their distribution--the task is essentially a score-distributional threshold optimization problem. The recent trend in modeling score distributions is to use a normal-exponential mixture: normal for relevant, and exponential for non-relevant document scores. We discuss the two main theoretical problems with the current model, support incompatibility and non-convexity, and develop new models that address them. The main contributions of the paper are two truncated normal-exponential models, varying in the way the out-truncated score ranges are handled. We conduct a range of experiments using the TREC 2007 and 2008 Legal Track data, and show that the truncated models lead to significantly better results.
1572033	The wisdom of the few: a collaborative filtering approach based on expert opinions from the web Nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering provides a successful means of generating recommendations for web users. However, this approach suffers from several shortcomings, including data sparsity and noise, the cold-start problem, and scalability. In this work, we present a novel method for recommending items to users based on expert opinions. Our method is a variation of traditional collaborative filtering: rather than applying a nearest neighbor algorithm to the user-rating data, predictions are computed using a set of expert neighbors from an independent dataset, whose opinions are weighted according to their similarity to the user. This method promises to address some of the weaknesses in traditional collaborative filtering, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We validate our approach by predicting a subset of the Netflix data set. We use ratings crawled from a web portal of expert reviews, measuring results both in terms of prediction accuracy and recommendation list precision. Finally, we explore the ability of our method to generate useful recommendations, by reporting the results of a user-study where users prefer the recommendations generated by our approach.
1572034	Personalized tag recommendation using graph-based ranking on multi-type interrelated objects Social tagging is becoming increasingly popular in many Web 2.0 applications where users can annotate resources (e.g. Web pages) with arbitrary keywords (i.e. tags). A tag recommendation module can assist users in tagging process by suggesting relevant tags to them. It can also be directly used to expand the set of tags annotating a resource. The benefits are twofold: improving user experience and enriching the index of resources. However, the former one is not emphasized in previous studies, though a lot of work has reported that different users may describe the same concept in different ways. We address the problem of personalized tag recommendation for text documents. In particular, we model personalized tag recommendation as a "query and ranking" problem and propose a novel graph-based ranking algorithm for interrelated multi-type objects. When a user issues a tagging request, both the document and the user are treated as a part of the query. Tags are then ranked by our graph-based ranking algorithm which takes into consideration both relevance to the document and preference of the user. Finally, the top ranked tags are presented to the user as suggestions. Experiments on a large-scale tagging data set collected from Del.icio.us have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms algorithms which fail to consider the diversity of different users' interests.
1572038	Reducing long queries using query quality predictors Long queries frequently contain many extraneous terms that hinder retrieval of relevant documents. We present techniques to reduce long queries to more effective shorter ones that lack those extraneous terms. Our work is motivated by the observation that perfectly reducing long TREC description queries can lead to an average improvement of 30% in mean average precision. Our approach involves transforming the reduction problem into a problem of learning to rank all sub-sets of the original query (sub-queries) based on their predicted quality, and selecting the top sub-query. We use various measures of query quality described in the literature as features to represent sub-queries, and train a classifier. Replacing the original long query with the top-ranked sub-query chosen by the ranker results in a statistically significant average improvement of 8% on our test sets. Analysis of the results shows that query reduction is well-suited for moderately-performing long queries, and a small set of query quality predictors are well-suited for the task of ranking sub-queries.
1572039	Extracting structured information from user queries with semi-supervised conditional random fields When search is against structured documents, it is beneficial to extract information from user queries in a format that is consistent with the backend data structure. As one step toward this goal, we study the problem of query tagging which is to assign each query term to a pre-defined category. Our problem could be approached by learning a conditional random field (CRF) model (or other statistical models) in a supervised fashion, but this would require substantial human-annotation effort. In this work, we focus on a semi-supervised learning method for CRFs that utilizes two data sources: (1) a small amount of manually-labeled queries, and (2) a large amount of queries in which some word tokens have derived labels, i.e., label information automatically obtained from additional resources. We present two principled ways of encoding derived label information in a CRF model. Such information is viewed as hard evidence in one setting and as soft evidence in the other. In addition to the general methodology of how to use derived labels in semi-supervised CRFs, we also present a practical method on how to obtain them by leveraging user click data and an in-domain database that contains structured documents. Evaluation on product search queries shows the effectiveness of our approach in improving tagging accuracies.
1572042	Optimizing search engine revenue in sponsored search Displaying sponsored ads alongside the search results is a key monetization strategy for search engine companies. Since users are more likely to click ads that are relevant to their query, it is crucial for search engine to deliver the right ads for the query and the order in which they are displayed. There are several works investigating on how to learn a ranking function to maximize the number of ad clicks. In this paper, we address a new revenue optimization problem and aim to answer the question: how to construct a ranking model that can deliver high quality ads to the user as well as maximize search engine revenue? We introduce two novel methods from di fferent machine learning perspectives, and both of them take the revenue component into careful considerations. The algorithms are built upon the click-through log data with real ad clicks and impressions. The extensively experimental results verify the proposed algorithm that can produce more revenue than other methods as well as avoid losing relevance accuracy. To provide deep insight into the importance of each feature to search engine revenue, we extract twelve basic features from four categories. The experimental study provides a feature ranking list according to the revenue benefit of each feature.
1572046	Telling experts from spammers: expertise ranking in folksonomies With a suitable algorithm for ranking the expertise of a user in a collaborative tagging system, we will be able to identify experts and discover useful and relevant resources through them. We propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors. Firstly, an expert should possess a high quality collection of resources, while the quality of a Web resource depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it. Secondly, an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users do. We propose a graph-based algorithm, SPEAR (SPamming-resistant Expertise Analysis and Ranking), which implements these ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy. We evaluate our method with experiments on data sets collected from Delicious.com comprising over 71,000 Web documents, 0.5 million users and 2 million shared bookmarks. We also show that the algorithm is more resistant to spammers than other methods such as the original HITS algorithm and simple statistical measures.
1572047	Detecting spammers and content promoters in online video social networks A number of online video social networks, out of which YouTube is the most popular, provides features that allow users to post a video as a response to a discussion topic. These features open opportunities for users to introduce polluted content, or simply pollution, into the system. For instance, spammers may post an unrelated video as response to a popular one aiming at increasing the likelihood of the response being viewed by a larger number of users. Moreover, opportunistic users-- promoters --may try to gain visibility to a specific video by posting a large number of (potentially unrelated) responses to boost the rank of the responded video , making it appear in the top lists maintained by the system. Content pollution may jeopardize the trust of users on the system, thus compromising its success in promoting social interactions. In spite of that, the available literature is very limited in providing a deep understanding of this problem. In this paper, we go a step further by addressing the issue of detecting video spammers and promoters. Towards that end, we manually build a test collection of real YouTube users, classifying them as spammers, promoters, and legitimates. Using our test collection, we provide a characterization of social and content attributes that may help distinguish each user class. We also investigate the feasibility of using a state-of-the-art supervised classification algorithm to detect spammers and promoters, and assess its effectiveness in our test collection. We found that our approach is able to correctly identify the majority of the promoters, misclassifying only a small percentage of legitimate users. In contrast, although we are able to detect a significant fraction of spammers, they showed to be much harder to distinguish from legitimate users.
1572070	The ESA retrieval model revisited Among the retrieval models that have been proposed in the last years, the ESA model of Gabrilovich and Markovitch received much attention. The authors report on a significant improvement in the retrieval performance, which is explained with the semantic concepts introduced by the document collection underlying ESA. Their explanation appears plausible but our analysis shows that the connections are more involved and that the "concept hypothesis" does not hold. In our contribution we analyze several properties that in fact affect the retrieval performance. Moreover, we introduce a formalization of ESA, which reveals its close connection to existing retrieval models.
1572085	Improving search relevance for implicitly temporal queries An abstract is not available.
1572092	It pays to be picky: an evaluation of thread retrieval in online forums Online forums host a rich information exchange, often with contributions from many subject matter experts. In this work we evaluate algorithms for thread retrieval in a large and active online forum community. We compare methods that utilize thread structure to a naÃ¯ve method that treats a thread as a single document. We find that thread structure helps, and additionally selective methods of thread scoring, which only use evidence from a small number of messages in the thread, significantly and consistently outperform inclusive methods which use all the messages in the thread.
1572093	Knowledge transformation for cross-domain sentiment classification With the explosion of user-generated web2.0 content in the form of blogs, wikis and discussion forums, the Internet has rapidly become a massive dynamic repository of public opinion on an unbounded range of topics. A key enabler of opinion extraction and summarization is sentiment classification: the task of automatically identifying whether a given piece of text expresses positive or negative opinion towards a topic of interest. Building high-quality sentiment classifiers using standard text categorization methods is challenging due to the lack of labeled data in a target domain. In this paper, we consider the problem of cross-domain sentiment analysis: can one, for instance, download rated movie reviews from rottentomatoes.com or IMBD discussion forums, learn linguistic expressions and sentiment-laden terms that generally characterize opinionated reviews and then successfully transfer this knowledge to the target domain, thereby building high-quality sentiment models without manual effort? We outline a novel sentiment transfer mechanism based on constrained non-negative matrix tri-factorizations of term-document matrices in the source and target domains. We report some preliminary results with this approach.
1572102	Multiple approaches to analysing query diversity In this paper we examine user queries with respect to diversity: providing a mix of results across different interpretations. Using two query log analysis techniques (click entropy and reformulated queries), 14.9 million queries from the Microsoft Live Search log were analysed. We found that a broad range of query types may benefit from diversification. Additionally, although there is a correlation between word ambiguity and the need for diversity, the range of results users may wish to see for an ambiguous query stretches well beyond traditional notions of word sense.
1572113	A ranking approach to keyphrase extraction This paper addresses the issue of automatically extracting keyphrases from a document. Previously, this problem was formalized as classification and learning methods for classification were utilized. This paper points out that it is more essential to cast the problem as ranking and employ a learning to rank method to perform the task. Specifically, it employs Ranking SVM, a state-of-art method of learning to rank, in keyphrase extraction. Experimental results on three datasets show that Ranking SVM significantly outperforms the baseline methods of SVM and Naive Bayes, indicating that it is better to exploit learning to rank techniques in keyphrase extraction.
1572114	Reciprocal rank fusion outperforms condorcet and individual rank learning methods Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), a simple method for combining the document rankings from multiple IR systems, consistently yields better results than any individual system, and better results than the standard method Condorcet Fuse. This result is demonstrated by using RRF to combine the results of several TREC experiments, and to build a meta-learner that ranks the LETOR 3 dataset better than any previously reported method
1572133	Temporal collaborative filtering with adaptive neighbourhoods Collaborative Filtering aims to predict user tastes, by minimising the mean error produced when predicting hidden user ratings. The aim of a deployed recommender system is to iteratively predict users' preferences over a dynamic, growing dataset, and system administrators are confronted with the problem of having to continuously tune the parameters calibrating their CF algorithm. In this work, we formalise CF as a time-dependent, iterative prediction problem. We then perform a temporal analysis of the Netflix dataset, and evaluate the temporal performance of two CF algorithms. We show that, due to the dynamic nature of the data, certain prediction methods that improve prediction accuracy on the Netflix probe set do not show similar improvements over a set of iterative train-test experiments with growing data. We then address the problem of parameter selection and update, and propose a method to automatically assign and update per-user neighbourhood sizes that (on the temporal scale) outperforms setting global parameters.
1572138	Topic set size redux The cost as well as the power and reliability of a retrieval test collection are all proportional to the number of topics included in it. Test collections created through community evaluations such as TREC generally use 50 topics. Prior work estimated the reliability of 50-topic sets by extrapolating confidence levels from those of smaller sets, and concluded that 50 topics are sufficient to have high confidence in a comparison, especially when the comparison is statistically significant. Using topic sets that actually contain 50 topics, this paper shows that statistically significant differences can be wrong, even when statistical significance is accompanied by moderately large (>10%) relative differences in scores. Further, using standardized evaluation scores rather than raw evaluation scores does not increase the reliability of these paired comparisons. Researchers should continue to be skeptical of conclusions demonstrated on only a single test collection.
1572139	Transforming patents into prior-art queries Searching for prior-art patents is an essential step for the patent examiner to validate or invalidate a patent application. In this paper, we consider the whole patent as the query, which reduces the burden on the user, and also makes many more potential search features available. We explore how to automatically transform the query patent into an effective search query, especially focusing on the effect of different patent fields. Experiments show that the background summary of a patent is the most useful source of terms for generating a query, even though most previous work used the patent claims.
1572140	Two-stage query segmentation for information retrieval Modeling term dependence has been shown to have a significant positive impact on retrieval. Current models, however, use sequential term dependencies, leading to an increased query latency, especially for long queries. In this paper, we examine two query segmentation models that reduce the number of dependencies. We find that two-stage segmentation based on both query syntactic structure and external information sources such as query logs, attains retrieval performance comparable to the sequential dependence model, while achieving a 50% reduction in query latency.
1572160	Generic similarity search engine demonstrated by an image retrieval application We introduce a generic engine for large-scale similarity search and demonstrate it on a set of 100 million Flickr images.
160689	Relevance feedback and inference networks Relevance feedback, which modifies queries using judgements of the relevance of a few, highly-ranked documents, has historically been an important method for increasing the performance of information retrieval systems. In this paper, we extend the inference network model introduced by Turtle and Croft to include relevance feedback techniques. The difference between relevance feedback on text abstracts and full text collections is studied. Preliminary results for relevance feedback on the structured queries supported by the inference net model are also reported.
160691	Automatic indexing based on Bayesian inference networks In this paper, a Bayesian inference network model for automatic indexing with index terms (descriptors) from a prescribed vocabulary is presented. It requires an indexing dictionary with rules mapping terms of the respective subject field onto descriptors and inverted lists for terms occuring in a set of documents of the subject field and descriptors manually assigned to these documents. The indexing dictionary can be derived automatically from a set of manually indexed documents. An application of the network model is described, followed by an indexing example and some experimental results about the indexing performance of the network model.
160692	Overview of the first TREC conference The first Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-1) was held in early November 1992 and was attended by about 100 people working in the 25 participating groups. The goal of the conference was to bring research groups together to discuss their work on a new large test collection. There was a large variety of retrieval techniques reported on, including methods using automatic thesaurii, sophisticated term weighting, natural language techniques, relevance feedback, and advanced pattern matching. As results had been run through a common evaluation package, groups were able to compare the effectiveness of different techniques, and discuss how differences among the sytems affected performance.
160693	Approaches to passage retrieval in full text information systems Large collections of full-text documents are now commonly used in automated information retrieval. When the stored document texts are long, the retrieval of complete documents may not be in the users' best interest. In such circumstance, efficient and effective retrieval results may be obtained by using passage retrieval strategies designed to retrieve text excerpts of varying size in response to statements of user interest. New approaches are described in this study for implementing selective passage retrieval systems, and identifying text passages responsive to particular user needs. An automated encyclopedia search system is used to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed methods.
160695	Subtopic structuring for full-length document access We argue that the advent of large volumes of full-length text, as opposed to short texts like abstracts and newswire, should be accompanied by corresponding new approaches to information access. Toward this end, we discuss the merits of imposing structure on full-length text documents; that is, a partition of the text into coherent multi-paragraph units that represent the pattern of subtopics that comprise the text. Using this structure, we can make a distinction between the main topics, which occur throughout the length of the text, and the subtopics, which are of only limited extent. We discuss why recognition of subtopic structure is important and how, to some degree of accuracy, it can be found. We describe a new way of specifying queries on full-length documents and then describe an experiment in which making use of the recognition of local structure achieves better results on a typical information retrieval task than does a standard IR measure.
160696	The identification of important concepts in highly structured technical papers Automatic abstracting, typically based on extraction of important sentences from a text, has been treated as a largely separate task from automatic indexing. This paper describes an approach in which the indexing and abstracting tasks are effectively combined. It is applicable to highly structured empirical research papers, whose content can be organised using a semantic frame. During a scan of a source text, stylistic clues and constructs are used for extracting candidate fillers for the various slots in the frame. Subsequently, an actual concept name is chosen for each slot by comparing the various candidates and their weights.
160703	Computation of term associations by a neural network An abstract is not available.
160710	A user-centred evaluation of ranking algorithms for interactive query expansion The evaluation of 6 ranking algorithms for the ranking of terms for query expansion is discussed within the context of an investigation of interactive query expansion and relevance feedback in a real operational environment. The yardstick for the evaluation was provided by the user relevance judgements on the lists of the candidate terms for query expansion. The evaluation focuses on the similarities in the performance of the different algorithms and how the algorithms with similar performance treat terms.
160713	Concept based query expansion Query expansion methods have been studied for a long time - with debatable success in many instances. In this paper we present a probabilistic query expansion model based on a similarity thesaurus which was constructed automatically. A similarity thesaurus reflects domain knowledge about the particular collection from which it is constructed. We address the two important issues with query expansion: the selection and the weighting of additional search terms. In contrast to earlier methods, our queries are expanded by adding those terms that are most similar to the concept of the query, rather than selecting terms that are similar to the query terms. Our experiments show that this kind of query expansion results in a notable improvement in the retrieval effectiveness when measured using both recall-precision and usefulness.
160715	Using WordNet to disambiguate word senses for text retrieval This paper describes an automatic indexing procedure that uses the âIS-Aâ relations contained within WordNet and the set of nouns contained in a text to select a sense for each plysemous noun in the text. The result of the indexing procedure is a vector in which some of the terms represent word senses instead of word stems. Retrieval experiments comparing the effectivenss of these sense-based vectors vs. stem-based vectors show the stem-based vectors to be superior overall, although the sense-based vectors do improve the performance of some queries. The overall degradation is due in large part to the difficulty of disambiguating senses in short query statements. An analysis of these results suggests two conclusions: the IS-A links define a generalization/specialization hierarchy that is not sufficient to reliably select the correct sense of a noun from the set of fine sense distinctions in WordNet; and missing correct matches because of incorrect sense resolution has a much more deleterious effect on retrieval performance than does making spurious matches.
160717	MURAX: a robust linguistic approach for question answering using an on-line encyclopedia Robust linguistic methods are applied to the task of answering closed-class questions using a corpus of natural language. The methods are illustrated in a broad domain: answering general-knowledge questions using an on-line encyclopedia. A closed-class question is a question stated in natural language, which assumes some definite answer typified by a noun phrase rather than a procedural answer. The methods hypothesize noun phrases that are likely to be the answer, and present the user with relevant text in which they are marked, focussing the user's attention appropriately. Furthermore, the sentences of matching text that are shown to the user are selected to confirm phrase relations implied by the question, rather than being selected solely on the basis of word frequency. The corpus is accessed via an information retrieval (IR) system that supports boolean search with proximity constraints. Queries are automatically constructed from the phrasal content of the question, and passed to the IR system to find relevant text. Then the relevant text is itself analyzed; noun phrase hypotheses are extracted and new queries are independently made to confirm phrase relations for the various hypotheses. The methods are currently being implemented in a system called MURAX and although this process is not complete, it is sufficiently advanced for an interim evaluation to be presented.
160718	Viewing morphology as an inference process Morphology is the area of linguistics concerned with the internal structure of words. Information Retrieval has generally not paid much attention to word structure, other than to account for some of the variability in word forms via the use of stemmers. This paper will describe our experiments to determine the importance of morphology, and the effect that it has on performance. We will also describe the role of morphological analysis in word sense disambiguation, and in identifying lexical semantic relationships in a machine-readable dictionary. We will first provide a brief overview of morphological phenomena, and then describe the experiments themselves.
160720	Structured answers for a large structured document collection There is a simple method for integrating information retrieval and hypertext. This consists of treating nodes as isolated documents and retrieving them in order of similarity. If the nodes are structured, in particular, if sets of nodes collectively constitute documents, we can do better. This paper shows how the formation of the hypertext, the retrieval of nodes in response to content based queries, and the presentation of the nodes can be achieved in a way that exploits the knowledge encoded as the structure of the documents. The ideas are then exemplified in an SGML based hypertext information retrieval system.
1835453	Prototype hierarchy based clustering for the categorization and navigation of web collections This paper presents a novel prototype hierarchy based clustering (PHC) framework for the organization of web collections. It solves simultaneously the problem of categorizing web collections and interpreting the clustering results for navigation. By utilizing prototype hierarchies and the underlying topic structures of the collections, PHC is modeled as a multi-criterion optimization problem based on minimizing the hierarchy evolution, maximizing category cohesiveness and inter-hierarchy structural and semantic resemblance. The flexible design of metrics enables PHC to be a general framework for applications in various domains. In the experiments on categorizing 4 collections of distinct domains, PHC achieves 30% improvement in Â¼ F 1 over the state-of-the-art techniques. Further experiments provide insights on performance variations with abstract and concrete domains, completeness of the prototype hierarchy, and effects of different combinations of optimization criteria.
1835454	Person name disambiguation by bootstrapping In this paper, we report our system that disambiguates person names in Web search results. The system uses named entities, compound key words, and URLs as features for document similarity calculation, which typically show high precision but low recall clustering results. We propose to use a two-stage clustering algorithm by bootstrapping to improve the low recall values, in which clustering results of the first stage are used to extract features used in the second stage clustering. Experimental results revealed that our algorithm yields better score than the best systems at the latest WePS workshop.
1835455	Self-taught hashing for fast similarity search The ability of fast similarity search at large scale is of great importance to many Information Retrieval (IR) applications. A promising way to accelerate similarity search is semantic hashing which designs compact binary codes for a large number of documents so that semantically similar documents are mapped to similar codes (within a short Hamming distance). Although some recently proposed techniques are able to generate high-quality codes for documents known in advance, obtaining the codes for previously unseen documents remains to be a very challenging problem. In this paper, we emphasise this issue and propose a novel Self-Taught Hashing (STH) approach to semantic hashing: we first find the optimal l -bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via unsupervised learning, and then train l classifiers via supervised learning to predict the l -bit code for any query document unseen before. Our experiments on three real-world text datasets show that the proposed approach using binarised Laplacian Eigenmap (LapEig) and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.
1835457	Personalizing information retrieval for multi-session tasks: the roles of task stage and task type Dwell time as a user behavior has been found in previous studies to be an unreliable predictor of document usefulness, with contextual factors such as the user's task needing to be considered in its interpretation. Task stage has been shown to influence search behaviors including usefulness judgments, as has task type. This paper reports on an investigation of how task stage and task type may help predict usefulness from the time that users spend on retrieved documents, over the course of several information seeking episodes. A 3-stage controlled experiment was conducted with 24 participants, each coming 3 times to work on 3 sub-tasks of a general task, couched either as "parallel" or "dependent" task type. The full task was to write a report on the general topic, with interim documents produced for each sub-task. Results show that task stage can help in inferring document usefulness from decision time, especially in the parallel task. The findings can be used to increase accuracy in predicting document usefulness and accordingly in personalizing search for multi-session tasks.
1835458	Predicting searcher frustration When search engine users have trouble finding information, they may become frustrated, possibly resulting in a bad experience (even if they are ultimately successful). In a user study in which participants were given difficult information seeking tasks, half of all queries submitted resulted in some degree of self-reported frustration. A third of all successful tasks involved at least one instance of frustration. By modeling searcher frustration, search engines can predict the current state of user frustration and decide when to intervene with alternative search strategies to prevent the user from becoming more frustrated, giving up, or switching to another search engine. We present several models to predict frustration using features extracted from query logs and physical sensors. We are able to predict frustration with a mean average precision of 65% from the physical sensors, and 87% from the query log features.
1835459	The good, the bad, and the random: an eye-tracking study of ad quality in web search We investigate how people interact with Web search engine result pages using eye-tracking. While previous research has focused on the visual attention devoted to the 10 organic search results, this paper examines other components of contemporary search engines, such as ads and related searches. We systematically varied the type of task (informational or navigational), the quality of the ads (relevant or irrelevant to the query), and the sequence in which ads of different quality were presented. We measured the effects of these variables on the distribution of visual attention and on task performance. Our results show significant effects of each variable. The amount of visual attention that people devote to organic results depends on both task type and ad quality. The amount of visual attention that people devote to ads depends on their quality, but not the type of task. Interestingly, the sequence and predictability of ad quality is also an important factor in determining how much people attend to ads. When the quality of ads varied randomly from task to task, people paid little attention to the ads, even when they were good. These results further our understanding of how attention devoted to search results is influenced by other page elements, and how previous search experiences influence how people attend to the current page.
1835461	Ranking using multiple document types in desktop search A typical desktop environment contains many document types (email, presentations, web pages, pdfs, etc.) each with different metadata. Predicting which types of documents a user is looking for in the context of a given query is a crucial part of providing effective desktop search. The problem is similar to selecting resources in distributed IR, but there are some important differences. In this paper, we quantify the impact of type prediction in producing a merged ranking for desktop search and introduce a new prediction method that exploits type-specific metadata. In addition, we show that type prediction performance and search effectiveness can be further enhanced by combining existing methods of type prediction using discriminative learning models. Our experiments employ pseudo-desktop collections and a human computation game for acquiring realistic and reusable queries.
1835462	Acquisition of instance attributes via labeled and related instances This paper presents a method for increasing the quality of automatically extracted instance attributes by exploiting weakly-supervised and unsupervised instance relatedness data. This data consists of (a) class labels for instances and (b) distributional similarity scores. The method organizes the text-derived data into a graph, and automatically propagates attributes among related instances, through random walks over the graph. Experiments on various graph topologies illustrate the advantage of the method over both the original attribute lists and a per-class attribute extractor, both in terms of the number of attributes extracted per instance and the accuracy of the top-ranked attributes.
1835463	Relevance and ranking in online dating systems Match-making systems refer to systems where users want to meet other individuals to satisfy some underlying need. Examples of match-making systems include dating services, resume/job bulletin boards, community based question answering, and consumer-to-consumer marketplaces. One fundamental component of a match-making system is the retrieval and ranking of candidate matches for a given user. We present the first in-depth study of information retrieval approaches applied to match-making systems. Specifically, we focus on retrieval for a dating service. This domain offers several unique problems not found in traditional information retrieval tasks. These include two-sided relevance, very subjective relevance, extremely few relevant matches, and structured queries. We propose a machine learned ranking function that makes use of features extracted from the uniquely rich user profiles that consist of both structured and unstructured attributes. An extensive evaluation carried out using data gathered from a real online dating service shows the benefits of our proposed methodology with respect to traditional match-making baseline systems. Our analysis also provides deep insights into the aspects of match-making that are particularly important for producing highly relevant matches.
1835466	Caching search engine results over incremental indices A Web search engine must update its index periodically to incorporate changes to the Web. We argue in this paper that index updates fundamentally impact the design of search engine result caches, a performance-critical component of modern search engines. Index updates lead to the problem of cache invalidation : invalidating cached entries of queries whose results have changed. Naive approaches, such as flushing the entire cache upon every index update, lead to poor performance and in fact, render caching futile when the frequency of updates is high. Solving the invalidation problem efficiently corresponds to predicting accurately which queries will produce different results if re-evaluated, given the actual changes to the index. To obtain this property, we propose a framework for developing invalidation predictors and define metrics to evaluate invalidation schemes. We describe concrete predictors using this framework and compare them against a baseline that uses a cache invalidation scheme based on time-to-live (TTL). Evaluation over Wikipedia documents using a query log from the Yahoo! search engine shows that selective invalidation of cached search results can lower the number of unnecessary query evaluations by as much as 30% compared to a baseline scheme, while returning results of similar freshness. In general, our predictors enable fewer unnecessary invalidations and fewer stale results compared to a TTL-only scheme for similar freshness of results.
1835467	Query forwarding in geographically distributed search engines Query forwarding is an important technique for preserving the result quality in distributed search engines where the index is geographically partitioned over multiple search sites. The key component in query forwarding is the thresholding algorithm by which the forwarding decisions are given. In this paper, we propose a linear-programming-based thresholding algorithm that significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of achieved search efficiency values. Moreover, we evaluate a greedy heuristic for partial index replication and investigate the impact of result cache freshness on query forwarding performance. Finally, we present some optimizations that improve the performance further, under certain conditions. We evaluate the proposed techniques by simulations over a real-life setting, using a large query log and a document collection obtained from Yahoo!.
1835470	Temporal click model for sponsored search Previous studies on search engine click modeling have identified two presentation factors that affect users' behavior: (1) position bias: the same result will get a different number of clicks when displayed in different positions and (2) externalities: the same result might get more clicks when displayed with results of relatively lower quality than when shown with higher quality results. In this paper we focus on analyzing the sequence of user actions to model users' click behavior on sponsored listings shown on the search results page. We first show that temporal click sequences are good indicators of externalities in the advertising domain. We then describe the positional rationality hypothesis to explain both the position bias and the externalities, and based on this hypothesis we further propose the temporal click model (TCM) , a Bayesian framework that is scalable and computationally efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to estimate positional bias, externalities and unbiased user-perceived ad quality from user click logs in a combined model. We finally evaluate the proposed model on two real datasets, each containing over 100 million ad impressions obtained from a commercial search engine. The experimental results show that TCM outperforms two other competitive methods at click prediction.
1835471	Freshness matters: in flowers, food, and web authority The collective contributions of billions of users across the globe each day result in an ever-changing web. In verticals like news and real-time search, recency is an obvious significant factor for ranking. However, traditional link-based web ranking algorithms typically run on a single web snapshot without concern for user activities associated with the dynamics of web pages and links. Therefore, a stale page popular many years ago may still achieve a high authority score due to its accumulated in-links. To remedy this situation, we propose a temporal web link-based ranking scheme, which incorporates features from historical author activities. We quantify web page freshness over time from page and in-link activity, and design a web surfer model that incorporates web freshness, based on a temporal web graph composed of multiple web snapshots at different time points. It includes authority propagation among snapshots, enabling link structures at distinct time points to influence each other when estimating web page authority. Experiments on a real-world archival web corpus show our approach improves upon PageRank in both relevance and freshness of the search results.
1835473	Ready to buy or just browsing?: detecting web searcher goals from interaction data An improved understanding of the relationship between search intent, result quality, and searcher behavior is crucial for improving the effectiveness of web search. While recent progress in user behavior mining has been largely focused on aggregate server-side click logs, we present a new class of search behavior models that also exploit fine-grained user interactions with the search results. We show that mining these interactions, such as mouse movements and scrolling, can enable more effective detection of the user's search goals. Potential applications include automatic search evaluation, improving search ranking, result presentation, and search advertising. We describe extensive experimental evaluation over both controlled user studies, and logs of interaction data collected from hundreds of real users. The results show that our method is more effective than the current state-of-the-art techniques, both for detection of searcher goals, and for an important practical application of predicting ad clicks for a given search session.
1835475	Learning to efficiently rank It has been shown that learning to rank approaches are capable of learning highly effective ranking functions. However, these approaches have mostly ignored the important issue of efficiency. Given that both efficiency and effectiveness are important for real search engines, models that are optimized for effectiveness may not meet the strict efficiency requirements necessary to deploy in a production environment. In this work, we present a unified framework for jointly optimizing effectiveness and efficiency. We propose new metrics that capture the tradeoff between these two competing forces and devise a strategy for automatically learning models that directly optimize the tradeoff metrics. Experiments indicate that models learned in this way provide a good balance between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. With specific loss functions, learned models converge to familiar existing ones, which demonstrates the generality of our framework. Finally, we show that our approach naturally leads to a reduction in the variance of query execution times, which is important for query load balancing and user satisfaction.
1835477	How good is a span of terms?: exploiting proximity to improve web retrieval Ranking search results is a fundamental problem in information retrieval. In this paper we explore whether the use of proximity and phrase information can improve web retrieval accuracy. We build on existing research by incorporating novel ranking features based on flexible proximity terms with recent state-of-the-art machine learning ranking models. We introduce a method of determining the goodness of a set of proximity terms that takes advantage of the structured nature of web documents, document metadata, and phrasal information from search engine user query logs. We perform experiments on a large real-world Web data collection and show that using the goodness score of flexible proximity terms can improve ranking accuracy over state-of-the-art ranking methods by as much as 13%. We also show that we can improve accuracy on the hardest queries by as much as 9% relative to state-of-the-art approaches.
1835478	Learning to rank only using training data from related domain Like traditional supervised and semi-supervised algorithms, learning to rank for information retrieval requires document annotations provided by domain experts. It is costly to annotate training data for different search domains and tasks. We propose to exploit training data annotated for a related domain to learn to rank retrieved documents in the target domain, in which no labeled data is available. We present a simple yet effective approach based on instance-weighting scheme. Our method first estimates the importance of each related-domain document relative to the target domain. Then heuristics are studied to transform the importance of individual documents to the pairwise weights of document pairs, which can be directly incorporated into the popular ranking algorithms. Due to importance weighting, ranking model trained on related domain is highly adaptable to the data of target domain. Ranking adaptation experiments on LETOR3.0 dataset [27] demonstrate that with a fair amount of related-domain training data, our method significantly outperforms the baseline without weighting, and most of time is not significantly worse than an "ideal" model directly trained on target domain.
1835484	Social media recommendation based on people and tags We study personalized item recommendation within an enterprise social media application suite that includes blogs, bookmarks, communities, wikis, and shared files. Recommendations are based on two of the core elements of social media - people and tags. Relationship information among people, tags, and items, is collected and aggregated across different sources within the enterprise. Based on these aggregated relationships, the system recommends items related to people and tags that are related to the user. Each recommended item is accompanied by an explanation that includes the people and tags that led to its recommendation, as well as their relationships with the user and the item. We evaluated our recommender system through an extensive user study. Results show a significantly better interest ratio for the tag-based recommender than for the people-based recommender, and an even better performance for a combined recommender. Tags applied on the user by other people are found to be highly effective in representing that user's topics of interest.
1835486	Temporal diversity in recommender systems Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms, used to build web-based recommender systems, are often evaluated in terms of how accurately they predict user ratings. However, current evaluation techniques disregard the fact that users continue to rate items over time : the temporal characteristics of the system's top- N recommendations are not investigated. In particular, there is no means of measuring the extent that the same items are being recommended to users over and over again. In this work, we show that temporal diversity is an important facet of recommender systems, by showing how CF data changes over time and performing a user survey. We then evaluate three CF algorithms from the point of view of the diversity in the sequence of recommendation lists they produce over time. We examine how a number of characteristics of user rating patterns (including profile size and time between rating) affect diversity. We then propose and evaluate set methods that maximise temporal recommendation diversity without extensively penalising accuracy.
1835490	Information-based models for ad hoc IR We introduce in this paper the family of information-based models for ad hoc information retrieval. These models draw their inspiration from a long-standing hypothesis in IR, namely the fact that the difference in the behaviors of a word at the document and collection levels brings information on the significance of the word for the document. This hypothesis has been exploited in the 2-Poisson mixture models, in the notion of eliteness in BM25, and more recently in DFR models. We show here that, combined with notions related to burstiness, it can lead to simpler and better models.
1835493	Geometric representations for multiple documents Combining multiple documents to represent an information object is well-known as an effective approach for many Information Retrieval tasks. For example, passages can be combined to represent a document for retrieval, document clusters are represented using combinations of the documents they contain, and feedback documents can be combined to represent a query model. Various techniques for combination have been introduced, and among them, representation techniques based on concatenation and the arithmetic mean are frequently used. Some recent work has shown the potential of a new representation technique using the geometric mean. However, these studies lack a theoretical foundation explaining why the geometric mean should have advantages for representing multiple documents. In this paper, we show that the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are approximations to the center of mass in certain geometries, and show empirically that the geometric mean is closer to the center. Through experiments with two IR tasks, we show the potential benefits for geometric representations, including a geometry-based pseudo-relevance feedback method that outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.
1835494	Using statistical decision theory and relevance models for query-performance prediction We present a novel framework for the query-performance prediction task. That is, estimating the effectiveness of a search performed in response to a query in lack of relevance judgments. Our approach is based on using statistical decision theory for estimating the utility that a document ranking provides with respect to an information need expressed by the query. To address the uncertainty in inferring the information need, we estimate utility by the expected similarity between the given ranking and those induced by relevance models ; the impact of a relevance model is based on its presumed representativeness of the information need. Specific query-performance predictors instantiated from the framework substantially outperform state-of-the-art predictors over five TREC corpora.
1835495	Active learning for ranking through expected loss optimization Learning to rank arises in many information retrieval applications, ranging from Web search engine, online advertising to recommendation system. In learning to rank, the performance of a ranking model is strongly affected by the number of labeled examples in the training set; on the other hand, obtaining labeled examples for training data is very expensive and time-consuming. This presents a great need for the active learning approaches to select most informative examples for ranking learning; however, in the literature there is still very limited work to address active learning for ranking. In this paper, we propose a general active learning framework, Expected Loss Optimization (ELO), for ranking. The ELO framework is applicable to a wide range of ranking functions. Under this framework, we derive a novel algorithm, Expected DCG Loss Optimization (ELO-DCG), to select most informative examples. Furthermore, we investigate both query and document level active learning for raking and propose a two-stage ELO-DCG algorithm which incorporate both query and document selection into active learning. Extensive experiments on real-world Web search data sets have demonstrated great potential and effective-ness of the proposed framework and algorithms.
1835497	Image search by concept map In this paper, we present a novel image search system, image search by concept map . This system enables users to indicate not only what semantic concepts are expected to appear but also how these concepts are spatially distributed in the desired images. To this end, we propose a new image search interface to enable users to formulate a query, called concept map , by intuitively typing textual queries in a blank canvas to indicate the desired spatial positions of the concepts. In the ranking process, by interpreting each textual concept as a set of representative visual instances, the concept map query is translated into a visual instance map , which is then used to evaluate the relevance of the image in the database. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.
1835499	Evaluating verbose query processing techniques Verbose or long queries are a small but significant part of the query stream in web search, and are common in other applications such as collaborative question answering (CQA). Current search engines perform well with keyword queries but are not, in general, effective for verbose queries. In this paper, we examine query processing techniques which can be applied to verbose queries prior to submission to a search engine in order to improve the search engine's results. We focus on verbose queries that have sentence-like structure, but are not simple "wh-" questions, and assume the search engine is a "black box." We evaluated the output of two search engines using queries from a CQA service and our results show that, among a broad range of techniques, the most effective approach is to simply reduce the length of the query. This can be achieved effectively by removing "stop structure" instead of only stop words. We show that the process of learning and removing stop structure from a query can be effectively automated.
1835505	Estimation of statistical translation models based on mutual information for ad hoc information retrieval As a principled approach to capturing semantic relations of words in information retrieval, statistical translation models have been shown to outperform simple document language models which rely on exact matching of words in the query and documents. A main challenge in applying translation models to ad hoc information retrieval is to estimate a translation model without training data. Existing work has relied on training on synthetic queries generated based on a document collection. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not have a good coverage of query words. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to estimate a translation model based on normalized mutual information between words, which is less computationally expensive and has better coverage of query words than the synthetic query method of estimation. We also propose to regularize estimated translation probabilities to ensure sufficient probability mass for self-translation. Experiment results show that the proposed mutual information-based estimation method is not only more efficient, but also more effective than the synthetic query-based method, and it can be combined with pseudo-relevance feedback to further improve retrieval accuracy. The results also show that the proposed regularization strategy is effective and can improve retrieval accuracy for both synthetic query-based estimation and mutual information-based estimation.
1835506	DivQ : diversification for keyword search over structured databases Keyword queries over structured databases are notoriously ambiguous. No single interpretation of a keyword query can satisfy all users, and multiple interpretations may yield overlapping results. This paper proposes a scheme to balance the relevance and novelty of keyword search results over structured databases. Firstly, we present a probabilistic model which effectively ranks the possible interpretations of a keyword query over structured data. Then, we introduce a scheme to diversify the search results by re-ranking query interpretations, taking into account redundancy of query results. Finally, we propose ?-nDCG-W and WS-recall, an adaptation of ?-nDCG and S-recall metrics, taking into account graded relevance of subtopics. Our evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that search results obtained using the proposed diversification algorithms better characterize possible answers available in the database than the results of the initial relevance ranking.
1835510	Incorporating post-click behaviors into a click model Much work has attempted to model a user's click-through behavior by mining the click logs. The task is not trivial due to the well-known position bias problem. Some break-throughs have been made: two newly proposed click models, DBN and CCM, addressed this problem and improved document relevance estimation. However, to further improve the estimation, we need a model that can capture more sophisticated user behaviors. In particular, after clicking a search result, a user's behavior (such as the dwell time on the clicked document, and whether there are further clicks on the clicked document) can be highly indicative of the relevance of the document. Unfortunately, such measures have not been incorporated in previous click models. In this paper, we introduce a novel click model, called the post-click click model (PCC), which provides an unbiased estimation of document relevance through leveraging both click behaviors on the search page and post-click behaviors beyond the search page. The PCC model is based on the Bayesian approach, and because of its incremental nature, it is highly scalable to large scale and constantly growing log data. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state of the art methods merely relying on click logs.
1835511	Interactive retrieval based on faceted feedback Motivated by the commonly used faceted search interface in e-commerce, this paper investigates interactive relevance feedback mechanism based on faceted document metadata. In this mechanism, the system recommends a group of document facet-value pairs, and lets users select relevant ones to restrict the returned documents. We propose four facet-value pair recommendation approaches and two retrieval models that incorporate user feedback on document facets. Evaluated based on user feedback collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk, our experimental results show that the Boolean filtering approach, which is widely used in faceted search in e-commerce, doesn't work well for text document retrieval, due to the incompleteness (low recall) of metadata assignment in semi-structured text documents. Instead, a soft model performs more effectively. The faceted feedback mechanism can also be combined with document-based relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback to further improve the retrieval performance.
1835513	Understanding web browsing behaviors through Weibull analysis of dwell time Dwell time on Web pages has been extensively used for various information retrieval tasks. However, some basic yet important questions have not been sufficiently addressed, eg, what distribution is appropriate to model the distribution of dwell times on a Web page, and furthermore, what the distribution tells us about the underlying browsing behaviors. In this paper, we draw an analogy between abandoning a page during Web browsing and a system failure in reliability analysis, and propose to model the dwell time using the Weibull distribution. Using this distribution provides better goodness-of-fit to real world data, and it uncovers some interesting patterns of user browsing behaviors not previously reported. For example, our analysis reveals that Web browsing in general exhibits a significant "negative aging" phenomenon, which means that some initial screening has to be passed before a page is examined in detail, giving rise to the browsing behavior that we call "screen-and-glean." In addition, we demonstrate that dwell time distributions can be reasonably predicted purely based on low-level page features, which broadens the possible applications of this study to situations where log data may be unavailable.
1835517	Proximity-based opinion retrieval Blog post opinion retrieval aims at finding blog posts that are relevant and opinionated about a user's query. In this paper we propose a simple probabilistic model for assigning relevant opinion scores to documents. The key problem is how to capture opinion expressions in the document, that are related to the query topic. Current solutions enrich general opinion lexicons by finding query-specific opinion lexicons using pseudo-relevance feedback on external corpora or the collection itself. In this paper we use a general opinion lexicon and propose using proximity information in order to capture opinion term relatedness to the query. We propose a proximity-based opinion propagation method to calculate the opinion density at each point in a document. The opinion density at the position of a query term in the document can then be considered as the probability of opinion about the query term at that position. The effect of different kernels for capturing the proximity is also discussed. Experimental results on the BLOG06 dataset show that the proposed method provides significant improvement over standard TREC baselines and achieves a 2.5% increase in MAP over the best performing run in the TREC 2008 blog track.
1835518	Evaluating and predicting answer quality in community QA Question answering (QA) helps one go beyond traditional keywords-based querying and retrieve information in more precise form than given by a document or a list of documents. Several community-based QA (CQA) services have emerged allowing information seekers pose their information need as questions and receive answers from their fellow users. A question may receive multiple answers from multiple users and the asker or the community can choose the best answer. While the asker can thus indicate if he was satisfied with the information he received, there is no clear way of evaluating the quality of that information. We present a study to evaluate and predict the quality of an answer in a CQA setting. We chose Yahoo! Answers as such CQA service and selected a small set of questions, each with at least five answers. We asked Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to rate the quality of each answer for a given question based on 13 different criteria. Each answer was rated by five different workers. We then matched their assessments with the actual asker's rating of a given answer. We show that the quality criteria we used faithfully match with asker's perception of a quality answer. We furthered our investigation by extracting various features from questions, answers, and the users who posted them, and training a number of classifiers to select the best answer using those features. We demonstrate a high predictability of our trained models along with the relative merits of each of the features for such prediction. These models support our argument that in case of CQA, contextual information such as a user's profile, can be critical in evaluating and predicting content quality.
1835522	Uncovering social spammers: social honeypots + machine learning Web-based social systems enable new community-based opportunities for participants to engage, share, and interact. This community value and related services like search and advertising are threatened by spammers, content polluters, and malware disseminators. In an effort to preserve community value and ensure longterm success, we propose and evaluate a honeypot-based approach for uncovering social spammers in online social systems. Two of the key components of the proposed approach are: (1) The deployment of social honeypots for harvesting deceptive spam profiles from social networking communities; and (2) Statistical analysis of the properties of these spam profiles for creating spam classifiers to actively filter out existing and new spammers. We describe the conceptual framework and design considerations of the proposed approach, and we present concrete observations from the deployment of social honeypots in MySpace and Twitter. We find that the deployed social honeypots identify social spammers with low false positive rates and that the harvested spam data contains signals that are strongly correlated with observable profile features (e.g., content, friend information, posting patterns, etc.). Based on these profile features, we develop machine learning based classifiers for identifying previously unknown spammers with high precision and a low rate of false positives.
1835524	Studying trailfinding algorithms for enhanced web search Search engines return ranked lists of Web pages in response to queries. These pages are starting points for post-query navigation, but may be insufficient for search tasks involving multiple steps. Search trails mined from toolbar logs start with a query and contain pages visited by one user during post-query navigation. Implicit endorsements from many trails can enhance result ranking. Rather than using trails solely to improve ranking, it may also be worth providing trail information directly to users. In this paper, we quantify the benefit that users currently obtain from trail-following and compare different methods for finding the best trail for a given query and each top-ranked result. We compare the relevance, topic coverage, topic diversity, and utility of trails selected using different methods, and break out findings by factors such as query type and origin relevance. Our findings demonstrate value in trails, highlight interesting differences in the performance of trailfinding algorithms, and show we can find best-trails for a query that outperform the trails most users follow. Findings have implications for enhancing Web information seeking using trails.
1835525	Context-aware ranking in web search The context of a search query often provides a search engine meaningful hints for answering the current query better. Previous studies on context-aware search were either focused on the development of context models or limited to a relatively small scale investigation under a controlled laboratory setting. Particularly, about context-aware ranking for Web search, the following two critical problems are largely remained unsolved. First, how can we take advantage of different types of contexts in ranking? Second, how can we integrate context information into a ranking model? In this paper, we tackle the above two essential problems analytically and empirically. We develop different ranking principles for different types of contexts. Moreover, we adopt a learning-to-rank approach and integrate the ranking principles into a state-of-the-art ranking model by encoding the context information as features of the model. We empirically test our approach using a large search log data set obtained from a major commercial search engine. Our evaluation uses both human judgments and implicit user click data. The experimental results clearly show that our context-aware ranking approach improves the ranking of a commercial search engine which ignores context information. Furthermore, our method outperforms a baseline method which considers context information in ranking.
1835533	Visual summarization of web pages Visual summarization is a attractive new scheme to summarize web pages, which can help achieve a more friendly user experience in search and re-finding tasks by allowing users quickly get the idea of what the web page is about and helping users recall the visited web page. In this paper, we perform a careful study on the recently proposed visual summarization approaches, including the thumbnail of the web page snapshot, the internal image in the web page which is representative of the content in the page, and the visual snippet which is a synthesized image based on the internal image, the title, and the logo found in the web page. Moreover, since the internal image based summarization approach hardly works when the representative internal images are unavailable, we propose a new strategy, which retrieves the representative image from the external to summarize the web page. The experimental results suggest that the various summarization approaches have respective advantages on different types of web pages. While internal images and thumbnails can provide a reliable summarization on web pages with dominant images and web pages with simple structure respectively, the external images are regarded as a useful information to complement the internal images and are demonstrated very useful in helping users understanding new web pages . The visual snippet performs well on the re-finding tasks since it incorporates the title and logo which are advantageous on identifying the visited web pages.
1835534	Learning more powerful test statistics for click-based retrieval evaluation Interleaving experiments are an attractive methodology for evaluating retrieval functions through implicit feedback. Designed as a blind and unbiased test for eliciting a preference between two retrieval functions, an interleaved ranking of the results of two retrieval functions is presented to the users. It is then observed whether the users click more on results from one retrieval function or the other. While it was shown that such interleaving experiments reliably identify the better of the two retrieval functions, the naive approach of counting all clicks equally leads to a suboptimal test. We present new methods for learning how to score different types of clicks so that the resulting test statistic optimizes the statistical power of the experiment. This can lead to substantial savings in the amount of data required for reaching a target confidence level. Our methods are evaluated on an operational search engine over a collection of scientific articles.
1835536	Query similarity by projecting the query-flow graph Defining a measure of similarity between queries is an interesting and difficult problem. A reliable query-similarity measure can be used in a variety of applications such as query recommendation, query expansion, and advertising. In this paper, we exploit the information present in query logs in order to develop a measure of semantic similarity between queries. Our approach relies on the concept of the query-flow graph. The query-flow graph aggregates query reformulations from many users: nodes in the graph represent queries, and two queries are connected if they are likely to appear as part of the same search goal. Our query similarity measure is obtained by projecting the graph (or appropriate subgraphs of it) on a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Our experiments show that the measure we obtain captures a notion of semantic similarity between queries and it is useful for diversifying query recommendations.
1835537	The demographics of web search How does the web search behavior of "rich" and "poor" people differ? Do men and women tend to click on difffferent results for the same query? What are some queries almost exclusively issued by African Americans? These are some of the questions we address in this study. Our research combines three data sources: the query log of a major US-based web search engine, profile information provided by 28 million of its users (birth year, gender and ZIP code), and US-census information including detailed demographic information aggregated at the level of ZIP code. Through this combination we can annotate each query with, e.g. the average per-capita income in the ZIP code it originated from. Though conceptually simple, this combination immediately creates a powerful user modeling tool. The main contributions of this work are the following. First, we provide a demographic description of a large sample of search engine users in the US and show that it agrees well with the distribution of the US population. Second, we describe how different segments of the population differ in their search behavior, e.g. with respect to the queries they formulate or the URLs they click. Third, we explore applications of our methodology to improve web search relevance and to provide better query suggestions. These results enable a wide range of applications including improving web search and advertising where, for instance, targeted advertisements for "family vacations" could be adapted to the (expected) income.
1835538	A user behavior model for average precision and its generalization to graded judgments We explore a set of hypothesis on user behavior that are potentially at the origin of the (Mean) Average Precision (AP) metric. This allows us to propose a more realistic version of AP where users click non-deterministically on relevant documents and where the number of relevant documents in the collection needs not be known in advance. We then depart from the assumption that a document is either relevant or irrelevant and we use instead relevance judgment similar to editorial labels used for Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG). We assume that clicked documents provide users with a certain level of "utility" and that a user ends a search when she gathered enough utility. Based on the query logs of a commercial search engine we show how to evaluate the utility associated with a label from the record of past user interactions with the search engine and we show how the two different user models can be evaluated based on their ability to predict accurately future clicks. Finally, based on these user models, we propose a measure that captures the relative quality of two rankings.
1835540	The effect of assessor error on IR system evaluation Recent efforts in test collection building have focused on scaling back the number of necessary relevance judgments and then scaling up the number of search topics. Since the largest source of variation in a Cranfield-style experiment comes from the topics, this is a reasonable approach. However, as topic set sizes grow, and researchers look to crowdsourcing and Amazon's Mechanical Turk to collect relevance judgments, we are faced with issues of quality control. This paper examines the robustness of the TREC Million Query track methods when some assessors make significant and systematic errors. We find that while averages are robust, assessor errors can have a large effect on system rankings.
1835542	Do user preferences and evaluation measures line up? This paper presents results comparing user preference for search engine rankings with measures of effectiveness computed from a test collection. It establishes that preferences and evaluation measures correlate: systems measured as better on a test collection are preferred by users. This correlation is established for both "conventional web retrieval" and for retrieval that emphasizes diverse results. The nDCG measure is found to correlate best with user preferences compared to a selection of other well known measures. Unlike previous studies in this area, this examination involved a large population of users, gathered through crowd sourcing, exposed to a wide range of retrieval systems, test collections and search tasks. Reasons for user preferences were also gathered and analyzed. The work revealed a number of new results, but also showed that there is much scope for future work refining effectiveness measures to better capture user preferences.
1835545	Exploring reductions for long web queries Long queries form a difficult, but increasingly important segment for web search engines. Query reduction, a technique for dropping unnecessary query terms from long queries, improves performance of ad-hoc retrieval on TREC collections. Also, it has great potential for improving long web queries (upto 25% improvement in NDCG@5). However, query reduction on the web is hampered by the lack of accurate query performance predictors and the constraints imposed by search engine architectures and ranking algorithms. In this paper, we present query reduction techniques for long web queries that leverage effective and efficient query performance predictors. We propose three learning formulations that combine these predictors to perform automatic query reduction. These formulations enable trading of average improvements for the number of queries impacted, and enable easy integration into the search engine's architecture for rank-time query reduction. Experiments on a large collection of long queries issued to a commercial search engine show that the proposed techniques significantly outperform baselines, with more than 12% improvement in NDCG@5 in the impacted set of queries. Extension to the formulations such as result interleaving further improves results. We find that the proposed techniques deliver consistent retrieval gains where it matters most: poorly performing long web queries.
1835546	Positional relevance model for pseudo-relevance feedback Pseudo-relevance feedback is an effective technique for improving retrieval results. Traditional feedback algorithms use a whole feedback document as a unit to extract words for query expansion, which is not optimal as a document may cover several different topics and thus contain much irrelevant information. In this paper, we study how to effectively select from feedback documents those words that are focused on the query topic based on positions of terms in feedback documents. We propose a positional relevance model (PRM) to address this problem in a unified probabilistic way. The proposed PRM is an extension of the relevance model to exploit term positions and proximity so as to assign more weights to words closer to query words based on the intuition that words closer to query words are more likely to be related to the query topic. We develop two methods to estimate PRM based on different sampling processes. Experiment results on two large retrieval datasets show that the proposed PRM is effective and robust for pseudo-relevance feedback, significantly outperforming the relevance model in both document-based feedback and passage-based feedback.
1835548	Assessing the scenic route: measuring the value of search trails in web logs Search trails mined from browser or toolbar logs comprise queries and the post-query pages that users visit. Implicit endorsements from many trails can be useful for search result ranking, where the presence of a page on a trail increases its query relevance. Follow-ing a search trail requires user effort, yet little is known about the benefit that users obtain from this activity versus, say, sticking with the clicked search result or jumping directly to the destination page at the end of the trail. In this paper, we present a log-based study estimating the user value of trail following. We compare the relevance, topic coverage, topic diversity, novelty, and utility of full trails over that provided by sub-trails, trail origins (landing pages), and trail destinations (pages where trails end). Our findings demonstrate significant value to users in following trails, especially for certain query types. The findings have implications for the design of search systems, including trail recommendation systems that display trails on search result pages.
1835550	Extending average precision to graded relevance judgments Evaluation metrics play a critical role both in the context of comparative evaluation of the performance of retrieval systems and in the context of learning-to-rank (LTR) as objective functions to be optimized. Many different evaluation metrics have been proposed in the IR literature, with average precision (AP) being the dominant one due a number of desirable properties it possesses. However, most of these measures, including average precision, do not incorporate graded relevance. In this work, we propose a new measure of retrieval effectiveness, the Graded Average Precision (GAP). GAP generalizes average precision to the case of multi-graded relevance and inherits all the desirable characteristics of AP: it has a nice probabilistic interpretation, it approximates the area under a graded precision-recall curve and it can be justified in terms of a simple but moderately plausible user model. We then evaluate GAP in terms of its informativeness and discriminative power. Finally, we show that GAP can reliably be used as an objective metric in learning to rank by illustrating that optimizing for GAP using SoftRank and LambdaRank leads to better performing ranking functions than the ones constructed by algorithms tuned to optimize for AP or NDCG even when using AP or NDCG as the test metrics.
1835551	PRES: a score metric for evaluating recall-oriented information retrieval applications Information retrieval (IR) evaluation scores are generally designed to measure the effectiveness with which relevant documents are identified and retrieved. Many scores have been proposed for this purpose over the years. These have primarily focused on aspects of precision and recall, and while these are often discussed with equal importance, in practice most attention has been given to precision focused metrics. Even for recall-oriented IR tasks of growing importance, such as patent retrieval, these precision based scores remain the primary evaluation measures. Our study examines different evaluation measures for a recall-oriented patent retrieval task and demonstrates the limitations of the current scores in comparing different IR systems for this task. We introduce PRES, a novel evaluation metric for this type of application taking account of recall and the user's search effort. The behaviour of PRES is demonstrated on 48 runs from the CLEF-IP 2009 patent retrieval track. A full analysis of the performance of PRES shows its suitability for measuring the retrieval effectiveness of systems from a recall focused perspective taking into account the user's expected search effort.
1835560	Comparing the sensitivity of information retrieval metrics Information retrieval effectiveness is usually evaluated using measures such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Precision at some cutoff (Precision@k) on a set of judged queries. Recent research has suggested an alternative, evaluating information retrieval systems based on user behavior. Particularly promising are experiments that interleave two rankings and track user clicks. According to a recent study, interleaving experiments can identify large differences in retrieval effectiveness with much better reliability than other click-based methods. We study interleaving in more detail, comparing it with traditional measures in terms of reliability, sensitivity and agreement. To detect very small differences in retrieval effectiveness, a reliable outcome with standard metrics requires about 5,000 judged queries, and this is about as reliable as interleaving with 50,000 user impressions. Amongst the traditional measures, NDCG has the strongest correlation with interleaving. Finally, we present some new forms of analysis, including an approach to enhance interleaving sensitivity.
1835562	Efficient partial-duplicate detection based on sequence matching With the ever-increasing growth of the Internet, numerous copies of documents become serious problem for search engine, opinion mining and many other web applications. Since partial-duplicates only contain a small piece of text taken from other sources and most existing near-duplicate detection approaches focus on document level, partial duplicates can not be dealt with well. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to realize the partial-duplicate detection task. Besides the similarities between documents, our proposed algorithm can simultaneously locate the duplicated parts. The main idea is to divide the partial-duplicate detection task into two subtasks: sentence level near-duplicate detection and sequence matching. For evaluation, we compare the proposed method with other approaches on both English and Chinese web collections. Experimental results appear to support that our proposed method is effectively and efficiently to detect both partial-duplicates on large web collections.
1835564	Vertical selection in the presence of unlabeled verticals Vertical aggregation is the task of incorporating results from specialized search engines or verticals (e.g., images, video, news) into Web search results. Vertical selection is the subtask of deciding, given a query, which verticals, if any, are relevant. State of the art approaches use machine learned models to predict which verticals are relevant to a query. When trained using a large set of labeled data, a machine learned vertical selection model outperforms baselines which require no training data. Unfortunately, whenever a new vertical is introduced, a costly new set of editorial data must be gathered. In this paper, we propose methods for reusing training data from a set of existing (source) verticals to learn a predictive model for a new (target) vertical. We study methods for learning robust, portable, and adaptive cross-vertical models. Experiments show the need to focus on different types of features when maximizing portability (the ability for a single model to make accurate predictions across multiple verticals) than when maximizing adaptability (the ability for a single model to make accurate predictions for a specific vertical). We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through extensive experimentation for 11 verticals
1835610	Search system requirements of patent analysts Patent search tasks are difficult and challenging, often requiring expert patent analysts to spend hours, even days, sourcing relevant information. To aid them in this process, analysts use Information Retrieval systems and tools to cope with their retrieval tasks. With the growing interest in patent search, it is important to determine their requirements and expectations of the tools and systems that they employ. In this poster, we report a subset of the findings of a survey of patent analysts conducted to elicit their search requirements.
1835615	Predicting query performance on the web Predicting the performance of web queries is useful for several applications such as automatic query reformulation and automatic spell correction. In the web environment, accurate performance prediction is challenging because measures such as clarity that work well on homogeneous TREC-like collections, are not as effective and are often expensive to compute. We present Rank-time Performance Prediction (RAPP), an effective and efficient approach for online performance prediction on the web. RAPP uses retrieval scores, and aggregates of the rank-time features used by the document- ranking algorithm to train regressors for query performance prediction. On a set of over 12,000 queries sampled from the query logs of a major search engine, RAPP achieves a linear correlation of 0.78 with DCG@5, and 0.52 with NDCG@5. Analysis of prediction accuracy shows that hard queries are easier to identify while easy queries are harder to identify.
1835616	Hashtag retrieval in a microblogging environment Microblog services let users broadcast brief textual messages to people who "follow" their activity. Often these posts contain terms called hashtags, markers of a post's meaning, audience, etc. This poster treats the following problem: given a user's stated topical interest, retrieve useful hashtags from microblog posts. Our premise is that a user interested in topic x might like to find hashtags that are often applied to posts about x. This poster proposes a language modeling approach to hashtag retrieval. The main contribution is a novel method of relevance feedback based on hashtags. The approach is tested on a corpus of data harvested from twitter.com.
1835617	Crowdsourcing a wikipedia vandalism corpus We report on the construction of the PAN Wikipedia vandalism corpus, PAN-WVC-10, using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The corpus compiles 32452 edits on 28468 Wikipedia articles, among which 2391 vandalism edits have been identified. 753 human annotators cast a total of 193022 votes on the edits, so that each edit was reviewed by at least 3 annotators, whereas the achieved level of agreement was analyzed in order to label an edit as "regular" or "vandalism." The corpus is available free of charge.
1835643	Short text classification in twitter to improve information filtering In microblogging services such as Twitter, the users may become overwhelmed by the raw data. One solution to this problem is the classification of short text messages. As short texts do not provide sufficient word occurrences, traditional classification methods such as "Bag-Of-Words" have limitations. To address this problem, we propose to use a small set of domain-specific features extracted from the author's profile and text. The proposed approach effectively classifies the text to a predefined set of generic classes such as News, Events, Opinions, Deals, and Private Messages.
1835648	Using flickr geotags to predict user travel behaviour We propose a method to predict a user's favourite locations in a city, based on his Flickr geotags in other cities. We define a similarity between the geotag distributions of two users based on a Gaussian kernel convolution. The geotags of the most similar users are then combined to rerank the popular locations in the target city personalised for this user. We show that this method can give personalised travel recommendations for users with a clear preference for a specific type of landmark.

2009922	Modeling and analysis of cross-session search tasks The information needs of search engine users vary in complexity, depending on the task they are trying to accomplish. Some simple needs can be satisfied with a single query, whereas others require a series of queries issued over a longer period of time. While search engines effectively satisfy many simple needs, searchers receive little support when their information needs span session boundaries. In this work, we propose methods for modeling and analyzing user search behavior that extends over multiple search sessions. We focus on two problems: (i) given a user query, identify all of the related queries from previous sessions that the same user has issued, and (ii) given a multi-query task for a user, predict whether the user will return to this task in the future. We model both problems within a classification framework that uses features of individual queries and long-term user search behavior at different granularity. Experimental evaluation of the proposed models for both tasks indicates that it is possible to effectively model and analyze cross-session search behavior. Our findings have implications for improving search for complex information needs and designing search engine features to support cross-session search tasks.
2009923	The economics in interactive information retrieval Searching is inherently an interactive process usually requiring numerous iterations of querying and assessing in order to find the desired amount of relevant information. Essentially, the search process can be viewed as a combination of inputs (queries and assessments) which are used to "produce" output (relevance). Under this view, it is possible to adapt microeconomic theory to analyze and understand the dynamics of Interactive Information Retrieval. In this paper, we approach the search process as an economics problem and conduct extensive simulations on TREC test collections analyzing various combinations of inputs in the "production" of relevance. The analysis reveals that the total Cumulative Gain (output) obtained during the course of a search session is functionally related to querying and assessing (inputs), and this can be characterized mathematically by the Cobbs-Douglas production function. Further analysis using cost models, that are grounded using cognitive load as the cost, reveals which search strategies minimize the cost of interaction for a given level of output. This paper demonstrates how economics can be applied to formally model the search process. This development establishes the theoretical foundations of Interactive Information Retrieval, providing numerous directions for empirical experimentation that are motivated directly from theory.
2009929	Intentions and attention in exploratory health search We study information goals and patterns of attention in explorato-ry search for health information on the Web, reporting results of a large-scale log-based study. We examine search activity associated with the goal of diagnosing illness from symptoms versus more general information-seeking about health and illness. We decom-pose exploratory health search into evidence-based and hypothe-sis-directed information seeking. Evidence-based search centers on the pursuit of details and relevance of signs and symptoms. Hypothesis-directed search includes the pursuit of content on one or more illnesses, including risk factors, treatments, and therapies for illnesses, and on the discrimination among different diseases under the uncertainty that exists in advance of a confirmed diag-nosis. These different goals of exploratory health search are not independent, and transitions can occur between them within or across search sessions. We construct a classifier that identifies medically-related search sessions in log data. Given a set of search sessions flagged as health-related, we show how we can identify different intentions persisting as foci of attention within those sessions. Finally, we discuss how insights about foci dynamics can help us better understand exploratory health search behavior and better support health search on the Web.
2009932	Bagging gradient-boosted trees for high precision, low variance ranking models Recent studies have shown that boosting provides excellent predictive performance across a wide variety of tasks. In Learning-to-rank, boosted models such as RankBoost and LambdaMART have been shown to be among the best performing learning methods based on evaluations on public data sets. In this paper, we show how the combination of bagging as a variance reduction technique and boosting as a bias reduction technique can result in very high precision and low variance ranking models. We perform thousands of parameter tuning experiments for LambdaMART to achieve a high precision boosting model. Then we show that a bagged ensemble of such LambdaMART boosted models results in higher accuracy ranking models while also reducing variance as much as 50%. We report our results on three public learning-to-rank data sets using four metrics. Bagged LamdbaMART outperforms all previously reported results on ten of the twelve comparisons, and bagged LambdaMART outperforms non-bagged LambdaMART on all twelve comparisons. For example, wrapping bagging around LambdaMART increases NDCG@1 from 0.4137 to 0.4200 on the MQ2007 data set; the best prior results in the literature for this data set is 0.4134 by RankBoost.
2009933	Learning to rank for freshness and relevance Freshness of results is important in modern web search. Failing to recognize the temporal aspect of a query can negatively affect the user experience, and make the search engine appear stale. While freshness and relevance can be closely related for some topics (e.g., news queries), they are more independent in others (e.g., time insensitive queries). Therefore, optimizing one criterion does not necessarily improve the other, and can even do harm in some cases. We propose a machine-learning framework for simultaneously optimizing freshness and relevance, in which the trade-off is automatically adaptive to query temporal characteristics. We start by illustrating different temporal characteristics of queries, and the features that can be used for capturing these properties. We then introduce our supervised framework that leverages the temporal profile of queries (inferred from pseudo-feedback documents) along with the other ranking features to improve both freshness and relevance of search results. Our experiments on a large archival web corpus demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques.
2009934	A cascade ranking model for efficient ranked retrieval There is a fundamental tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency when designing retrieval models for large-scale document collections. Effectiveness tends to derive from sophisticated ranking functions, such as those constructed using learning to rank, while efficiency gains tend to arise from improvements in query evaluation and caching strategies. Given their inherently disjoint nature, it is difficult to jointly optimize effectiveness and efficiency in end-to-end systems. To address this problem, we formulate and develop a novel cascade ranking model, which unlike previous approaches, can simultaneously improve both top k ranked effectiveness and retrieval efficiency. The model constructs a cascade of increasingly complex ranking functions that progressively prunes and refines the set of candidate documents to minimize retrieval latency and maximize result set quality. We present a novel boosting algorithm for learning such cascades to directly optimize the tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results show that our cascades are faster and return higher quality results than comparable ranking models.
2009937	SCENE: a scalable two-stage personalized news recommendation system Recommending news articles has become a promising research direction as the Internet provides fast access to real-time information from multiple sources around the world. Traditional news recommendation systems strive to adapt their services to individual users by virtue of both user and news content information. However, the latent relationships among different news items, and the special properties of new articles, such as short shelf lives and value of immediacy, render the previous approaches inefficient. In this paper, we propose a scalable two-stage personalized news recommendation approach with a two-level representation, which considers the exclusive characteristics (e.g., news content, access patterns, named entities, popularity and recency) of news items when performing recommendation. Also, a principled framework for news selection based on the intrinsic property of user interest is presented, with a good balance between the novelty and diversity of the recommended result. Extensive empirical experiments on a collection of news articles obtained from various news websites demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach.
2009938	Inferring and using location metadata to personalize web search Personalization of search results offers the potential for significant improvements in Web search. Among the many observable user attributes, approximate user location is particularly simple for search engines to obtain and allows personalization even for a first-time Web search user. However, acting on user location information is difficult, since few Web documents include an address that can be interpreted as constraining the locations where the document is relevant. Furthermore, many Web documents -- such as local news stories, lottery results, and sports team fan pages -- may not correspond to physical addresses, but the location of the user still plays an important role in document relevance. In this paper, we show how to infer a more general location relevance which uses not only physical location but a more general notion of locations of interest for Web pages. We compute this information using implicit user behavioral data, characterize the most location-centric pages, and show how location information can be incorporated into Web search ranking. Our results show that a substantial fraction of Web search queries can be significantly improved by incorporating location-based features.
2009945	Who should share what?: item-level social influence prediction for users and posts ranking People and information are two core dimensions in a social network. People sharing information (such as blogs, news, albums, etc.) is the basic behavior. In this paper, we focus on predicting item-level social influence to answer the question Who should share What, which can be extended into two information retrieval scenarios: (1) Users ranking: given an item, who should share it so that its diffusion range can be maximized in a social network; (2) Web posts ranking: given a user, what should she share to maximize her influence among her friends. We formulate the social influence prediction problem as the estimation of a user-post matrix, in which each entry represents the strength of influence of a user given a web post. We propose a Hybrid Factor Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (HF-NMF) approach for item-level social influence modeling, and devise an efficient projected gradient method to solve the HF-NMF problem. Intensive experiments are conducted and demonstrate the advantages and characteristics of the proposed method.
2009947	Crowdsourcing for book search evaluation: impact of hit design on comparative system ranking The evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems over special collections, such as large book repositories, is out of reach of traditional methods that rely upon editorial relevance judgments. Increasingly, the use of crowdsourcing to collect relevance labels has been regarded as a viable alternative that scales with modest costs. However, crowdsourcing suffers from undesirable worker practices and low quality contributions. In this paper we investigate the design and implementation of effective crowdsourcing tasks in the context of book search evaluation. We observe the impact of aspects of the Human Intelligence Task (HIT) design on the quality of relevance labels provided by the crowd. We assess the output in terms of label agreement with a gold standard data set and observe the effect of the crowdsourced relevance judgments on the resulting system rankings. This enables us to observe the effect of crowdsourcing on the entire IR evaluation process. Using the test set and experimental runs from the INEX 2010 Book Track, we find that varying the HIT design, and the pooling and document ordering strategies leads to considerable differences in agreement with the gold set labels. We then observe the impact of the crowdsourced relevance label sets on the relative system rankings using four IR performance metrics. System rankings based on MAP and Bpref remain less affected by different label sets while the Precision@10 and nDCG@10 lead to dramatically different system rankings, especially for labels acquired from HITs with weaker quality controls. Overall, we find that crowdsourcing can be an effective tool for the evaluation of IR systems, provided that care is taken when designing the HITs.
2009950	Composite hashing with multiple information sources Similarity search applications with a large amount of text and image data demands an efficient and effective solution. One useful strategy is to represent the examples in databases as compact binary codes through semantic hashing, which has attracted much attention due to its fast query/search speed and drastically reduced storage requirement. All of the current semantic hashing methods only deal with the case when each example is represented by one type of features. However, examples are often described from several different information sources in many real world applications. For example, the characteristics of a webpage can be derived from both its content part and its associated links. To address the problem of learning good hashing codes in this scenario, we propose a novel research problem -- Composite Hashing with Multiple Information Sources (CHMIS). The focus of the new research problem is to design an algorithm for incorporating the features from different information sources into the binary hashing codes efficiently and effectively. In particular, we propose an algorithm CHMIS-AW (CHMIS with Adjusted Weights) for learning the codes. The proposed algorithm integrates information from several different sources into the binary hashing codes by adjusting the weights on each individual source for maximizing the coding performance, and enables fast conversion from query examples to their binary hashing codes. Experimental results on five different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against several other state-of-the-art semantic hashing techniques.
2009954	Social context summarization We study a novel problem of social context summarization for Web documents. Traditional summarization research has focused on extracting informative sentences from standard documents. With the rapid growth of online social networks, abundant user generated content (e.g., comments) associated with the standard documents is available. Which parts in a document are social users really caring about? How can we generate summaries for standard documents by considering both the informativeness of sentences and interests of social users? This paper explores such an approach by modeling Web documents and social contexts into a unified framework. We propose a dual wing factor graph (DWFG) model, which utilizes the mutual reinforcement between Web documents and their associated social contexts to generate summaries. An efficient algorithm is designed to learn the proposed factor graph model.Experimental results on a Twitter data set validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. By leveraging the social context information, our approach obtains significant improvement (averagely +5.0%-17.3%) over several alternative methods (CRF, SVM, LR, PR, and DocLead) on the performance of summarization.
2009957	Unsupervised query segmentation using clickthrough for information retrieval Query segmentation is an important task toward understanding queries accurately, which is essential for improving search results. Existing segmentation models either use labeled data to predict the segmentation boundaries, for which the training data is expensive to collect, or employ unsupervised strategy based on a large text corpus, which might be inaccurate because of the lack of relevant information. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to exploit clickthrough data for query segmentation, where the model parameters are estimated via an efficient EM algorithm. We further study how to properly interpret the segmentation results and utilize them to improve retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we propose an integrated language model based on the standard bigram language model to exploit the probabilistic structure obtained through query segmentation. Experiment results on two datasets show that our segmentation model outperforms existing segmentation models. Furthermore, extensive experiments on a large retrieval dataset reveals that the results of query segmentation can be leveraged to improve retrieval relevance by using the proposed integrated language model.
2009959	Collaborative competitive filtering: learning recommender using context of user choice While a user's preference is directly reflected in the interactive choice process between her and the recommender, this wealth of information was not fully exploited for learning recommender models. In particular, existing collaborative filtering (CF) approaches take into account only the binary events of user actions but totally disregard the contexts in which users' decisions are made. In this paper, we propose Collaborative Competitive Filtering (CCF), a framework for learning user preferences by modeling the choice process in recommender systems. CCF employs a multiplicative latent factor model to characterize the dyadic utility function. But unlike CF, CCF models the user behavior of choices by encoding a local competition effect. In this way, CCF allows us to leverage dyadic data that was previously lumped together with missing data in existing CF models. We present two formulations and an efficient large scale optimization algorithm. Experiments on three real-world recommendation data sets demonstrate that CCF significantly outperforms standard CF approaches in both offline and online evaluations.
2009960	CLR: a collaborative location recommendation framework based on co-clustering GPS data tracked on mobile devices contains rich information about human activities and preferences. In this paper, GPS data is used in location-based services (LBSs) to provide collaborative location recommendations. We observe that most existing LBSs provide location recommendations by clustering the User-Location matrix. Since the User-Location matrix created based on GPS data is huge, there are two major problems with these methods. First, the number of similar locations that need to be considered in computing the recommendations can be numerous. As a result, the identification of truly relevant locations from numerous candidates is challenging. Second, the clustering process on large matrix is time consuming. Thus, when new GPS data arrives, complete re-clustering of the whole matrix is infeasible. To tackle these two problems, we propose the Collaborative Location Recommendation (CLR) framework for location recommendation. By considering activities (i.e., temporal preferences) and different user classes (i.e., Pattern Users, Normal Users, and Travelers) in the recommendation process, CLR is capable of generating more precise and refined recommendations to the users compared to the existing methods. Moreover, CLR employs a dynamic clustering algorithm CADC to cluster the trajectory data into groups of similar users, similar activities and similar locations efficiently by supporting incremental update of the groups when new GPS trajectory data arrives. We evaluate CLR with a real-world GPS dataset, and confirm that the CLR framework provides more accurate location recommendations compared to the existing methods.
2009961	Functional matrix factorizations for cold-start recommendation A key challenge in recommender system research is how to effectively profile new users, a problem generally known as cold-start recommendation. Recently the idea of progressively querying user responses through an initial interview process has been proposed as a useful new user preference elicitation strategy. In this paper, we present functional matrix factorization (fMF), a novel cold-start recommendation method that solves the problem of initial interview construction within the context of learning user and item profiles. Specifically, fMF constructs a decision tree for the initial interview with each node being an interview question, enabling the recommender to query a user adaptively according to her prior responses. More importantly, we associate latent profiles for each node of the tree --- in effect restricting the latent profiles to be a function of possible answers to the interview questions --- which allows the profiles to be gradually refined through the interview process based on user responses. We develop an iterative optimization algorithm that alternates between decision tree construction and latent profiles extraction as well as a regularization scheme that takes into account of the tree structure. Experimental results on three benchmark recommendation data sets demonstrate that the proposed fMF algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods for cold-start recommendation.
2009962	Exploiting geographical influence for collaborative point-of-interest recommendation In this paper, we aim to provide a point-of-interests (POI) recommendation service for the rapid growing location-based social networks (LBSNs), e.g., Foursquare, Whrrl, etc. Our idea is to explore user preference, social influence and geographical influence for POI recommendations. In addition to deriving user preference based on user-based collaborative filtering and exploring social influence from friends, we put a special emphasis on geographical influence due to the spatial clustering phenomenon exhibited in user check-in activities of LBSNs. We argue that the geographical influence among POIs plays an important role in user check-in behaviors and model it by power law distribution. Accordingly, we develop a collaborative recommendation algorithm based on geographical influence based on naive Bayesian. Furthermore, we propose a unified POI recommendation framework, which fuses user preference to a POI with social influence and geographical influence. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation over two large-scale datasets collected from Foursquare and Whrrl. Experimental results with these real datasets show that the unified collaborative recommendation approach significantly outperforms a wide spectrum of alternative recommendation approaches.
2009964	Why searchers switch: understanding and predicting engine switching rationales Search engine switching is the voluntary transition between Web search engines. Engine switching can occur for a number of reasons, including user dissatisfaction with search results, a desire for broader topic coverage or verification, user preferences, or even unintentionally. An improved understanding of switching rationales allows search providers to tailor the search experience according to the different causes. In this paper we study the reasons behind search engine switching within a session. We address the challenge of identifying switching rationales by designing and implementing client-side instrumentation to acquire in-situ feedbacks from users. Using this feedback, we investigate in detail the reasons that users switch engines within a session. We also study the relationship between implicit behavioral signals and the switching causes, and develop and evaluate models to predict the reasons for switching. In addition, we collect editorial judgments of switching rationales by third-party judges and show that we can recover switching causes a posteriori. Our findings provide valuable insights into why users switch search engines in a session and demonstrate the relationship between search behavior and switching motivations. The findings also reveal sufficient behavioral consistency to afford accurate prediction of switching rationale, which can be used to dynamically adapt the search experience and derive more accurate competitive metrics.
2009965	Find it if you can: a game for modeling different types of web search success using interaction data A better understanding of strategies and behavior of successful searchers is crucial for improving the experience of all searchers. However, research of search behavior has been struggling with the tension between the relatively small-scale, but controlled lab studies, and the large-scale log-based studies where the searcher intent and many other important factors have to be inferred. We present our solution for performing controlled, yet realistic, scalable, and reproducible studies of searcher behavior. We focus on difficult informational tasks, which tend to frustrate many users of the current web search technology. First, we propose a principled formalization of different types of "success" for informational search, which encapsulate and sharpen previously proposed models. Second, we present a scalable game-like infrastructure for crowdsourcing search behavior studies, specifically targeted towards capturing and evaluating successful search strategies on informational tasks with known intent. Third, we report our analysis of search success using these data, which confirm and extends previous findings. Finally, we demonstrate that our model can predict search success more effectively than the existing state-of-the-art methods, on both our data and on a different set of log data collected from regular search engine sessions. Together, our search success models, the data collection infrastructure, and the associated behavior analysis techniques, significantly advance the study of success in web search.
2009967	ViewSer: enabling large-scale remote user studies of web search examination and interaction Web search behaviour studies, including eye-tracking studies of search result examination, have resulted in numerous insights to improve search result quality and presentation. Yet, eye tracking studies have been restricted in scale, due to the expense and the effort required. Furthermore, as the reach of the Web expands, it becomes increasingly important to understand how searchers around the world see and interact with the search results. To address both challenges, we introduce ViewSer, a novel methodology for performing web search examination studies remotely, at scale, and without requiring eye-tracking equipment. ViewSer operates by automatically modifying the appearance of a search engine result page, to clearly show one search result at a time as if through a "viewport", while partially blurring the rest and allowing the participant to move the viewport naturally with a computer mouse or trackpad. Remarkably, the resulting result viewing and clickthrough patterns agree closely with unrestricted viewing of results, as measured by eye-tracking equipment, validated by a study with over 100 participants. We also explore applications of ViewSer to practical search tasks, such as analyzing the search result summary (snip- pet) attractiveness, result re-ranking, and evaluating snippet quality. These experiments could have only be done previously by tracking the eye movements for a small number of subjects in the lab. In contrast, our study was performed with over 100 participants, allowing us to reproduce and extend previous findings, establishing ViewSer as a valuable tool for large-scale search behavior experiments.
2009974	Predicting web searcher satisfaction with existing community-based answers Community-based Question Answering (CQA) sites, such as Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Knows, Naver, and Quora, have been rapidly growing in popularity. The resulting archives of posted answers to questions, in Yahoo! Answers alone, already exceed in size 1 billion, and are aggressively indexed by web search engines. In fact, a large number of search engine users benefit from these archives, by finding existing answers that address their own queries. This scenario poses new challenges and opportunities for both search engines and CQA sites. To this end, we formulate a new problem of predicting the satisfaction of web searchers with CQA answers. We analyze a large number of web searches that result in a visit to a popular CQA site, and identify unique characteristics of searcher satisfaction in this setting, namely, the effects of query clarity, query-to-question match, and answer quality. We then propose and evaluate several approaches to predicting searcher satisfaction that exploit these characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict and validate the usefulness of CQA archives for external searchers, rather than for the original askers. Our results suggest promising directions for improving and exploiting community question answering services in pursuit of satisfying even more Web search queries.
2009984	Estimation methods for ranking recent information Temporal aspects of documents can impact relevance for certain kinds of queries. In this paper, we build on earlier work of modeling temporal information. We propose an extension to the Query Likelihood Model that incorporates query-specific information to estimate rate parameters, and we introduce a temporal factor into language model smoothing and query expansion using pseudo-relevance feedback. We evaluate these extensions using a Twitter corpus and two newspaper article collections. Results suggest that, compared to prior approaches, our models are more effective at capturing the temporal variability of relevance associated with some topics.
2009988	Efficient manifold ranking for image retrieval Manifold Ranking (MR), a graph-based ranking algorithm, has been widely applied in information retrieval and shown to have excellent performance and feasibility on a variety of data types. Particularly, it has been successfully applied to content-based image retrieval, because of its outstanding ability to discover underlying geometrical structure of the given image database. However, manifold ranking is computationally very expensive, both in graph construction and ranking computation stages, which significantly limits its applicability to very large data sets. In this paper, we extend the original manifold ranking algorithm and propose a new framework named Efficient Manifold Ranking (EMR). We aim to address the shortcomings of MR from two perspectives: scalable graph construction and efficient computation. Specifically, we build an anchor graph on the data set instead of the traditional k-nearest neighbor graph, and design a new form of adjacency matrix utilized to speed up the ranking computation. The experimental results on a real world image database demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. With a comparable performance to the original manifold ranking, our method significantly reduces the computational time, makes it a promising method to large scale real world retrieval problems.
2009992	Inverted indexes for phrases and strings Inverted indexes are the most fundamental and widely used data structures in information retrieval. For each unique word occurring in a document collection, the inverted index stores a list of the documents in which this word occurs. Compression techniques are often applied to further reduce the space requirement of these lists. However, the index has a shortcoming, in that only predefined pattern queries can be supported efficiently. In terms of string documents where word boundaries are undefined, if we have to index all the substrings of a given document, then the storage quickly becomes quadratic in the data size. Also, if we want to apply the same type of indexes for querying phrases or sequence of words, then the inverted index will end up storing redundant information. In this paper, we show the first set of inverted indexes which work naturally for strings as well as phrase searching. The central idea is to exclude document d in the inverted list of a string P if every occurrence of P in d is subsumed by another string of which P is a prefix. With this we show that our space utilization is close to the optimal. Techniques from succinct data structures are deployed to achieve compression while allowing fast access in terms of frequency and document id based retrieval. Compression and speed trade-offs are evaluated for different variants of the proposed index. For phrase searching, we show that our indexes compare favorably against a typical inverted index deploying position-wise intersections. We also show efficient top- k based retrieval under relevance metrics like frequency and tf-idf .
2009997	Intent-aware search result diversification Search result diversification has gained momentum as a way to tackle ambiguous queries. An effective approach to this problem is to explicitly model the possible aspects underlying a query, in order to maximise the estimated relevance of the retrieved documents with respect to the different aspects. However, such aspects themselves may represent information needs with rather distinct intents (e.g., informational or navigational). Hence, a diverse ranking could benefit from applying intent-aware retrieval models when estimating the relevance of documents to different aspects. In this paper, we propose to diversify the results retrieved for a given query, by learning the appropriateness of different retrieval models for each of the aspects underlying this query. Thorough experiments within the evaluation framework provided by the diversity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks show that the proposed approach can significantly improve state-of-the-art diversification approaches.
2009998	Parameterized concept weighting in verbose queries The majority of the current information retrieval models weight the query concepts (e.g., terms or phrases) in an unsupervised manner, based solely on the collection statistics. In this paper, we go beyond the unsupervised estimation of concept weights, and propose a parameterized concept weighting model. In our model, the weight of each query concept is determined using a parameterized combination of diverse importance features. Unlike the existing supervised ranking methods, our model learns importance weights not only for the explicit query concepts, but also for the latent concepts that are associated with the query through pseudo-relevance feedback. The experimental results on both newswire and web TREC corpora show that our model consistently and significantly outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art retrieval models. In addition, our model significantly reduces the number of latent concepts used for query expansion compared to the non-parameterized pseudo-relevance feedback based models.
2010002	Fast context-aware recommendations with factorization machines The situation in which a choice is made is an important information for recommender systems. Context-aware recommenders take this information into account to make predictions. So far, the best performing method for context-aware rating prediction in terms of predictive accuracy is Multiverse Recommendation based on the Tucker tensor factorization model. However this method has two drawbacks: (1) its model complexity is exponential in the number of context variables and polynomial in the size of the factorization and (2) it only works for categorical context variables. On the other hand there is a large variety of fast but specialized recommender methods which lack the generality of context-aware methods. We propose to apply Factorization Machines (FMs) to model contextual information and to provide context-aware rating predictions. This approach results in fast context-aware recommendations because the model equation of FMs can be computed in linear time both in the number of context variables and the factorization size. For learning FMs, we develop an iterative optimization method that analytically finds the least-square solution for one parameter given the other ones. Finally, we show empirically that our approach outperforms Multiverse Recommendation in prediction quality and runtime.
2010006	ILDA: interdependent LDA model for learning latent aspects and their ratings from online product reviews Today, more and more product reviews become available on the Internet, e.g., product review forums, discussion groups, and Blogs. However, it is almost impossible for a customer to read all of the different and possibly even contradictory opinions and make an informed decision. Therefore, mining online reviews (opinion mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction. Extracting aspects and the corresponding ratings is an important challenge in opinion mining. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, e.g. 'screen' for a digital camera. It is common that reviewers use different words to describe an aspect (e.g. 'LCD', 'display', 'screen'). A rating is an intended interpretation of the user satisfaction in terms of numerical values. Reviewers usually express the rating of an aspect by a set of sentiments, e.g. 'blurry screen'. In this paper we present three probabilistic graphical models which aim to extract aspects and corresponding ratings of products from online reviews. The first two models extend standard PLSI and LDA to generate a rated aspect summary of product reviews. As our main contribution, we introduce Interdependent Latent Dirichlet Allocation (ILDA) model. This model is more natural for our task since the underlying probabilistic assumptions (interdependency between aspects and ratings) are appropriate for our problem domain. We conduct experiments on a real life dataset, Epinions.com, demonstrating the improved effectiveness of the ILDA model in terms of the likelihood of a held-out test set, and the accuracy of aspects and aspect ratings.
2010007	Clickthrough-based latent semantic models for web search This paper presents two new document ranking models for Web search based upon the methods of semantic representation and the statistical translation-based approach to information retrieval (IR). Assuming that a query is parallel to the titles of the documents clicked on for that query, large amounts of query-title pairs are constructed from clickthrough data; two latent semantic models are learned from this data. One is a bilingual topic model within the language modeling framework. It ranks documents for a query by the likelihood of the query being a semantics-based translation of the documents. The semantic representation is language independent and learned from query-title pairs, with the assumption that a query and its paired titles share the same distribution over semantic topics. The other is a discriminative projection model within the vector space modeling framework. Unlike Latent Semantic Analysis and its variants, the projection matrix in our model, which is used to map from term vectors into sematic space, is learned discriminatively such that the distance between a query and its paired title, both represented as vectors in the projected semantic space, is smaller than that between the query and the titles of other documents which have no clicks for that query. These models are evaluated on the Web search task using a real world data set. Results show that they significantly outperform their corresponding baseline models, which are state-of-the-art.
2010008	Regularized latent semantic indexing Topic modeling can boost the performance of information retrieval, but its real-world application is limited due to scalability issues. Scaling to larger document collections via parallelization is an active area of research, but most solutions require drastic steps such as vastly reducing input vocabulary. We introduce Regularized Latent Semantic Indexing (RLSI), a new method which is designed for parallelization. It is as effective as existing topic models, and scales to larger datasets without reducing input vocabulary. RLSI formalizes topic modeling as a problem of minimizing a quadratic loss function regularized by l ? and/or l ? norm. This formulation allows the learning process to be decomposed into multiple sub-optimization problems which can be optimized in parallel, for example via MapReduce. We particularly propose adopting l ? norm on topics and l ? norm on document representations, to create a model with compact and readable topics and useful for retrieval. Relevance ranking experiments on three TREC datasets show that RLSI performs better than LSI, PLSI, and LDA, and the improvements are sometimes statistically significant. Experiments on a web dataset, containing about 1.6 million documents and 7 million terms, demonstrate a similar boost in performance on a larger corpus and vocabulary than in previous studies.
2010014	Enhanced results for web search "Ten blue links" have defined web search results for the last fifteen years -- snippets of text combined with document titles and URLs. In this paper, we establish the notion of enhanced search results that extend web search results to include multimedia objects such as images and video, intent-specific key value pairs, and elements that allow the user to interact with the contents of a web page directly from the search results page. We show that users express a preference for enhanced results both explicitly, and when observed in their search behavior. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of enhanced results in helping users to assess the relevance of search results. Lastly, we show that we can efficiently generate enhanced results to cover a significant fraction of search result pages.
2010016	Evolutionary timeline summarization: a balanced optimization framework via iterative substitution Classic news summarization plays an important role with the exponential document growth on the Web. Many approaches are proposed to generate summaries but seldom simultaneously consider evolutionary characteristics of news plus to traditional summary elements. Therefore, we present a novel framework for the web mining problem named Evolutionary Timeline Summarization (ETS). Given the massive collection of time-stamped web documents related to a general news query, ETS aims to return the evolution trajectory along the timeline, consisting of individual but correlated summaries of each date, emphasizing relevance, coverage, coherence and cross-date diversity . ETS greatly facilitates fast news browsing and knowledge comprehension and hence is a necessity. We formally formulate the task as an optimization problem via iterative substitution from a set of sentences to a subset of sentences that satisfies the above requirements, balancing coherence/diversity measurement and local/global summary quality. The optimized substitution is iteratively conducted by incorporating several constraints until convergence. We develop experimental systems to evaluate on 6 instinctively different datasets which amount to 10251 documents. Performance comparisons between different system-generated timelines and manually created ones by human editors demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in terms of ROUGE metrics.
2010019	Collective entity linking in web text: a graph-based method Entity Linking (EL) is the task of linking name mentions in Web text with their referent entities in a knowledge base. Traditional EL methods usually link name mentions in a document by assuming them to be independent. However, there is often additional interdependence between different EL decisions, i.e., the entities in the same document should be semantically related to each other. In these cases, Collective Entity Linking, in which the name mentions in the same document are linked jointly by exploiting the interdependence between them, can improve the entity linking accuracy. This paper proposes a graph-based collective EL method, which can model and exploit the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based representation, called Referent Graph, which can model the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Then we propose a collective inference algorithm, which can jointly infer the referent entities of all name mentions by exploiting the interdependence captured in Referent Graph. The key benefit of our method comes from: 1) The global interdependence model of EL decisions; 2) The purely collective nature of the inference algorithm, in which evidence for related EL decisions can be reinforced into high-probability decisions. Experimental results show that our method can achieve significant performance improvement over the traditional EL methods.
2010023	Query suggestions in the absence of query logs After an end-user has partially input a query, intelligent search engines can suggest possible completions of the partial query to help end-users quickly express their information needs. All major web-search engines and most proposed methods that suggest queries rely on search engine query logs to determine possible query suggestions. However, for customized search systems in the enterprise domain, intranet search, or personalized search such as email or desktop search or for infrequent queries, query logs are either not available or the user base and the number of past user queries is too small to learn appropriate models. We propose a probabilistic mechanism for generating query suggestions from the corpus without using query logs. We utilize the document corpus to extract a set of candidate phrases. As soon as a user starts typing a query, phrases that are highly correlated with the partial user query are selected as completions of the partial query and are offered as query suggestions. Our proposed approach is tested on a variety of datasets and is compared with state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in suggesting queries with higher quality.
2010025	Post-ranking query suggestion by diversifying search results Query suggestion refers to the process of suggesting related queries to search engine users. Most existing researches have focused on improving the relevance of suggested queries. In this paper, we introduce the concept of diversifying the content of the search results from suggested queries while keeping the suggestion relevant. Our framework first retrieves a set of query candidates from search engine logs using random walk and other techniques. We then re-rank the suggested queries by ranking them in the order which maximizes the diversification function that measures the difference between the original search results and the results from suggested queries. The diversification function we proposed includes features like ODP category, URL and domain similarity and so on. One important outcome from our research which contradicts with most existing researches is that, with the increase of suggestion relevance, the similarity between the queries actually decreases. Experiments are conducted on a large set of human-labeled data, which is randomly sampled from a commercial search engine's log. Results indicate that the post-ranking framework significantly improves the relevance of suggested queries by comparing to existing models.
2010028	Improved video categorization from text metadata and user comments We consider the task of assigning categories (e.g., howto/cooking, sports/basketball, pet/dogs) to YouTube videos from video and text signals. We show that two complementary views on the data -- from the video and text perspectives -- complement each other and refine predictions. The contributions of the paper are threefold: (1) we show that a text-based classifier trained on imperfect predictions of the weakly supervised video content-based classifier is not redundant; (2) we demonstrate that a simple model which combines the predictions made by the two classifiers outperforms each of them taken independently; (3) we analyse such sources of text information as video title, description, user tags and viewers' comments and show that each of them provides valuable clues to the topic of the video.
2010029	Multifaceted toponym recognition for streaming news News sources on the Web generate constant streams of information, describing many aspects of the events that shape our world. In particular, geography plays a key role in the news, and enabling geographic retrieval of news articles involves recognizing the textual references to geographic locations (called toponyms) present in the articles, which can be difficult due to ambiguity in natural language. Toponym recognition in news is often accomplished with algorithms designed and tested around small corpora of news articles, but these static collections do not reflect the streaming nature of online news, as evidenced by poor performance in tests. In contrast, a method for toponym recognition is presented that is tuned for streaming news by leveraging a wide variety of recognition components, both rule-based and statistical. An evaluation of this method shows that it outperforms two prominent toponym recognition systems when tested on large datasets of streaming news, indicating its suitability for this domain.
2010034	Identifying points of interest by self-tuning clustering Deducing trip related information from web-scale datasets has received very large amounts of attention recently. Identifying points of interest (POIs) in geo-tagged photos is one of these problems. The problem can be viewed as a standard clustering problem of partitioning two dimensional objects. In this work, we study spectral clustering which is the first attempt for the POIs identification. However, there is no unified approach to assign the clustering parameters; especially the features of POIs are immensely varying in different metropolitans and locations. To address this, we are intent to study a self-tuning technique which can properly assign the parameters for the clustering needed. Besides geographical information, web photos inherently store rich information. These information are mutually influenced each others and should be taken into trip related mining tasks. To address this, we study reinforcement which constructs the relationship over multiple sources by iterative learning. At last, we thoroughly demonstrate our findings by web scale datasets collected from Flickr.
2010037	System effectiveness, user models, and user utility: a conceptual framework for investigation There is great interest in producing effectiveness measures that model user behavior in order to better model the utility of a system to its users. These measures are often formulated as a sum over the product of a discount function of ranks and a gain function mapping relevance assessments to numeric utility values. We develop a conceptual framework for analyzing such effectiveness measures based on classifying members of this broad family of measures into four distinct families, each of which reflects a different notion of system utility. Within this framework we can hypothesize about the properties that such a measure should have and test those hypotheses against user and system data. Along the way we present a collection of novel results about specific measures and relationships between them.
2010039	Repeatable and reliable search system evaluation using crowdsourcing The primary problem confronting any new kind of search task is how to boot-strap a reliable and repeatable evaluation campaign, and a crowd-sourcing approach provides many advantages. However, can these crowd-sourced evaluations be repeated over long periods of time in a reliable manner? To demonstrate, we investigate creating an evaluation campaign for the semantic search task of keyword-based ad-hoc object retrieval. In contrast to traditional search over web-pages, object search aims at the retrieval of information from factual assertions about real-world objects rather than searching over web-pages with textual descriptions. Using the first large-scale evaluation campaign that specifically targets the task of ad-hoc Web object retrieval over a number of deployed systems, we demonstrate that crowd-sourced evaluation campaigns can be repeated over time and still maintain reliable results. Furthermore, we show how these results are comparable to expert judges when ranking systems and that the results hold over different evaluation and relevance metrics. This work provides empirical support for scalable, reliable, and repeatable search system evaluation using crowdsourcing.
2010045	Posting list intersection on multicore architectures In current commercial Web search engines, queries are processed in the conjunctive mode, which requires the search engine to compute the intersection of a number of posting lists to determine the documents matching all query terms. In practice, the intersection operation takes a significant fraction of the query processing time, for some queries dominating the total query latency. Hence, efficient posting list intersection is critical for achieving short query latencies. In this work, we focus on improving the performance of posting list intersection by leveraging the compute capabilities of recent multicore systems. To this end, we consider various coarse-grained and fine-grained parallelization models for list intersection. Specifically, we present an algorithm that partitions the work associated with a given query into a number of small and independent tasks that are subsequently processed in parallel. Through a detailed empirical analysis of these alternative models, we demonstrate that exploiting parallelism at the finest-level of granularity is critical to achieve the best performance on multicore systems. On an eight-core system, the fine-grained parallelization method is able to achieve more than five times reduction in average query processing time while still exploiting the parallelism for high query throughput.
2010048	Faster top-k document retrieval using block-max indexes Large search engines process thousands of queries per second over billions of documents, making query processing a major performance bottleneck. An important class of optimization techniques called early termination achieves faster query processing by avoiding the scoring of documents that are unlikely to be in the top results. We study new algorithms for early termination that outperform previous methods. In particular, we focus on safe techniques for disjunctive queries, which return the same result as an exhaustive evaluation over the disjunction of the query terms. The current state-of-the-art methods for this case, the WAND algorithm by Broder et al. [11] and the approach of Strohman and Croft [30], achieve great benefits but still leave a large performance gap between disjunctive and (even non-early terminated) conjunctive queries. We propose a new set of algorithms by introducing a simple augmented inverted index structure called a block-max index. Essentially, this is a structure that stores the maximum impact score for each block of a compressed inverted list in uncompressed form, thus enabling us to skip large parts of the lists. We show how to integrate this structure into the WAND approach, leading to considerable performance gains. We then describe extensions to a layered index organization, and to indexes with reassigned document IDs, that achieve additional gains that narrow the gap between disjunctive and conjunctive top-k query processing.
2010050	Utilizing marginal net utility for recommendation in e-commerce Traditional recommendation algorithms often select products with the highest predicted ratings to recommend. However, earlier research in economics and marketing indicates that a consumer usually makes purchase decision(s) based on the product's marginal net utility (i.e., the marginal utility minus the product price). Utility is defined as the satisfaction or pleasure user u gets when purchasing the corresponding product. A rational consumer chooses the product to purchase in order to maximize the total net utility. In contrast to the predicted rating, the marginal utility of a product depends on the user's purchase history and changes over time. According to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, many products have the decreasing marginal utility with the increase of purchase count, such as cell phones, computers, and so on. Users are not likely to purchase the same or similar product again in a short time if they already purchased it before. On the other hand, some products, such as pet food, baby diapers, would be purchased again and again. To better match users' purchase decisions in the real world, this paper explores how to recommend products with the highest marginal net utility in e-commerce sites. Inspired by the Cobb-Douglas utility function in consumer behavior theory, we propose a novel utility-based recommendation framework. The framework can be utilized to revamp a family of existing recommendation algorithms. To demonstrate the idea, we use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an example and revamp it with the framework. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on an e-commerce (shop.com) data set. The new algorithm significantly improves the base algorithm, largely due to its ability to recommend both products that are new to the user and products that the user is likely to re-purchase.
2010053	Associative tag recommendation exploiting multiple textual features This work addresses the task of recommending relevant tags to a target object by jointly exploiting three dimensions of the problem: (i) term co-occurrence with tags pre-assigned to the target object, (ii) terms extracted from multiple textual features, and (iii) several metrics of tag relevance. In particular, we propose several new heuristic methods, which extend state-of-the-art strategies by including new metrics that try to capture how accurately a candidate term describes the object's content. We also exploit two learning-to-rank (L2R) techniques, namely RankSVM and Genetic Programming, for the task of generating ranking functions that combine multiple metrics to accurately estimate the relevance of a tag to a given object. We evaluate all proposed methods in various scenarios for three popular Web 2.0 applications, namely, LastFM, YouTube and YahooVideo. We found that our new heuristics greatly outperform the methods on which they are based, producing gains in precision of up to 181%, as well as another state-of-the-art technique, with improvements in precision of up to 40% over the best baseline in any scenario. Further improvements can also be achieved with the new L2R strategies, which have the additional advantage of being quite flexible and extensible to exploit other aspects of the tag recommendation problem.
2010055	Evaluating diversified search results using per-intent graded relevance Search queries are often ambiguous and/or underspecified. To accomodate different user needs, search result diversification has received attention in the past few years. Accordingly, several new metrics for evaluating diversification have been proposed, but their properties are little understood. We compare the properties of existing metrics given the premises that (1) queries may have multiple intents; (2) the likelihood of each intent given a query is available; and (3) graded relevance assessments are available for each intent. We compare a wide range of traditional and diversified IR metrics after adding graded relevance assessments to the TREC 2009 Web track diversity task test collection which originally had binary relevance assessments. Our primary criterion is discriminative power, which represents the reliability of a metric in an experiment. Our results show that diversified IR experiments with a given number of topics can be as reliable as traditional IR experiments with the same number of topics, provided that the right metrics are used. Moreover, we compare the intuitiveness of diversified IR metrics by closely examining the actual ranked lists from TREC. We show that a family of metrics called D#-measures have several advantages over other metrics such as ?-nDCG and Intent-Aware metrics.
2010056	Evaluating multi-query sessions The standard system-based evaluation paradigm has focused on assessing the performance of retrieval systems in serving the best results for a single query. Real users, however, often begin an interaction with a search engine with a sufficiently under-specified query that they will need to reformulate before they find what they are looking for. In this work we consider the problem of evaluating retrieval systems over test collections of multi-query sessions. We propose two families of measures: a model-free family that makes no assumption about the user's behavior over a session, and a model-based family with a simple model of user interactions over the session. In both cases we generalize traditional evaluation metrics such as average precision to multi-query session evaluation. We demonstrate the behavior of the proposed metrics by using the new TREC 2010 Session track collection and simulations over the TREC-9 Query track collection.
2010057	Quantifying test collection quality based on the consistency of relevance judgements Relevance assessments are a key component for test collection-based evaluation of information retrieval systems. This paper reports on a feature of such collections that is used as a form of ground truth data to allow analysis of human assessment error. A wide range of test collections are retrospectively examined to determine how accurately assessors judge the relevance of documents. Our results demonstrate a high level of inconsistency across the collections studied. The level of irregularity is shown to vary across topics, with some showing a very high level of assessment error. We investigate possible influences on the error, and demonstrate that inconsistency in judging increases with time. While the level of detail in a topic specification does not appear to influence the errors that assessors make, judgements are significantly affected by the decisions made on previously seen similar documents. Assessors also display an assessment inertia. Alternate approaches to generating relevance judgements appear to reduce errors. A further investigation of the way that retrieval systems are ranked using sets of relevance judgements produced early and late in the judgement process reveals a consistent influence measured across the majority of examined test collections. We conclude that there is a clear value in examining, even inserting, ground truth data in test collections, and propose ways to help minimise the sources of inconsistency when creating future test collections.
2010063	Improved query performance prediction using standard deviation Query performance prediction (QPP) is an important task in information retrieval (IR). In this paper, we (1) develop a new predictor based on the standard deviation of scores in a variable length ranked list, and (2) we show that this new predictor outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without the need for tuning.
2010070	When documents are very long, BM25 fails! We reveal that the Okapi BM25 retrieval function tends to overly penalize very long documents. To address this problem, we present a simple yet effective extension of BM25, namely BM25L, which "shifts" the term frequency normalization formula to boost scores of very long documents. Our experiments show that BM25L, with the same computation cost, is more effective and robust than the standard BM25.
2010104	Detecting seasonal queries by time-series analysis Seasonal events such as Halloween and Christmas repeat every year and initiate several temporal information needs. The impact of such events on users is often reflected in search logs in form of seasonal spikes in the frequency of related queries (e.g. "halloween costumes", "where is santa"). Many seasonal queries such as "sigir conference" mainly target fresh pages (e.g. sigir2011.org) that have less usage data such as clicks and anchor-text compared to older alternatives (e.g.sigir2009.org). Thus, it is important for search engines to correctly identify seasonal queries and make sure that their results are temporally reordered if necessary. In this poster, we focus on detecting seasonal queries using time-series analysis. We demonstrate that the seasonality of a query can be determined with high accuracy according to its historical frequency distribution.

In an effort to provide better retrieval performance on large collections, more sophisticated retrieval techniques have been developed that support rich, structured queries. Structured queries are not amenable to previously proposed optimization techniques. Optimizing execution, however, is even more important in the context of large document collections. We present a new structured query optimization technique which we have implemented in an inference network-based information retrieval system. Experimental results show that query evaluation time can be reduced by more than half with little impact on retrieval effectiveness.

253189	S-tree: a dynamic balanced signature index for office retrieval The signature approach is an access method for partial-match retrieval which meets many requirements of an office environment. Signatures are hash coded binary words derived from objects stored in the data base. They serve as a filter for retrieval in order to discard a large number of nonqualifying objects. In an indexed signature method the signatures of objects stored on a single page are used to form a signature for that page. In this paper we describe a new technique of indexed signatures which combines the dynamic balancing of B-trees with the signature approach. The main problem of appropriate splitting is solved in a heuristic way. Operations are described and a simple performance analysis is given. The analysis and some experimental results indicate a considerable performance gain. Moreover, the new S-tree approach supports a clustering on a signature basis. Further remarks on adaptability complete this work.
253190	Improved hierarchical bit-vector compression in document retrieval systems The âconcordanceâ of an information retrieval system can often be stored in form of bit-maps, which are usually very sparse and should be compressed. Hierarchical bit-vector compression consists of partitioning a vector v i into equi-sized blocks, constructing a new bit-vector v i +1 which points to the non-zero blocks in v i , dropping the zero-blocks of v i , and repeating the process for v i +1. We refine the method by pruning some of the tree branches if they ultimately point to very few documents; these document numbers are then added to an appended list which is compressed by the prefix-omission technique. The new method was thoroughly tested on the bit-maps of the Responsa Retrieval Project, and gave a relative improvement of about 40% over the conventional hierarchical compression method.
253193	Incorporating syntactic information into a document retrieval strategy: an investigation This paper deals with mechanisms for performing text retrieval which incorporate a degree of linguistic processing into the overall strategy. We have performed some experiments using parsing of text an a test collection of documents and queries to try and find out exactly if and how parsing could contribute to an overall improvement in retrieval effectiveness. Investigating this topic has led us to the definition of a retrieval strategy which incorporates parsing of query text and a more âshallowâ parsing of document texts, whose retrieval effectiveness is investigated and described. Our results indicate that significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness can be obtained by incorporating such linguistic processing into an overall retrieval strategy.
253200	Hierarchic document classification using Ward's clustering method In this paper, we discuss the application of a recent hierarchic clustering algorithm to the automatic classification of files of documents. Whereas most hierarchic clustering algorithms involve the generation and updating of an inter-object dissimilarity matrix, this new algorithm is based upon a series of nearest neighbor searches. Such an approach is appropriate to several clustering methods, including Ward's method which has been shown to perform well in experimental studies of hierarchic document clustering. A description is given of heuristics which can increase the efficiency of the new algorithm when it is used to cluster three document collections by Ward's method.
253202	User-oriented document clustering: a framework for learning in information retrieval In information retrieval, cluster analysis is an important tool employed to enhance both efficiency and effectiveness of the retrieval process. Most clustering algorithms have difficulty in reflecting the closeness of documents as perceived by the user. A two phase scheme for document clustering, whose results reflect the âconceptualâ clusters that are perceived by the user of the retrieval system, is proposed. Since the clusters obtained by this scheme are not characterized in terms of the document representations, a strategy for cluster searching is also developed. Both the proposed document clustering scheme and document searching strategy are experimentally evaluated using a test collection from the SMART system. The preliminary experimental results obtained are very encouraging.
253206	An experimental study of factors important in document ranking The ability to effectively rank retrieved documents in order of their probable relevance to a query is a critical factor in statistically-based keyword retrieval systems. This paper summarizes a set of experiments with different methods of term weighting for documents, using measures of term importance within an entire document collection, term importance within a given document, and document length. It is shown that significant improvements over no term weighting can be made using a combination of weighting measures and normalizing for document length.
253208	(invited paper) A new theoretical framework for information retrieval A new framework based on a non-classical logic is proposed for investigating IR. The paper motivates the use of a particular conditional logic as the 'right' logic for IR. A new principle, the logical uncertainty principle, is proposed, to deal with the inherent uncertainty associated with applicable inferences.
253211	User-specified domain knowledge for document retrieval The introduction of domain knowledge into a document retrieval system has two important consequences; an increase in the effectiveness of retrieval and a decrease in the efficiency of text processing. In this paper, a method is presented of combining user-specified domain knowledge with efficient retrieval techniques based on probabilistic models. The domain knowledge is represented as a collection of frames that contain rules specifying recognition conditions for domain concepts and relationships between concepts. The inference network represented in these frames is used to infer the concepts that are related to a user's query. This approach is being implemented as part of the I 3 R expert intermediary system.
253506	Generalized vector spaces model in information retrieval In information retrieval, it is common to model index terms and documents as vectors in a suitably defined vector space. The main difficulty with this approach is that the explicit representation of term vectors is not known a priori. For this reason, the vector space model adopted by Salton for the SMART system treats the terms as a set of orthogonal vectors. In such a model it is often necessary to adopt a separate, corrective procedure to take into account the correlations between terms. In this paper, we propose a systematic method (the generalized vector space model) to compute term correlations directly from automatic indexing scheme. We also demonstrate how such correlations can be included with minimal modification in the existing vector based information retrieval systems. The preliminary experimental results obtained from the new model are very encouraging.
253515	Optimization of inverted vector searches A simple algorithm is presented for increasing the efficiency of information retrieval searches which are implemented using inverted files. This optimization algorithm employs knowledge about the methods used for weighting document and query terms in order to examine as few inverted lists as possible. An extension to the basic algorithm allows greatly increased performance optimization at a modest cost in retrieval effectiveness. Experimental runs are made examining several different term weighting models and showing the optimization possible with each.
253524	The cluster hypothesis revisited A new means of evaluating the cluster hypothesis is introduced and the results of such an evaluation are presented for four collections. The results of retrieval experiments comparing a sequential search, a cluster-based search, and a search of the clustered collection in which individual documents are scored against the query are also presented. These results indicate that while the absolute performance of a search on a particular collection is dependent on the pairwise similarity of the relevant documents, the relative effectiveness of clustered retrieval versus sequential retrieval is independent of this factor. However, retrieval of entire clusters in response to a query usually results in a poorer performance than retrieval of individual documents from clusters.

253527	The LIVE-project: retrieval experiments based on evaluation viewpoints Besides the operators 'and', 'or' and 'not' the GRIPS retrieval language contains thesaurus â operators to extend the query and truncation â and context-operators for freetext and Boolean searching. In a similar way several other viewpoints and evaluation measures were defined and applied in the retrieval experiment. Under the assumption that the evaluation measure is an interval scale averaging is done by calculating the arithmetic mean. As levels of the experimental factor /8/ the following similarity measures were used: inner product measure, cosine measure, overlap measure, coefficient of Jaccard and Euclidean distance. As situative factors /8/ the number of documents retrieved by GRIPS, the number of descriptiors of the queries, generality and topic of documents were used. The retrieval experiment is not yet finished completely but several results have already been obtained. For example in the average (over 81 queries) for the above defined viewpoint the ranking with the inner product measure does not indicate a significant improvement compared with the GRIPS-output. In the case of the Euclidean distance measure it seems that in the average the user has to inspect less nonrelevant documents. This means an improvement compared with the unordered retrieved set from the GRIPS-output. For more details of the so called 'two-level retrieval process' and further experimental results we refer to the long version of this paper.

258561	Passage retrieval revisited Ranking based on passages addresses some of the shortcomings of whole-document ranking. It provides convenient units of text to return to the user, avoids the difficulties of comparing documents of different length, and enables identification of short blocks of relevant material amongst otherwise irrelevant text. In this paper we explore the potential of passage retrieval, based on an experimental evaluation of the ability of passages to identify relevant documents. We compare our scheme of arbitrary passage retrieval to several other document retrieval and passage retrieval methods; we show experimentally that, compared to these methods, ranking via fixed-length passages is robust and effective. Our experiments also show that, compared to whole-document ranking, ranking via fixed-length arbitrary passages significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, by 8% for TREC disks 2 and 4 and by 18%-37% for the Federal Register collection.

1009024	Dependence language model for information retrieval This paper presents a new dependence language modeling approach to information retrieval. The approach extends the basic language modeling approach based on unigram by relaxing the independence assumption. We integrate the linkage of a query as a hidden variable, which expresses the term dependencies within the query as an acyclic, planar, undirected graph. We then assume that a query is generated from a document in two stages: the linkage is generated first, and then each term is generated in turn depending on other related terms according to the linkage. We also present a smoothing method for model parameter estimation and an approach to learning the linkage of a sentence in an unsupervised manner. The new approach is compared to the classical probabilistic retrieval model and the previously proposed language models with and without taking into account term dependencies. Results show that our model achieves substantial and significant improvements on TREC collections.
1009025	Parsimonious language models for information retrieval We systematically investigate a new approach to estimating the parameters of language models for information retrieval, called parsimonious language models. Parsimonious language models explicitly address the relation between levels of language models that are typically used for smoothing. As such, they need fewer (non-zero) parameters to describe the data. We apply parsimonious models at three stages of the retrieval process: 1) at indexing time; 2) at search time; 3) at feedback time. Experimental results show that we are able to build models that are significantly smaller than standard models, but that still perform at least as well as the standard approaches.
1009026	Cluster-based retrieval using language models Previous research on cluster-based retrieval has been inconclusive as to whether it does bring improved retrieval effectiveness over document-based retrieval. Recent developments in the language modeling approach to IR have motivated us to re-examine this problem within this new retrieval framework. We propose two new models for cluster-based retrieval and evaluate them on several TREC collections. We show that cluster-based retrieval can perform consistently across collections of realistic size, and significant improvements over document-based retrieval can be obtained in a fully automatic manner and without relevance information provided by human.
1009027	Corpus structure, language models, and ad hoc information retrieval Most previous work on the recently developed language-modeling approach to information retrieval focuses on document-specific characteristics, and therefore does not take into account the structure of the surrounding corpus. We propose a novel algorithmic framework in which information provided by document-based language models is enhanced by the incorporation of information drawn from clusters of similar documents. Using this framework, we develop a suite of new algorithms. Even the simplest typically outperforms the standard language-modeling approach in precision and recall, and our new interpolation algorithm posts statistically significant improvements for both metrics over all three corpora tested.
1009029	Document clustering by concept factorization In this paper, we propose a new data clustering method called concept factorization that models each concept as a linear combination of the data points, and each data point as a linear combination of the concepts. With this model, the data clustering task is accomplished by computing the two sets of linear coefficients, and this linear coefficients computation is carried out by finding the non-negative solution that minimizes the reconstruction error of the data points. The cluster label of each data point can be easily derived from the obtained linear coefficients. This method differs from the method of clustering based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) citeXu03 in that it can be applied to data containing negative values and the method can be implemented in the kernel space. Our experimental results show that the proposed data clustering method and its variations performs best among 11 algorithms and their variations that we have evaluated on both TDT2 and Reuters-21578 corpus. In addition to its good performance, the new method also has the merit in its easy and reliable derivation of the clustering results.
1009030	Learning to cluster web search results Organizing Web search results into clusters facilitates users' quick browsing through search results. Traditional clustering techniques are inadequate since they don't generate clusters with highly readable names. In this paper, we reformalize the clustering problem as a salient phrase ranking problem. Given a query and the ranked list of documents (typically a list of titles and snippets) returned by a certain Web search engine, our method first extracts and ranks salient phrases as candidate cluster names, based on a regression model learned from human labeled training data. The documents are assigned to relevant salient phrases to form candidate clusters, and the final clusters are generated by merging these candidate clusters. Experimental results verify our method's feasibility and effectiveness.
1009031	Document clustering via adaptive subspace iteration Document clustering has long been an important problem in information retrieval. In this paper, we present a new clustering algorithm ASI 1 , which uses explicitly modeling of the subspace structure associated with each cluster. ASI simultaneously performs data reduction and subspace identification via an iterative alternating optimization procedure. Motivated from the optimization procedure, we then provide a novel method to determine the number of clusters. We also discuss the connections of ASI with various existential clustering approaches. Finally, extensive experimental results on real data sets show the effectiveness of ASI algorithm.
1009032	Restrictive clustering and metaclustering for self-organizing document collections This paper addresses the problem of automatically structuring heterogenous document collections by using clustering methods. In contrast to traditional clustering, we study restrictive methods and ensemble-based meta methods that may decide to leave out some documents rather than assigning them to inappropriate clusters with low confidence. These techniques result in higher cluster purity, better overall accuracy, and make unsupervised self-organization more robust. Our comprehensive experimental studies on three different real-world data collections demonstrate these benefits. The proposed methods seem particularly suitable for automatically substructuring personal email folders or personal Web directories that are populated by focused crawlers, and they can be combined with supervised classification techniques.
1009034	Feature selection using linear classifier weights: interaction with classification models This paper explores feature scoring and selection based on weights from linear classification models. It investigates how these methods combine with various learning models. Our comparative analysis includes three learning algorithms: NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in combination with three feature weighting methods: Odds Ratio, Information Gain, and weights from linear models, the linear SVM and Perceptron. Experiments show that feature selection using weights from linear SVMs yields better classification performance than other feature weighting methods when combined with the three explored learning algorithms. The results support the conjecture that it is the sophistication of the feature weighting method rather than its apparent compatibility with the learning algorithm that improves classification performance.
1009035	Web-page classification through summarization Web-page classification is much more difficult than pure-text classification due to a large variety of noisy information embedded in Web pages. In this paper, we propose a new Web-page classification algorithm based on Web summarization for improving the accuracy. We first give empirical evidence that ideal Web-page summaries generated by human editors can indeed improve the performance of Web-page classification algorithms. We then propose a new Web summarization-based classification algorithm and evaluate it along with several other state-of-the-art text summarization algorithms on the LookSmart Web directory. Experimental results show that our proposed summarization-based classification algorithm achieves an approximately 8.8% improvement as compared to pure-text-based classification algorithm. We further introduce an ensemble classifier using the improved summarization algorithm and show that it achieves about 12.9% improvement over pure-text based methods.
1009036	Parameterized generation of labeled datasets for text categorization based on a hierarchical directory Although text categorization is a burgeoning area of IR research, readily available test collections in this field are surprisingly scarce. We describe a methodology and system (named ACCIO) for automatically acquiring labeled datasets for text categorization from the World Wide Web, by capitalizing on the body of knowledge encoded in the structure of existing hierarchical directories such as the Open Directory. We define parameters of categories that make it possible to acquire numerous datasets with desired properties , which in turn allow better control over categorization experiments. In particular, we develop metrics that estimate the difficulty of a dataset by examining the host directory structure. These metrics are shown to be good predictors of categorization accuracy that can be achieved on a dataset, and serve as efficient heuristics for generating datasets subject to user's requirements. A large collection of automatically generated datasets are made available for other researchers to use.
1009038	Information retrieval using word senses: root sense tagging approach Information retrieval using word senses is emerging as a good research challenge on semantic information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new method using word senses in information retrieval: root sense tagging method. This method assigns coarse-grained word senses defined in WordNet to query terms and document terms by unsupervised way using co-occurrence information constructed automatically. Our sense tagger is crude, but performs consistent disambiguation by considering only the single most informative word as evidence to disambiguate the target word. We also allow multiple-sense assignment to alleviate the problem caused by incorrect disambiguation.Experimental results on a large-scale TREC collection show that our approach to improve retrieval effectiveness is successful, while most of the previous work failed to improve performances even on small text collection. Our method also shows promising results when is combined with pseudo relevance feedback and state-of-the-art retrieval function such as BM25.
1009039	An effective approach to document retrieval via utilizing WordNet and recognizing phrases Noun phrases in queries are identified and classified into four types: proper names, dictionary phrases, simple phrases and complex phrases. A document has a phrase if all content words in the phrase are within a window of a certain size. The window sizes for different types of phrases are different and are determined using a decision tree. Phrases are more important than individual terms. Consequently, documents in response to a query are ranked with matching phrases given a higher priority. We utilize WordNet to disambiguate word senses of query terms. Whenever the sense of a query term is determined, its synonyms, hyponyms, words from its definition and its compound words are considered for possible additions to the query. Experimental results show that our approach yields between 23% and 31% improvements over the best-known results on the TREC 9, 10 and 12 collections for short (title only) queries, without using Web data.
1009040	Web-a-where: geotagging web content We describe Web-a-Where, a system for associating geography with Web pages. Web-a-Where locates mentions of places and determines the place each name refers to. In addition, it assigns to each page a geographic focus --- a locality that the page discusses as a whole. The tagging process is simple and fast, aimed to be applied to large collections of Web pages and to facilitate a variety of location-based applications and data analyses.Geotagging involves arbitrating two types of ambiguities: geo/non-geo and geo/geo. A geo/non-geo ambiguity occurs when a place name also has a non-geographic meaning, such as a person name (e.g., Berlin) or a common word (Turkey). Geo/geo ambiguity arises when distinct places have the same name, as in London, England vs. London, Ontario.An implementation of the tagger within the framework of the WebFountain data mining system is described, and evaluated on several corpora of real Web pages. Precision of up to 82% on individual geotags is achieved. We also evaluate the relative contribution of various heuristics the tagger employs, and evaluate the focus-finding algorithm using a corpus pretagged with localities, showing that as many as 91% of the foci reported are correct up to the country level.
1009042	Focused named entity recognition using machine learning In this paper we study the problem of finding most topical named entities among all entities in a document, which we refer to as focused named entity recognition. We show that these focused named entities are useful for many natural language processing applications, such as document summarization, search result ranking, and entity detection and tracking. We propose a statistical model for focused named entity recognition by converting it into a classification problem. We then study the impact of various linguistic features and compare a number of classification algorithms. From experiments on an annotated Chinese news corpus, we demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve near human-level accuracy.
1009044	Text classification and named entities for new event detection New Event Detection is a challenging task that still offers scope for great improvement after years of effort. In this paper we show how performance on New Event Detection (NED) can be improved by the use of text classification techniques as well as by using named entities in a new way. We explore modifications to the document representation in a vector space-based NED system. We also show that addressing named entities preferentially is useful only in certain situations. A combination of all the above results in a multi-stage NED system that performs much better than baseline single-stage NED systems.
1009046	Assigning identifiers to documents to enhance the clustering property of fulltext indexes Web Search Engines provide a large-scale text document retrieval service by processing huge Inverted File indexes. Inverted File indexes allow fast query resolution and good memory utilization since their d -gaps representation can be effectively and efficiently compressed by using variable length encoding methods. This paper proposes and evaluates some algorithms aimed to find an assignment of the document identifiers which minimizes the average values of d -gaps, thus enhancing the effectiveness of traditional compression methods. We ran several tests over the Google contest collection in order to validate the techniques proposed. The experiments demonstrated the scalability and effectiveness of our algorithms. Using the proposed algorithms, we were able to sensibly improve (up to 20.81%) the compression ratios of several encoding schemes.
1009047	Filtering algorithms for information retrieval models with named attributes and proximity operators In the selective dissemination of information (or publish/subscribe) paradigm, clients subscribe to a server with continuous queries (or profiles) that express their information needs. Clients can also publish documents to servers. Whenever a document is published, the continuous queries satisfying this document are found and notifications are sent to appropriate clients. This paper deals with the filtering problem that needs to be solved effciently by each server: Given a database of continuous queries db and a document d , find all queries q ? db that match d . We present data structures and indexing algorithms that enable us to solve the filtering problem efficiently for large databases of queries expressed in the model AWP which is based on named attributes with values of type text, and word proximity operators.
1009048	Hourly analysis of a very large topically categorized web query log We review a query log of hundreds of millions of queries that constitute the total query traffic for an entire week of a general-purpose commercial web search service. Previously, query logs have been studied from a single, cumulative view. In contrast, our analysis shows changes in popularity and uniqueness of topically categorized queries across the hours of the day. We examine query traffic on an hourly basis by matching it against lists of queries that have been topically pre-categorized by human editors. This represents 13% of the query traffic. We show that query traffic from particular topical categories differs both from the query stream as a whole and from other categories. This analysis provides valuable insight for improving retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. It is also relevant to the development of enhanced query disambiguation, routing, and caching algorithms.
1009050	A collaborative filtering algorithm and evaluation metric that accurately model the user experience Collaborative Filtering (CF) systems have been researched for over a decade as a tool to deal with information overload. At the heart of these systems are the algorithms which generate the predictions and recommendations.In this article we empirically demonstrate that two of the most acclaimed CF recommendation algorithms have flaws that result in a dramatically unacceptable user experience.In response, we introduce a new Belief Distribution Algorithm that overcomes these flaws and provides substantially richer user modeling. The Belief Distribution Algorithm retains the qualities of nearest-neighbor algorithms which have performed well in the past, yet produces predictions of belief distributions across rating values rather than a point rating value.In addition, we illustrate how the exclusive use of the mean absolute error metric has concealed these flaws for so long, and we propose the use of a modified Precision metric for more accurately evaluating the user experience.
1009051	An automatic weighting scheme for collaborative filtering Collaborative filtering identifies information interest of a particular user based on the information provided by other similar users. The memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient approach) identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. In these approaches, different items are weighted either equally or by some predefined functions. The impact of rating discrepancies among different users has not been taken into consideration. For example, an item that is highly favored by most users should have a smaller impact on the user-similarity than an item for which different types of users tend to give different ratings. Even though simple weighting methods such as variance weighting try to address this problem, empirical studies have shown that they are ineffective in improving the performance of collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present an optimization algorithm to automatically compute the weights for different items based on their ratings from training users. More specifically, the new weighting scheme will create a clustered distribution for user vectors in the item space by bringing users of similar interests closer and separating users of different interests more distant. Empirical studies over two datasets have shown that our new weighting scheme substantially improves the performance of the Pearson correlation coefficient method for collaborative filtering.
1009052	Using bayesian priors to combine classifiers for adaptive filtering An adaptive information filtering system monitors a document stream to identify the documents that match information needs specified by user profiles. As the system filters, it also refines its knowledge about the user's information needs based on long-term observations of the document stream and periodic feedback(training data) from the user. Low variance profile learning algorithms, such as Rocchio, work well at the early stage of filtering when the system has very few training data. Low bias profile learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, work well at the later stage of filtering when the system has accumulated enough training data.However, an empirical system needs to works well consistently at all stages of filtering process. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a new technique to combine different text classification algorithms via a constrained maximum likelihood Bayesian prior. This technique provides a trade off between bias and variance, and the combined classifier may achieve a consistent good performance at different stages of filtering. We implemented the proposed technique to combine two complementary classification algorithms: Rocchio and logistic regression. The new algorithm is shown to compare favorably with Rocchio, Logistic Regression, and the best methods in the TREC-9 and TREC-11 adaptive filtering tracks.
1009053	A nonparametric hierarchical bayesian framework for information filtering Information filtering has made considerable progress in recent years. The predominant approaches are content-based methods and collaborative methods. Researchers have largely concentrated on either of the two approaches since a principled unifying framework is still lacking. This paper suggests that both approaches can be combined under a hierarchical Bayesian framework . Individual content-based user profiles are generated and collaboration between various user models is achieved via a common learned prior distribution. However, it turns out that a parametric distribution (e.g. Gaussian) is too restrictive to describe such a common learned prior distribution. We thus introduce a nonparametric common prior , which is a sample generated from a Dirichlet process which assumes the role of a hyper prior . We describe effective means to learn this nonparametric distribution, and apply it to learn users' information needs. The resultant algorithm is simple and understandable, and offers a principled solution to combine content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Within our framework, we are now able to interpret various existing techniques from a unifying point of view. Finally we demonstrate the empirical success of the proposed information filtering methods.
1009055	Automatic image annotation by using concept-sensitive salient objects for image content representation Multi-level annotation of images is a promising solution to enable more effective semantic image retrieval by using various keywords at different semantic levels. In this paper, we propose a multi-level approach to annotate the semantics of natural scenes by using both the dominant image components and the relevant semantic concepts. In contrast to the well-known image-based and region-based approaches, we use the salient objects as the dominant image components to achieve automatic image annotation at the content level. By using the salient objects for image content representation, a novel image classification technique is developed to achieve automatic image annotation at the concept level. To detect the salient objects automatically, a set of detection functions are learned from the labeled image regions by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with an automatic scheme for searching the optimal model parameters. To generate the semantic concepts, finite mixture models are used to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects. An adaptive EM algorithm has been proposed to determine the optimal model structure and model parameters simultaneously. We have also demonstrated that our algorithms are very effective to enable multi-level annotation of natural scenes in a large-scale dataset.
1009056	A search engine for historical manuscript images Many museum and library archives are digitizing their large collections of handwritten historical manuscripts to enable public access to them. These collections are only available in image formats and require expensive manual annotation work for access to them. Current handwriting recognizers have word error rates in excess of 50% and therefore cannot be used for such material. We describe two statistical models for retrieval in large collections of handwritten manuscripts given a text query. Both use a set of transcribed page images to learn a joint probability distribution between features computed from word images and their transcriptions. The models can then be used to retrieve unlabeled images of handwritten documents given a text query. We show experiments with a training set of 100 transcribed pages and a test set of 987 handwritten page images from the George Washington collection. Experiments show that the precision at 20 documents is about 0.4 to 0.5 depending on the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic retrieval system for historical manuscripts using text queries, without manual transcription of the original corpus.
1009057	Display time as implicit feedback: understanding task effects Recent research has had some success using the length of time a user displays a document in their web browser as implicit feedback for document preference. However, most studies have been confined to specific search domains, such as news, and have not considered the effects of task on display time, and the potential impact of this relationship on the effectiveness of display time as implicit feedback. We describe the results of an intensive naturalistic study of the online information-seeking behaviors of seven subjects during a fourteen-week period. Throughout the study, subjects' online information-seeking activities were monitored with various pieces of logging and evaluation software. Subjects were asked to identify the tasks with which they were working, classify the documents that they viewed according to these tasks, and evaluate the usefulness of the documents. Results of a user-centered analysis demonstrate no general, direct relationship between display time and usefulness, and that display times differ significantly according to specific task, and according to specific user.
1009060	Learning effective ranking functions for newsgroup search Web communities are web virtual broadcasting spaces where people can freely discuss anything. While such communities function as discussion boards, they have even greater value as large repositories of archived information. In order to unlock the value of this resource, we need an effective means for searching archived discussion threads. Unfortunately the techniques that have proven successful for searching document collections and the Web are not ideally suited to the task of searching archived community discussions. In this paper, we explore the problem of creating an effective ranking function to predict the most relevant messages to queries in community search. We extract a set of predictive features from the thread trees of newsgroup messages as well as features of message authors and lexical distribution within a message thread. Our final results indicate that when using linear regression with this feature set, our search system achieved a 28.5% performance improvement compared to our baseline system.
1009061	Language-specific models in multilingual topic tracking Topic tracking is complicated when the stories in the stream occur in multiple languages. Typically, researchers have trained only English topic models because the training stories have been provided in English. In tracking, non-English test stories are then machine translated into English to compare them with the topic models. We propose a native language hypothesis stating that comparisons would be more effective in the original language of the story. We first test and support the hypothesis for story link detection. For topic tracking the hypothesis implies that it should be preferable to build separate language-specific topic models for each language in the stream. We compare different methods of incrementally building such native language topic models.
1009064	Evaluation of an extraction-based approach to answering definitional questions This paper evaluates an extraction-based approach to answering definitional questions. Our system extracted useful linguistic constructs called linguistic features from raw text using information extraction tools and formulated answers based on such features. The features employed include appositives, copulas, structured patterns, relations, propositions and raw sentences. The features were ranked based on feature type and similarity to a question profile . Redundant features were detected using a simple heuristic-based strategy. The approach achieved state of the art performance at the TREC 2003 QA evaluation. Component analysis of the system was carried out using an automatic scoring function called Rouge (Lin and Hovy, 2003). Major findings include 1) answers using linguistic features are significantly better than those using raw sentences; 2) the most useful features are appositives and copulas; 3) question profiles, as a means of modeling user interests, can significantly improve system performance; 4) the Rouge scores are closely correlated with subjective evaluation results, indicating the suitability of using Rouge for evaluating definitional QA systems.
1009065	Query based event extraction along a timeline In this paper, we present a framework and a system that extracts events relevant to a query from a collection C of documents, and places such events along a timeline. Each event is represented by a sentence extracted from C, based on the assumption that "important" events are widely cited in many documents for a period of time within which these events are of interest. In our experiments, we used queries that are event types ("earthquake") and person names (e.g. "George Bush"). Evaluation was performed using G8 leader names as queries: comparison made by human evaluators between manually and system generated timelines showed that although manually generated timelines are on average more preferable, system generated timelines are sometimes judged to be better than manually constructed ones.
1009066	Sentence completion We discuss a retrieval model in which the task is to complete a sentence, given an initial fragment, and given an application specific document collection. This model is motivated by administrative and call center environments, in which users have to write documents with a certain repetitiveness. We formulate the problem setting and discuss appropriate performance metrics. We present an index-based retrieval algorithm and a cluster-based approach, and evaluate our algorithms using collections of emails that have been written by two distinct service centers.
1009068	Block-level link analysis Link Analysis has shown great potential in improving the performance of web search. PageRank and HITS are two of the most popular algorithms. Most of the existing link analysis algorithms treat a web page as a single node in the web graph. However, in most cases, a web page contains multiple semantics and hence the web page might not be considered as the atomic node. In this paper, the web page is partitioned into blocks using the vision-based page segmentation algorithm. By extracting the page-to-block, block-to-page relationships from link structure and page layout analysis, we can construct a semantic graph over the WWW such that each node exactly represents a single semantic topic. This graph can better describe the semantic structure of the web. Based on block-level link analysis, we proposed two new algorithms, Block Level PageRank and Block Level HITS, whose performances we study extensively using web data.
1009070	Block-based web search Multiple-topic and varying-length of web pages are two negative factors significantly affecting the performance of web search. In this paper, we explore the use of page segmentation algorithms to partition web pages into blocks and investigate how to take advantage of block-level evidence to improve retrieval performance in the web context. Because of the special characteristics of web pages, different page segmentation method will have different impact on web search performance. We compare four types of methods, including fixed-length page segmentation, DOM-based page segmentation, vision-based page segmentation, and a combined method which integrates both semantic and fixed-length properties. Experiments on block-level query expansion and retrieval are performed. Among the four approaches, the combined method achieves the best performance for web search. Our experimental results also show that such a semantic partitioning of web pages effectively deals with the problem of multiple drifting topics and mixed lengths, and thus has great potential to boost up the performance of current web search engines.
1009076	Merging retrieval results in hierarchical peer-to-peer networks An abstract is not available.
1009079	Eye-tracking analysis of user behavior in WWW search We investigate how users interact with the results page of a WWW search engine using eye-tracking. The goal is to gain insight into how users browse the presented abstracts and how they select links for further exploration. Such understanding is valuable for improved interface design, as well as for more accurate interpretations of implicit feedback (e.g. clickthrough) for machine learning. The following presents initial results, focusing on the amount of time spent viewing the presented abstracts, the total number of abstract viewed, as well as measures of how thoroughly searchers evaluate their results set.

1009110	Formal multiple-bernoulli models for language modeling An abstract is not available.
1009124	A study of methods for normalizing user ratings in collaborative filtering The goal of collaborative filtering is to make recommendations for a test user by utilizing the rating information of users who share interests similar to the test user. Because ratings are determined not only by user interests but also the rating habits of users, it is important to normalize ratings of different users to the same scale. In this paper, we compare two different normalization strategies for user ratings, namely the Gaussian normalization method and the decoupling normalization method. Particularly, we incorporated these two rating normalization methods into two collaborative filtering algorithms, and evaluated their effectiveness on the EachMovie dataset. The experiment results have shown that the decoupling method for rating normalization is more effective than the Gaussian normalization method in improving the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms.
1009127	The effect of document retrieval quality on factoid question answering performance An abstract is not available.
1009132	Why current IR engines fail Observations from a unique investigation of failure analysis of Information Retrieval (IR) research engines are presented. The Reliable Information Access (RIA) Workshop invited seven leading IR research groups to supply both their systems and their experts to an effort to analyze why their systems fail on some topics and whether the failures are due to system flaws, approach flaws, or the topic itself. There were surprising results from this cross-system failure analysis. One is that despite systems retrieving very different documents, the major cause of failure for any particular topic was almost always the same across all systems. Another is that relationships between aspects of a topic are not especially important for state-of-the-art systems; the systems are failing at a much more basic level where the top-retrieved documents are not reflecting some aspect at all.
1008996	Evaluating high accuracy retrieval techniques Although information retrieval research has always been concerned with improving the effectiveness of search, in some applications, such as information analysis, a more specific requirement exists for high accuracy retrieval. This means that achieving high precision in the top document ranks is paramount. In this paper we present work aimed at achieving high accuracy in ad-hoc document retrieval by incorporating approaches from question answering(QA). We focus on getting the first relevant result as high as possible in the ranked list and argue that traditional precision and recall are not appropriate measures for evaluatin this task. We instead use the mean reciprocal rank(MRR) of the first relevant result. We evaluate three different methods for modifying queries to achieve high accuracy. The experiments done on TREC data provide support for the approach of using MRR and incorporating QA techniques for getting high accuracy in ad-hoc retrieval task.
1008997	Scaling IR-system evaluation using term relevance sets This paper describes an evaluation method based on Term Relevance Sets Trels that measures an IR system's quality by examining the content of the retrieved results rather than by looking for pre-specified relevant pages. Trels consist of a list of terms believed to be relevant for a particular query as well as a list of irrelevant terms. The proposed method does not involve any document relevance judgments, and as such is not adversely affected by changes to the underlying collection. Therefore, it can better scale to very large, dynamic collections such as the Web. Moreover, this method can evaluate a system's effectiveness on an updatable "live" collection, or on collections derived from different data sources. Our experiments show that the proposed method is very highly correlated with official TREC measures.
1008998	Using temporal profiles of queries for precision prediction A key missing component in information retrieval systems is self-diagnostic tests to establish whether the system can provide reasonable results for a given query on a document collection. If we can measure properties of a retrieved set of documents which allow us to predict average precision, we can automate the decision of whether to elicit relevance feedback, or modify the retrieval system in other ways. We use meta-data attached to documents in the form of time stamps to measure the distribution of documents retrieved in response to a query, over the time domain, to create a temporal profile for a query. We define some useful features over this temporal profile. We find that using these temporal features, together with the content of the documents retrieved, we can improve the prediction of average precision for a query.
1009000	Retrieval evaluation with incomplete information This paper examines whether the Cranfield evaluation methodology is robust to gross violations of the completeness assumption (i.e., the assumption that all relevant documents within a test collection have been identified and are present in the collection). We show that current evaluation measures are not robust to substantially incomplete relevance judgments. A new measure is introduced that is both highly correlated with existing measures when complete judgments are available and more robust to incomplete judgment sets. This finding suggests that substantially larger or dynamic test collections built using current pooling practices should be viable laboratory tools, despite the fact that the relevance information will be incomplete and imperfect.
1009001	Forming test collections with no system pooling Forming test collection relevance judgments from the pooled output of multiple retrieval systems has become the standard process for creating resources such as the TREC, CLEF, and NTCIR test collections. This paper presents a series of experiments examining three different ways of building test collections where no system pooling is used. First, a collection formation technique combining manual feedback and multiple systems is adapted to work with a single retrieval system. Second, an existing method based on pooling the output of multiple manual searches is re-examined: testing a wider range of searchers and retrieval systems than has been examined before. Third, a new approach is explored where the ranked output of a single automatic search on a single retrieval system is assessed for relevance: no pooling whatsoever. Using established techniques for evaluating the quality of relevance judgments, in all three cases, test collections are formed that are as good as TREC.
1009002	Building an information retrieval test collection for spontaneous conversational speech Test collections model use cases in ways that facilitate evaluation of information retrieval systems. This paper describes the use of search-guided relevance assessment to create a test collection for retrieval of spontaneous conversational speech. Approximately 10,000 thematically coherent segments were manually identified in 625 hours of oral history interviews with 246 individuals. Automatic speech recognition results, manually prepared summaries, controlled vocabulary indexing, and name authority control are available for every segment. Those features were leveraged by a team of four relevance assessors to identify topically relevant segments for 28 topics developed from actual user requests. Search-guided assessment yielded sufficient inter-annotator agreement to support formative evaluation during system development. Baseline results for ranked retrieval are presented to illustrate use of the collection.
1009004	A formal study of information retrieval heuristics Empirical studies of information retrieval methods show that good retrieval performance is closely related to the use of various retrieval heuristics, such as TF-IDF weighting. One basic research question is thus what exactly are these "necessary" heuristics that seem to cause good retrieval performance. In this paper, we present a formal study of retrieval heuristics. We formally define a set of basic desirable constraints that any reasonable retrieval function should satisfy, and check these constraints on a variety of representative retrieval functions. We find that none of these retrieval functions satisfies all the constraints unconditionally. Empirical results show that when a constraint is not satisfied, it often indicates non-optimality of the method, and when a constraint is satisfied only for a certain range of parameter values, its performance tends to be poor when the parameter is out of the range. In general, we find that the empirical performance of a retrieval formula is tightly related to how well it satisfies these constraints. Thus the proposed constraints provide a good explanation of many empirical observations and make it possible to evaluate any existing or new retrieval formula analytically .
1009005	Probabilistic model for contextual retrieval Contextual retrieval is a critical technique for facilitating many important applications such as mobile search, personalized search, PC troubleshooting, etc. Despite of its importance, there is no comprehensive retrieval model to describe the contextual retrieval process. We observed that incompatible context, noisy context and incomplete query are several important issues commonly existing in contextual retrieval applications. However, these issues have not been previously explored and discussed. In this paper, we propose probabilistic models to address these problems. Our study clearly shows that query log is the key to build effective contextual retrieval models. We also conduct a case study in the PC troubleshooting domain to testify the performance of the proposed models and experimental results show that the models can achieve very good retrieval precision.
1009006	Discriminative models for information retrieval Discriminative models have been preferred over generative models in many machine learning problems in the recent past owing to some of their attractive theoretical properties. In this paper, we explore the applicability of discriminative classifiers for IR. We have compared the performance of two popular discriminative models, namely the maximum entropy model and support vector machines with that of language modeling, the state-of-the-art generative model for IR. Our experiments on ad-hoc retrieval indicate that although maximum entropy is significantly worse than language models, support vector machines are on par with language models. We argue that the main reason to prefer SVMs over language models is their ability to learn arbitrary features automatically as demonstrated by our experiments on the home-page finding task of TREC-10.
1009008	The overlap problem in content-oriented XML retrieval evaluation Within the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval(INEX) a number of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of content-oriented XML retrieval approaches were developed. Although these metrics provide a solution towards addressing the problem of overlapping result elements, they do not consider the problem of overlapping reference components within the recall-base, thus leading to skewed effectiveness scores. We propose alternative metrics that aim to provide a solution to both overlap issues.
1009009	Length normalization in XML retrieval XML retrieval is a departure from standard document retrieval in which each individual XML element, ranging from italicized words or phrases to full blown articles, is a potentially retrievable unit. The distribution of XML element lengths is unlike what we usually observe in standard document collections, prompting us to revisit the issue of document length normalization. We perform a comparative analysis of arbitrary elements versus relevant elements, and show the importance of length as a parameter for XML retrieval. Within the language modeling framework, we investigate a range of techniques that deal with length either directly or indirectly. We observe a length bias introduced by the amount of smoothing, and show the importance of extreme length priors for XML retrieval. We also show that simply removing shorter elements from the index (by introducing a cut-off value) does not create an appropriate document length normalization. Even after increasing the minimal size of XML elements occurring in the index, the importance of an extreme length bias remains.
1009010	Configurable indexing and ranking for XML information retrieval Indexing and ranking are two key factors for efficient and effective XML information retrieval. Inappropriate indexing may result in false negatives and false positives, and improper ranking may lead to low precisions. In this paper, we propose a configurable XML information retrieval system, in which users can configure appropriate index types for XML tags and text contents. Based on users' index configurations, the system transforms XML structures into a compact tree representation, Ctree, and indexes XML text contents. To support XML ranking, we propose the concepts of "weighted term frequency" and "inverted element frequency," where the weight of a term depends on its frequency and location within an XML element as well as its popularity among similar elements in an XML dataset. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system through extensive experiments on the INEX 03 dataset and 30 content and structure (CAS) topics. The experimental results reveal that our system has significantly high precision at low recall regions and achieves the highest average precision (0.3309) as compared with 38 official INEX 03 submissions using the strict evaluation metric.
1009012	Locality preserving indexing for document representation Document representation and indexing is a key problem for document analysis and processing, such as clustering, classification and retrieval. Conventionally, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is considered effective in deriving such an indexing. LSI essentially detects the most representative features for document representation rather than the most discriminative features. Therefore, LSI might not be optimal in discriminating documents with different semantics. In this paper, a novel algorithm called Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) is proposed for document indexing. Each document is represented by a vector with low dimensionality. In contrast to LSI which discovers the global structure of the document space, LPI discovers the local structure and obtains a compact document representation subspace that best detects the essential semantic structure. We compare the proposed LPI approach with LSI on two standard databases. Experimental results show that LPI provides better representation in the sense of semantic structure.
1009014	On scaling latent semantic indexing for large peer-to-peer systems The exponential growth of data demands scalable infrastructures capable of indexing and searching rich content such as text, music, and images. A promising direction is to combine information re-trieval with peer-to-peer technology for scalability, fault-tolerance, and low administration cost. One pioneering work along this di-rection is pSearch [32, 33]. pSearch places documents onto a peer-to- peer overlay network according to semantic vectors produced using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). The search cost for a query is reduced since documents related to the query are likely to be co-located on a small number of nodes. Unfortunately, because of its reliance on LSI, pSearch also inherits the limitations of LSI. (1) When the corpus is large and heterogeneous, LSI's retrieval quality is inferior to methods such as Okapi. (2) The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) used in LSI is unscalable in terms of both memory consumption and computation time.This paper addresses the above limitations of LSI and makes the following contributions. (1) To reduce the cost of SVD, we reduce the size of its input matrix through document clustering and term selection. Our method retains the retrieval quality of LSI but is several orders of magnitude more efficient. (2) Through extensive experimentation, we found that proper normalization of semantic vectors for terms and documents improves recall by 76%. (3) To further improve retrieval quality, we use low-dimensional subvectors of semantic vectors to cluster documents in the overlay and then use Okapi to guide the search and document selection.
1009016	GaP: a factor model for discrete data We present a probabilistic model for a document corpus that combines many of the desirable features of previous models. The model is called "GaP" for Gamma-Poisson, the distributions of the first and last random variable. GaP is a factor model, that is it gives an approximate factorization of the document-term matrix into a product of matrices ? and X . These factors have strictly non-negative terms. GaP is a generative probabilistic model that assigns finite probabilities to documents in a corpus. It can be computed with an efficient and simple EM recurrence. For a suitable choice of parameters, the GaP factorization maximizes independence between the factors. So it can be used as an independent-component algorithm adapted to document data. The form of the GaP model is empirically as well as analytically motivated. It gives very accurate results as a probabilistic model (measured via perplexity) and as a retrieval model. The GaP model projects documents and terms into a low-dimensional space of "themes," and models texts as "passages" of terms on the same theme.
1009017	Belief revision for adaptive information retrieval Applying Belief Revision logic to model adaptive information retrieval is appealing since it provides a rigorous theoretical foundation to model partiality and uncertainty inherent in any information retrieval (IR) processes. In particular, a retrieval context can be formalised as a belief set and the formalised context is used to disambiguate vague user queries. Belief revision logic also provides a robust computational mechanism to revise an IR system's beliefs about the users' changing information needs. In addition, information flow is proposed as a text mining method to automatically acquire the initial IR contexts. The advantage of a belief-based IRsystem is that its IR behaviour is more predictable and explanatory. However, computational efficiency is often a concern when the belief revision formalisms are applied to large real-life applications. This paper describes our belief-based adaptive IR system which is underpinned by an efficient belief revision mechanism. Our initial experiments show that the belief-based symbolic IR model is more effective than a classical quantitative IR model. To our best knowledge, this is the first successful empirical evaluation of a logic-based IR model based on large IR benchmark collections.
1009020	Translating unknown queries with web corpora for cross-language information retrieval It is crucial for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems to deal with the translation of unknown queries due to that real queries might be short. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of exploiting the Web as the corpus source to translate unknown queries for CLIR. We propose an online translation approach to determine effective translations for unknown query terms via mining of bilingual search-result pages obtained from Web search engines. This approach can alleviate the problem of the lack of large bilingual corpora, translate many unknown query terms, provide flexible query specifications, and extract semantically-close translations to benefit CLIR tasks -- especially for cross-language Web search.
1009022	Using the web for automated translation extraction in cross-language information retrieval There have been significant advances in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) in recent years. One of the major remaining reasons that CLIR does not perform as well as monolingual retrieval is the presence of out of vocabulary (OOV) terms. Previous work has either relied on manual intervention or has only been partially successful in solving this problem. We use a method that extends earlier work in this area by augmenting this with statistical analysis, and corpus-based translation disambiguation to dynamically discover translations of OOV terms. The method can be applied to both Chinese-English and English-Chinese CLIR, correctly extracting translations of OOV terms from the Web automatically, and thus is a significant improvement on earlier work.
1009137	Implicit queries (IQ) for contextualized search The Implicit Query (IQ) prototype is a system which automatically generates context-sensitive searches based on a user's current computing activities. In the demo, we show IQ running when users are reading or composing email. Queries are automatically generated by analyzing the email message, and results are presented in a small pane adjacent to the current window to provide peripheral awareness of related information.
1009147	Toponym resolution in text (abstract only): which sheffield is it? Named entity tagging comprises the sub-tasks of identifying a text span and classifying it, but this view ignores the relationship between the entities and the world. Spatial and temporal entities ground events in space-time, and this relationship is vital for applications such as question answering and event tracking. There is much recent work regarding the temporal dimension (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2002, Mani and Wilson 2000), but no detailed study of the spatial dimension.I propose to investigate how spatial named entities (which are often referentially ambiguous) can be automatically resolved with respect to an extensional coordinate model (toponym resolution). To this end, various information sources including linguistic cue patterns, co-occurrence information, discourse/positional information, world knowledge (such as size and population) as well as minimality heuristics (Leidner et al. 2003) will be combined in a supervised machine learning regime.The major contributions of this research project will be a corpus of text manually annotated for spatial named entities with their model correlates as a training and evaluation resource, a novel method to spatially ground toponyms in text and a component-based evaluation based on this new reference corpus.
1076039	Orthogonal locality preserving indexing We consider the problem of document indexing and representation. Recently, Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) was proposed for learning a compact document subspace. Different from Latent Semantic Indexing which is optimal in the sense of global Euclidean structure, LPI is optimal in the sense of local manifold structure. However, LPI is extremely sensitive to the number of dimensions. This makes it difficult to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality, while inaccurately estimated dimensionality would drastically degrade its performance. One reason leading to this problem is that LPI is non-orthogonal. Non-orthogonality distorts the metric structure of the document space. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Orthogonal LPI. Orthogonal LPI iteratively computes the mutually orthogonal basis functions which respect the local geometrical structure. Moreover, our empirical study shows that OLPI can have more locality preserving power than LPI. We compare the new algorithm to LSI and LPI. Extensive experimental results show that Orthogonal LPI obtains better performance than both LSI and LPI. More crucially, it is insensitive to the number of dimensions, which makes it an efficient data preprocessing method for text clustering, classification, retrieval, etc.
1076040	Why spectral retrieval works We argue that the ability to identify pairs of related terms is at the heart of what makes spectral retrieval work in practice. Schemes such as latent semantic indexing (LSI) and its descendants have this ability in the sense that they can be viewed as computing a matrix of term-term relatedness scores which is then used to expand the given documents (not the queries). For almost all existing spectral retrieval schemes, this matrix of relatedness scores depends on a fixed low-dimensional subspace of the original term space. We instead vary the dimension and study for each term pair the resultin curve of relatedness scores. We find that it is actually the shape of this curve which is indicative for the term-pair relatedness, and not any of the individual relatedness scores on the curve. We derive two simple, parameterless algorithms that detect this shape and that consistently outperform previous methods on a number of test collections. Our curves also shed light on the effectiveness of three fundamental types of variations of the basic LSI scheme.
1076041	Better than the real thing?: iterative pseudo-query processing using cluster-based language models We present a novel approach to pseudo-feedback-based ad hoc retrieval that uses language models induced from both documents and clusters. First, we treat the pseudo-feedback documents produced in response to the original query as a set of pseudo-query that themselves can serve as input to the retrieval process. Observing that the documents returned in response to the pseudo-query can then act as pseudo-query for subsequent rounds, we arrive at a formulation of pseudo-query-based retrieval as an iterative process. Experiments show that several concrete instantiations of this idea, when applied in conjunction with techniques designed to heighten precision, yield performance results rivaling those of a number of previously-proposed algorithms, including the standard language-modeling approach. The use of cluster-based language models is a key contributing factor to our algorithms' success.
1076042	The maximum entropy method for analyzing retrieval measures We present a model, based on the maximum entropy method, for analyzing various measures of retrieval performance such as average precision, R-precision, and precision-at-cutoffs. Our methodology treats the value of such a measure as a constraint on the distribution of relevant documents in an unknown list, and the maximum entropy distribution can be determined subject to these constraints. For good measures of overall performance (such as average precision), the resulting maximum entropy distributions are highly correlated with actual distributions of relevant documents in lists as demonstrated through TREC data; for poor measures of overall performance, the correlation is weaker. As such, the maximum entropy method can be used to quantify the overall quality of a retrieval measure. Furthermore, for good measures of overall performance (such as average precision), we show that the corresponding maximum entropy distributions can be used to accurately infer precision-recall curves and the values of other measures of performance, and we demonstrate that the quality of these inferences far exceeds that predicted by simple retrieval measure correlation, as demonstrated through TREC data.
1076044	A study of factors affecting the utility of implicit relevance feedback Implicit relevance feedback (IRF) is the process by which a search system unobtrusively gathers evidence on searcher interests from their interaction with the system. IRF is a new method of gathering information on user interest and, if IRF is to be used in operational IR systems, it is important to establish when it performs well and when it performs poorly. In this paper we investigate how the use and effectiveness of IRF is affected by three factors: search task complexity, the search experience of the user and the stage in the search. Our findings suggest that all three of these factors contribute to the utility of IRF.
1076045	Context-sensitive information retrieval using implicit feedback A major limitation of most existing retrieval models and systems is that the retrieval decision is made based solely on the query and document collection; information about the actual user and search context is largely ignored. In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an interactive information retrieval setting. We propose several context-sensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents. We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set. Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.
1076047	Active feedback in ad hoc information retrieval Information retrieval is, in general, an iterative search process, in which the user often has several interactions with a retrieval system for an information need. The retrieval system can actively probe a user with questions to clarify the information need instead of just passively responding to user queries. A basic question is thus how a retrieval system should propose questions to the user so that it can obtain maximum benefits from the feedback on these questions. In this paper, we study how a retrieval system can perform active feedback, i.e., how to choose documents for relevance feedback so that the system can learn most from the feedback information. We present a general framework for such an active feedback problem, and derive several practical algorithms as special cases. Empirical evaluation of these algorithms shows that the performance of traditional relevance feedback (presenting the top K documents) is consistently worse than that of presenting documents with more diversity. With a diversity-based selection algorithm, we obtain fewer relevant documents, however, these fewer documents have more learning benefits.
1076049	Improving collection selection with overlap awareness in P2P search engines Collection selection has been a research issue for years. Typically, in related work, precomputed statistics are employed in order to estimate the expected result quality of each collection, and subsequently the collections are ranked accordingly. Our thesis is that this simple approach is insufficient for several applications in which the collections typically overlap. This is the case, for example, for the collections built by autonomous peers crawling the web. We argue for the extension of existing quality measures using estimators of mutual overlap among collections and present experiments in which this combination outperforms CORI, a popular approach based on quality estimation. We outline our prototype implementation of a P2P web search engine, coined MINERVA, that allows handling large amounts of data in a distributed and self-organizing manner. We conduct experiments which show that taking overlap into account during collection selection can drastically decrease the number of collections that have to be contacted in order to reach a satisfactory level of recall, which is a great step toward the feasibility of distributed web search.
1076050	Server selection methods in hybrid portal search The TREC.GOV collection makes a valuable web testbed for distributed information retrieval methods because it is naturally partitioned and includes 725 web-oriented queries with judged answers. It can usefully model aspects of government and large corporate portals. Analysis of the.gov data shows that a purely distributed approach would not be feasible for providing search on a.gov portal because of the large number (17,000+) of web sites and the high proportion that do not provide a search interface. An alternative hybrid approach, combining both distributed and centralized techniques, is proposed and server selection methods are evaluated within this framework using web-oriented evaluation methodology. A number of well-known algorithms are compared against representatives (highest anchor ranked page (HARP) and anchor weighted sum (AWSUM)) of a family of new selection methods which use link anchortext extracted from an auxiliary crawl to provide descriptions of sites which are not themselves crawled. Of the previously published methods, ReDDE substantially outperformed three variants of CORI and also outperformed a method based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (extended) except on topic distillation. HARP and AWSUM performed best overall but were outperformed on the topic distillation task by extended KL Divergence.
1076051	Modeling search engine effectiveness for federated search Federated search links multiple search engines into a single, virtual search system. Most prior research of federated search focused on selecting search engines that have the most relevant contents, but ignored the retrieval effectiveness of individual search engines. This omission can cause serious problems when federating search engines of different qualities.This paper proposes a federated search technique that uses utility maximization to model the retrieval effectiveness of each search engine in a federated search environment. The new algorithm ranks the available resources by explicitly estimating the amount of relevant material that each resource can return , instead of the amount of relevant material that each resource contains . An extensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the new algorithm.
1076054	Robustness of adaptive filtering methods in a cross-benchmark evaluation This paper reports a cross-benchmark evaluation of regularized logistic regression (LR) and incremental Rocchio for adaptive filtering. Using four corpora from the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) forum and the Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC) we evaluated these methods with non-stationary topics at various granularity levels, and measured performance with different utility settings. We found that LR performs strongly and robustly in optimizing T11SU (a TREC utility function) while Rocchio is better for optimizing Ctrk (the TDT tracking cost), a high-recall oriented objective function. Using systematic cross-corpus parameter optimization with both methods, we obtained the best results ever reported on TDT5, TREC10 and TREC11. Relevance feedback on a small portion (0.05~0.2%) of the TDT5 test documents yielded significant performance improvements, measuring up to a 54% reduction in Ctrk and a 20.9% increase in T11SU (with b=0.1), compared to the results of the top-performing system in TDT2004 without relevance feedback information.
1076055	A probabilistic model for retrospective news event detection Retrospective news event detection (RED) is defined as the discovery of previously unidentified events in historical news corpus. Although both the contents and time information of news articles are helpful to RED, most researches focus on the utilization of the contents of news articles. Few research works have been carried out on finding better usages of time information. In this paper, we do some explorations on both directions based on the following two characteristics of news articles. On the one hand, news articles are always aroused by events; on the other hand, similar articles reporting the same event often redundantly appear on many news sources. The former hints a generative model of news articles, and the latter provides data enriched environments to perform RED. With consideration of these characteristics, we propose a probabilistic model to incorporate both content and time information in a unified framework. This model gives new representations of both news articles and news events. Furthermore, based on this approach, we build an interactive RED system, HISCOVERY, which provides additional functions to present events, Photo Story and Chronicle .
1076056	Scalable collaborative filtering using cluster-based smoothing Memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. In the past, the memory-based approach has been shown to suffer from two fundamental problems: data sparsity and difficulty in scalability. Alternatively, the model-based approach has been proposed to alleviate these problems, but this approach tends to limit the range of users. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines the advantages of these two approaches by introducing a smoothing-based method. In our approach, clusters generated from the training data provide the basis for data smoothing and neighborhood selection. As a result, we provide higher accuracy as well as increased efficiency in recommendations. Empirical studies on two datasets (EachMovie and MovieLens) show that our new proposed approach consistently outperforms other state-of-art collaborative filtering algorithms.
1076058	OCFS: optimal orthogonal centroid feature selection for text categorization Text categorization is an important research area in many Information Retrieval (IR) applications. To save the storage space and computation time in text categorization, efficient and effective algorithms for reducing the data before analysis are highly desired. Traditional techniques for this purpose can generally be classified into feature extraction and feature selection . Because of efficiency, the latter is more suitable for text data such as web documents. However, many popular feature selection techniques such as Information Gain (IG) and? 2 -test (CHI) are all greedy in nature and thus may not be optimal according to some criterion. Moreover, the performance of these greedy methods may be deteriorated when the reserved data dimension is extremely low. In this paper, we propose an efficient optimal feature selection algorithm by optimizing the objective function of Orthogonal Centroid (OC) subspace learning algorithm in a discrete solution space, called Orthogonal Centroid Feature Selection (OCFS). Experiments on 20 Newsgroups (20NG), Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) and Open Directory Project (ODP) data show that OCFS is consistently better than IG and CHI with smaller computation time especially when the reduced dimension is extremely small.
1076059	SimFusion: measuring similarity using unified relationship matrix In this paper we use a Unified Relationship Matrix ( URM ) to represent a set of heterogeneous data objects (e.g., web pages, queries) and their interrelationships (e.g., hyperlinks, user click-through sequences). We claim that iterative computations over the URM can help overcome the data sparseness problem and detect latent relationships among heterogeneous data objects, thus, can improve the quality of information applications that require com- bination of information from heterogeneous sources. To support our claim, we present a unified similarity-calculating algorithm, SimFusion . By iteratively computing over the URM, SimFusion can effectively integrate relationships from heterogeneous sources when measuring the similarity of two data objects. Experiments based on a web search engine query log and a web page collection demonstrate that SimFusion can improve similarity measurement of web objects over both traditional content based algorithms and the cutting edge SimRank algorithm.
1076062	Combining eye movements and collaborative filtering for proactive information retrieval We study a new task, proactive information retrieval by combining implicit relevance feedback and collaborative filtering. We have constructed a controlled experimental setting, a prototype application, in which the users try to find interesting scientific articles by browsing their titles. Implicit feedback is inferred from eye movement signals, with discriminative hidden Markov models estimated from existing data in which explicit relevance feedback is available. Collaborative filtering is carried out using the User Rating Profile model, a state-of-the-art probabilistic latent variable model, computed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For new document titles the prediction accuracy with eye movements, collaborative filtering, and their combination was significantly better than by chance. The best prediction accuracy still leaves room for improvement but shows that proactive information retrieval and combination of many sources of relevance feedback is feasible.
1076063	Accurately interpreting clickthrough data as implicit feedback This paper examines the reliability of implicit feedback generated from clickthrough data in WWW search. Analyzing the users' decision process using eyetracking and comparing implicit feedback against manual relevance judgments, we conclude that clicks are informative but biased. While this makes the interpretation of clicks as absolute relevance judgments difficult, we show that relative preferences derived from clicks are reasonably accurate on average.
1076064	Information retrieval system evaluation: effort, sensitivity, and reliability The effectiveness of information retrieval systems is measured by comparing performance on a common set of queries and documents. Significance tests are often used to evaluate the reliability of such comparisons. Previous work has examined such tests, but produced results with limited application. Other work established an alternative benchmark for significance, but the resulting test was too stringent. In this paper, we revisit the question of how such tests should be used. We find that the t-test is highly reliable (more so than the sign or Wilcoxon test), and is far more reliable than simply showing a large percentage difference in effectiveness measures between IR systems. Our results show that past empirical work on significance tests over-estimated the error of such tests. We also re-consider comparisons between the reliability of precision at rank 10 and mean average precision, arguing that past comparisons did not consider the assessor effort required to compute such measures. This investigation shows that assessor effort would be better spent building test collections with more topics, each assessed in less detail.
1076066	Detecting phrase-level duplication on the world wide web Two years ago, we conducted a study on the evolution of web pages over time. In the course of that study, we discovered a large number of machine-generated "spam" web pages emanating from a handful of web servers in Germany. These spam web pages were dynamically assembled by stitching together grammatically well-formed German sentences drawn from a large collection of sentences. This discovery motivated us to develop techniques for finding other instances of such "slice and dice" generation of web pages, where pages are automatically generated by stitching together phrases drawn from a limited corpus. We applied these techniques to two data sets, a set of 151 million web pages collected in December 2002 and a set of 96 million web pages collected in June 2004. We found a number of other instances of large-scale phrase-level replication within the two data sets. This paper describes the algorithms we used to discover this type of replication, and highlights the results of our data mining.
1076067	Using ODP metadata to personalize search The Open Directory Project is clearly one of the largest collaborative efforts to manually annotate web pages. This effort involves over 65,000 editors and resulted in metadata specifying topic and importance for more than 4 million web pages. Still, given that this number is just about 0.05 percent of the Web pages indexed by Google, is this effort enough to make a difference? In this paper we discuss how these metadata can be exploited to achieve high quality personalized web search. First, we address this by introducing an additional criterion for web page ranking, namely the distance between a user profile defined using ODP topics and the sets of ODP topics covered by each URL returned in regular web search. We empirically show that this enhancement yields better results than current web search using Google. Then, in the second part of the paper, we investigate the boundaries of biasing PageRank on subtopics of the ODP in order to automatically extend these metadata to the whole web.
1076068	Exploiting the hierarchical structure for link analysis Link analysis algorithms have been extensively used in Web information retrieval. However, current link analysis algorithms generally work on a flat link graph, ignoring the hierarchal structure of the Web graph. They often suffer from two problems: the sparsity of link graph and biased ranking of newly-emerging pages. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking algorithm called Hierarchical Rank as a solution to these two problems, which considers both the hierarchical structure and the link structure of the Web. In this algorithm, Web pages are first aggregated based on their hierarchical structure at directory, host or domain level and link analysis is performed on the aggregated graph. Then, the importance of each node on the aggregated graph is distributed to individual pages belong to the node based on the hierarchical structure. This algorithm allows the importance of linked Web pages to be distributed in the Web page space even when the space is sparse and contains new pages. Experimental results on the .GOV collection of TREC 2003 and 2004 show that hierarchical ranking algorithm consistently outperforms other well-known ranking algorithms, including the PageRank, BlockRank and LayerRank. In addition, experimental results show that link aggregation at the host level is much better than link aggregation at either the domain or directory levels.
1076070	Web-page summarization using clickthrough data Most previous Web-page summarization methods treat a Web page as plain text. However, such methods fail to uncover the full knowledge associated with a Web page needed in building a high-quality summary, because many of these methods do not consider the hidden relationships in the Web. Uncovering the hidden knowledge is important in building good Web-page summarizers. In this paper, we extract the extra knowledge from the clickthrough data of a Web search engine to improve Web-page summarization. Wefirst analyze the feasibility in utilizing the clickthrough data to enhance Web-page summarization and then propose two adapted summarization methods that take advantage of the relationships discovered from the clickthrough data. For those pages that are not covered by the clickthrough data, we design a thematic lexicon approach to generate implicit knowledge for them. Our methods are evaluated on a dataset consisting of manually annotated pages as well as a large dataset that is crawled from the Open Directory Project website. The experimental results indicate that significant improvements can be achieved through our proposed summarizer as compared to the summarizers that do not use the clickthrough data.
1076071	Topic themes for multi-document summarization The problem of using topic representations for multi-document summarization (MDS) has received considerable attention recently. In this paper, we describe five different topic representations and introduce a novel representation of topics based on topic themes. We present eight different methods of generating MDS and evaluate each of these methods on a large set of topics used in past DUC workshops. Our evaluation results show a significant improvement in the quality of summaries based on topic themes over MDS methods that use other alternative topic representations.
1076072	Do summaries help? We describe a task-based evaluation to determine whether multi-document summaries measurably improve user performance whe using online news browsing systems for directed research. We evaluated the multi-document summaries generated by Newsblaster, a robust news browsing system that clusters online news articles and summarizes multiple articles on each event. Four groups of subjects were asked to perform the same time-restricted fact-gathering tasks, reading news under different conditions: no summaries at all, single sentence summaries drawn from one of the articles, Newsblaster multi-document summaries, and human summaries. Our results show that, in comparison to source documents only, the quality of reports assembled using Newsblaster summaries was significantly better and user satisfaction was higher with both Newsblaster and human summaries.
1076074	Optimization strategies for complex queries Previous research into the efficiency of text retrieval systems has dealt primarily with methods that consider inverted lists in sequence; these methods are known as term-at-a-time methods. However, the literature for optimizing document-at-a-time systems remains sparse.We present an improvement to the max_score optimization, which is the most efficient known document-at-a-time scoring method. Like max_score, our technique, called term bounded max_score, is guaranteed to return exactly the same scores and documents as an unoptimized evaluation, which is particularly useful for query model research. We simulated our technique to explore the problem space, then implemented it in Indri, our large scale language modeling search engine. Tests with the GOV2 corpus on title queries show our method to be 23% faster than max_score alone, and 61% faster than our document-at-a-time baseline. Our optimized query times are competitive with conventional term-at-a-time systems on this year's TREC Terabyte task.
1076075	Simplified similarity scoring using term ranks We propose a method for document ranking that combines a simple document-centric view of text, and fast evaluation strategies that have been developed in connection with the vector space model. The new method defines the importance of a term within a document qualitatively rather than quantitatively, and in doing so reduces the need for tuning parameters. In addition, the method supports very fast query processing, with most of the computation carried out on small integers, and dynamic pruning an effective option. Experiments on a wide range of TREC data show that the new method provides retrieval effectiveness as good as or better than the Okapi BM25 formulation, and variants of language models.
1076077	Efficient and self-tuning incremental query expansion for top-k query processing We present a novel approach for efficient and self-tuning query expansion that is embedded into a top-k query processor with candidate pruning. Traditional query expansion methods select expansion terms whose thematic similarity to the original query terms is above some specified threshold, thus generating a disjunctive query with much higher dimensionality. This poses three major problems: 1) the need for hand-tuning the expansion threshold, 2) the potential topic dilution with overly aggressive expansion, and 3) the drastically increased execution cost of a high-dimensional query. The method developed in this paper addresses all three problems by dynamically and incrementally merging the inverted lists for the potential expansion terms with the lists for the original query terms. A priority queue is used for maintaining result candidates, the pruning of candidates is based on Fagin's family of top-k algorithms, and optionally probabilistic estimators of candidate scores can be used for additional pruning. Experiments on the TREC collections for the 2004 Robust and Terabyte tracks demonstrate the increased efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of our approach.
1076079	Title extraction from bodies of HTML documents and its application to web page retrieval This paper is concerned with automatic extraction of titles from the bodies of HTML documents. Titles of HTML documents should be correctly defined in the title fields; however, in reality HTML titles are often bogus. It is desirable to conduct automatic extraction of titles from the bodies of HTML documents. This is an issue which does not seem to have been investigated previously. In this paper, we take a supervised machine learning approach to address the problem. We propose a specification on HTML titles. We utilize format information such as font size, position, and font weight as features in title extraction. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline method of using the lines in largest font size as title (20.9%-32.6% improvement in F1 score). As application, we consider web page retrieval. We use the TREC Web Track data for evaluation. We propose a new method for HTML documents retrieval using extracted titles. Experimental results indicate that the use of both extracted titles and title fields is almost always better than the use of title fields alone; the use of extracted titles is particularly helpful in the task of named page finding (23.1% -29.0% improvements).
1076080	Multi-label informed latent semantic indexing Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a well-known unsupervised approach for dimensionality reduction in information retrieval. However if the output information (i.e. category labels) is available, it is often beneficial to derive the indexing not only based on the inputs but also on the target values in the training data set. This is of particular importance in applications with multiple labels , in which each document can belong to several categories simultaneously. In this paper we introduce the multi-label informed latent semantic indexing (MLSI) algorithm which preserves the information of inputs and meanwhile captures the correlations between the multiple outputs. The recovered "latent semantics" thus incorporate the human-annotated category information and can be used to greatly improve the prediction accuracy. Empirical study based on two data sets, Reuters-21578 and RCV1, demonstrates very encouraging results.
1076081	Text classification with kernels on the multinomial manifold Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been very successful in text classification. However, the intrinsic geometric structure of text data has been ignored by standard kernels commonly used in SVMs. It is natural to assume that the documents are on the multinomial manifold, which is the simplex of multinomial models furnished with the Riemannian structure induced by the Fisher information metric. We prove that the Negative Geodesic Distance (NGD) on the multinomial manifold is conditionally positive definite (cpd), thus can be used as a kernel in SVMs. Experiments show the NGD kernel on the multinomial manifold to be effective for text classification, significantly outperforming standard kernels on the ambient Euclidean space.
1076082	Multi-labelled classification using maximum entropy method Many classification problems require classifiers to assign each single document into more than one category, which is called multi-labelled classification . The categories in such problems usually are neither conditionally independent from each other nor mutually exclusive, therefore it is not trivial to directly employ state-of-the-art classification algorithms without losing information of relation among categories. In this paper, we explore correlations among categories with maximum entropy method and derive a classification algorithm for multi-labelled documents. Our experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the combination of single label approach.
1076085	Linear discriminant model for information retrieval This paper presents a new discriminative model for information retrieval (IR), referred to as linear discriminant model (LDM), which provides a flexible framework to incorporate arbitrary features. LDM is different from most existing models in that it takes into account a variety of linguistic features that are derived from the component models of HMM that is widely used in language modeling approaches to IR. Therefore, LDM is a means of melding discriminative and generative models for IR. We present two algorithms of parameter learning for LDM. One is to optimize the average precision (AP) directly using an iterative procedure. The other is a perceptron-based algorithm that minimizes the number of discordant document-pairs in a rank list. The effectiveness of our approach has been evaluated on the task of ad hoc retrieval using six English and Chinese TREC test sets. Results show that (1) in most test sets, LDM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art language modeling approaches and the classical probabilistic retrieval model; (2) it is more appropriate to train LDM using a measure of AP rather than likelihood if the IR system is graded on AP; and (3) linguistic features (e.g. phrases and dependences) are effective for IR if they are incorporated properly.
1076086	Integrating word relationships into language models In this paper, we propose a novel dependency language modeling approach for information retrieval. The approach extends the existing language modeling approach by relaxing the independence assumption. Our goal is to build a language model in which various word relationships can be integrated. In this work, we integrate two types of relationship extracted from WordNet and co-occurrence relationships respectively. The integrated model has been tested on several TREC collections. The results show that our model achieves substantial and significant improvements with respect to the models without these relationships. These results clearly show the benefit of integrating word relationships into language models for IR.
1076087	PageRank without hyperlinks: structural re-ranking using links induced by language models Inspired by the PageRank and HITS (hubs and authorities) algorithms for Web search, we propose a structural re-ranking approach to ad hoc information retrieval: we reorder the documents in an initially retrieved set by exploiting asymmetric relationships between them. Specifically, we consider generation links , which indicate that the language model induced from one document assigns high probability to the text of another; in doing so, we take care to prevent bias against long documents. We study a number of re-ranking criteria based on measures of centrality in the graphs formed by generation links, and show that integrating centrality into standard language-model-based retrieval is quite effective at improving precision at top ranks.
1076089	Controlling overlap in content-oriented XML retrieval The direct application of standard ranking techniques to retrieve individual elements from a collection of XML documents often produces a result set in which the top ranks are dominated by a large number of elements taken from a small number of highly relevant documents. This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm that re-ranks this result set, with the aim of minimizing redundant content while preserving the benefits of element retrieval, including the benefit of identifying topic-focused components contained within relevant documents. The test collection developed by the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) forms the basis for the evaluation.
1076090	Publish/subscribe functionality in IR environments using structured overlay networks We study the problem of offering publish/subscribe functionality on top of structured overlay networks using data models and languages from IR. We show how to achieve this by extending the distributed hash table Chord and present a detailed experimental evaluation of our proposals.
1076091	Learning to extract information from semi-structured text using a discriminative context free grammar In recent work, conditional Markov chain models (CMM) have been used to extract information from semi-structured text (one example is the Conditional Random Field [10]). Applications range from finding the author and title in research papers to finding the phone number and street address in a web page. The CMM framework combines a priori knowledge encoded as features with a set of labeled training data to learn an efficient extraction process. We will show that similar problems can be solved more effectively by learning a discriminative context free grammar from training data. The grammar has several distinct advantages: long range, even global, constraints can be used to disambiguate entity labels; training data is used more efficiently; and a set of new more powerful features can be introduced. The grammar based approach also results in semantic information (encoded in the form of a parse tree) which could be used for IR applications like question answering. The specific problem we consider is of extracting personal contact, or address, information from unstructured sources such as documents and emails. While linear-chain CMMs perform reasonably well on this task, we show that a statistical parsing approach results in a 50% reduction in error rate. This system also has the advantage of being interactive, similar to the system described in [9]. In cases where there are multiple errors, a single user correction can be propagated to correct multiple errors automatically. Using a discriminatively trained grammar, 93.71% of all tokens are labeled correctly (compared to 88.43% for a CMM) and 72.87% of records have all tokens labeled correctly (compared to 45.29% for the CMM).
1076094	On the collective classification of email speech acts We consider classification of email messages as to whether or not they contain certain "email acts", such as a request or a commitment. We show that exploiting the sequential correlation among email messages in the same thread can improve email-act classification. More specifically, we describe a new text-classification algorithm based on a dependency-network based collective classification method, in which the local classifiers are maximum entropy models based on words and certain relational features. We show that statistically significant improvements over a bag-of-words baseline classifier can be obtained for some, but not all, email-act classes. Performance improvements obtained by collective classification appears to be consistent across many email acts suggested by prior speech-act theory.
1076095	Using term informativeness for named entity detection Informal communication (e-mail, bulletin boards) poses a difficult learning environment because traditional grammatical and lexical information are noisy. Other information is necessary for tasks such as named entity detection. How topic-centric, or informative, a word is can be valuable information. It is well known that informative words are best modeled by "heavy-tailed" distributions, such as mixture models. However, informativeness scores do not take full advantage of this fact. We introduce a new informativeness score that directly utilizes mixture model likelihood to identify informative words. We use the task of extracting restaurant names from bulletin board posts as a way to determine effectiveness. We find that our "mixture score" is weakly effective alone and highly effective when combined with Inverse Document Frequency. We compare against other informativeness criteria and find that only Residual IDF is competitive against our combined IDF/Mixture score.
1076101	Generic soft pattern models for definitional question answering This paper explores probabilistic lexico-syntactic pattern matching, also known as soft pattern matching . While previous methods in soft pattern matching are ad hoc in computing the degree of match, we propose two formal matching models: one based on bigrams and the other on the Profile Hidden Markov Model (PHMM). Both models provide a theoretically sound method to model pattern matching as a probabilistic process that generates token sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on definition sentence retrieval for definitional question answering. We show that both models significantly outperform state-of-the-art manually constructed patterns. A critical difference between the two models is that the PHMM technique handles language variations more effectively but requires more training data to converge. We believe that both models can be extended to other areas where lexico-syntactic pattern matching can be applied.
1076103	Question answering passage retrieval using dependency relations State-of-the-art question answering (QA) systems employ term-density ranking to retrieve answer passages. Such methods often retrieve incorrect passages as relationships among question terms are not considered. Previous studies attempted to address this problem by matching dependency relations between questions and answers. They used strict matching, which fails when semantically equivalent relationships are phrased differently. We propose fuzzy relation matching based on statistical models. We present two methods for learning relation mapping scores from past QA pairs: one based on mutual information and the other on expectation maximization. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art density-based passage retrieval methods by up to 78% in mean reciprocal rank. Relation matching also brings about a 50% improvement in a system enhanced by query expansion.
1076105	A study of relevance propagation for web search Different from traditional information retrieval, both content and structure are critical to the success of Web information retrieval. In recent years, many relevance propagation techniques have been proposed to propagate content information between web pages through web structure to improve the performance of web search. In this paper, we first propose a generic relevance propagation framework, and then provide a comparison study on the effectiveness and efficiency of various representative propagation models that can be derived from this generic framework. We come to many conclusions that are useful for selecting a propagation model in real-world search applications, including 1) sitemap-based propagation models outperform hyperlink-based models in sense of both effectiveness and efficiency, and 2) sitemap-based term propagation is easier to be integrated into real-world search engines because of its parallel offline implementation and acceptable complexity. Some other more detailed study results are also reported in the paper.
1076106	Relevance weighting for query independent evidence A query independent feature, relating perhaps to document content, linkage or usage, can be transformed into a static, per-document relevance weight for use in ranking. The challenge is to find a good function to transform feature values into relevance scores. This paper presents FLOE, a simple density analysis method for modelling the shape of the transformation required, based on training data and without assuming independence between feature and baseline. For a new query independent feature, it addresses the questions: is it required for ranking, what sort of transformation is appropriate and, after adding it, how successful was the chosen transformation? Based on this we apply sigmoid transformations to PageRank, indegree, URL Length and ClickDistance, tested in combination with a BM25 baseline.
1076107	Detecting dominant locations from search queries Accurately and effectively detecting the locations where search queries are truly about has huge potential impact on increasing search relevance. In this paper, we define a search query's dominant location (QDL) and propose a solution to correctly detect it. QDL is geographical location(s) associated with a query in collective human knowledge, i.e., one or few prominent locations agreed by majority of people who know the answer to the query. QDL is a subjective and collective attribute of search queries and we are able to detect QDLs from both queries containing geographical location names and queries not containing them. The key challenges to QDL detection include false positive suppression (not all contained location names in queries mean geographical locations), and detecting implied locations by the context of the query. In our solution, a query is recursively broken into atomic tokens according to its most popular web usage for reducing false positives. If we do not find a dominant location in this step, we mine the top search results and/or query logs (with different approaches discussed in this paper) to discover implicit query locations. Our large-scale experiments on recent MSN Search queries show that our query location detection solution has consistent high accuracy for all query frequency ranges.
1076109	When will information retrieval be good enough? We describe a user study that examined the relationship between the quality of an Information Retrieval system and the effectiveness of its users in performing a task. The task involves finding answer facets of questions pertaining to a collection of newswire documents over a six month period. We artificially created sets of ranked lists at increasing levels of quality by blending the output of a state-of-the-art retrieval system with truth data created by annotators. Subjects performed the task by using these ranked lists to guide their labeling of answer passages in the retrieved articles. We found that as system accuracy improves, subject time on task and error rate decrease, and the rate of finding new correct answers increases. There is a large intermediary region in which the utility difference is not significant; our results suggest that there is some threshold of accuracy for this task beyond which user utility improves rapidly, but more experiments are needed to examine the area around that threshold closely.
1076110	Modeling task-genre relationships for IR in the workplace Context influences the search process, but to date research has not definitively identified which aspects of context are the most influential for information retrieval, and thus are worthy of integration in today's retrieval systems. In this research, we isolated for examination two aspects of context: task and document genre and examined the relationship between them within a software engineering work domain. In this domain, the nature of the task has an impact on decisions of relevance and usefulness, and the document collection contains a distinctive set of genre. Our data set was a document repository created and used by our target population. The document surrogates were meta-tagged by purpose and document type. Correspondence analysis of this categorical data identified some specific relationships between genres and tasks, as well as four broad dimensions of variability underlying these relationships. These results have the potential to inform the design of a contextual retrieval system by refining search results for this domain.
1076111	Personalizing search via automated analysis of interests and activities We formulate and study search algorithms that consider a user's prior interactions with a wide variety of content to personalize that user's current Web search. Rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption that people will precisely specify their intent when searching, we pursue techniques that leverage implicit information about the user's interests. This information is used to re-rank Web search results within a relevance feedback framework. We explore rich models of user interests, built from both search-related information, such as previously issued queries and previously visited Web pages, and other information about the user such as documents and email the user has read and created. Our research suggests that rich representations of the user and the corpus are important for personalization, but that it is possible to approximate these representations and provide efficient client-side algorithms for personalizing search. We show that such personalization algorithms can significantly improve on current Web search.
1076112	The loquacious user: a document-independent source of terms for query expansion In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of a document-independent technique for eliciting feedback from users about their information problems. We propose that such a technique can be used to elicit terms from users for use in query expansion and as a follow-up when ambiguous queries are initially posed by users. We design a feedback form to obtain additional information from users, administer the form to users after initial querying, and create a series of experimental runs based on the information that we obtained from the form. Results demonstrate that the form was successful at eliciting more information from users and that this additional information significantly improved retrieval performance. Our results further demonstrate a strong relationship between query length and performance.
1076115	A Markov random field model for term dependencies This paper develops a general, formal framework for modeling term dependencies via Markov random fields. The model allows for arbitrary text features to be incorporated as evidence. In particular, we make use of features based on occurrences of single terms, ordered phrases, and unordered phrases. We explore full independence, sequential dependence, and full dependence variants of the model. A novel approach is developed to train the model that directly maximizes the mean average precision rather than maximizing the likelihood of the training data. Ad hoc retrieval experiments are presented on several newswire and web collections, including the GOV2 collection used at the TREC 2004 Terabyte Track. The results show significant improvements are possible by modeling dependencies, especially on the larger web collections.
1076116	An exploration of axiomatic approaches to information retrieval Existing retrieval models generally do not offer any guarantee for optimal retrieval performance. Indeed, it is even difficult, if not impossible, to predict a model's empirical performance analytically . This limitation is at least partly caused by the way existing retrieval models are developed where relevance is only coarsely modeled at the level of documents and queries as opposed to a finer granularity level of terms. In this paper, we present a new axiomatic approach to developing retrieval models based on direct modeling of relevance with formalized retrieval constraints defined at the level of terms. The basic idea of this axiomatic approach is to search in a space of candidate retrieval functions for one that can satisfy a set of reasonable retrieval constraints. To constrain the search space, we propose to define a retrieval function inductively and decompose a retrieval function into three component functions. Inspired by the analysis of the existing retrieval functions with the inductive definition, we derive several new retrieval functions using the axiomatic retrieval framework. Experiment results show that the derived new retrieval functions are more robust and less sensitive to parameter settings than the existing retrieval functions with comparable optimal performance.
1076119	Impedance coupling in content-targeted advertising The current boom of the Web is associated with the revenues originated from on-line advertising. While search-based advertising is dominant, the association of ads with a Web page (during user navigation) is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we study the problem of associating ads with a Web page, referred to as content-targeted advertising, from a computer science perspective. We assume that we have access to the text of the Web page, the keywords declared by an advertiser, and a text associated with the advertiser's business. Using no other information and operating in fully automatic fashion, we propose ten strategies for solving the problem and evaluate their effectiveness. Our methods indicate that a matching strategy that takes into account the semantics of the problem (referred to as AAK for "ads and keywords") can yield gains in average precision figures of 60% compared to a trivial vector-based strategy. Further, a more sophisticated impedance coupling strategy, which expands the text of the Web page to reduce vocabulary impedance with regard to an advertisement, can yield extra gains in average precision of 50%. These are first results. They suggest that great accuracy in content-targeted advertising can be attained with appropriate algorithms.
1076120	Improving web search results using affinity graph In this paper, we propose a novel ranking scheme named Affinity Ranking (AR) to re-rank search results by optimizing two metrics: (1) diversity -- which indicates the variance of topics in a group of documents; (2) information richness -- which measures the coverage of a single document to its topic. Both of the two metrics are calculated from a directed link graph named Affinity Graph (AG). AG models the structure of a group of documents based on the asymmetric content similarities between each pair of documents. Experimental results in Yahoo! Directory, ODP Data, and Newsgroup data demonstrate that our proposed ranking algorithm significantly improves the search performance. Specifically, the algorithm achieves 31% improvement in diversity and 12% improvement in information richness relatively within the top 10 search results.
1076121	Learning to estimate query difficulty: including applications to missing content detection and distributed information retrieval In this article we present novel learning methods for estimating the quality of results returned by a search engine in response to a query. Estimation is based on the agreement between the top results of the full query and the top results of its sub-queries. We demonstrate the usefulness of quality estimation for several applications, among them improvement of retrieval, detecting queries for which no relevant content exists in the document collection, and distributed information retrieval. Experiments on TREC data demonstrate the robustness and the effectiveness of our learning algorithms.
1076123	Iterative translation disambiguation for cross-language information retrieval Finding a proper distribution of translation probabilities is one of the most important factors impacting the effectiveness of a cross-language information retrieval system. In this paper we present a new approach that computes translation probabilities for a given query by using only a bilingual dictionary and a monolingual corpus in the target language. The algorithm combines term association measures with an iterative machine learning approach based on expectation maximization. Our approach considers only pairs of translation candidates and is therefore less sensitive to data-sparseness issues than approaches using higher n-grams. The learned translation probabilities are used as query term weights and integrated into a vector-space retrieval system. Results for English-German cross-lingual retrieval show substantial improvements over a baseline using dictionary lookup without term weighting.
1076125	A maximum coherence model for dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval One key to cross-language information retrieval is how to efficiently resolve the translation ambiguity of queries given their short length. This problem is even more challenging when only bilingual dictionaries are available, which is the focus of this paper. In the previous research of cross-language information retrieval using bilingual dictionaries, the word co-occurrence statistics is used to determine the most likely translations of queries. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical model, named ``maximum coherence model'', which estimates the translation probabilities of query words that are consistent with the word co-occurrence statistics. Unlike the previous work, where a binary decision is made for the selection of translations, the new model maintains the uncertainty in translating query words when their sense ambiguity is difficult to resolve. Furthermore, this new model is able to estimate translations of multiple query words simultaneously. This is in contrast to many previous approaches where translations of individual query words are determined independently. Empirical studies with TREC datasets have shown that the maximum coherence model achieves a relative 10% - 40% improvement in cross-language information retrieval, comparing to other approaches that also use word co-occurrence statistics for sense disambiguation.
1076127	Hidden Markov models for automatic annotation and content-based retrieval of images and video This paper introduces a novel method for automatic annotation of images with keywords from a generic vocabulary of concepts or objects for the purpose of content-based image retrieval. An image, represented as sequence of feature-vectors characterizing low-level visual features such as color, texture or oriented-edges, is modeled as having been stochastically generated by a hidden Markov model, whose states represent concepts. The parameters of the model are estimated from a set of manually annotated (training) images. Each image in a large test collection is then automatically annotated with the a posteriori probability of concepts present in it. This annotation supports content-based search of the image-collection via keywords. Various aspects of model parameterization, parameter estimation, and image annotation are discussed. Empirical retrieval results are presented on two image-collections | COREL and key-frames from TRECVID. Comparisons are made with two other recently developed techniques on the same datasets.
1076128	Exploiting ontologies for automatic image annotation Automatic image annotation is the task of automatically assigning words to an image that describe the content of the image. Machine learning approaches have been explored to model the association between words and images from an annotated set of images and generate annotations for a test image. The paper proposes methods to use a hierarchy defined on the annotation words derived from a text ontology to improve automatic image annotation and retrieval. Specifically, the hierarchy is used in the context of generating a visual vocabulary for representing images and as a framework for the proposed hierarchical classification approach for automatic image annotation. The effect of using the hierarchy in generating the visual vocabulary is demonstrated by improvements in the annotation performance of translation models. In addition to performance improvements, hierarchical classification approaches yield well to constructing multimedia ontologies.
1076129	A database centric view of semantic image annotation and retrieval We introduce a new model for semantic annotation and retrieval from image databases. The new model is based on a probabilistic formulation that poses annotation and retrieval as classification problems, and produces solutions that are optimal in the minimum probability of error sense. It is also database centric, by establishing a one-to-one mapping between semantic classes and the groups of database images that share the associated semantic labels. In this work we show that, under the database centric probabilistic model, optimal annotation and retrieval can be implemented with algorithms that are conceptually simple, computationally efficient, and do not require prior semantic segmentation of training images. Due to its simplicity, the annotation and retrieval architecture is also amenable to sophisticated parameter tuning, a property that is exploited to investigate the role of feature selection in the design of optimal annotation and retrieval systems. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of simply establishing a one-to-one mapping between keywords and the states of the semantic classification problem over the more complex, and currently popular, joint modeling of keyword and visual feature distributions. The database centric probabilistic retrieval model is compared to existing semantic labeling and retrieval methods, and shown to achieve higher accuracy than the previously best published results, at a fraction of their computational cost.
1076132	A testbed for people searching strategies in the WWW This paper describes the creation of a testbed to evaluate people searching strategies on the World-Wide-Web. This task involves resolving person names' ambiguity and locating relevant information characterising every individual under the same name.
1076138	Automatic web query classification using labeled and unlabeled training data Accurate topical categorization of user queries allows for increased effectiveness, efficiency, and revenue potential in general-purpose web search systems. Such categorization becomes critical if the system is to return results not just from a general web collection but from topic-specific databases as well. Maintaining sufficient categorization recall is very difficult as web queries are typically short, yielding few features per query. We examine three approaches to topical categorization of general web queries: matching against a list of manually labeled queries, supervised learning of classifiers, and mining of selectional preference rules from large unlabeled query logs. Each approach has its advantages in tackling the web query classification recall problem, and combining the three techniques allows us to classify a substantially larger proportion of queries than any of the individual techniques. We examine the performance of each approach on a real web query stream and show that our combined method accurately classifies 46% of queries, outperforming the recall of the best single approach by nearly 20%, with a 7% improvement in overall effectiveness.
1076148	Relation between PLSA and NMF and implications Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF, [5]) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA, [4]) have been successfully applied to a number of text analysis tasks such as document clustering. Despite their different inspirations, both methods are instances of multinomial PCA [1]. We further explore this relationship and first show that PLSA solves the problem of NMF with KL divergence, and then explore the implications of this relationship.
1076156	Finding semantically similar questions based on their answers A large number of question and answer pairs can be collected from question and answer boards and FAQ pages on the Web. This paper proposes an automatic method of finding the questions that have the same meaning. The method can detect semantically similar questions that have little word overlap because it calculates question-question similarities by using the corresponding answers as well as the questions. We develop two different similarity measures based on language modeling and compare them with the traditional similarity measures. Experimental results show that semantically similar questions pairs can be effectively found with the proposed similarity measures.

1076182	Mining translations of OOV terms from the web through cross-lingual query expansion Translating out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms is a great challenge for the Cross-lingual Information Retrieval and Data-driven Machine Translation systems. Several approaches have been proposed to mine translations for OOV terms from the web, especially from pages containing mixed languages. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically translate OOV terms on the fly through cross-lingual query expansion. The proposed approach does not require any web crawling and has achieved an inclusion rate of 95% and overall translation accuracy of 90%, outperforming state-of-the-art OOV translation techniques.
1148175	Learning user interaction models for predicting web search result preferences Evaluating user preferences of web search results is crucial for search engine development, deployment, and maintenance. We present a real-world study of modeling the behavior of web search users to predict web search result preferences. Accurate modeling and interpretation of user behavior has important applications to ranking, click spam detection, web search personalization, and other tasks. Our key insight to improving robustness of interpreting implicit feedback is to model query-dependent deviations from the expected "noisy" user behavior. We show that our model of clickthrough interpretation improves prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art clickthrough methods. We generalize our approach to model user behavior beyond clickthrough, which results in higher preference prediction accuracy than models based on clickthrough information alone. We report results of a large-scale experimental evaluation that show substantial improvements over published implicit feedback interpretation methods.
1148176	User performance versus precision measures for simple search tasks Several recent studies have demonstrated that the type of improvements in information retrieval system effectiveness reported in forums such as SIGIR and TREC do not translate into a benefit for users. Two of the studies used an instance recall task, and a third used a question answering task, so perhaps it is unsurprising that the precision based measures of IR system effectiveness on one-shot query evaluation do not correlate with user performance on these tasks. In this study, we evaluate two different information retrieval tasks on TREC Web-track data: a precision-based user task, measured by the length of time that users need to find a single document that is relevant to a TREC topic; and, a simple recall-based task, represented by the total number of relevant documents that users can identify within five minutes. Users employ search engines with controlled mean average precision (MAP) of between 55% and 95%. Our results show that there is no significant relationship between system effectiveness measured by MAP and the precision-based task. A significant, but weak relationship is present for the precision at one document returned metric. A weak relationship is present between MAP and the simple recall-based task.
1148177	Improving web search ranking by incorporating user behavior information We show that incorporating user behavior data can significantly improve ordering of top results in real web search setting. We examine alternatives for incorporating feedback into the ranking process and explore the contributions of user feedback compared to other common web search features. We report results of a large scale evaluation over 3,000 queries and 12 million user interactions with a popular web search engine. We show that incorporating implicit feedback can augment other features, improving the accuracy of a competitive web search ranking algorithms by as much as 31% relative to the original performance.
1148179	Contextual search and name disambiguation in email using graphs Similarity measures for text have historically been an important tool for solving information retrieval problems. In many interesting settings, however, documents are often closely connected to other documents, as well as other non-textual objects: for instance, email messages are connected to other messages via header information. In this paper we consider extended similarity metrics for documents and other objects embedded in graphs, facilitated via a lazy graph walk. We provide a detailed instantiation of this framework for email data, where content, social networks and a timeline are integrated in a structural graph. The suggested framework is evaluated for two email-related problems: disambiguating names in email documents, and threading. We show that reranking schemes based on the graph-walk similarity measures often outperform baseline methods, and that further improvements can be obtained by use of appropriate learning methods.
1148180	Thread detection in dynamic text message streams Text message stream is a newly emerging type of Web data which is produced in enormous quantities with the popularity of Instant Messaging and Internet Relay Chat. It is beneficial for detecting the threads contained in the text stream for various applications, including information retrieval, expert recognition and even crime prevention. Despite its importance, not much research has been conducted so far on this problem due to the characteristics of the data in which the messages are usually very short and incomplete. In this paper, we present a stringent definition of the thread detection task and our preliminary solution to it. We propose three variations of a single-pass clustering algorithm for exploiting the temporal information in the streams. An algorithm based on linguistic features is also put forward to exploit the discourse structure information. We conducted several experiments to compare our approaches with some existing algorithms on a real dataset. The results show that all three variations of the single-pass algorithm outperform the basic single-pass algorithm. Our proposed algorithm based on linguistic features improves the performance relatively by 69.5% and 9.7% when compared with the basic single-pass algorithm and the best variation algorithm in terms of F1 respectively.
1148181	Formal models for expert finding in enterprise corpora Searching an organization's document repositories for experts provides a cost effective solution for the task of expert finding. We present two general strategies to expert searching given a document collection which are formalized using generative probabilistic models. The first of these directly models an expert's knowledge based on the documents that they are associated with, whilst the second locates documents on topic, and then finds the associated expert. Forming reliable associations is crucial to the performance of expert finding systems. Consequently, in our evaluation we compare the different approaches, exploring a variety of associations along with other operational parameters (such as topicality). Using the TREC Enterprise corpora, we show that the second strategy consistently outperforms the first. A comparison against other unsupervised techniques, reveals that our second model delivers excellent performance.
1148183	Spoken document retrieval from call-center conversations We are interested in retrieving information from conversational speech corpora, such as call-center data. This data comprises spontaneous speech conversations with low recording quality, which makes automatic speech recognition (ASR) a highly difficult task. For typical call-center data, even state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems produce a transcript with word error rate of 30% or higher. In addition to the output transcript, advanced systems provide word confusion networks (WCNs), a compact representation of word lattices associating each word hypothesis with its posterior probability. Our work exploits the information provided by WCNs in order to improve retrieval performance. In this paper, we show that the mean average precision (MAP) is improved using WCNs compared to the raw word transcripts. Finally, we analyze the effect of increasing ASR word error rate on search effectiveness. We show that MAP is still reasonable even under extremely high error rate.
1148188	Respect my authority!: HITS without hyperlinks, utilizing cluster-based language models We present an approach to improving the precision of an initial document ranking wherein we utilize cluster information within a graph-based framework. The main idea is to perform reranking based on centrality within bipartite graphs of documents (on one side) and clusters (on the other side), on the premise that these are mutually reinforcing entities. Links between entities are created via consideration of language models induced from them.We find that our cluster-document graphs give rise to much better retrieval performance than previously proposed document-only graphs do. For example, authority-based reranking of documents via a HITS-style cluster-based approach outperforms a previously-proposed PageRank-inspired algorithm applied to solely-document graphs. Moreover, we also show that computing authority scores for clusters constitutes an effective method for identifying clusters containing a large percentage of relevant documents.
1148189	Topical link analysis for web search Traditional web link-based ranking schemes use a single score to measure a page's authority without concern of the community from which that authority is derived. As a result, a resource that is highly popular for one topic may dominate the results of another topic in which it is less authoritative. To address this problem, we suggest calculating a score vector for each page to distinguish the contribution from different topics, using a random walk model that probabilistically combines page topic distribution and link structure. We show how to incorporate the topical model within both PageRank and HITS without affecting the overall property and still render insight into topic-level transition. Experiments on multiple datasets indicate that our technique outperforms other ranking approaches that incorporate textual analysis.
1148191	The role of knowledge in conceptual retrieval: a study in the domain of clinical medicine Despite its intuitive appeal, the hypothesis that retrieval at the level of "concepts" should outperform purely term-based approaches remains unverified empirically. In addition, the use of "knowledge" has not consistently resulted in performance gains. After identifying possible reasons for previous negative results, we present a novel framework for "conceptual retrieval" that articulates the types of knowledge that are important for information seeking. We instantiate this general framework in the domain of clinical medicine based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Experiments show that an EBM-based scoring algorithm dramatically outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline that employs only term statistics. Ablation studies further yield a better understanding of the performance contributions of different components. Finally, we discuss how other domains can benefit from knowledge-based approaches.
1148192	A parallel derivation of probabilistic information retrieval models This paper investigates in a stringent athematical formalism the parallel derivation of three grand probabilistic retrieval models: binary independent retrieval (BIR), Poisson model (PM), and language modelling (LM).The investigation has been motivated by a number of questions. Firstly, though sharing the same origin, namely the probability of relevance, the models differ with respect to event spaces. How can this be captured in a consistent notation, and can we relate the event spaces? Secondly, BIR and PM are closely related, but how does LM fit in? Thirdly, how are tf-idf and probabilistic models related? .The parallel investigation of the models leads to a number of formalised results: BIR and PM assume the collection to be a set of non-relevant documents, whereas LM assumes the collection to be a set of terms from relevant documents. PM can be viewed as a bridge connecting BIR and LM. A BIR-LM equivalence explains BIR as a special LM case. PM explains tf-idf, and both, BIR and LM probabilities express tf-idf in a dual way. .
1148193	Semantic term matching in axiomatic approaches to information retrieval A common limitation of many retrieval models, including the recently proposed axiomatic approaches, is that retrieval scores are solely based on exact (i.e., syntactic) matching of terms in the queries and documents, without allowing distinct but semantically related terms to match each other and contribute to the retrieval score. In this paper, we show that semantic term matching can be naturally incorporated into the axiomatic retrieval model through defining the primitive weighting function based on a semantic similarity function of terms. We define several desirable retrieval constraints for semantic term matching and use such constraints to extend the axiomatic model to directly support semantic term matching based on the mutual information of terms computed on some document set. We show that such extension can be efficiently implemented as query expansion. Experiment results on several representative data sets show that, with mutual information computed over the documents in either the target collection for retrieval or an external collection such as the Web, our semantic expansion consistently and substantially improves retrieval accuracy over the baseline axiomatic retrieval model. As a pseudo feedback method, our method also outperforms a state-of-the-art language modeling feedback method.
1148195	On-line spam filter fusion We show that a set of independently developed spam filters may be combined in simple ways to provide substantially better filtering than any of the individual filters. The results of fifty-three spam filters evaluated at the TREC 2005 Spam Track were combined post-hoc so as to simulate the parallel on-line operation of the filters. The combined results were evaluated using the TREC methodology, yielding more than a factor of two improvement over the best filter. The simplest method -- averaging the binary classifications returned by the individual filters -- yields a remarkably good result. A new method -- averaging log-odds estimates based on the scores returned by the individual filters -- yields a somewhat better result, and provides input to SVM- and logistic-regression-based stacking methods. The stacking methods appear to provide further improvement, but only for very large corpora. Of the stacking methods, logistic regression yields the better result. Finally, we show that it is possible to select a priori small subsets of the filters that, when combined, still outperform the best individual filter by a substantial margin.
1148196	Building bridges for web query classification Web query classification (QC) aims to classify Web users' queries, which are often short and ambiguous, into a set of target categories. QC has many applications including page ranking in Web search, targeted advertisement in response to queries, and personalization. In this paper, we present a novel approach for QC that outperforms the winning solution of the ACM KDDCUP 2005 competition, whose objective is to classify 800,000 real user queries. In our approach, we first build a bridging classifier on an intermediate taxonomy in an offline mode. This classifier is then used in an online mode to map user queries to the target categories via the above intermediate taxonomy. A major innovation is that by leveraging the similarity distribution over the intermediate taxonomy, we do not need to retrain a new classifier for each new set of target categories, and therefore the bridging classifier needs to be trained only once. In addition, we introduce category selection as a new method for narrowing down the scope of the intermediate taxonomy based on which we classify the queries. Category selection can improve both efficiency and effectiveness of the online classification. By combining our algorithm with the winning solution of KDDCUP 2005, we made an improvement by 9.7% and 3.8% in terms of precision and F1 respectively compared with the best results of KDDCUP 2005.
1148197	ProbFuse: a probabilistic approach to data fusion Data fusion is the combination of the results of independent searches on a document collection into one single output result set. It has been shown in the past that this can greatly improve retrieval effectiveness over that of the individual results.This paper presents probFuse , a probabilistic approach to data fusion. ProbFuse assumes that the performance of the individual input systems on a number of training queries is indicative of their future performance. The fused result set is based on probabilities of relevance calculated during this training process. Retrieval experiments using data from the TREC ad hoc collection demonstrate that probFuse achieves results superior to that of the popular CombMNZ fusion algorithm.
1148200	Improving the estimation of relevance models using large external corpora Information retrieval algorithms leverage various collection statistics to improve performance. Because these statistics are often computed on a relatively small evaluation corpus, we believe using larger, non-evaluation corpora should improve performance. Specifically, we advocate incorporating external corpora based on language modeling. We refer to this process as external expansion . When compared to traditional pseudo-relevance feedback techniques, external expansion is more stable across topics and up to 10% more effective in terms of mean average precision. Our results show that using a high quality corpus that is comparable to the evaluation corpus can be as, if not more, effective than using the web. Our results also show that external expansion outperforms simulated relevance feedback. In addition, we propose a method for predicting the extent to which external expansion will improve retrieval performance. Our new measure demonstrates positive correlation with improvements in mean average precision.
1148201	Regularized estimation of mixture models for robust pseudo-relevance feedback Pseudo-relevance feedback has proven to be an effective strategy for improving retrieval accuracy in all retrieval models. However the performance of existing pseudo feedback methods is often affected significantly by some parameters, such as the number of feedback documents to use and the relative weight of original query terms; these parameters generally have to be set by trial-and-error without any guidance. In this paper, we present a more robust method for pseudo feedback based on statistical language models. Our main idea is to integrate the original query with feedback documents in a single probabilistic mixture model and regularize the estimation of the language model parameters in the model so that the information in the feedback documents can be gradually added to the original query. Unlike most existing feedback methods, our new method has no parameter to tune. Experiment results on two representative data sets show that the new method is significantly more robust than a state-of-the-art baseline language modeling approach for feedback with comparable or better retrieval accuracy.
1148204	LDA-based document models for ad-hoc retrieval Search algorithms incorporating some form of topic model have a long history in information retrieval. For example, cluster-based retrieval has been studied since the 60s and has recently produced good results in the language model framework. An approach to building topic models based on a formal generative model of documents, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is heavily cited in the machine learning literature, but its feasibility and effectiveness in information retrieval is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study how to efficiently use LDA to improve ad-hoc retrieval. We propose an LDA-based document model within the language modeling framework, and evaluate it on several TREC collections. Gibbs sampling is employed to conduct approximate inference in LDA and the computational complexity is analyzed. We show that improvements over retrieval using cluster-based models can be obtained with reasonable efficiency.
1148205	Adapting ranking SVM to document retrieval The paper is concerned with applying learning to rank to document retrieval. Ranking SVM is a typical method of learning to rank. We point out that there are two factors one must consider when applying Ranking SVM, in general a "learning to rank" method, to document retrieval. First, correctly ranking documents on the top of the result list is crucial for an Information Retrieval system. One must conduct training in a way that such ranked results are accurate. Second, the number of relevant documents can vary from query to query. One must avoid training a model biased toward queries with a large number of relevant documents. Previously, when existing methods that include Ranking SVM were applied to document retrieval, none of the two factors was taken into consideration. We show it is possible to make modifications in conventional Ranking SVM, so it can be better used for document retrieval. Specifically, we modify the "Hinge Loss" function in Ranking SVM to deal with the problems described above. We employ two methods to conduct optimization on the loss function: gradient descent and quadratic programming. Experimental results show that our method, referred to as Ranking SVM for IR, can outperform the conventional Ranking SVM and other existing methods for document retrieval on two datasets.
1148207	A study of statistical models for query translation: finding a good unit of translation This paper presents a study of three statistical query translation models that use different units of translation. We begin with a review of a word-based translation model that uses co-occurrence statistics for resolving translation ambiguities. The translation selection problem is then formulated under the framework of graphic model resorting to which the modeling assumptions and limitations of the co-occurrence model are discussed, and the research of finding better translation units is motivated. Then, two other models that use larger, linguistically motivated translation units (i.e., noun phrase and dependency triple) are presented. For each model, the modeling and training methods are described in detail. All query translation models are evaluated using TREC collections. Results show that larger translation units lead to more specific models that usually achieve better translation and cross-language information retrieval results.
1148208	Combining bidirectional translation and synonymy for cross-language information retrieval This paper introduces a general framework for the use of translation probabilities in cross-language information retrieval based on the notion that information retrieval fundamentally requires matching what the searcher means with what the author of a document meant. That perspective yields a computational formulation that provides a natural way of combining what have been known as query and document translation. Two well-recognized techniques are shown to be a special case of this model under restrictive assumptions. Cross-language search results are reported that are statistically indistinguishable from strong monolingual baselines for both French and Chinese documents.
1148211	Answering complex questions with random walk models We present a novel framework for answering complex questions that relies on question decomposition. Complex questions are decomposed by a procedure that operates on a Markov chain, by following a random walk on a bipartite graph of relations established between concepts related to the topic of a complex question and subquestions derived from topic-relevant passages that manifest these relations. Decomposed questions discovered during this random walk are then submitted to a state-of-the-art Question Answering (Q/A) system in order to retrieve a set of passages that can later be merged into a comprehensive answer by a Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) system. In our evaluations, we show that access to the decompositions generated using this method can significantly enhance the relevance and comprehensiveness of summary-length answers to complex questions.
1148212	A framework to predict the quality of answers with non-textual features New types of document collections are being developed by various web services. The service providers keep track of non-textual features such as click counts. In this paper, we present a framework to use non-textual features to predict the quality of documents. We also show our quality measure can be successfully incorporated into the language modeling-based retrieval model. We test our approach on a collection of question and answer pairs gathered from a community based question answering service where people ask and answer questions. Experimental results using our quality measure show a significant improvement over our baseline.
1148214	Latent semantic analysis for multiple-type interrelated data objects Co-occurrence data is quite common in many real applications. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) has been successfully used to identify semantic relations in such data. However, LSA can only handle a single co-occurrence relationship between two types of objects. In practical applications, there are many cases where multiple types of objects exist and any pair of these objects could have a pairwise co-occurrence relation. All these co-occurrence relations can be exploited to alleviate data sparseness or to represent objects more meaningfully. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, M-LSA , which conducts latent semantic analysis by incorporating all pairwise co-occurrences among multiple types of objects. Based on the mutual reinforcement principle, M-LSA identifies the most salient concepts among the co-occurrence data and represents all the objects in a unified semantic space. M-LSA is general and we show that several variants of LSA are special cases of our algorithm. Experiment results show that M-LSA outperforms LSA on multiple applications, including collaborative filtering, text clustering, and text categorization.
1148215	Identifying comparative sentences in text documents This paper studies the problem of identifying comparative sentences in text documents. The problem is related to but quite different from sentiment/opinion sentence identification or classification. Sentiment classification studies the problem of classifying a document or a sentence based on the subjective opinion of the author. An important application area of sentiment/opinion identification is business intelligence as a product manufacturer always wants to know consumers' opinions on its products. Comparisons on the other hand can be subjective or objective. Furthermore, a comparison is not concerned with an object in isolation. Instead, it compares the object with others. An example opinion sentence is "the sound quality of CD player X is poor" . An example comparative sentence is "the sound quality of CD player X is not as good as that of CD player Y" . Clearly, these two sentences give different information. Their language constructs are quite different too. Identifying comparative sentences is also useful in practice because direct comparisons are perhaps one of the most convincing ways of evaluation, which may even be more important than opinions on each individual object. This paper proposes to study the comparative sentence identification problem. It first categorizes comparative sentences into different types, and then presents a novel integrated pattern discovery and supervised learning approach to identifying comparative sentences from text documents. Experiment results using three types of documents, news articles, consumer reviews of products, and Internet forum postings, show a precision of 79% and recall of 81%. More detailed results are given in the paper.
1148216	Tackling concept drift by temporal inductive transfer Machine learning is the mainstay for text classification. However, even the most successful techniques are defeated by many real-world applications that have a strong time-varying component. To advance research on this challenging but important problem, we promote a natural, experimental framework-the Daily Classification Task-which can be applied to large time-based datasets, such as Reuters RCV1.In this paper we dissect concept drift into three main subtypes. We demonstrate via a novel visualization that the recurrent themes subtype is present in RCV1. This understanding led us to develop a new learning model that transfers induced knowledge through time to benefit future classifier learning tasks. The method avoids two main problems with existing work in inductive transfer: scalability and the risk of negative transfer. In empirical tests, it consistently showed more than 10 points F-measure improvement for each of four Reuters categories tested.
1148218	Evaluation in (XML) information retrieval: expected precision-recall with user modelling (EPRUM) Standard Information Retrieval (IR) metrics assume a simple model where documents are understood as independent units. Such an assumption is not adapted to new paradigms like XML or Web IR where retrievable informations are parts of documents or sets of related documents. Moreover, classical hypotheses assumes that the user ignores the structural or logical context of document elements and hence the possibility of navigation between units. EPRUM is a generalisation of Precision-Recall (PR) that aims at allowing the user to navigate or browse in the corpus structure. Like the Cumulated Gain metrics, it is able to handle continuous valued relevance. We apply and compare EPRUM in the context of XML Retrieval -- a very active field for evaluation metrics. We also explain how EPRUM can be used in other IR paradigms.
1148219	Minimal test collections for retrieval evaluation Accurate estimation of information retrieval evaluation metrics such as average precision require large sets of relevance judgments. Building sets large enough for evaluation of real-world implementations is at best inefficient, at worst infeasible. In this work we link evaluation with test collection construction to gain an understanding of the minimal judging effort that must be done to have high confidence in the outcome of an evaluation. A new way of looking at average precision leads to a natural algorithm for selecting documents to judge and allows us to estimate the degree of confidence by defining a distribution over possible document judgments. A study with annotators shows that this method can be used by a small group of researchers to rank a set of systems in under three hours with 95% confidence. Information retrieval metrics such as average precision require large sets of relevance judgments to be accurately estimated. Building these sets is infeasible and often inefficient for many real-world retrieval implementations. We present a new way of looking at average precision that allows us to estimate the confidence in an evaluation based on the size of the test collection. We use this to build an algorithm for selecting the best documents to judge to have maximum confidence in an evaluation with a minimal number of relevance judgments. A study with annotators shows how the algorithm can be used by a small group of researchers to quickly rank a set of systems with 95% confidence.
1148222	Finding near-duplicate web pages: a large-scale evaluation of algorithms Broder et al.'s [3] shingling algorithm and Charikar's [4] random projection based approach are considered "state-of-the-art" algorithms for finding near-duplicate web pages. Both algorithms were either developed at or used by popular web search engines. We compare the two algorithms on a very large scale, namely on a set of 1.6B distinct web pages. The results show that neither of the algorithms works well for finding near-duplicate pairs on the same site , while both achieve high precision for near-duplicate pairs on different sites . Since Charikar's algorithm finds more near-duplicate pairs on different sites, it achieves a better precision overall, namely 0.50 versus 0.38 for Broder et al.'s algorithm. We present a combined algorithm which achieves precision 0.79 with 79% of the recall of the other algorithms.
1148223	Structure-driven crawler generation by example Many Web IR and Digital Library applications require a crawling process to collect pages with the ultimate goal of taking advantage of useful information available on Web sites. For some of these applications the criteria to determine when a page is to be present in a collection are related to the page content. However, there are situations in which the inner structure of the pages provides a better criteria to guide the crawling process than their content. In this paper, we present a structure-driven approach for generating Web crawlers that requires a minimum effort from users. The idea is to take as input a sample page and an entry point to a Web site and generate a structure-driven crawler based on navigation patterns , sequences of patterns for the links a crawler has to follow to reach the pages structurally similar to the sample page. In the experiments we have carried out, structure-driven crawlers generated by our new approach were able to collect all pages that match the samples given, including those pages added after their generation.
1148224	Building implicit links from content for forum search The objective of Web forums is to create a shared space for open communications and discussions of specific topics and issues. The tremendous information behind forum sites is not fully-utilized yet. Most links between forum pages are automatically created, which means the link-based ranking algorithm cannot be applied efficiently. In this paper, we proposed a novel ranking algorithm which tries to introduce the content information into link-based methods as implicit links. The basic idea is derived from the more focused random surfer: the surfer may more likely jump to a page which is similar to what he is reading currently. In this manner, we are allowed to introduce the content similarities into the link graph as a personalization bias. Our method, named Fine-grained Rank (FGRank), can be efficiently computed based on an automatically generated topic hierarchy. Not like the topic-sensitive PageRank, our method only need to compute single PageRank score for each page. Another contribution of this paper is to present a very efficient algorithm for automatically generating topic hierarchy and map each page in a large-scale collection onto the computed hierarchy. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve retrieval performance, and reveal that content-based link graph is also important compared with the hyper-link graph.
1148225	Generalizing PageRank: damping functions for link-based ranking algorithms This paper introduces a family of link-based ranking algorithms that propagate page importance through links. In these algorithms there is a damping function that decreases with distance, so a direct link implies more endorsement than a link through a long path. PageRank is the most widely known ranking function of this family.The main objective of this paper is to determine whether this family of ranking techniques has some interest per se , and how different choices for the damping function impact on rank quality and on convergence speed. Even though our results suggest that PageRank can be approximated with other simpler forms of rankings that may be computed more efficiently, our focus is of more speculative nature, in that it aims at separating the kernel of PageRank, that is, link-based importance propagation, from the way propagation decays over paths.We focus on three damping functions, having linear, exponential, and hyperbolic decay on the lengths of the paths. The exponential decay corresponds to PageRank, and the other functions are new. Our presentation includes algorithms, analysis, comparisons and experiments that study their behavior under different parameters in real Web graph data.Among other results, we show how to calculate a linear approximation that induces a page ordering that is almost identical to PageRank's using a fixed small number of iterations; comparisons were performed using Kendall's ? on large domain datasets.
1148227	Capturing collection size for distributed non-cooperative retrieval Modern distributed information retrieval techniques require accurate knowledge of collection size. In non-cooperative environments, where detailed collection statistics are not available, the size of the underlying collections must be estimated. While several approaches for the estimation of collection size have been proposed, their accuracy has not been thoroughly evaluated. An empirical analysis of past estimation approaches across a variety of collections demonstrates that their prediction accuracy is low. Motivated by ecological techniques for the estimation of animal populations, we propose two new approaches for the estimation of collection size. We show that our approaches are significantly more accurate that previous methods, and are more efficient in use of resources required to perform the estimation.
1148228	Probabilistic latent query analysis for combining multiple retrieval sources Combining the output from multiple retrieval sources over the same document collection is of great importance to a number of retrieval tasks such as multimedia retrieval, web retrieval and meta-search. To merge retrieval sources adaptively according to query topics, we propose a series of new approaches called probabilistic latent query analysis (pLQA), which can associate non-identical combination weights with latent classes underlying the query space. Compared with previous query independent and query-class based combination methods, the proposed approaches have the advantage of being able to discover latent query classes automatically without using prior human knowledge, to assign one query to a mixture of query classes, and to determine the number of query classes under a model selection principle. Experimental results on two retrieval tasks, i.e., multimedia retrieval and meta-search, demonstrate that the proposed methods can uncover sensible latent classes from training data, and can achieve considerable performance gains.
1148229	User modeling for full-text federated search in peer-to-peer networks User modeling for information retrieval has mostly been studied to improve the effectiveness of information access in centralized repositories. In this paper we explore user modeling in the context of full-text federated search in peer-to-peer networks. Our approach models a user's persistent, long-term interests based on past queries, and uses the model to improve search efficiency for future queries that represent interests similar to past queries. Our approach also enables queries representing a user's transient, ad-hoc interests to be automatically recognized so that search for these queries can rely on a relatively large search radius to avoid sacrificing effectiveness for efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the efficiency of full-text federated search without degrading its accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed approach does not require a large amount of training data, and is robust to a range of parameter values.
1148232	Load balancing for term-distributed parallel retrieval Large-scale web and text retrieval systems deal with amounts of data that greatly exceed the capacity of any single machine. To handle the necessary data volumes and query throughput rates, parallel systems are used, in which the document and index data are split across tightly-clustered distributed computing systems. The index data can be distributed either by document or by term. In this paper we examine methods for load balancing in term-distributed parallel architectures, and propose a suite of techniques for reducing net querying costs. In combination, the techniques we describe allow a 30% improvement in query throughput when tested on an eight-node parallel computer system.
1148233	Hybrid index maintenance for growing text collections We present a new family of hybrid index maintenance strategies to be used in on-line index construction for monotonically growing text collections. These new strategies improve upon recent results for hybrid index maintenance in dynamic text retrieval systems. Like previous techniques, our new method distinguishes between short and long posting lists: While short lists are maintained using a merge strategy, long lists are kept separate and are updated in-place. This way, costly relocations of long posting lists are avoided.We discuss the shortcomings of previous hybrid methods and give an experimental evaluation of the new technique, showing that its index maintenance performance is superior to that of the earlier methods, especially when the amount of main memory available to the indexing system is small. We also present a complexity analysis which proves that, under a Zipfian term distribution, the asymptotical number of disk accesses performed by the best hybrid maintenance strategy is linear in the size of the text collection, implying the asymptotical optimality of the proposed strategy.
1148234	Type less, find more: fast autocompletion search with a succinct index We consider the following full-text search autocompletion feature. Imagine a user of a search engine typing a query. Then with every letter being typed, we would like an instant display of completions of the last query word which would lead to good hits. At the same time, the best hits for any of these completions should be displayed. Known indexing data structures that apply to this problem either incur large processing times for a substantial class of queries, or they use a lot of space. We present a new indexing data structure that uses no more space than a state-of-the-art compressed inverted index, but with 10 times faster query processing times. Even on the large TREC Terabyte collection, which comprises over 25 million documents, we achieve, on a single machine and with the index on disk, average response times of one tenth of a second. We have built a full-fledged, interactive search engine that realizes the proposed autocompletion feature combined with support for proximity search, semi-structured (XML) text, subword and phrase completion, and semantic tags.
1148235	Pruned query evaluation using pre-computed impacts Exhaustive evaluation of ranked queries can be expensive, particularly when only a small subset of the overall ranking is required, or when queries contain common terms. This concern gives rise to techniques for dynamic query pruning, that is, methods for eliminating redundant parts of the usual exhaustive evaluation, yet still generating a demonstrably "good enough" set of answers to the query. In this work we propose new pruning methods that make use of impact-sorted indexes. Compared to exhaustive evaluation, the new methods reduce the amount of computation performed, reduce the amount of memory required for accumulators, reduce the amount of data transferred from disk, and at the same time allow performance guarantees in terms of precision and mean average precision. These strong claims are backed by experiments using the TREC Terabyte collection and queries.
1148237	Mining dependency relations for query expansion in passage retrieval Classical query expansion techniques such as the local context analysis (LCA) make use of term co-occurrence statistics to incorporate additional contextual terms for enhancing passage retrieval. However, relevant contextual terms do not always co-occur frequently with the query terms and vice versa. Hence the use of such methods often brings in noise, which leads to reduced precision. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of relationship analysis for natural language queries in passage retrieval. However, they found that without query expansion, the performance is not satisfactory for short queries. In this paper, we present two novel query expansion techniques that make use of dependency relation analysis to extract contextual terms and relations from external corpuses. The techniques are used to enhance the performance of density based and relation based passage retrieval frameworks respectively. We compare the performance of the resulting systems with LCA in a density based passage retrieval system (DBS) and a relation based system without any query expansion (RBS) using the factoid questions from the TREC-12 QA task. The results show that in terms of MRR scores, our relation based term expansion method with DBS outperforms the LCA by 9.81%, while our relation expansion method outperforms RBS by 17.49%.
1148238	What makes a query difficult? This work tries to answer the question of what makes a query difficult. It addresses a novel model that captures the main components of a topic and the relationship between those components and topic difficulty. The three components of a topic are the textual expression describing the information need (the query or queries), the set of documents relevant to the topic (the Qrels), and the entire collection of documents. We show experimentally that topic difficulty strongly depends on the distances between these components. In the absence of knowledge about one of the model components, the model is still useful by approximating the missing component based on the other components. We demonstrate the applicability of the difficulty model for several uses such as predicting query difficulty, predicting the number of topic aspects expected to be covered by the search results, and analyzing the findability of a specific domain.
1148239	On ranking the effectiveness of searches There is a growing interest in estimating the effectiveness of search. Two approaches are typically considered: examining the search queries and examining the retrieved document sets. In this paper, we take the latter approach. We use four measures to characterize the retrieved document sets and estimate the quality of search. These measures are (i) the clustering tendency as measured by the Cox-Lewis statistic, (ii) the sensitivity to document perturbation, (iii) the sensitivity to query perturbation and (iv) the local intrinsic dimensionality. We present experimental results for the task of ranking 200 queries according to the search effectiveness over the TREC (discs 4 and 5) dataset. Our ranking of queries is compared with the ranking based on the average precision using the Kendall t statistic. The best individual estimator is the sensitivity to document perturbation and yields Kendall t of 0.521. When combined with the clustering tendency based on the Cox-Lewis statistic and the query perturbation measure, it results in Kendall t of 0.562 which to our knowledge is the highest correlation with the average precision reported to date.
1148241	Document clustering with prior knowledge Document clustering is an important tool for text analysis and is used in many different applications. We propose to incorporate prior knowledge of cluster membership for document cluster analysis and develop a novel semi-supervised document clustering model. The method models a set of documents with weighted graph in which each document is represented as a vertex, and each edge connecting a pair of vertices is weighted with the similarity value of the two corresponding documents. The prior knowledge indicates pairs of documents that known to belong to the same cluster. Then, the prior knowledge is transformed into a set of constraints. The document clustering task is accomplished by finding the best cuts of the graph under the constraints. We apply the model to the Normalized Cut method to demonstrate the idea and concept. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed document clustering model reveals remarkable performance improvements with very limited training samples, and hence is a very effective semi-supervised classification tool.
1148242	Text clustering with extended user feedback Text clustering is most commonly treated as a fully automated task without user feedback. However, a variety of researchers have explored mixed-initiative clustering methods which allow a user to interact with and advise the clustering algorithm. This mixed-initiative approach is especially attractive for text clustering tasks where the user is trying to organize a corpus of documents into clusters for some particular purpose (e.g., clustering their email into folders that reflect various activities in which they are involved). This paper introduces a new approach to mixed-initiative clustering that handles several natural types of user feedback. We first introduce a new probabilistic generative model for text clustering (the SpeClustering model) and show that it outperforms the commonly used mixture of multinomials clustering model, even when used in fully autonomous mode with no user input. We then describe how to incorporate four distinct types of user feedback into the clustering algorithm, and provide experimental evidence showing substantial improvements in text clustering when this user feedback is incorporated.
1148243	Near-duplicate detection by instance-level constrained clustering For the task of near-duplicated document detection, both traditional fingerprinting techniques used in database community and bag-of-word comparison approaches used in information retrieval community are not sufficiently accurate. This is due to the fact that the characteristics of near-duplicated documents are different from that of both "almost-identical" documents in the data cleaning task and "relevant" documents in the search task. This paper presents an instance-level constrained clustering approach for near-duplicate detection. The framework incorporates information such as document attributes and content structure into the clustering process to form near-duplicate clusters. Gathered from several collections of public comments sent to U.S. government agencies on proposed new regulations, the experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other near-duplicate detection algorithms and as about as effective as human assessors.
1148245	Less is more: probabilistic models for retrieving fewer relevant documents Traditionally, information retrieval systems aim to maximize the number of relevant documents returned to a user within some window of the top. For that goal, the probability ranking principle, which ranks documents in decreasing order of probability of relevance, is provably optimal. However, there are many scenarios in which that ranking does not optimize for the users information need. One example is when the user would be satisfied with some limited number of relevant documents, rather than needing all relevant documents. We show that in such a scenario, an attempt to return many relevant documents can actually reduce the chances of finding any relevant documents. We consider a number of information retrieval metrics from the literature, including the rank of the first relevant result, the %no metric that penalizes a system only for retrieving no relevant results near the top, and the diversity of retrieved results when queries have multiple interpretations. We observe that given a probabilistic model of relevance, it is appropriate to rank so as to directly optimize these metrics in expectation. While doing so may be computationally intractable, we show that a simple greedy optimization algorithm that approximately optimizes the given objectives produces rankings for TREC queries that outperform the standard approach based on the probability ranking principle.
1148246	High accuracy retrieval with multiple nested ranker High precision at the top ranks has become a new focus of research in information retrieval. This paper presents the multiple nested ranker approach that improves the accuracy at the top ranks by iteratively re-ranking the top scoring documents. At each iteration, this approach uses the RankNet learning algorithm to re-rank a subset of the results. This splits the problem into smaller and easier tasks and generates a new distribution of the results to be learned by the algorithm. We evaluate this approach using different settings on a data set labeled with several degrees of relevance. We use the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) to measure the performance because it depends not only on the position but also on the relevance score of the document in the ranked list. Our experiments show that making the learning algorithm concentrate on the top scoring results improves precision at the top ten documents in terms of the NDCG score.
1148247	Semantic search via XML fragments: a high-precision approach to IR In some IR applications, it is desirable to adopt a high precision search strategy to return a small set of documents that are highly focused and relevant to the user's information need. With these applications in mind, we investigate semantic search using the XML Fragments query language on text corpora automatically pre-processed to encode semantic information useful for retrieval. We identify three XML Fragment operations that can be applied to a query to conceptualize , restrict , or relate terms in the query. We demonstrate how these operations can be used to address four different query-time semantic needs: to specify target information type , to disambiguate keywords , to specify search term context , or to relate select terms in the query. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our semantic search technology through a series of experiments using the two applications in which we embed this technology and show that it yields significant improvement in precision in the search results.
1148249	Elicitation of term relevance feedback: an investigation of term source and context Term relevance feedback has had a long history in information retrieval. However, research on interactive term relevance feedback has yielded mixed results. In this paper, we investigate several aspects related to the elicitation of term relevance feedback: the display of document surrogates, the technique for identifying or selecting terms, and sources of expansion terms. We conduct a between subjects experiment (n=61) of three term relevance feedback interfaces using the 2005 TREC HARD collection, and evaluate each interface with respect to query length and retrieval performance. Results demonstrate that queries created with each experimental interface significantly outperformed corresponding baseline queries, even though there were no differences in performance between interface conditions. Results also demonstrate that pseudo-relevance feedback runs outperformed both baseline and experimental runs as assessed by recall-oriented measures, but that user-generated terms improved precision.
1148250	Find-similar: similarity browsing as a search tool Search systems have for some time provided users with the ability to request documents similar to a given document. Interfaces provide this feature via a link or button for each document in the search results. We call this feature find-similar or similarity browsing . We examined find-similar as a search tool, like relevance feedback, for improving retrieval performance. Our investigation focused on find-similar's document-to-document similarity, the reexamination of documents during a search, and the user's browsing pattern. Find-similar with a query-biased similarity, avoiding the reexamination of documents, and a breadth-like browsing pattern achieved a 23% increase in the arithmetic mean average precision and a 66% increase in the geometric mean average precision over our baseline retrieval. This performance matched that of a more traditionally styled iterative relevance feedback technique.
1148253	Large scale semi-supervised linear SVMs Large scale learning is often realistic only in a semi-supervised setting where a small set of labeled examples is available together with a large collection of unlabeled data. In many information retrieval and data mining applications, linear classifiers are strongly preferred because of their ease of implementation, interpretability and empirical performance. In this work, we present a family of semi-supervised linear support vector classifiers that are designed to handle partially-labeled sparse datasets with possibly very large number of examples and features. At their core, our algorithms employ recently developed modified finite Newton techniques. Our contributions in this paper are as follows: (a) We provide an implementation of Transductive SVM (TSVM) that is significantly more efficient and scalable than currently used dual techniques, for linear classification problems involving large, sparse datasets. (b) We propose a variant of TSVM that involves multiple switching of labels. Experimental results show that this variant provides an order of magnitude further improvement in training efficiency. (c) We present a new algorithm for semi-supervised learning based on a Deterministic Annealing (DA) approach. This algorithm alleviates the problem of local minimum in the TSVM optimization procedure while also being computationally attractive. We conduct an empirical study on several document classification tasks which confirms the value of our methods in large scale semi-supervised settings.
1148254	Graph-based text classification: learn from your neighbors Automatic classification of data items, based on training samples, can be boosted by considering the neighborhood of data items in a graph structure (e.g., neighboring documents in a hyperlink environment or co-authors and their publications for bibliographic data entries). This paper presents a new method for graph-based classification, with particular emphasis on hyperlinked text documents but broader applicability. Our approach is based on iterative relaxation labeling and can be combined with either Bayesian or SVM classifiers on the feature spaces of the given data items. The graph neighborhood is taken into consideration to exploit locality patterns while at the same time avoiding overfitting. In contrast to prior work along these lines, our approach employs a number of novel techniques: dynamically inferring the link/class pattern in the graph in the run of the iterative relaxation labeling, judicious pruning of edges from the neighborhood graph based on node dissimilarities and node degrees, weighting the influence of edges based on a distance metric between the classification labels of interest and weighting edges by content similarity measures. Our techniques considerably improve the robustness and accuracy of the classification outcome, as shown in systematic experimental comparisons with previously published methods on three different real-world datasets.
1148255	Constructing informative prior distributions from domain knowledge in text classification Supervised learning approaches to text classification are in practice often required to work with small and unsystematically collected training sets. The alternative to supervised learning is usually viewed to be building classifiers by hand, using a domain expert's understanding of which features of the text are related to the class of interest. This is expensive, requires a degree of sophistication about linguistics and classification, and makes it difficult to use combinations of weak predictors. We propose instead combining domain knowledge with training examples in a Bayesian framework. Domain knowledge is used to specify a prior distribution for the parameters of a logistic regression model, and labeled training data is used to produce a posterior distribution, whose mode we take as the final classifier. We show on three text categorization data sets that this approach can rescue what would otherwise be disastrously bad training situations, producing much more effective classifiers.
1148257	Unifying user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches by similarity fusion Memory-based methods for collaborative filtering predict new ratings by averaging (weighted) ratings between, respectively, pairs of similar users or items. In practice, a large number of ratings from similar users or similar items are not available, due to the sparsity inherent to rating data. Consequently, prediction quality can be poor. This paper re-formulates the memory-based collaborative filtering problem in a generative probabilistic framework, treating individual user-item ratings as predictors of missing ratings. The final rating is estimated by fusing predictions from three sources: predictions based on ratings of the same item by other users, predictions based on different item ratings made by the same user, and, third, ratings predicted based on data from other but similar users rating other but similar items. Existing user-based and item-based approaches correspond to the two simple cases of our framework. The complete model is however more robust to data sparsity, because the different types of ratings are used in concert, while additional ratings from similar users towards similar items are employed as a background model to smooth the predictions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are indeed more robust against data sparsity and give better recommendations.
1148258	Personalized recommendation driven by information flow We propose that the information access behavior of a group of people can be modeled as an information flow issue, in which people intentionally or unintentionally influence and inspire each other, thus creating an interest in retrieving or getting a specific kind of information or product. Information flow models how information is propagated in a social network. It can be a real social network where interactions between people reside; it can be, moreover, a virtual social network in that people only influence each other unintentionally, for instance, through collaborative filtering. We leverage users' access patterns to model information flow and generate effective personalized recommendations. First, an early adoption based information flow (EABIF) network describes the influential relationships between people. Second, based on the fact that adoption is typically category specific, we propose a topic-sensitive EABIF (TEABIF) network, in which access patterns are clustered with respect to the categories. Once an item has been accessed by early adopters, personalized recommendations are achieved by estimating whom the information will be propagated to with high probabilities. In our experiments with an online document recommendation system, the results demonstrate that the EABIF and the TEABIF can respectively achieve an improved (precision, recall) of (91.0%, 87.1%) and (108.5%, 112.8%) compared to traditional collaborative filtering, given an early adopter exists.
1148261	Evaluating evaluation metrics based on the bootstrap This paper describes how the Bootstrap approach to statistics can be applied to the evaluation of IR effectiveness metrics. First, we argue that Bootstrap Hypothesis Tests deserve more attention from the IR community, as they are based on fewer assumptions than traditional statistical significance tests. We then describe straightforward methods for comparing the sensitivity of IR metrics based on Bootstrap Hypothesis Tests. Unlike the heuristics-based "swap" method proposed by Voorhees and Buckley, our method estimates the performance difference required to achieve a given significance level directly from Bootstrap Hypothesis Test results. In addition, we describe a simple way of examining the accuracy of rank correlation between two metrics based on the Bootstrap Estimate of Standard Error. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods using test collections and runs from the NTCIR CLIR track for comparing seven IR metrics, including those that can handle graded relevance and those based on the Geometric Mean.
1148262	Statistical precision of information retrieval evaluation We introduce and validate bootstrap techniques to compute confidence intervals that quantify the effect of test-collection variability on average precision (AP) and mean average precision (MAP) IR effectiveness measures. We consider the test collection in IR evaluation to be a representative of a population of materially similar collections, whose documents are drawn from an infinite pool with similar characteristics. Our model accurately predicts the degree of concordance between system results on randomly selected halves of the TREC-6 ad hoc corpus. We advance a framework for statistical evaluation that uses the same general framework to model other sources of chance variation as a source of input for meta-analysis techniques.
1148263	A statistical method for system evaluation using incomplete judgments We consider the problem of large-scale retrieval evaluation, and we propose a statistical method for evaluating retrieval systems using incomplete judgments. Unlike existing techniques that (1) rely on effectively complete, and thus prohibitively expensive, relevance judgment sets, (2) produce biased estimates of standard performance measures, or (3) produce estimates of non-standard measures thought to be correlated with these standard measures, our proposed statistical technique produces unbiased estimates of the standard measures themselves.Our proposed technique is based on random sampling. While our estimates are unbiased by statistical design, their variance is dependent on the sampling distribution employed; as such, we derive a sampling distribution likely to yield low variance estimates. We test our proposed technique using benchmark TREC data, demonstrating that a sampling pool derived from a set of runs can be used to efficiently and effectively evaluate those runs. We further show that these sampling pools generalize well to unseen runs. Our experiments indicate that highly accurate estimates of standard performance measures can be obtained using a number of relevance judgments as small as 4% of the typical TREC-style judgment pool.
1148265	Learning to advertise Content-targeted advertising, the task of automatically associating ads to a Web page, constitutes a key Web monetization strategy nowadays. Further, it introduces new challenging technical problems and raises interesting questions. For instance, how to design ranking functions able to satisfy conflicting goals such as selecting advertisements (ads) that are relevant to the users and suitable and profitable to the publishers and advertisers? In this paper we propose a new framework for associating ads with web pages based on Genetic Programming (GP). Our GP method aims at learning functions that select the most appropriate ads, given the contents of a Web page. These ranking functions are designed to optimize overall precision and minimize the number of misplacements. By using a real ad collection and web pages from a newspaper, we obtained a gain over a state-of-the-art baseline method of 61.7% in average precision. Further, by evolving individuals to provide good ranking estimations, GP was able to discover ranking functions that are very effective in placing ads in web pages while avoiding irrelevant ones.
1148266	Getting work done on the web: supporting transactional queries Many searches on the web have a transactional intent. We argue that pages satisfying transactional needs can be distinguished from the more common pages that have some information and links, but cannot be used to execute a transaction. Based on this hypothesis, we provide a recipe for constructing a transaction annotator. By constructing an annotator with one corpus and then demonstrating its classification performance on another,we establish its robustness. Finally, we show experimentally that a search procedure that exploits such pre-annotation greatly outperforms traditional search for retrieving transactional pages.
1148267	You are what you say: privacy risks of public mentions In today's data-rich networked world, people express many aspects of their lives online. It is common to segregate different aspects in different places: you might write opinionated rants about movies in your blog under a pseudonym while participating in a forum or web site for scholarly discussion of medical ethics under your real name. However, it may be possible to link these separate identities, because the movies, journal articles, or authors you mention are from a sparse relation space whose properties (e.g., many items related to by only a few users) allow re-identification . This re-identification violates people's intentions to separate aspects of their life and can have negative consequences; it also may allow other privacy violations, such as obtaining a stronger identifier like name and address.This paper examines this general problem in a specific setting: re-identification of users from a public web movie forum in a private movie ratings dataset. We present three major results. First, we develop algorithms that can re-identify a large proportion of public users in a sparse relation space. Second, we evaluate whether private dataset owners can protect user privacy by hiding data; we show that this requires extensive and undesirable changes to the dataset, making it impractical. Third, we evaluate two methods for users in a public forum to protect their own privacy, suppression and misdirection. Suppression doesn't work here either. However, we show that a simple misdirection strategy works well: mention a few popular items that you haven't rated.
1148269	A compositional context sensitive multi-document summarizer: exploring the factors that influence summarization The usual approach for automatic summarization is sentence extraction, where key sentences from the input documents are selected based on a suite of features. While word frequency often is used as a feature in summarization, its impact on system performance has not been isolated. In this paper, we study the contribution to summarization of three factors related to frequency: content word frequency, composition functions for estimating sentence importance from word frequency, and adjustment of frequency weights based on context. We carry out our analysis using datasets from the Document Understanding Conferences, studying not only the impact of these features on automatic summarizers, but also their role in human summarization. Our research shows that a frequency based summarizer can achieve performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art systems, but only with a good composition function; context sensitivity improves performance and significantly reduces repetition.
1148270	Information graphics: an untapped resource for digital libraries Information graphics are non-pictorial graphics such as bar charts and line graphs that depict attributes of entities and relations among entities. Most information graphics appearing in popular media have a communicative goal or intended message; consequently, information graphics constitute a form of language. This paper argues that information graphics are a valuable knowledge resource that should be retrievable from a digital library and that such graphics should be taken into account when summarizing a multimodal document for subsequent indexing and retrieval. But to accomplish this, the information graphic must be understood and its message recognized. The paper presents our Bayesian system for recognizing the primary message of one kind of information graphic (simple bar charts) and discusses the potential role of an information graphic's message in indexing graphics and summarizing multimodal documents.
1148284	Bias and the limits of pooling Modern retrieval test collections are built through a process called pooling in which only a sample of the entire document set is judged for each topic. The idea behind pooling is to find enough relevant documents such that when unjudged documents are assumed to be nonrelevant the resulting judgment set is sufficiently complete and unbiased. As document sets grow larger, a constant-size pool represents an increasingly small percentage of the document set, and at some point the assumption of approximately complete judgments must become invalid.This paper demonstrates that the AQUAINT 2005 test collection exhibits bias caused by pools that were too shallow for the document set size despite having many diverse runs contribute to the pools. The existing judgment set favors relevant documents that contain topic title words even though relevant documents containing few topic title words are known to exist in the document set. The paper concludes with suggested modifications to traditional pooling and evaluation methodology that may allow very large reusable test collections to be built.
1148285	Term proximity scoring for ad-hoc retrieval on very large text collections We propose an integration of term proximity scoring into Okapi BM25. The relative retrieval effectiveness of our retrieval method, compared to pure BM25, varies from collection to collection.We present an experimental evaluation of our method and show that the gains achieved over BM25 as the size of the underlying text collection increases. We also show that for stemmed queries the impact of term proximity scoring is larger than for unstemmed queries.
1148287	Tensor space model for document analysis Vector Space Model (VSM) has been at the core of information retrieval for the past decades. VSM considers the documents as vectors in high dimensional space.In such a vector space, techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, etc., can be then applied for indexing and classification. However, in some cases, the dimensionality of the document space might be extremely large, which makes these techniques infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality . In this paper, we propose a novel Tensor Space Model for document analysis. We represent documents as the second order tensors, or matrices. Correspondingly, a novel indexing algorithm called Tensor Latent Semantic Indexing (TensorLSI) is developed in the tensor space. Our theoretical analysis shows that TensorLSI is much more computationally efficient than the conventional Latent Semantic Indexing, which makes it applicable for extremely large scale data set. Several experimental results on standard document data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm.
1148304	Authorship attribution with thousands of candidate authors In this paper, we use a blog corpus to demonstrate that we can often identify the author of an anonymous text even where there are many thousands of candidate authors. Our approach combines standard information retrieval methods with a text categorization meta-learning scheme that determines when to even venture a guess.

1148320	Improving personalized web search using result diversification We present and evaluate methods for diversifying search results to improve personalized web search. A common personalization approach involves reranking the top N search results such that documents likely to be preferred by the user are presented higher. The usefulness of reranking is limited in part by the number and diversity of results considered. We propose three methods to increase the diversity of the top results and evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.
1148326	History repeats itself: repeat queries in Yahoo's logs Thanks to the ubiquity of the Internet search engine search box, users have come to depend on search engines both to find and re-find information. However, re-finding behavior has not been significantly addressed. Here we look at re-finding queries issued to the Yahoo! search engine by 114 users over a year.
1148330	Why structural hints in queries do not help XML-retrieval For many years it has been commonly held that a user who adds structural "hints" to a query will improve precision in an element retrieval search. At INEX 2005 we conducted an experiment to test this assumption. We present the unexpected result that structural hints in queries do not improve precision. An analysis of the topics and the judgments suggests that this is because users are particularly bad at giving structural hints.

1277746	Personalized query expansion for the web The inherent ambiguity of short keyword queries demands for enhanced methods for Web retrieval. In this paper we propose to improve such Web queries by expanding them with terms collected from each user's Personal Information Repository, thus implicitly personalizing the search output. We introduce five broad techniques for generating the additional query keywords by analyzing user data at increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and compound level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics, as well as to using external thesauri. Our extensive empirical analysis under four different scenarios shows some of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing a very strong increase in the quality of the output rankings. Subsequently, we move this personalized search framework one step further and propose to make the expansion process adaptive to various features of each query. A separate set of experiments indicates the adaptive algorithms to bring an additional statistically significant improvement over the best static expansion approach.
1277747	Using query contexts in information retrieval User query is an element that specifies an information need, but it is not the only one. Studies in literature have found many contextual factors that strongly influence the interpretation of a query. Recent studies have tried to consider the user's interests by creating a user profile. However, a single profile for a user may not be sufficient for a variety of queries of the user. In this study, we propose to use query-specific contexts instead of user-centric ones, including context around query and context within query . The former specifies the environment of a query such as the domain of interest, while the latter refers to context words within the query, which is particularly useful for the selection of relevant term relations. In this paper, both types of context are integrated in an IR model based on language modeling. Our experiments on several TREC collections show that each of the context factors brings significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
1277748	Towards task-based personal information management evaluations Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and refind information. A feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users manage and refind information, but very few have been evaluated. This has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations. The difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal information. In this paper we aim to facilitate PIM evaluations by addressing each of these difficulties. In the first part, we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks. The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to refind information and produces a taxonomy of refinding tasks for email messages and web pages. In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using two different methods of task creation.
1277750	Utility-based information distillation over temporally sequenced documents This paper examines a new approach to information distillation over temporally ordered documents, and proposes a novel evaluation scheme for such a framework. It combines the strengths of and extends beyond conventional adaptive filtering, novelty detection and non-redundant passage ranking with respect to long-lasting information needs ("tasks" with multiple queries). Our approach supports fine-grained user feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text, and leverages such information for utility optimization in adaptive settings. For our experiments, we defined hypothetical tasks based on news events in the TDT4 corpus, with multiple queries per task. Answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semi-automatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses. We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty. Our results show encouraging utility enhancements using the new approach, compared to the baseline systems without incremental learning or the novelty detection components.
1277751	Effective missing data prediction for collaborative filtering Memory-based collaborative filtering algorithms have been widely adopted in many popular recommender systems, although these approaches all suffer from data sparsity and poor prediction quality problems. Usually, the user-item matrix is quite sparse, which directly leads to inaccurate recommendations. This paper focuses the memory-based collaborative filtering problems on two crucial factors: (1) similarity computation between users or items and (2) missing data prediction algorithms. First, we use the enhanced Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) algorithm by adding one parameter which overcomes the potential decrease of accuracy when computing the similarity of users or items. Second, we propose an effective missing data prediction algorithm, in which information of both users and items is taken into account. In this algorithm, we set the similarity threshold for users and items respectively, and the prediction algorithm will determine whether predicting the missing data or not. We also address how to predict the missing data by employing a combination of user and item information. Finally, empirical studies on dataset MovieLens have shown that our newly proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms and it is more robust against data sparsity.
1277752	Efficient bayesian hierarchical user modeling for recommendation system A content-based personalized recommendation system learns user specific profiles from user feedback so that it can deliver information tailored to each individual user's interest. A system serving millions of users can learn a better user profile for a new user, or a user with little feedback, by borrowing information from other users through the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model. Learning the model parameters to optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very computationally expensive. The commonly used EM algorithm converges very slowly due to the sparseness of the data in IR applications. This paper proposes a new fast learning technique to learn a large number of individual user profiles. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are justified by theory and demonstrated on actual user data from Netflix and MovieLens.
1277754	Robust test collections for retrieval evaluation Low-cost methods for acquiring relevance judgments can be a boon to researchers who need to evaluate new retrieval tasks or topics but do not have the resources to make thousands of judgments. While these judgments are very useful for a one-time evaluation, it is not clear that they can be trusted when re-used to evaluate new systems. In this work, we formally define what it means for judgments to be reusable: the confidence in an evaluation of new systems can be accurately assessed from an existing set of relevance judgments. We then present a method for augmenting a set of relevance judgments with relevance estimates that require no additional assessor effort. Using this method practically guarantees reusability: with as few as five judgments per topic taken from only two systems, we can reliably evaluate a larger set of ten systems. Even the smallest sets of judgments can be useful for evaluation of new systems.
1277755	Reliable information retrieval evaluation with incomplete and biased judgements Information retrieval evaluation based on the pooling method is inherently biased against systems that did not contribute to the pool of judged documents. This may distort the results obtained about the relative quality of the systems evaluated and thus lead to incorrect conclusions about the performance of a particular ranking technique. We examine the magnitude of this effect and explore how it can be countered by automatically building an unbiased set of judgements from the original, biased judgements obtained through pooling. We compare the performance of this method with other approaches to the problem of incomplete judgements, such as bpref, and show that the proposed method leads to higher evaluation accuracy, especially if the set of manual judgements is rich in documents, but highly biased against some systems.
1277756	Alternatives to Bpref Recently, a number of TREC tracks have adopted a retrieval effectiveness metric called bpref which has been designed for evaluation environments with incomplete relevance data. A graded-relevance version of this metric called rpref has also been proposed. However, we show that the application of Q-measure, normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) or Average Precision (AveP)to condensed lists , obtained by ?ltering out all unjudged documents from the original ranked lists, is actually a better solution to the incompleteness problem than bpref. Furthermore, we show that the use of graded relevance boosts the robustness of IR evaluation to incompleteness and therefore that Q-measure and nDCG based on condensed lists are the best choices. To this end, we use four graded-relevance test collections from NTCIR to compare ten different IR metrics in terms of system ranking stability and pairwise discriminative power.
1277758	An interactive algorithm for asking and incorporating feature feedback into support vector machines Standard machine learning techniques typically require ample training data in the form of labeled instances. In many situations it may be too tedious or costly to obtain sufficient labeled data for adequate classifier performance. However, in text classification, humans can easily guess the relevance of features, that is, words that are indicative of a topic, thereby enabling the classifier to focus its feature weights more appropriately in the absence of sufficient labeled data. We will describe an algorithm for tandem learning that begins with a couple of labeled instances, and then at each iteration recommends features and instances for a human to label. Tandem learning using an "oracle" results in much better performance than learning on only features or only instances. We find that humans can emulate the oracle to an extent that results in performance (accuracy) comparable to that of the oracle. Our unique experimental design helps factor out system error from human error, leading to a better understanding of when and why interactive feature selection works.
1277759	Learn from web search logs to organize search results Effective organization of search results is critical for improving the utility of any search engine. Clustering search results is an effective way to organize search results, which allows a user to navigate into relevant documents quickly. However, two deficiencies of this approach make it not always work well: (1) the clusters discovered do not necessarily correspond to the interesting aspects of a topic from the user's perspective; and (2) the cluster labels generated are not informative enough to allow a user to identify the right cluster. In this paper, we propose to address these two deficiencies by (1) learning "interesting aspects" of a topic from Web search logs and organizing search results accordingly; and (2) generating more meaningful cluster labels using past query words entered by users. We evaluate our proposed method on a commercial search engine log data. Compared with the traditional methods of clustering search results, our method can give better result organization and more meaningful labels.
1277760	Regularized clustering for documents In recent years, document clustering has been receiving more and more attentions as an important and fundamental technique for unsupervised document organization, automatictopic extraction, and fast information retrieval or filtering. In this paper, we propose a novel method for clustering documents using regularization. Unlike traditional globally regularized clustering methods, our method first construct a local regularized linear label predictor for each document vector, and then combine all those local regularizers with a global smoothness regularizer. So we call our algorithm Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) . We will show that the cluster memberships of the documents can be achieved by eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix, which can be efficiently solved by iterative methods. Finally our experimental evaluations on several datasets are presented to show the superiorities of CLGR over traditional document clustering methods.
1277762	Towards automatic extraction of event and place semantics from flickr tags We describe an approach for extracting semantics of tags, unstructured text-labels assigned to resources on the Web, based on each tag's usage patterns. In particular, we focus on the problem of extracting place and event semantics for tags that are assigned to photos on Flickr, a popular photo sharing website that supports time and location (latitude/longitude) metadata. We analyze two methods inspired by well-known burst-analysis techniques and one novel method: Scale-structure Identification. We evaluate the methods on a subset of Flickr data, and show that our Scale-structure Identification method outperforms the existing techniques. The approach and methods described in this work can be used in other domains such as geo-annotated web pages, where text terms can be extracted and associated with usage patterns.
1277763	Hierarchical classification for automatic image annotation In this paper, a hierarchical classification framework has been proposed for bridging the semantic gap effectively and achieving multi-level image annotation automatically. First, the semantic gap between the low-level computable visual features and users' real information needs is partitioned into four smaller gaps, and multiple approachesallare proposed to bridge these smaller gaps more effectively. To learn more reliable contextual relationships between the atomic image concepts and the co-appearances of salient objects, a multi-modal boosting algorithm is proposed. To enable hierarchical image classification and avoid inter-level error transmission, a hierarchical boosting algorithm is proposed by incorporating concept ontology and multi-task learning to achieve hierarchical image classifier training with automatic error recovery. To bridge the gap between the computable image concepts and the users' real information needs, a novel hyperbolic visualization framework is seamlessly incorporated to enable intuitive query specification and evaluation by acquainting the users with a good global view of large-scale image collections. Our experiments on large-scale image databases have also obtained very positive results.
1277766	Fast generation of result snippets in web search The presentation of query biased document snippets as part of results pages presented by search engines has become an expectation of search engine users. In this paper we explore the algorithms and data structures required as part of a search engine to allow efficient generation of query biased snippets. We begin by proposing and analysing a document compression method that reduces snippet generation time by 58% over a baseline using the zlib compression library. These experiments reveal that finding documents on secondary storage dominates the total cost of generating snippets, and so caching documents in RAM is essential for a fast snippet generation process. Using simulation, we examine snippet generation performance for different size RAM caches. Finally we propose and analyse document reordering and compaction, revealing a scheme that increases the number of document cache hits with only a marginal affect on snippet quality. This scheme effectively doubles the number of documents that can fit in a fixed size cache.
1277767	The influence of caption features on clickthrough patterns in web search Web search engines present lists of captions, comprising title, snippet, and URL, to help users decide which search results to visit. Understanding the influence of features of these captions on Web search behavior may help validate algorithms and guidelines for their improved generation. In this paper we develop a methodology to use clickthrough logs from a commercial search engine to study user behavior when interacting with search result captions. The findings of our study suggest that relatively simple caption features such as the presence of all terms query terms, the readability of the snippet, and the length of the URL shown in the caption, can significantly influence users' Web search behavior.
1277768	CollabSum: exploiting multiple document clustering for collaborative single document summarizations Almost all existing methods conduct the summarization tasks for single documents separately without interactions for each document under the assumption that the documents are considered independent of each other. This paper proposes a novel framework called CollabSum for collaborative single document summarizations by making use of mutual influences of multiple documents within a cluster context. In this study, CollabSum is implemented by first employing the clustering algorithm to obtain appropriate document clusters and then exploiting the graph-ranking based algorithm for collaborative document summarizations within each cluster. Both the with-document and cross-document relationships between sentences are incorporated in the algorithm. Experiments on the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed approach. Different clustering algorithms have been investigated and we find that the summarization performance relies positively on the quality of document cluster.
1277770	Information re-retrieval: repeat queries in Yahoo's logs People often repeat Web searches, both to find new information on topics they have previously explored and to re-find information they have seen in the past. The query associated with a repeat search may differ from the initial query but can nonetheless lead to clicks on the same results. This paper explores repeat search behavior through the analysis of a one-year Web query log of 114 anonymous users and a separate controlled survey of an additional 119 volunteers. Our study demonstrates that as many as 40% of all queries are re-finding queries. Re-finding appears to be an important behavior for search engines to explicitly support, and we explore how this can be done. We demonstrate that changes to search engine results can hinder re-finding, and provide a way to automatically detect repeat searches and predict repeat clicks.
1277771	Studying the use of popular destinations to enhance web search interaction We present a novel Web search interaction feature which, for a given query, provides links to websites frequently visited by other users with similar information needs. These popular destinations complement traditional search results, allowing direct navigation to authoritative resources for the query topic. Destinations are identified using the history of search and browsing behavior of many users over an extended time period, whose collective behavior provides a basis for computing source authority. We describe a user study which compared the suggestion of destinations with the previously proposed suggestion of related queries, as well as with traditional, unaided Web search. Results show that search enhanced by destination suggestions outperforms other systems for exploratory tasks, with best performance obtained from mining past user behavior at query-level granularity.
1277772	Neighborhood restrictions in geographic IR Geographic information retrieval (GIR) systems allow users to specify a geographic context, in addition to a more traditional query, enabling the system to pinpoint interesting search results whose relevancy is location-dependent. In particular local search services have become a widely used mechanism to find businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, which satisfy a geographical restriction. Unfortunately, many useful types of geographic restrictions are currently not supported in these systems, including restrictions that specify the neighborhood in which the business should be located. As the boundaries of city neighborhoods are not readily available, automated techniques to construct representations of the spatial extent of neighborhoods are required to support this kind of restrictions. In this paper, we propose such a technique, using fuzzy footprints to cope with the inherent vagueness of most neighborhood boundaries, and we provide experimental results that demonstrate the potential of our technique in a local search setting.
1277774	Efficient document retrieval in main memory Disk access performance is a major bottleneck in traditional information retrieval systems. Compared to system memory, disk bandwidth is poor, and seek times are worse. We circumvent this problem by considering query evaluation strategies in main memory. We show how new accumulator trimming techniques combined with inverted list skipping can produce extremely high performance retrieval systems without resorting to methods that may harm effectiveness. We evaluate our techniques using Galago, a new retrieval system designed for efficient query processing. Our system achieves a 69% improvement in query throughput over previous methods.
1277775	The impact of caching on search engines In this paper we study the trade-offs in designing efficient caching systems for Web search engines. We explore the impact of different approaches, such as static vs. dynamic caching, and caching query results vs.caching posting lists. Using a query log spanning a whole year we explore the limitations of caching and we demonstrate that caching posting lists can achieve higher hit rates than caching query answers. We propose a new algorithm for static caching of posting lists, which outperforms previous methods. We also study the problem of finding the optimal way to split the static cache between answers and posting lists. Finally, we measure how the changes in the query log affect the effectiveness of static caching, given our observation that the distribution of the queries changes slowly over time. Our results and observations are applicable to different levels of the data-access hierarchy, for instance, for a memory/disk layer or a broker/remote server layer.
1277776	Pruning policies for two-tiered inverted index with correctness guarantee The Web search engines maintain large-scale inverted indexes which are queried thousands of times per second by users eager for information. In order to cope with the vast amounts of query loads, search engines prune their index to keep documents that are likely to be returned as top results, and use this pruned index to compute the first batches of results. While this approach can improve performance by reducing the size of the index, if we compute the top results only from the pruned index we may notice a significant degradation in the result quality: if a document should be in the top results but was not included in the pruned index, it will be placed behind the results computed from the pruned index. Given the fierce competition in the online search market, this phenomenon is clearly undesirable. In this paper, we study how we can avoid any degradation of result quality due to the pruning-based performance optimization, while still realizing most of its benefit. Our contribution is a number of modifications in the pruning techniques for creating the pruned index and a new result computation algorithm that guarantees that the top-matching pages are always placed at the top search results, even though we are computing the first batch from the pruned index most of the time. We also show how to determine the optimal size of a pruned index and we experimentally evaluate our algorithms on a collection of 130 million Web pages.
1277778	Topic segmentation with shared topic detection and alignment of multiple documents Topic detection and tracking and topic segmentation play an important role in capturing the local and sequential information of documents. Previous work in this area usually focuses on single documents, although similar multiple documents are available in many domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method for shared topic detection and topic segmentation of multiple similar documents based on mutual information (MI) and weighted mutual information (WMI) that is a combination of MI and term weights. The basic idea is that the optimal segmentation maximizes MI (or WMI). Our approach can detect shared topics among documents. It can find the optimal boundaries in a document, and align segments among documents at the same time. It also can handle single-document segmentation as a special case of the multi-document segmentation and alignment. Our methods can identify and strengthen cue terms that can be used for segmentation and partially remove stop words by using term weights based on entropy learned from multiple documents. Our experimental results show that our algorithm works well for the tasks of single-document segmentation, shared topic detection, and multi-document segmentation. Utilizing information from multiple documents can tremendously improve the performance of topic segmentation, and using WMI is even better than using MI for the multi-document segmentation.
1277779	Analyzing feature trajectories for event detection We consider the problem of analyzing word trajectories in both time and frequency domains, with the specific goal of identifying important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic words. A set of words with identical trends can be grouped together to reconstruct an event in a completely un-supervised manner. The document frequency of each word across time is treated like a time series, where each element is the document frequency - inverse document frequency (DFIDF) score at one time point. In this paper, we 1) first applied spectral analysis to categorize features for different event characteristics: important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic; 2) modeled aperiodic features with Gaussian density and periodic features with Gaussian mixture densities, and subsequently detected each feature's burst by the truncated Gaussian approach; 3) proposed an unsupervised greedy event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events. All of the above methods can be applied to time series data in general. We extensively evaluated our methods on the 1-year Reuters News Corpus [3] and showed that they were able to uncover meaningful aperiodic and periodic events.
1277780	New event detection based on indexing-tree and named entity New Event Detection (NED) aims at detecting from one or multiple streams of news stories that which one is reported on a new event (i.e. not reported previously). With the overwhelming volume of news available today, there is an increasing need for a NED system which is able to detect new events more efficiently and accurately. In this paper we propose a new NED model to speed up the NED task by using news indexing-tree dynamically. Moreover, based on the observation that terms of different types have different effects for NED task, two term reweighting approaches are proposed to improve NED accuracy. In the first approach, we propose to adjust term weights dynamically based on previous story clusters and in the second approach, we propose to employ statistics on training data to learn the named entity reweighting model for each class of stories. Experimental results on two Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) datasets TDT2 and TDT3 show that the proposed model can improve both efficiency and accuracy of NED task significantly, compared to the baseline system and other existing systems.
1277783	Robust classification of rare queries using web knowledge We propose a methodology for building a practical robust query classification system that can identify thousands of query classes with reasonable accuracy, while dealing in real-time with the query volume of a commercial web search engine. We use a blind feedback technique: given a query, we determine its topic by classifying the web search results retrieved by the query. Motivated by the needs of search advertising, we primarily focus on rare queries, which are the hardest from the point of view of machine learning, yet in aggregation account for a considerable fraction of search engine traffic. Empirical evaluation confirms that our methodology yields a considerably higher classification accuracy than previously reported. We believe that the proposed methodology will lead to better matching of online ads to rare queries and overall to a better user experience.
1277784	Random walks on the click graph Search engines can record which documents were clicked for which query, and use these query-document pairs as "soft" relevance judgments. However, compared to the true judgments, click logs give noisy and sparse relevance information. We apply a Markov random walk model to a large click log, producing a probabilistic ranking of documents for a given query. A key advantage of the model is its ability to retrieve relevant documents that have not yet been clicked for that query and rank those effectively. We conduct experiments on click logs from image search, comparing our ("backward") random walk model to a different ("forward") random walk, varying parameters such as walk length and self-transition probability. The most effective combination is a long backward walk with high self-transition probability.
1277787	Investigating the querying and browsing behavior of advanced search engine users One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be more successful in their searches is to better understand what those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this knowledge to benefit everyone. In this paper we study the interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so advanced) to better understand how these user groups search. The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced. Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information and learn improved searching strategies.
1277788	Term feedback for information retrieval with language models In this paper we study term-based feedback for information retrieval in the language modeling approach. With term feedback a user directly judges the relevance of individual terms without interaction with feedback documents, taking full control of the query expansion process. We propose a cluster-based method for selecting terms to present to the user for judgment, as well as effective algorithms for constructing refined query language models from user term feedback. Our algorithms are shown to bring significant improvement in retrieval accuracy over a non-feedback baseline, and achieve comparable performance to relevance feedback. They are helpful even when there are no relevant documents in the top.
1277790	A support vector method for optimizing average precision Machine learning is commonly used to improve ranked retrieval systems. Due to computational difficulties, few learning techniques have been developed to directly optimize for mean average precision (MAP), despite its widespread use in evaluating such systems. Existing approaches optimizing MAP either do not find a globally optimal solution, or are computationally expensive. In contrast, we present a general SVM learning algorithm that efficiently finds a globally optimal solution to a straightforward relaxation of MAP. We evaluate our approach using the TREC 9 and TREC 10 Web Track corpora (WT10g), comparing against SVMs optimized for accuracy and ROCArea. In most cases we show our method to produce statistically significant improvements in MAP scores.
1277791	Ranking with multiple hyperplanes The central problem for many applications in Information Retrieval is ranking and learning to rank is considered as a promising approach for addressing the issue. Ranking SVM, for example, is a state-of-the-art method for learning to rank and has been empirically demonstrated to be effective. In this paper, we study the issue of learning to rank, particularly the approach of using SVM techniques to perform the task. We point out that although Ranking SVM is advantageous, it still has shortcomings. Ranking SVM employs a single hyperplane in the feature space as the model for ranking, which is too simple to tackle complex ranking problems. Furthermore, the training of Ranking SVM is also computationally costly. In this paper, we look at an alternative approach to Ranking SVM, which we call "Multiple Hyperplane Ranker" (MHR), and make comparisons between the two approaches. MHR takes the divide-and-conquer strategy. It employs multiple hyperplanes to rank instances and finally aggregates the ranking results given by the hyperplanes. MHR contains Ranking SVM as a special case, and MHR can overcome the shortcomings which Ranking SVM suffers from. Experimental results on two information retrieval datasets show that MHR can outperform Ranking SVM in ranking.
1277792	A regression framework for learning ranking functions using relative relevance judgments Effective ranking functions are an essential part of commercial search engines. We focus on developing a regression framework for learning ranking functions for improving relevance of search engines serving diverse streams of user queries. We explore supervised learning methodology from machine learning, and we distinguish two types of relevance judgments used as the training data: 1) absolute relevance judgments arising from explicit labeling of search results; and 2) relative relevance judgments extracted from user click throughs of search results or converted from the absolute relevance judgments. We propose a novel optimization framework emphasizing the use of relative relevance judgments. The main contribution is the development of an algorithm based on regression that can be applied to objective functions involving preference data, i.e., data indicating that a document is more relevant than another with respect to a query. Experimental results are carried out using data sets obtained from a commercial search engine. Our results show significant improvements of our proposed methods over some existing methods.
1277794	An exploration of proximity measures in information retrieval In most existing retrieval models, documents are scored primarily based on various kinds of term statistics such as within-document frequencies, inverse document frequencies, and document lengths. Intuitively, the proximity of matched query terms in a document can also be exploited to promote scores of documents in which the matched query terms are close to each other. Such a proximity heuristic, however, has been largely under-explored in the literature; it is unclear how we can model proximity and incorporate a proximity measure into an existing retrieval model. In this paper,we systematically explore the query term proximity heuristic. Specifically, we propose and study the effectiveness of five different proximity measures, each modeling proximity from a different perspective. We then design two heuristic constraints and use them to guide us in incorporating the proposed proximity measures into an existing retrieval model. Experiments on five standard TREC test collections show that one of the proposed proximity measures is indeed highly correlated with document relevance, and by incorporating it into the KL-divergence language model and the Okapi BM25 model, we can significantly improve retrieval performance.
1277795	Estimation and use of uncertainty in pseudo-relevance feedback Existing pseudo-relevance feedback methods typically perform averaging over the top-retrieved documents, but ignore an important statistical dimension: the risk or variance associated with either the individual document models, or their combination. Treating the baseline feedback method as a black box, and the output feedback model as a random variable, we estimate a posterior distribution for the feed-back model by resampling a given query's top-retrieved documents, using the posterior mean or mode as the enhanced feedback model. We then perform model combination over several enhanced models, each based on a slightly modified query sampled from the original query. We find that resampling documents helps increase individual feedback model precision by removing noise terms, while sampling from the query improves robustness (worst-case performance) by emphasizing terms related to multiple query aspects. The result is a meta-feedback algorithm that is both more robust and more precise than the original strong baseline method.
1277796	Latent concept expansion using markov random fields Query expansion, in the form of pseudo-relevance feedback or relevance feedback, is a common technique used to improve retrieval effectiveness. Most previous approaches have ignored important issues, such as the role of features and the importance of modeling term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a robust query expansion technique based onthe Markov random field model for information retrieval. The technique, called latent concept expansion, provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during expansion. Furthermore, the use of arbitrary features within the model provides a powerful framework for going beyond simple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by most other expansion techniques. We evaluate our technique against relevance models, a state-of-the-art language modeling query expansion technique. Our model demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across several TREC data sets. We also describe how our technique can be used to generate meaningful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query suggestion/reformulation.
1277797	A study of Poisson query generation model for information retrieval Many variants of language models have been proposed for information retrieval. Most existing models are based on multinomial distribution and would score documents based on query likelihood computed based on a query generation probabilistic model. In this paper, we propose and study a new family of query generation models based on Poisson distribution. We show that while in their simplest forms, the new family of models and the existing multinomial models are equivalent. However, based on different smoothing methods, the two families of models behave differently. We show that the Poisson model has several advantages, including naturally accommodating per-term smoothing and modeling accurate background more efficiently. We present several variants of the new model corresponding to different smoothing methods, and evaluate them on four representative TREC test collections. The results show that while their basic models perform comparably, the Poisson model can out perform multinomial model with per-term smoothing. The performance can be further improved with two-stage smoothing.
1277801	A probabilistic graphical model for joint answer ranking in question answering Graphical models have been applied to various information retrieval and natural language processing tasks in the recent literature. In this paper, we apply a probabilistic graphical model for answer ranking in question answering. This model estimates the joint probability of correctness of all answer candidates, from which the probability of correctness of an individual candidate can be inferred. The joint prediction model can estimate both the correctness of individual answers as well as their correlations, which enables a list of accurate and comprehensive answers. This model was compared with a logistic regression model which directly estimates the probability of correctness of each individual answer candidate. An extensive set of empirical results based on TREC questions demonstrates the effectiveness of the joint model for answer ranking. Furthermore, we combine the joint model with the logistic regression model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of answer ranking.
1277802	Structured retrieval for question answering Bag-of-words retrieval is popular among Question Answering (QA) system developers, but it does not support constraint checking and ranking on the linguistic and semantic information of interest to the QA system. We present anapproach to retrieval for QA, applying structured retrieval techniques to the types of text annotations that QA systems use. We demonstrate that the structured approach can retrieve more relevant results, more highly ranked, compared with bag-of-words, on a sentence retrieval task. We also characterize the extent to which structured retrieval effectiveness depends on the quality of the annotations.
1277805	Test theory for assessing IR test collections How good is an IR test collection? A series of papers in recent years has addressed the question by empirically enumerating the consistency of performance comparisons using alternate subsets of the collection. In this paper we propose using Test Theory, which is based on analysis of variance and is specifically designed to assess test collections. Using the method, we not only can measure test reliability after the fact, but we can estimate the test collection's reliability before it is even built or used. We can also determine an optimal allocation of resources before the fact, e.g. whether to invest in more judges or queries. The method, which is in widespread use in the field of educational testing, complements data-driven approaches to assessing test collections. Whereas the data-driven method focuses on test results, test theory focuses on test designs. It offers unique practical results, as well as insights about the variety and implications of alternative test designs.
1277806	Strategic system comparisons via targeted relevance judgments Relevance judgments are used to compare text retrieval systems. Given a collection of documents and queries, and a set of systems being compared, a standard approach to forming judgments is to manually examine all documents that are highly ranked by any of the systems. However, not all of these relevance judgments provide the same benefit to the final result, particularly if the aim is to identify which systems are best, rather than to fully order them. In this paper we propose new experimental methodologies that can significantly reduce the volume of judgments required in system comparisons. Using rank-biased precision, a recently proposed effectiveness measure, we show that judging around 200 documents for each of 50 queries in a TREC-scale system evaluation containing over 100 runs is sufficient to identify the best systems.
1277808	FRank: a ranking method with fidelity loss Ranking problem is becoming important in many fields, especially in information retrieval (IR). Many machine learning techniques have been proposed for ranking problem, such as RankSVM, RankBoost, and RankNet. Among them, RankNet, which is based on a probabilistic ranking framework, is leading to promising results and has been applied to a commercial Web search engine. In this paper we conduct further study on the probabilistic ranking framework and provide a novel loss function named fidelity loss for measuring loss of ranking. The fidelity loss notonly inherits effective properties of the probabilistic ranking framework in RankNet, but possesses new properties that are helpful for ranking. This includes the fidelity loss obtaining zero for each document pair, and having a finite upper bound that is necessary for conducting query-level normalization. We also propose an algorithm named FRank based on a generalized additive model for the sake of minimizing the fedelity loss and learning an effective ranking function. We evaluated the proposed algorithm for two datasets: TREC dataset and real Web search dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed FRank algorithm outperforms other learning-based ranking methods on both conventional IR problem and Web search.
1277809	AdaRank: a boosting algorithm for information retrieval In this paper we address the issue of learning to rank for document retrieval. In the task, a model is automatically created with some training data and then is utilized for ranking of documents. The goodness of a model is usually evaluated with performance measures such as MAP (Mean Average Precision) and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain). Ideally a learning algorithm would train a ranking model that could directly optimize the performance measures with respect to the training data. Existing methods, however, are only able to train ranking models by minimizing loss functions loosely related to the performance measures. For example, Ranking SVM and RankBoost train ranking models by minimizing classification errors on instance pairs. To deal with the problem, we propose a novel learning algorithm within the framework of boosting, which can minimize a loss function directly defined on the performance measures. Our algorithm, referred to as AdaRank, repeatedly constructs 'weak rankers' on the basis of reweighted training data and finally linearly combines the weak rankers for making ranking predictions. We prove that the training process of AdaRank is exactly that of enhancing the performance measure used. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that AdaRank significantly outperforms the baseline methods of BM25, Ranking SVM, and RankBoost.
1277810	A combined component approach for finding collection-adapted ranking functions based on genetic programming In this paper, we propose a new method to discover collection-adapted ranking functions based on Genetic Programming (GP). Our Combined Component Approach (CCA)is based on the combination of several term-weighting components (i.e.,term frequency, collection frequency, normalization) extracted from well-known ranking functions. In contrast to related work, the GP terminals in our CCA are not based on simple statistical information of a document collection, but on meaningful, effective, and proven components. Experimental results show that our approach was able to outper form standard TF-IDF, BM25 and another GP-based approach in two different collections. CCA obtained improvements in mean average precision up to 40.87% for the TREC-8 collection, and 24.85% for the WBR99 collection (a large Brazilian Web collection), over the baseline functions. The CCA evolution process also was able to reduce the overtraining, commonly found in machine learning methods, especially genetic programming, and to converge faster than the other GP-based approach used for comparison.
1277811	Feature selection for ranking Ranking is a very important topic in information retrieval. While algorithms for learning ranking models have been intensively studied, this is not the case for feature selection, despite of its importance. The reality is that many feature selection methods used in classification are directly applied to ranking. We argue that because of the striking differences between ranking and classification, it is better to develop different feature selection methods for ranking. To this end, we propose a new feature selection method in this paper. Specifically, for each feature we use its value to rank the training instances, and define the ranking accuracy in terms of a performance measure or a loss function as the importance of the feature. We also define the correlation between the ranking results of two features as the similarity between them. Based on the definitions, we formulate the feature selection issue as an optimization problem, for which it is to find the features with maximum total importance scores and minimum total similarity scores. We also demonstrate how to solve the optimization problem in an efficient way. We have tested the effectiveness of our feature selection method on two information retrieval datasets and with two ranking models. Experimental results show that our method can outperform traditional feature selection methods for the ranking task.
1277813	Relaxed online SVMs for spam filtering Spam is a key problem in electronic communication, including large-scale email systems and the growing number of blogs. Content-based filtering is one reliable method of combating this threat in its various forms, but some academic researchers and industrial practitioners disagree on how best to filter spam. The former have advocated the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for content-based filtering, as this machine learning methodology gives state-of-the-art performance for text classification. However, similar performance gains have yet to be demonstrated for online spam filtering. Additionally, practitioners cite the high cost of SVMs as reason to prefer faster (if less statistically robust) Bayesian methods. In this paper, we offer a resolution to this controversy. First, we show that online SVMs indeed give state-of-the-art classification performance on online spam filtering on large benchmark data sets. Second, we show that nearly equivalent performance may be achieved by a Relaxed Online SVM (ROSVM) at greatly reduced computational cost. Our results are experimentally verified on email spam, blog spam, and splog detection tasks.
1277814	Know your neighbors: web spam detection using the web topology Web spam can significantly deteriorate the quality of search engine results. Thus there is a large incentive for commercial search engines to detect spam pages efficiently and accurately. In this paper we present a spam detection system that combines link-based and content-based features, and uses the topology of the Web graph by exploiting the link dependencies among the Web pages. We find that linked hosts tend to belong to the same class: either both are spam or both are non-spam. We demonstrate three methods of incorporating the Web graph topology into the predictions obtained by our base classifier: (i) clustering the host graph, and assigning the label of all hosts in the cluster by majority vote, (ii) propagating the predicted labels to neighboring hosts, and (iii) using the predicted labels of neighboring hosts as new features and retraining the classifier. The result is an accurate system for detecting Web spam, tested on a large and public dataset, using algorithms that can be applied in practice to large-scale Web data.
1277815	DiffusionRank: a possible penicillin for web spamming While the PageRank algorithm has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, the rank scores of Web pages can be manipulated. To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank. DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph. Theoretically we show that DiffusionRank can serve as a generalization of PageRank when the heat diffusion co-efficient ? tends to infinity. In such a case 1=?= 0, DiffusionRank (PageRank) has low ability of anti-manipulation. When ? = 0, DiffusionRank obtains the highest ability of anti-manipulation, but in such a case, the web structure is completely ignored. Consequently, ? is an interesting factor that can control the balance between the ability of preserving the original Web and the ability of reducing the effect of manipulation. It is found empirically that, when ? = 1, DiffusionRank has a Penicillin-like effect on the link manipulation. Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-to-group relations on the Web, to divide the Web graph into several parts, and to find link communities. Experimental results show that the DiffusionRank algorithm achieves the above mentioned advantages as expected.
1277817	Towards musical query-by-semantic-description using the CAL500 data set Query-by-semantic-description (QBSD)is a natural paradigm for retrieving content from large databases of music. A major impediment to the development of good QBSD systems for music information retrieval has been the lack of a cleanly-labeled, publicly-available, heterogeneous data set of songs and associated annotations. We have collected the Computer Audition Lab 500-song (CAL500) data set by having humans listen to and annotate songs using a survey designed to capture 'semantic associations' between music and words. We adapt the supervised multi-class labeling (SML) model, which has shown good performance on the task of image retrieval, and use the CAL500 data to learn a model for music retrieval. The model parameters are estimated using the weighted mixture hierarchies expectation-maximization algorithm which has been specifically designed to handle real-valued semantic association between words and songs, rather than binary class labels. The output of the SML model, a vector of class-conditional probabilities, can be interpreted as a semantic multinomial distribution over a vocabulary. By also representing a semantic query as a query multinomial distribution, we can quickly rank order the songs in a database based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the query multinomial and each song's semantic multinomial. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our SML model can both annotate a novel song with meaningful words and retrieve relevant songs given a multi-word, text-based query.
1277818	A music search engine built upon audio-based and web-based similarity measures An approach is presented to automatically build a search engine for large-scale music collections that can be queried through natural language. While existing approaches depend on explicit manual annotations and meta-data assigned to the individual audio pieces, we automatically derive descriptions by making use of methods from Web Retrieval and Music Information Retrieval. Based on the ID3 tags of a collection of mp3 files, we retrieve relevant Web pages via Google queries and use the contents of these pages to characterize the music pieces and represent them by term vectors. By incorporating complementary information about acous tic similarity we are able to both reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and improve the performance of retrieval, i.e. the quality of the results. Furthermore, the usage of audio similarity allows us to also characterize audio pieces when there is no associated information found on the Web.
1277820	Building simulated queries for known-item topics: an analysis using six european languages There has been increased interest in the use of simulated queries for evaluation and estimation purposes in Information Retrieval. However, there are still many unaddressed issues regarding their usage and impact on evaluation because their quality, in terms of retrieval performance, is unlike real queries. In this paper, wefocus on methods for building simulated known-item topics and explore their quality against real known-item topics. Using existing generation models as our starting point, we explore factors which may influence the generation of the known-item topic. Informed by this detailed analysis (on six European languages) we propose a model with improved document and term selection properties, showing that simulated known-item topics can be generated that are comparable to real known-item topics. This is a significant step towards validating the potential usefulness of simulated queries: for evaluation purposes, and becausebuilding models of querying behavior provides a deeper insight into the querying process so that better retrieval mechanisms can be developed to support the user.
1277821	Cross-lingual query suggestion using query logs of different languages Query suggestion aims to suggest relevant queries for a given query, which help users better specify their information needs. Previously, the suggested terms are mostly in the same language of the input query. In this paper, we extend it to cross-lingual query suggestion (CLQS): for a query in one language, we suggest similar or relevant queries in other languages. This is very important to scenarios of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) and cross-lingual keyword bidding for search engine advertisement. Instead of relying on existing query translation technologies for CLQS, we present an effective means to map the input query of one language to queries of the other language in the query log. Important monolingual and cross-lingual information such as word translation relations and word co-occurrence statistics, etc. are used to estimate the cross-lingual query similarity with a discriminative model. Benchmarks show that the resulting CLQS system significantly out performs a baseline system based on dictionary-based query translation. Besides, the resulting CLQS is tested with French to English CLIR tasks on TREC collections. The results demonstrate higher effectiveness than the traditional query translation methods.
1277823	Hits on the web: how does it compare? This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, when used in combination with a state-of-the-art text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text. We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements. The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges. We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree. The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm. Finally, we studied the relationship between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.
1277824	Hits hits TREC: exploring IR evaluation results with network analysis We propose a novel method of analysing data gathered fromTREC or similar information retrieval evaluation experiments. We define two normalized versions of average precision, that we use to construct a weighted bipartite graph of TREC systems and topics. We analyze the meaning of well known - and somewhat generalized - indicators fromsocial network analysis on the Systems-Topics graph. We apply this method to an analysis of TREC 8 data; amongthe results, we find that authority measures systems performance, that hubness of topics reveals that some topics are better than others at distinguishing more or less effective systems, that with current measures a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics, and that by using different effectiveness measures this is no longer the case.
1277825	Combining content and link for classification using matrix factorization The world wide web contains rich textual contents that areinterconnected via complex hyperlinks. This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample. It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, e.g., web page classification, by exploiting both the content and the link structure. The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage. Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features. Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors. Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates an excellent accuracy in hypertext classification on the WebKB and Cora benchmarks.
1277827	Federated text retrieval from uncooperative overlapped collections In federated text retrieval systems, the query is sent to multiple collections at the same time. The results returned by collections are gathered and ranked by a central broker that presents them to the user. It is usually assumed that the collections have little overlap. However, in practice collections may share many common documents as either exact or near duplicates, potentially leading to high numbers of duplicates in the final results. Considering the natural band width restrictions and efficiency issues of federated search, sendingqueries to redundant collections leads to unnecessary costs. We propose a novel method for estimating the rate of over-lap among collections based on sampling. Then, using theestimated overlap statistics, we propose two collection selection methods that aim to maximize the number of unique relevant documents in the final results. We show experimentally that, although our estimates of overlap are not in exact, our suggested techniques can significantly improve the search effectiveness when collections overlap.
1277828	Evaluating sampling methods for uncooperative collections Many server selection methods suitable for distributed information retrieval applications rely, in the absence of cooperation, on the availability of unbiased samples of documents from the constituent collections. We describe a number of sampling methods which depend only on the normal query-response mechanism of the applicable search facilities. We evaluate these methods on a number of collections typical of a personal metasearch application. Results demonstrate that biases exist for all methods, particularly toward longer documents, and that in some cases these biases can be reduced but not eliminated by choice of parameters.We also introduce a new sampling technique, "multiple queries", which produces samples of similar quality to the best current techniques but with significantly reduced cost.
1277831	A time machine for text search Text search over temporally versioned document collections such as web archives has received little attention as a research problem. As a consequence, there is no scalable and principled solution to search such a collection as of a specified time. In this work, we address this shortcoming and propose an efficient solution for time-travel text search by extending the inverted file index to make it ready for temporal search. We introduce approximate temporal coalescing as a tunable method to reduce the index size without significantly affecting the quality of results. In order to further improve the performance of time-travel queries, we introduce two principled techniques to trade off index size for its performance. These techniques can be formulated as optimization problems that can be solved to near-optimality. Finally, our approach is evaluated in a comprehensive series of experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets. Results unequivocally show that our methods make it possible to build an efficient "time machine" scalable to large versioned text collections.
1277832	Principles of hash-based text retrieval Hash-based similarity search reduces a continuous similarity relation to the binary concept "similar or not similar": two feature vectors are considered as similar if they are mapped on the same hash key. From its runtime performance this principle is unequaled--while being unaffected by dimensionality concerns at the same time. Similarity hashing is applied with great success for near similarity search in large document collections, and it is considered as a key technology for near-duplicate detection and plagiarism analysis. This papers reveals the design principles behind hash-based search methods and presents them in a unified way. We introduce new stress statistics that are suited to analyze the performance of hash-based search methods, and we explain the rationale of their effectiveness. Based on these insights, we show how optimum hash functions for similarity search can be derived. We also present new results of a comparative study between different hash-based search methods.
1277833	Compressed permuterm index Recently [Manning et al., 2007] resorted the Permuterm indexof Garfield (1976) as a time-efficient and elegant solution to the string dictionary problem in which pattern queries may possibly include one wild-card symbol (called, Tolerant Retrieval problem). Unfortunately the Permuterm index is space inefficient because its quadruples the dictionary size. In this paper we propose the Compressed Permuterm Index which solves the Tolerant Retrieval problem in optimal query time, i.e. time proportional to the length of the searched pattern, and space close to the k-th order empirical entropy of the indexed dictionary. Our index can be used to solve also more sophisticated queries which involve several wild-card symbols, or require to prefix-match multiple fields in a database of records.The result is based on an elegant variant of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform defined on a dictionary of strings of variable length, which allows to easily adapt known compressed indexes [Makinen-Navarro, 2007] to solve the Tolerant Retrieval problem. Experiments show that our index supports fast queries within a space occupancy that is close to the one achievable by compressing the string dictionary via gzip, bzip or ppmdi. This improves known approaches based on front-coding by more than 50% in absolute space occupancy, still guaranteeing comparable query time.
1277835	Query performance prediction in web search environments Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist. In this paper, we present three techniques to address these challenges. We focus on performance prediction for two types of queries in web search environments: content-based and Named-Page finding. Our evaluation is mainly performed on the GOV2 collection. In addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately, we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types of queries are mixed together without prior information on query types. To assist prediction under the mixed-query situation, a novel query classifier is adopted. Results show that our prediction of web query performance is substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art prediction techniques. Consequently, our paper provides a practical approach to performance prediction in real-world web settings.
1277836	Broad expertise retrieval in sparse data environments Expertise retrieval has been largely unexplored on data other than the W3C collection. At the same time, many intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive organisations offer examples of relatively small but clean multilingual expertise data, covering broad ranges of expertise areas. We first present two main expertise retrieval tasks, along with a set of baseline approaches based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding expertise relations between topics and people. For our experimental evaluation, we introduce (and release) a new test set based on a crawl of a university site. Using this test set, we conduct two series of experiments. The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise retrieval methods applied to the new test set. The second is aimed at assessing refined models that exploit characteristic features of the new test set, such as the organizational structure of the university, and the hierarchical structure of the topics in the test set. Expertise retrieval models are shown to be robust with respect to environments smaller than the W3C collection, and current techniques appear to be generalizable to other settings.
1277837	A semantic approach to contextual advertising Contextual advertising or Context Match (CM) refers to the placement of commercial textual advertisements within the content of a generic web page, while Sponsored Search (SS) advertising consists in placing ads on result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query. In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience. With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads. The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by "bid phrases" representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach. However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads. To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.
1277839	How well does result relevance predict session satisfaction? Per-query relevance measures provide standardized, repeatable measurements of search result quality, but they ignore much of what users actually experience in a full search session. This paper examines how well we can approximate a user's ultimate session-level satisfaction using a simple relevance metric. We find that thisrelationship is surprisingly strong. By incorporating additional properties of the query itself, we construct a model which predicts user satisfaction even more accurately than relevance alone.
1277841	Performance prediction using spatial autocorrelation Evaluation of information retrieval systems is one of the core tasks in information retrieval. Problems include the inability to exhaustively label all documents for a topic, generalizability from a small number of topics, and incorporating the variability of retrieval systems. Previous work addresses the evaluation of systems, the ranking of queries by difficulty, and the ranking of individual retrievals by performance. Approaches exist for the case of few and even no relevance judgments. Our focus is on zero-judgment performance prediction of individual retrievals. One common shortcoming of previous techniques is the assumption of uncorrelated document scores and judgments. If documents are embedded in a high-dimensional space (as they often are), we can apply techniques from spatial data analysis to detect correlations between document scores. We find that the low correlation between scores of topically close documents often implies a poor retrieval performance. When compared to a state of the art baseline, we demonstrate that the spatial analysis of retrieval scores provides significantly better prediction performance. These new predictors can also be incorporated with classic predictors to improve performance further. We also describe the first large-scale experiment to evaluate zero-judgment performance prediction for a massive number of retrieval systems over a variety collections in several languages.
1277843	An outranking approach for rank aggregation in information retrieval Research in Information Retrieval usually shows performanceimprovement when many sources of evidence are combined to produce a ranking of documents (e.g., texts, pictures, sounds, etc.). In this paper, we focus on the rank aggregation problem, also called data fusion problem, where rankings of documents, searched into the same collection and provided by multiple methods, are combined in order to produce a new ranking. In this context, we propose a rank aggregation method within a multiple criteria framework using aggregation mechanisms based on decision rules identifying positive and negative reasons for judging whether a document should get a better rank than another. We show that the proposed method deals well with the Information Retrieval distinctive features. Experimental results are reported showing that the suggested method performs better than the well-known CombSUM and CombMNZ operators.
1277845	ARSA: a sentiment-aware model for predicting sales performance using blogs Due to its high popularity, Weblogs (or blogs in short) present a wealth of information that can be very helpful in assessing the general public's sentiments and opinions. In this paper, we study the problem of mining sentiment information from blogs and investigate ways to use such information for predicting product sales performance. Based on an analysis of the complex nature of sentiments, we propose Sentiment PLSA (S-PLSA), in which a blog entry is viewed as a document generated by a number of hidden sentiment factors. Training an S-PLSA model on the blog data enables us to obtain a succinct summary of the sentiment information embedded in the blogs. We then present ARSA, an autoregressive sentiment-aware model, to utilize the sentiment information captured by S-PLSA for predicting product sales performance. Extensive experiments were conducted on a movie data set. We compare ARSA with alternative models that do not take into account the sentiment information, as well as a model with a different feature selection method. Experiments confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.
1277847	Vocabulary independent spoken term detection We are interested in retrieving information from speech data like broadcast news, telephone conversations and roundtable meetings. Today, most systems use large vocabulary continuous speech recognition tools to produce word transcripts; the transcripts are indexed and query terms are retrieved from the index. However, query terms that are not part of the recognizer's vocabulary cannot be retrieved, and the recall of the search is affected. In addition to the output word transcript, advanced systems provide also phonetic transcripts, against which query terms can be matched phonetically. Such phonetic transcripts suffer from lower accuracy and cannot be an alternative to word transcripts.We present a vocabulary independent system that can handle arbitrary queries, exploiting the information provided by having both word transcripts and phonetic transcripts. A speech recognizer generates word confusion networks and phonetic lattices. The transcripts are indexed for query processing and ranking purpose.The value of the proposed method is demonstrated by the relative high performance ofour system, which received the highest overall ranking for US English speech data in the recent NIST Spoken Term Detection evaluation.
1277851	Context sensitive stemming for web search Traditionally, stemming has been applied to Information Retrieval tasks by transforming words in documents to the their root form before indexing, and applying a similar transformation to query terms. Although it increases recall, this naive strategy does not work well for Web Search since it lowers precision and requires a significant amount of additional computation. In this paper, we propose a context sensitive stemming method that addresses these two issues. Two unique properties make our approach feasible for Web Search. First, based on statistical language modeling, we perform context sensitive analysis on the query side. We accurately predict which of its morphological variants is useful to expand a query term with before submitting the query to the search engine. This dramatically reduces the number of bad expansions, which in turn reduces the cost of additional computation and improves the precision at the same time. Second, our approach performs a context sensitive document matching for those expanded variants. This conservative strategy serves as a safeguard against spurious stemming, and it turns out to be very important for improving precision. Using word pluralization handling as an example of our stemming approach, our experiments on a major Web search engine show that stemming only 29% of the query traffic, we can improve relevance as measured by average Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG5) by 6.1% on these queriesand 1.8% over all query traffic.
1277853	Knowledge-intensive conceptual retrieval and passage extraction of biomedical literature This paper presents a study of incorporating domain-specific knowledge (i.e., information about concepts and relationships between concepts in a certain domain) in an information retrieval (IR) system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical literature. The effects of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution are examined. Based on the TREC platform, we show that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge in a proposed conceptual retrieval model yields about 23% improvement over the best reported result in passage retrieval in the Genomics Track of TREC 2006.
1277855	Heavy-tailed distributions and multi-keyword queries Intersecting inverted indexes is a fundamental operation for many applications in information retrieval and databases. Efficient indexing for this operation is known to be a hard problem for arbitrary data distributions. However, text corpora used in Information Retrieval applications often have convenient power-law constraints (also known as Zipf's Law and long tails) that allow us to materialize carefully chosen combinations of multi-keyword indexes, which significantly improve worst-case performance without requiring excessive storage. These multi-keyword indexes limit the number of postings accessed when computing arbitrary index intersections. Our evaluation on an e-commerce collection of 20 million products shows that the indexes of up to four arbitrary keywords can be intersected while accessing less than 20% of the postings in the largest single-keyword index.
1277856	ESTER: efficient search on text, entities, and relations We present ESTER, a modular and highly efficient system for combined full-text and ontology search. ESTER builds on a query engine that supports two basic operations: prefix search and join. Both of these can be implemented very efficiently with a compact index, yet in combination provide powerful querying capabilities. We show how ESTER can answer basic SPARQL graph-pattern queries on the ontology by reducing them to a small number of these two basic operations. ESTER further supports a natural blend of such semantic queries with ordinary full-text queries. Moreover, the prefix search operation allows for a fully interactive and proactive user interface, which after every keystroke suggests to the user possible semantic interpretations of his or her query, and speculatively executes the most likely of these interpretations. As a proof of concept, we applied ESTER to the English Wikipedia, which contains about 3 million documents, combined with the recent YAGO ontology, which contains about 2.5 million facts. For a variety of complex queries, ESTER achieves worst-case query processing times of a fraction of a second, on a single machine, with an index size of about 4 GB.
1277857	Web text retrieval with a P2P query-driven index In this paper, we present a query-driven indexing/retrieval strategy for efficient full text retrieval from large document collections distributed within a structured P2P network. Our indexing strategy is based on two important properties: (1) the generated distributed index stores posting lists for carefully chosen indexing term combinations, and (2) the posting lists containing too many document references are truncated to a bounded number of their top-ranked elements. These two properties guarantee acceptable storage and bandwidth requirements, essentially because the number of indexing term combinations remains scalable and the transmitted posting lists never exceed a constant size. However, as the number of generated term combinations can still become quite large, we also use term statistics extracted from available query logs to index only such combinations that are frequently present in user queries. Thus, by avoiding the generation of superfluous indexing term combinations, we achieve an additional substantial reduction in bandwidth and storage consumption. As a result, the generated distributed index corresponds to a constantly evolving query-driven indexing structure that efficiently follows current information needs of the users. More precisely, our theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that, at the price of a marginal loss in retrieval quality for rare queries, the generated index size and network traffic remain manageable even for web-size document collections. Furthermore, our experiments show that at the same time the achieved retrieval quality is fully comparable to the one obtained with a state-of-the-art centralized query engine.
1277868	Recommending citations for academic papers We approach the problem of academic literature search by considering an unpublished manuscript as a query to a search system. We use the text of previous literature as well as the citation graph that connects it to find relevant related material. We evaluate our technique with manual and automatic evaluation methods, and find an order of magnitude improvement in mean average precision as compared to a text similarity baseline.
1277870	Understanding the relationship of information need specificity to search query length When searching, people's information needs flowthrough to expressing an information retrieval request posed to asearch engine. We hypothesise that the degree of specificity of anIR request might correspond to the length of a search query. Ourresults show a strong correlation between decreasing query lengthand increasing broadness or generality of the IR request. We foundan average cross-over point of specificity from broad to narrow of 3words in the query. These results have implications for searchengines in responding to queries of differing lengths.
1277876	A generic framework for machine transliteration An abstract is not available.
1277882	What emotions do news articles trigger in their readers? We study the classification of news articles into emotions they invoke in their readers. Our work differs from previous studies, which focused on the classification of documents into their authors' emotions instead of the readers'. We use various combinations of feature sets to find the best combination for identifying the emotional influences of news articles on readers.
1277894	Characterizing the value of personalizing search We investigate the diverse goals that people have when they issue the same query to a search engine, and the ability of current search engines to address such diversity. We quantify the potential value of personalizing search results based on this analysis. Great variance was found in the results that different individuals rated as relevant for the same query -- even when the same information goal was expressed. Our analysis suggests that while search engines do a good job of ranking results to maximize global happiness, they do not do a very good job for specific individuals.
1277902	The relationship between IR effectiveness measures and user satisfaction This paper presents an experimental study of users assessing the quality of Google web search results. In particular we look at how users' satisfaction correlates with the effectiveness of Google as quantified by IR measures such as precision and the suite of Cumulative Gain measures (CG, DCG, NDCG). Results indicate strong correlation between users' satisfaction, CG and precision, moderate correlation with DCG, with perhaps surprisingly negligible correlation with NDCG. The reasons for the low correlation with NDCG are examined.
1277907	Varying approaches to topical web query classification Topical classification of web queries has drawn recent interest because of the promise it offers in improving retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. However, much of this promise depends on whether classification is performed before or after the query is used to retrieve documents. We examine two previously unaddressed issues in query classification: pre versus post-retrieval classification effectiveness and the effect of training explicitly from classified queries versus bridging a classifier trained using a document taxonomy. Bridging classifiers map the categories of a document taxonomy onto those of a query classification problem to provide sufficient training data. We find that training classifiers explicitly from manually classified queries outperforms the bridged classifier by 48% in F1 score. Also, a pre-retrieval classifier using only the query terms performs merely 11% worse than the bridged classifier which requires snippets from retrieved documents.
1277909	Clustering short texts using wikipedia Subscribers to the popular news or blog feeds (RSS/Atom) often face the problem of information overload as these feed sources usually deliver large number of items periodically. One solution to this problem could be clustering similar items in the feed reader to make the information more manageable for a user. Clustering items at the feed reader end is a challenging task as usually only a small part of the actual article is received through the feed. In this paper, we propose a method of improving the accuracy of clustering short texts by enriching their representation with additional features from Wikipedia. Empirical results indicate that this enriched representation of text items can substantially improve the clustering accuracy when compared to the conventional bag of words representation.
1277912	Enhancing patent retrieval by citation analysis This paper proposes a method to combine text-based and citation-based retrieval methods in the invalidity patent search. Using the NTCIR-6 test collection including eight years of USPTO patents, we show the effectiveness of our method experimentally.
1277914	Improving weak ad-hoc queries using wikipedia asexternal corpus In an ad-hoc retrieval task, the query is usually short and the user expects to find the relevant documents in the first several result pages. We explored the possibilities of using Wikipedia's articles as an external corpus to expand ad-hoc queries. Results show promising improvements over measures that emphasize on weak queries.
1277921	The utility of linguistic rules in opinion mining Online product reviews are one of the important opinion sources on the Web. This paper studies the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive or negative) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. Most existing approaches use a set of opinion words for the purpose. However, the semantic orientations of many words are context dependent. In this paper, we propose to use some linguistic rules to deal with the problem together with a new opinion aggregation function. Extensive experiments show that these rules and the function are highly effective. A system, called Opinion Observer, has also been built.
1277927	Active learning for class imbalance problem The class imbalance problem has been known to hinder the learning performance of classification algorithms. Various real-world classification tasks such as text categorization suffer from this phenomenon. We demonstrate that active learning is capable of solving the problem.
1277928	Strategies for retrieving plagiarized documents For the identification of plagiarized passages in large document collections we present retrieval strategies which rely on stochastic sampling and chunk indexes. Using the entire Wikipedia corpus we compile n-gram indexes and compare them to a new kind of fingerprint index in a plagiarism analysis use case. Our index provides an analysis speed-up by factor 1.5 and is an order of magnitude smaller, while being equivalent in terms of precision and recall.
1277937	Incorporating term dependency in the dfr framework Term dependency, or co-occurrence, has been studied in language modelling, for instance by Metzler & Croft who showed that retrieval performance could be significantlyenhanced using term dependency information. In this work, weshow how term dependency can be modelled within the Divergence From Randomness (DFR) framework. We evaluate our term dependency model on the two adhoc retrieval tasks using the TREC .GOV2 Terabyte collection. Furthermore, we examine the effect of varying the term dependency window size on the retrieval performance of the proposed model. Our experiments show that term dependency can indeed besuccessfully incorporated within the DFR framework.
1277938	Hits on question answer portals: exploration of link analysis for author ranking Question-Answer portals such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers are growing in popularity. However, despite the increased popularity, the quality of answers is uneven, and while some users usually provide good answers, many others often provide bad answers. Hence, estimating the authority, or the expected quality of users, is a crucial task for this emerging domain, with potential applications to answer ranking and to incentive mechanism design. We adapt a powerful link analysis methodology from the web domain as a first step towards estimating authority in Question Answer portals. Our experimental results over more than 3 million answers from Yahoo! Answers are promising, and warrant further exploration along the lines outlined in this poster.
1277939	Heads and tails: studies of web search with common and rare queries A large fraction of queries submitted to Web search enginesoccur very infrequently. We describe search log studiesaimed at elucidating behaviors associated with rare andcommon queries. We present several analyses and discussresearch directions.
1277942	Query rewriting using active learning for sponsored search Sponsored search is a major revenue source for search companies. Web searchers can issue any queries, while advertisement keywords are limited. Query rewriting technique effectively matches user queries with relevant advertisement keywords, thus increases the amount of web advertisements available. The match relevance is critical for clicks. In this study, we aim to improve query rewriting relevance. For this purpose, we use an active learning algorithm called Transductive Experimental Design to select the most informative samples to train the query rewriting relevance model. Experiments show that this approach significantly improves model accuracy and rewriting relevance.
1277951	Feature engineering for mobile (SMS) spam filtering Mobile spam in an increasing threat that may be addressed using filtering systems like those employed against email spam. We believe that email filtering techniques require some adaptation to reach good levels of performance on SMS spam, especially regarding message representation. In order to test this assumption, we have performed experiments on SMS filtering using top performing email spam filters on mobile spam messages using a suitable feature representation, with results supporting our hypothesis.
1277953	Query suggestion based on user landing pages This poster investigates a novel query suggestion technique that selects query refinements through a combination of many users' post-query navigation patterns and the query logs of a large search engine. We compare this technique, which uses the queries that retrieve in the top-ranked search results places where searchers end up after post-query browsing (i.e., the landing pages), with an approach based on query refinements from user search sessions extracted from query logs. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using landing pages for the direct generation of query suggestions, as well as the complementary nature of the suggestions it generates with regard to traditional query log based refinement methodologies.
133167	Relevance feedback revisited Researchers have found relevance feedback to be effective in interactive information retrieval, although few formal user experiments have been made. In order to run a user experiment on a large document collection, experiments were performed at NIST to complete some of the missing links found in using the probabilistic retrieval model. These experiments, using the Cranfield 1400 collection, showed the importance of query expansion in addition to query reweighting, and showed that adding as few as 20 well-selected terms could result in performance improvements of over 100%. Additionally it was shown that performing multiple iterations of feedback is highly effective.
133169	Incremental relevance feedback Although relevance feedback techniques have been investigated for more than 20 years, hardly any of these techniques has been implemented in a commercial full-text document retrieval system. In addition to pure performance problems, this is due to the fact that the application of relevance feedback techniques increases the complexity of the user interface and thus also the use of a document retrieval system. In this paper we concentrate on a relevance feedback technique that allows easily understandable and manageable user interfaces, and at the same time provides high-quality retrieval results. Moreover, the relevance feedback technique introduced unifies as well as improves other well-known relevance feedback techniques.
133172	An evaluation of phrasal and clustered representations on a text categorization task Syntactic phrase indexing and term clustering have been widely explored as text representation techniques for text retrieval. In this paper we study the properties of phrasal and clustered indexing languages on a text categorization task, enabling us to study their properties in isolation from query interpretation issues. We show that optimal effectiveness occurs when using only a small proportion of the indexing terms available, and that effectiveness peaks at a higher feature set size and lower effectiveness level for a syntactic phrase indexing than for word-based indexing. We also present results suggesting that traditional term clustering method are unlikely to provide significantly improved text representations. An improved probabilistic text categorization method is also presented.
133177	Classifying news stories using memory based reasoning We describe a method for classifying news stories using Memory Based Reasoning (MBR) a k -nearest neighbor method), that does not require manual topic definitions. Using an already coded training database of about 50,000 stories from the Dow Jones Press Release News Wire, and SEEKER [Stanfill] (a text retrieval system that supports relevance feedback) as the underlying match engine, codes are assigned to new, unseen stories with a recall of about 80% and precision of about 70%. There are about 350 different codes to be assigned. Using a massively parallel supercomputer, we leverage the information already contained in the thousands of coded stories and are able to code a story in about 2 seconds. Given SEEKER, the text retrieval system, we achieved these results in about two person-months. We believe this approach is effective in reducing the development time to implement classification systems involving large number of topics for the purpose of classification, message routing etc.
133180	Experiments in automatic statistical thesaurus construction A well constructed thesaurus has long been recognized as a valuable tool in the effective operation of an information retrieval system. This paper reports the results of experiments designed to determine the validity of an approach to the automatic construction of global thesauri (described originally by Crouch in [1] and [2] based on a clustering of the document collection. The authors validate the approach by showing that the use of thesauri generated by this method results in substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness in four test collections. The term discrimination value theory, used in the thesaurus generation algorithm to determine a term's membership in a particular thesaurus class, is found not to be useful in distinguishing a âgoodâ from an âindifferentâ or âpoorâ thesaurus class). In conclusion, the authors suggest an alternate approach to automatic thesaurus construction which greatly simplifies the work of producing viable thesaurus classes. Experimental results show that the alternate approach described herein in some cases produces thesauri which are comparable in retrieval effectiveness to those produced by the first method at much lower cost.
133181	Use of syntactic context to produce term association lists for text retrieval One aspect of world knowledge essential to information retrieval is knowing when two words are related. Knowing word relatedness allows a system given a user's query terms to retrieve relevant documents not containing those exact terms. Two words can be said to be related if they appear in the same contexts Document co-occurrence gives a measure of word relatedness that has proved to be too rough to be useful. The relatively recent apparition of on-line dictionaries and robust and rapid parsers permits the extraction of finer word contexts from large corpora. In this paper, we will describe such an extraction technique that uses only coarse syntactic analysis and no domain knowledge. This technique produces lists of words related to any work appearing in a corpus. When the closest related terms were used in query expansion of a standard information retrieval testbed, the results were much better than that given by document co-occurence techniques, and slightly better than using unexpanded queries, supporting the contention that semantically similar words were indeed extracted by this technique.
133183	Versioning a full-text information retrieval system In this paper, we present an approach to the incorporation of object versioning into a distributed full-text information retrieval system. We propose an implementation based on âpartially versionedâ index sets, arguing that its space overhead and query-time performance make it suitable for full-text IR, with its heavy dependence on inverted indexing. We develop algorithms for computing both historical queries and time range queries and show how these algorithms can be applied to a number of problems in distributed information management, such as data replication, caching, transactional consistency, and hybrid media repositories.
133185	Retrieval activities in a database consisting of heterogeneous collections of structured text The first part of this paper briefly describes a mathematical framework (called the containment model) that provides the operations and data structures for a text dominated database with a hierarchical structure. The database is considered to be a hierarchical collection of continuous extents each extent being a word, word phrase, text element or non-text element. The filter operations making up a search command are expressed in terms of containment criteria that specify whether a contiguous extent will be selected or rejected during a search. This formalism, comprised of the mathematical framework and its associated language, defines a conceptual layer upon which we can construct a well-defined higher level layer, specifically the user interface that serves to provide a level of functionality that is closer to the needs of the user and the application domain. With the conceptual layer established, we go on to describe the design and implementation of a versatile interface which handles queries that search and navigate a heterogeneous collection of structured documents. Interface functionality is provided by a set of âworkerâ modules supported by an âenvironmentâ that is the same for all interfaces. The interface environment allows a worker to communicate with the underlying text retrieval engine using a well-defined command protocol that is based on a small set of filter operators. The overall design emphasizes: a) interface flexibility for a variety of search and browsing capabilities, b) the modular independence of the interface with respect to its underlying retrieval engine, and c) the advantages to be accrued by defining retrieval commands using operators that are part of a text algebra that provides a sound theoretical foundation for the database.
133188	Towards a probabilistic modal logic for semantic-based information retrieval Semantic-based approaches to Information Retrieval make a query evaluation similar to an inference process based on semantic relations. Semantic-based approaches find out hidden semantic relationships between a document and a query, but quantitative estimation of the correspondence between them is often empiric. On the other hand, probabilistic approaches usually consider only statistical relationships between terms. It is expected that improvement may be brought by integrating these two approaches. This paper demonstrates, using some particular probabilistic models which are strongly related to modal logic, that such an integration is feasible and natural. A new model is developed on the basis of an extended modal logic. It has the advantages of : (1) augmenting a semantic-based approach with a probabilistic measurement, and (2) augmenting a probabilistic approach with finer semantic relations than just statistical ones. It is shown that this model verifies most of the conditions for an absolute probability function .
133191	Latent semantic indexing is an optimal special case of multidimensional scaling Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a technique for representing documents, queries, and terms as vectors in a multidimensional real-valued space. The representtions are approximations to the original term space encoding, and are found using the matrix technique of Singular Value Decomposition. In comparison Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a class of data analysis techniques for representing data points as points in a multidimensional real-valued space. The objects are represented so that inter-point similarities in the space match inter-object similarity information provided by the researcher. We illustrate how the document representations given by LSI are equivalent to the optimal representations found when solving a particular MDS problem in which the given inter-object similarity information is provided by the inner product similarities between the documents themselves. We further analyze a more general MDS problem in which the interdocument similarity information, although still in inner product form is arbitrary with respect to the vector space encoding of the documents.
133194	A system for retrieving speech documents An information retrieval model is presented for the retrieval of speech documents, i.e. audio recordings containing speech. The indexing vocabulary consists of indexing features that have the following characteristics. First, they are easy to recognize by speech recognition methods. Second, the number of different indexing features is small such that a reasonable amount of training data is sufficent to train the hidden Markov models that are used by the speech recognition process. Third, the retrieval method based on such indexing features achieves an acceptable retrieval effectiveness as shown by experiments on text collections. Fourth, these indexing features cannot only be identified in speech documents but also in text documents. From the last characteristic follows that speech documents and text documents can be retrieved simultaneously. Analogously, the queries may contain either speech or text. Thus, we have a simple multimedia retrieval model where two different medias are indexed coherently. We also describe a prototype retrieval system under development.
133199	Probabilistic retrieval based on staged logistic regression The goal of a probabilistic retrieval system design is to rank the elements of the search universe in descending order of their estimated probability of usefulness to the user. Previously explored methods for computing such a ranking have involved the use of statistical independence assumptions and multiple regression analysis on a learning sample. In this paper these techniques are recombined in a new way to achieve greater accuracy of probabilistic estimate without undue additional computational complexity. The novel element of the proposed design is that the regression analysis be carried out in two or more levels or stages. Such an approach allows composite or grouped retrieval clues to be analyzed in an orderly manner -- first within groups, and then between. It compensates automatically for systematic biases introduced by the statistical simplifying assumptions, and gives rise to search algorithms of reasonable computational efficiency.
133202	Integration of probabilistic fact and text retrieval In this paper, a model for combining text and fact retrieval is described. A query is a set of conditions, where a single condition is either a text or fact condition. Fact conditions can be interpreted as being vague, thus leading to nonbinary weights for fact conditions with respect to database objects. For text conditions, we use descriptions of the occurence of terms in documents instead of precomputed indexing weights, thus treating terms similar to attributes. Probabilistic indexing weights for conditions are computed by introducing the notion of correctness (or acceptability) of a condition w.r.t. an object. These indexing weights are used in retrieval for a probabilistic ranking of objects based on the retrieval for a probabilistic ranking of objects based on the retrieval-with-probabilistic-indexing (RPI) model, for which a new derivation is given here.
133205	Automating the assignment of submitted manuscripts to reviewers The 117 manuscripts submitted for the Hypertext '91 conference were assigned to members of the review committee, using a variety of automated methods based on information retrieval principles and Latent Semantic Indexing. Fifteen reviewers provided exhaustive ratings for the submitted abstracts, indicating how well each abstract matched their interests. The automated methods do a fairly good job of assigning relevant papers for review, but they are still somewhat poorer than assignments made manually by human experts and substantially poorer than an assignment perfectly matching the reviewers' own ranking of the papers. A new automated assignment method called â n of 2 n â achieves better performance than human experts by sending reviewers more papers than they actually have to review and then allowing them to choose part of their review load themselves.
133210	Parameterised compression for sparse bitmaps Full-text retrieval systems often use either a bitmap or an inverted file to identify which documents contain which terms, so that the documents containing any combination of query terms can be quickly located. Bitmaps of term occurrences are large, but are usually sparse, and thus are amenable to a variety of compression techniques. Here we consider techniques in which the encoding of each bitvector within the bitmap is parameterised, so that a different code can be used for each bitvector. Our experimental results show that the new methods yield better compression than previous techniques.
133214	Scatter/Gather: a cluster-based approach to browsing large document collections Document clustering has not been well received as an information retrieval tool. Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval. We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithms which support this interactive browsing paradigm.
133215	Bead: explorations in information visualization We describe work on the visualization of bibliographic data and, to aid in this task, the application of numerical techniques for multidimensional scaling. Many areas of scientific research involve complex multivariate data. One example of this is Information Retrieval. Document comparisons may be done using a large number of variables. Such conditions do not favour the more well-known methods of visualization and graphical analysis, as it is rarely feasible to map each variable onto one aspect of even a three-dimensional, coloured and textured space. Bead is a prototype system for the graphically-based exploration of information. In this system, articles in a bibliography are represented by particles in 3-space. By using physically-based modelling techniques to take advantage of fast methods for the approximation of potential fields, we represent the relationships between articles by their relative spatial positions. Inter-particle forces tend to make similar articles move closer to one another and dissimilar ones move apart. The result is a 3D scene which can be used to visualize patterns in the high-D information space.
133216	The dynamic HomeFinder: evaluating dynamic queries in a real-estate information exploration system We designed, implemented, and evaluated a new concept for visualizing and searching databases utilizing direct manipulation called dynamic queries . Dynamic queries allow users to formulate queries by adjusting graphical widgets, such as sliders, and see the results immediately. By providing a graphical visualization of the database and search results, users can find trends and exceptions easily. User testing was done with eighteen undergraduate students who performed significantly faster using a dynamic queries interface compared to both a natural language system and paper printouts. The interfaces were used to explore a real-estate database and find homes meeting specific search criteria.
1390339	Effective and efficient user interaction for long queries Handling long queries can involve either pruning the query to retain only the important terms (reduction), or expanding the query to include related concepts (expansion). While automatic techniques to do so exist, roughly 25% performance improvements in terms of MAP have been realized in past work through interactive variants. We show that selectively reducing or expanding a query leads to an average improvement of 51% in MAP over the baseline for standard TREC test collections. We demonstrate how user interaction can be used to achieve this improvement. Most interaction techniques present users with a fixed number of options for all queries. We achieve improvements by interacting less with the user, i.e., we present techniques to identify the optimal number of options to present to users, resulting in an interface with an average of 70% fewer options to consider. Previous algorithms supporting interactive reduction and expansion are exponential in nature. To extend their utility to operational environments, we present techniques to make the complexity of the algorithms polynomial. We finally present an analysis of long queries that continue to exhibit poor performance in spite of our new techniques.
1390340	How do users find things with PubMed?: towards automatic utility evaluation with user simulations In the context of document retrieval in the biomedical domain, this paper explores the complex relationship between the quality of initial query results and the overall utility of an interactive retrieval system. We demonstrate that a content-similarity browsing tool can compensate for poor retrieval results, and that the relationship between retrieval performance and overall utility is non-linear. Arguments are advanced with user simulations, which characterize the relevance of documents that a user might encounter with different browsing strategies. With broader implications to IR, this work provides a case study of how user simulations can be exploited as a formative tool for automatic utility evaluation. Simulation-based studies provide researchers with an additional evaluation tool to complement interactive and Cranfield-style experiments.
1390343	An unsupervised framework for extracting and normalizing product attributes from multiple web sites We have developed an unsupervised framework for simultaneously extracting and normalizing attributes of products from multiple Web pages originated from different sites. Our framework is designed based on a probabilistic graphical model that can model the page-independent content information and the page-dependent layout information of the text fragments in Web pages. One characteristic of our framework is that previously unseen attributes can be discovered from the clue contained in the layout format of the text fragments. Our framework tackles both extraction and normalization tasks by jointly considering the relationship between the content and layout information. Dirichlet process prior is employed leading to another advantage that the number of discovered product attributes is unlimited. An unsupervised inference algorithm based on variational method is presented. The semantics of the normalized attributes can be visualized by examining the term weights in the model. Our framework can be applied to a wide range of Web mining applications such as product matching and retrieval. We have conducted extensive experiments from four different domains consisting of over 300 Web pages from over 150 different Web sites, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our framework.
1390346	Score standardization for inter-collection comparison of retrieval systems The goal of system evaluation in information retrieval has always been to determine which of a set of systems is superior on a given collection. The tool used to determine system ordering is an evaluation metric such as average precision, which computes relative, collection-specific scores. We argue that a broader goal is achievable. In this paper we demonstrate that, by use of standardization, scores can be substantially independent of a particular collection, allowing systems to be compared even when they have been tested on different collections. Compared to current methods, our techniques provide richer information about system performance, improved clarity in outcome reporting, and greater simplicity in reviewing results from disparate sources.
1390347	The good and the bad system: does the test collection predict users' effectiveness? Test collections are extensively used in the evaluation of information retrieval systems. Crucial to their use is the degree to which results from them predict user effectiveness. At first, past studies did not substantiate a relationship between system and user effectiveness; more recently, however, correlations have begun to emerge. The results of this paper strengthen and extend those findings. We introduce a novel methodology for investigating the relationship, which shows great success in establishing a significant correlation between system and user effectiveness. It is shown that users behave differently and discern differences between pairs of systems that have a very small absolute difference in test collection effectiveness. Our results strengthen the use of test collections in IR evaluation, confirming that users' effectiveness can be predicted successfully.
1390350	Attack resistant collaborative filtering The widespread deployment of recommender systems has lead to user feedback of varying quality. While some users faithfully express their true opinion, many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations. The presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Even worse, malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their benefit. While previous research has attempted to study the robustness of various existing Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches, this remains an unsolved problem. Approaches such as Neighbor Selection algorithms, Association Rules and Robust Matrix Factorization have produced unsatisfactory results. This work describes a new collaborative algorithm based on SVD which is accurate as well as highly stable to shilling. This algorithm exploits previously established SVD based shilling detection algorithms, and combines it with SVD based-CF. Experimental results show a much diminished effect of all kinds of shilling attacks. This work also offers significant improvement over previous Robust Collaborative Filtering frameworks.
1390351	EigenRank: a ranking-oriented approach to collaborative filtering A recommender system must be able to suggest items that are likely to be preferred by the user. In most systems, the degree of preference is represented by a rating score. Given a database of users' past ratings on a set of items, traditional collaborative filtering algorithms are based on predicting the potential ratings that a user would assign to the unrated items so that they can be ranked by the predicted ratings to produce a list of recommended items. In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering approach that addresses the item ranking problem directly by modeling user preferences derived from the ratings. We measure the similarity between users based on the correlation between their rankings of the items rather than the rating values and propose new collaborative filtering algorithms for ranking items based on the preferences of similar users. Experimental results on real world movie rating data sets show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional collaborative filtering algorithms significantly on the NDCG measure for evaluating ranked results.
1390352	Personalized active learning for collaborative filtering Collaborative Filtering (CF) requires user-rated training examples for statistical inference about the preferences of new users. Active learning strategies identify the most informative set of training examples through minimum interactions with the users. Current active learning approaches in CF make an implicit and unrealistic assumption that a user can provide rating for any queried item. This paper introduces a new approach to the problem which does not make such an assumption. We personalize active learning for the user, and query for only those items which the user can provide rating for. We propose an extended form of Bayesian active learning and use the Aspect Model for CF to illustrate and examine the idea. A comparative evaluation of the new method and a well-established baseline method on benchmark datasets shows statistically significant improvements with our method over the performance of the baseline method that is representative for existing approaches which do not take personalization into account.
1390354	A boosting algorithm for learning bipartite ranking functions with partially labeled data This paper presents a boosting based algorithm for learning a bipartite ranking function (BRF) with partially labeled data. Until now different attempts had been made to build a BRF in a transductive setting, in which the test points are given to the methods in advance as unlabeled data. The proposed approach is a semi-supervised inductive ranking algorithm which, as opposed to transductive algorithms, is able to infer an ordering on new examples that were not used for its training. We evaluate our approach using the TREC-9 Ohsumed and the Reuters-21578 data collections, comparing against two semi-supervised classification algorithms for ROCArea (AUC), uninterpolated average precision (AUP), mean precision@50 (TP) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves. In the most interesting cases where there are an unbalanced number of irrelevant examples over relevant ones, we show our method to produce statistically significant improvements with respect to these ranking measures.
1390355	Directly optimizing evaluation measures in learning to rank One of the central issues in learning to rank for information retrieval is to develop algorithms that construct ranking models by directly optimizing evaluation measures used in information retrieval such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Several such algorithms including SVM map and AdaRank have been proposed and their effectiveness has been verified. However, the relationships between the algorithms are not clear, and furthermore no comparisons have been conducted between them. In this paper, we conduct a study on the approach of directly optimizing evaluation measures in learning to rank for Information Retrieval (IR). We focus on the methods that minimize loss functions upper bounding the basic loss function defined on the IR measures. We first provide a general framework for the study and analyze the existing algorithms of SVM map and AdaRank within the framework. The framework is based on upper bound analysis and two types of upper bounds are discussed. Moreover, we show that we can derive new algorithms on the basis of this analysis and create one example algorithm called PermuRank. We have also conducted comparisons between SVM map , AdaRank, PermuRank, and conventional methods of Ranking SVM and RankBoost, using benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the methods based on direct optimization of evaluation measures can always outperform conventional methods of Ranking SVM and RankBoost. However, no significant difference exists among the performances of the direct optimization methods themselves.
1390356	Query dependent ranking using K-nearest neighbor Many ranking models have been proposed in information retrieval, and recently machine learning techniques have also been applied to ranking model construction. Most of the existing methods do not take into consideration the fact that significant differences exist between queries, and only resort to a single function in ranking of documents. In this paper, we argue that it is necessary to employ different ranking models for different queries and onduct what we call query-dependent ranking. As the first such attempt, we propose a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method for query-dependent ranking. We first consider an online method which creates a ranking model for a given query by using the labeled neighbors of the query in the query feature space and then rank the documents with respect to the query using the created model. Next, we give two offline approximations of the method, which create the ranking models in advance to enhance the efficiency of ranking. And we prove a theory which indicates that the approximations are accurate in terms of difference in loss of prediction, if the learning algorithm used is stable with respect to minor changes in training examples. Our experimental results show that the proposed online and offline methods both outperform the baseline method of using a single ranking function.
1390358	Asymmetric distance estimation with sketches for similarity search in high-dimensional spaces Efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces is important to content-based retrieval systems. Recent studies have shown that sketches can effectively approximate L 1 distance in high-dimensional spaces, and that filtering with sketches can speed up similarity search by an order of magnitude. It is a challenge to further reduce the size of sketches, which are already compact, without compromising accuracy of distance estimation. This paper presents an efficient sketch algorithm for similarity search with L 2 distances and a novel asymmetric distance estimation technique. Our new asymmetric estimator takes advantage of the original feature vector of the query to boost the distance estimation accuracy. We also apply this asymmetric method to existing sketches for cosine similarity and L 1 distance. Evaluations with datasets extracted from images and telephone records show that our L 2 sketch outperforms existing methods, and the asymmetric estimators consistently improve the accuracy of different sketch methods. To achieve the same search quality, asymmetric estimators can reduce the sketch size by 10% to 40%.
1390359	ResIn: a combination of results caching and index pruning for high-performance web search engines Results caching is an efficient technique for reducing the query processing load, hence it is commonly used in real search engines. This technique, however, bounds the maximum hit rate due to the large fraction of singleton queries, which is an important limitation. In this paper we propose ResIn - an architecture that uses a combination of res ults caching and in dex pruning to overcome this limitation. We argue that results caching is an inexpensive and efficient way to reduce the query processing load and show that it is cheaper to implement compared to a pruned index. At the same time, we show that index pruning performance is fundamentally affected by the changes in the query traffic that the results cache induces. We experiment with real query logs and a large document collection, and show that the combination of both techniques enables efficient reduction of the query processing costs and thus is practical to use in Web search engines.
1390360	Reorganizing compressed text Recent research has demonstrated beyond doubts the benefits of compressing natural language texts using word-based statistical semistatic compression. Not only it achieves extremely competitive compression rates, but also direct search on the compressed text can be carried out faster than on the original text; indexing based on inverted lists benefits from compression as well. Such compression methods assign a variable-length codeword to each different text word. Some coding methods (Plain Huffman and Restricted Prefix Byte Codes) do not clearly mark codeword boundaries, and hence cannot be accessed at random positions nor searched with the fastest text search algorithms. Other coding methods (Tagged Huffman, End-Tagged Dense Code, or ( s, c )-Dense Code) do mark codeword boundaries, achieving a self-synchronization property that enables fast search and random access, in exchange for some loss in compression effectiveness. In this paper, we show that by just performing a simple reordering of the target symbols in the compressed text (more precisely, reorganizing the bytes into a wavelet-treelike shape) and using little additional space, searching capabilities are greatly improved without a drastic impact in compression and decompression times. With this approach, all the codes achieve synchronism and can be searched fast and accessed at arbitrary points. Moreover, the reordered compressed text becomes an implicitly indexed representation of the text, which can be searched for words in time independent of the text length. That is, we achieve not only fast sequential search time, but indexed search time, for almost no extra space cost. We experiment with three well-known word-based compression techniques with different characteristics (Plain Huffman, End-Tagged Dense Code and Restricted Prefix Byte Codes), and show the searching capabilities achieved by reordering the compressed representation on several corpora. We show that the reordered versions are not only much more efficient than their classical counterparts, but also more efficient than explicit inverted indexes built on the collection, when using the same amount of space.
1390362	User adaptation: good results from poor systems Several recent studies have found only a weak relationship between the performance of a retrieval system and the "success" achievable by human searchers. We hypothesize that searchers are successful precisely because they alter their behavior. To explore the possible causal relation between system performance and search behavior, we control system performance, hoping to elicit adaptive search behaviors. 36 subjects each completed 12 searches using either a standard system or one of two degraded systems. Using a general linear model, we isolate the main effect of system performance, by measuring and removing main effects due to searcher variation, topic difficulty, and the position of each search in the time series. We find that searchers using our degraded systems are as successful as those using the standard system, but that, in achieving this success, they alter their behavior in ways that could be measured, in real time, by a suitably instrumented system. Our findings suggest, quite generally, that some aspects of behavioral dynamics may provide unobtrusive indicators of system performance.
1390363	Exploring folksonomy for personalized search As a social service in Web 2.0, folksonomy provides the users the ability to save and organize their bookmarks online with "social annotations" or "tags". Social annotations are high quality descriptors of the web pages' topics as well as good indicators of web users' interests. We propose a personalized search framework to utilize folksonomy for personalized search. Specifically, three properties of folksonomy, namely the categorization, keyword, and structure property, are explored. In the framework, the rank of a web page is decided not only by the term matching between the query and the web page's content but also by the topic matching between the user's interests and the web page's topics. In the evaluation, we propose an automatic evaluation framework based on folksonomy data, which is able to help lighten the common high cost in personalized search evaluations. A series of experiments are conducted using two heterogeneous data sets, one crawled from Del.icio.us and the other from Dogear. Extensive experimental results show that our personalized search approach can significantly improve the search quality.
1390364	To personalize or not to personalize: modeling queries with variation in user intent In most previous work on personalized search algorithms, the results for all queries are personalized in the same manner. However, as we show in this paper, there is a lot of variation across queries in the benefits that can be achieved through personalization. For some queries, everyone who issues the query is looking for the same thing. For other queries, different people want very different results even though they express their need in the same way. We examine variability in user intent using both explicit relevance judgments and large-scale log analysis of user behavior patterns. While variation in user behavior is correlated with variation in explicit relevance judgments the same query, there are many other factors, such as result entropy, result quality, and task that can also affect the variation in behavior. We characterize queries using a variety of features of the query, the results returned for the query, and people's interaction history with the query. Using these features we build predictive models to identify queries that can benefit from personalization.
1390366	The opposite of smoothing: a language model approach to ranking query-specific document clusters Exploiting information induced from (query-specific) clustering of top-retrieved documents has long been proposed as means for improving precision at the very top ranks of the returned results. We present a novel language model approach to ranking query-specific clusters by the presumed percentage of relevant documents that they contain. While most previous cluster ranking approaches focus on the cluster as a whole, our model also exploits information induced from documents associated with the cluster. Our model substantially outperforms previous approaches for identifying clusters containing a high relevant-document percentage. Furthermore, using the model to produce document ranking yields precision-at-top-ranks performance that is consistently better than that of the initial ranking upon which clustering is performed; the performance also favorably compares with that of a state-of-the-art pseudo-feedback retrieval method.
1390367	Enhancing text clustering by leveraging Wikipedia semantics Most traditional text clustering methods are based on "bag of words" ( BOW ) representation based on frequency statistics in a set of documents. BOW , however, ignores the important information on the semantic relationships between key terms. To overcome this problem, several methods have been proposed to enrich text representation with external resource in the past, such as WordNet. However, many of these approaches suffer from some limitations: 1) WordNet has limited coverage and has a lack of effective word-sense disambiguation ability; 2) Most of the text representation enrichment strategies, which append or replace document terms with their hypernym and synonym, are overly simple. In this paper, to overcome these deficiencies, we first propose a way to build a concept thesaurus based on the semantic relations (synonym, hypernym, and associative relation) extracted from Wikipedia. Then, we develop a unified framework to leverage these semantic relations in order to enhance traditional content similarity measure for text clustering. The experimental results on Reuters and OHSUMED datasets show that with the help of Wikipedia thesaurus, the clustering performance of our method is improved as compared to previous methods. In addition, with the optimized weights for hypernym, synonym, and associative concepts that are tuned with the help of a few labeled data users provided, the clustering performance can be further improved.
1390374	A study of methods for negative relevance feedback Negative relevance feedback is a special case of relevance feedback where we do not have any positive example; this often happens when the topic is difficult and the search results are poor. Although in principle any standard relevance feedback technique can be applied to negative relevance feedback, it may not perform well due to the lack of positive examples. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of methods for negative relevance feedback. We compare a set of representative negative feedback methods, covering vector-space models and language models, as well as several special heuristics for negative feedback. Evaluating negative feedback methods requires a test set with sufficient difficult topics, but there are not many naturally difficult topics in the existing test collections. We use two sampling strategies to adapt a test collection with easy topics to evaluate negative feedback. Experiment results on several TREC collections show that language model based negative feedback methods are generally more effective than those based on vector-space models, and using multiple negative models is an effective heuristic for negative feedback. Our results also show that it is feasible to adapt test collections with easy topics for evaluating negative feedback methods through sampling.
1390375	A bayesian logistic regression model for active relevance feedback Relevance feedback, which traditionally uses the terms in the relevant documents to enrich the user's initial query, is an effective method for improving retrieval performance. The traditional relevance feedback algorithms lead to overfitting because of the limited amount of training data and large term space. This paper introduces an online Bayesian logistic regression algorithm to incorporate relevance feedback information. The new approach addresses the overfitting problem by projecting the original feature space onto a more compact set which retains the necessary information. The new set of features consist of the original retrieval score, the distance to the relevant documents and the distance to non-relevant documents. To reduce the human evaluation effort in ascertaining relevance, we introduce a new active learning algorithm based on variance reduction to actively select documents for user evaluation. The new active learning algorithm aims to select feedback documents to reduce the model variance. The variance reduction approach leads to capturing relevance, diversity and uncertainty of the unlabeled documents in a principled manner. These are the critical factors of active learning indicated in previous literature. Experiments with several TREC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
1390376	A cluster-based resampling method for pseudo-relevance feedback Typical pseudo-relevance feedback methods assume the top-retrieved documents are relevant and use these pseudo-relevant documents to expand terms. The initial retrieval set can, however, contain a great deal of noise. In this paper, we present a cluster-based resampling method to select better pseudo-relevant documents based on the relevance model. The main idea is to use document clusters to find dominant documents for the initial retrieval set, and to repeatedly feed the documents to emphasize the core topics of a query. Experimental results on large-scale web TREC collections show significant improvements over the relevance model. For justification of the resampling approach, we examine relevance density of feedback documents. A higher relevance density will result in greater retrieval accuracy, ultimately approaching true relevance feedback. The resampling approach shows higher relevance density than the baseline relevance model on all collections, resulting in better retrieval accuracy in pseudo-relevance feedback. This result indicates that the proposed method is effective for pseudo-relevance feedback.
1390377	Selecting good expansion terms for pseudo-relevance feedback Pseudo-relevance feedback assumes that most frequent terms in the pseudo-feedback documents are useful for the retrieval. In this study, we re-examine this assumption and show that it does not hold in reality - many expansion terms identified in traditional approaches are indeed unrelated to the query and harmful to the retrieval. We also show that good expansion terms cannot be distinguished from bad ones merely on their distributions in the feedback documents and in the whole collection. We then propose to integrate a term classification process to predict the usefulness of expansion terms. Multiple additional features can be integrated in this process. Our experiments on three TREC collections show that retrieval effectiveness can be much improved when term classification is used. In addition, we also demonstrate that good terms should be identified directly according to their possible impact on the retrieval effectiveness, i.e. using supervised learning, instead of unsupervised learning.
1390379	Learning to rank with partially-labeled data Ranking algorithms, whose goal is to appropriately order a set of objects/documents, are an important component of information retrieval systems. Previous work on ranking algorithms has focused on cases where only labeled data is available for training (i.e. supervised learning). In this paper, we consider the question whether unlabeled (test) data can be exploited to improve ranking performance. We present a framework for transductive learning of ranking functions and show that the answer is affirmative. Our framework is based on generating better features from the test data (via KernelPCA) and incorporating such features via Boosting, thus learning different ranking functions adapted to the individual test queries. We evaluate this method on the LETOR (TREC, OHSUMED) dataset and demonstrate significant improvements.
1390380	Learning to rank with SoftRank and Gaussian processes In this paper we address the issue of learning to rank for document retrieval using Thurstonian models based on sparse Gaussian processes. Thurstonian models represent each document for a given query as a probability distribution in a score space; these distributions over scores naturally give rise to distributions over document rankings. However, in general we do not have observed rankings with which to train the model; instead, each document in the training set is judged to have a particular relevance level: for example "Bad", "Fair", "Good", or "Excellent". The performance of the model is then evaluated using information retrieval (IR) metrics such as Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Recently Taylor et al. presented a method called SoftRank which allows the direct gradient optimisation of a smoothed version of NDCG using a Thurstonian model. In this approach, document scores are represented by the outputs of a neural network, and score distributions are created artificially by adding random noise to the scores. The SoftRank mechanism is a general one; it can be applied to different IR metrics, and make use of different underlying models. In this paper we extend the SoftRank framework to make use of the score uncertainties which are naturally provided by a Gaussian process (GP), which is a probabilistic non-linear regression model. We further develop the model by using sparse Gaussian process techniques, which give improved performance and efficiency, and show competitive results against baseline methods when tested on the publicly available LETOR OHSUMED data set. We also explore how the available uncertainty information can be used in prediction and how it affects model performance.
1390381	Learning to rank at query-time using association rules Some applications have to present their results in the form of ranked lists. This is the case of many information retrieval applications, in which documents must be sorted according to their relevance to a given query. This has led the interest of the information retrieval community in methods that automatically learn effective ranking functions. In this paper we propose a novel method which uncovers patterns (or rules) in the training data associating features of the document with its relevance to the query, and then uses the discovered rules to rank documents. To address typical problems that are inherent to the utilization of association rules (such as missing rules and rule explosion), the proposed method generates rules on a demand-driven basis, at query-time. The result is an extremely fast and effective ranking method. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using the LETOR benchmark collections. We show that generating rules on a demand-driven basis can boost ranking performance, providing gains ranging from 12% to 123%, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods that learn to rank, with no need of time-consuming and laborious pre-processing. As a highlight, we also show that additional information, such as query terms, can make the generated rules more discriminative, further improving ranking performance.
1390384	Query-sensitive mutual reinforcement chain and its application in query-oriented multi-document summarization Sentence ranking is the issue of most concern in document summarization. Early researchers have presented the mutual reinforcement principle (MR) between sentence and term for simultaneous key phrase and salient sentence extraction in generic single-document summarization. In this work, we extend the MR to the mutual reinforcement chain (MRC) of three different text granularities, i.e., document, sentence and terms. The aim is to provide a general reinforcement framework and a formal mathematical modeling for the MRC. Going one step further, we incorporate the query influence into the MRC to cope with the need for query-oriented multi-document summarization. While the previous summarization approaches often calculate the similarity regardless of the query, we develop a query-sensitive similarity to measure the affinity between the pair of texts. When evaluated on the DUC 2005 dataset, the experimental results suggest that the proposed query-sensitive MRC (Qs-MRC) is a promising approach for summarization.
1390385	Comments-oriented document summarization: understanding documents with readers' feedback Comments left by readers on Web documents contain valuable information that can be utilized in different information retrieval tasks including document search, visualization, and summarization. In this paper, we study the problem of comments-oriented document summarization and aim to summarize a Web document (e.g., a blog post) by considering not only its content, but also the comments left by its readers. We identify three relations (namely, topic, quotation, and mention ) by which comments can be linked to one another, and model the relations in three graphs. The importance of each comment is then scored by: (i) graph-based method , where the three graphs are merged into a multi-relation graph; (ii) tensor-based method , where the three graphs are used to construct a 3rd-order tensor. To generate a comments-oriented summary, we extract sentences from the given Web document using either feature-biased approach or uniform-document approach . The former scores sentences to bias keywords derived from comments; while the latter scores sentences uniformly with comments. In our experiments using a set of blog posts with manually labeled sentences, our proposed summarization methods utilizing comments showed significant improvement over those not using comments. The methods using feature-biased sentence extraction approach were observed to outperform that using uniform-document approach.
1390386	Multi-document summarization using cluster-based link analysis The Markov Random Walk model has been recently exploited for multi-document summarization by making use of the link relationships between sentences in the document set, under the assumption that all the sentences are indistinguishable from each other. However, a given document set usually covers a few topic themes with each theme represented by a cluster of sentences. The topic themes are usually not equally important and the sentences in an important theme cluster are deemed more salient than the sentences in a trivial theme cluster. This paper proposes the Cluster-based Conditional Markov Random Walk Model (ClusterCMRW) and the Cluster-based HITS Model (ClusterHITS) to fully leverage the cluster-level information. Experimental results on the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets demonstrate the good effectiveness of our proposed summarization models. The results also demonstrate that the ClusterCMRW model is more robust than the ClusterHITS model, with respect to different cluster numbers.
1390387	Multi-document summarization via sentence-level semantic analysis and symmetric matrix factorization Multi-document summarization aims to create a compressed summary while retaining the main characteristics of the original set of documents. Many approaches use statistics and machine learning techniques to extract sentences from documents. In this paper, we propose a new multi-document summarization framework based on sentence-level semantic analysis and symmetric non-negative matrix factorization. We first calculate sentence-sentence similarities using semantic analysis and construct the similarity matrix. Then symmetric matrix factorization, which has been shown to be equivalent to normalized spectral clustering, is used to group sentences into clusters. Finally, the most informative sentences are selected from each group to form the summary. Experimental results on DUC2005 and DUC2006 data sets demonstrate the improvement of our proposed framework over the implemented existing summarization systems. A further study on the factors that benefit the high performance is also conducted.
1390389	Algorithmic mediation for collaborative exploratory search We describe a new approach to information retrieval: algorithmic mediation for intentional, synchronous collaborative exploratory search. Using our system, two or more users with a common information need search together, simultaneously. The collaborative system provides tools, user interfaces and, most importantly, algorithmically-mediated retrieval to focus, enhance and augment the team's search and communication activities. Collaborative search outperformed post hoc merging of similarly instrumented single user runs. Algorithmic mediation improved both collaborative search (allowing a team of searchers to find relevant information more efficiently and effectively), and exploratory search (allowing the searchers to find relevant information that cannot be found while working individually).
1390392	A user browsing model to predict search engine click data from past observations. Search engine click logs provide an invaluable source of relevance information but this information is biased because we ignore which documents from the result list the users have actually seen before and after they clicked. Otherwise, we could estimate document relevance by simple counting. In this paper, we propose a set of assumptions on user browsing behavior that allows the estimation of the probability that a document is seen, thereby providing an unbiased estimate of document relevance. To train, test and compare our model to the best alternatives described in the Literature, we gather a large set of real data and proceed to an extensive cross-validation experiment. Our solution outperforms very significantly all previous models. As a side effect, we gain insight into the browsing behavior of users and we can compare it to the conclusions of an eye-tracking experiments by Joachims et al. [12]. In particular, our findings confirm that a user almost always see the document directly after a clicked document. They also explain why documents situated just after a very relevant document are clicked more often.
1390393	Learning query intent from regularized click graphs This work presents the use of click graphs in improving query intent classifiers, which are critical if vertical search and general-purpose search services are to be offered in a unified user interface. Previous works on query classification have primarily focused on improving feature representation of queries, e.g. , by augmenting queries with search engine results. In this work, we investigate a completely orthogonal approach --- instead of enriching feature representation, we aim at drastically increasing the amounts of training data by semi-supervised learning with click graphs. Specifically, we infer class memberships of unlabeled queries from those of labeled ones according to their proximities in a click graph. Moreover, we regularize the learning with click graphs by content-based classification to avoid propagating erroneous labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in two different applications, product intent and job intent classification. In both cases, we expand the training data with automatically labeled queries by over two orders of magnitude, leading to significant improvements in classification performance. An additional finding is that with a large amount of training data obtained in this fashion, classifiers using only query words/phrases as features can work remarkably well.
1390394	Retrieval and feedback models for blog feed search Blog feed search poses different and interesting challenges from traditional ad hoc document retrieval. The units of retrieval, the blogs, are collections of documents, the blog posts. In this work we adapt a state-of-the-art federated search model to the feed retrieval task, showing a significant improvement over algorithms based on the best performing submissions in the TREC 2007 Blog Distillation task[12]. We also show that typical query expansion techniques such as pseudo-relevance feedback using the blog corpus do not provide any significant performance improvement and in many cases dramatically hurt performance. We perform an in-depth analysis of the behavior of pseudo-relevance feedback for this task and develop a novel query expansion technique using the link structure in Wikipedia. This query expansion technique provides significant and consistent performance improvements for this task, yielding a 22% and 14% improvement in MAP over the unexpanded query for our baseline and federated algorithms respectively.
1390396	Learning to reduce the semantic gap in web image retrieval and annotation We study in this paper the problem of bridging the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level semantic concepts, which is the key hindrance in content-based image retrieval. Piloted by the rich textual information of Web images, the proposed framework tries to learn a new distance measure in the visual space, which can be used to retrieve more semantically relevant images for any unseen query image. The framework differentiates with traditional distance metric learning methods in the following ways. 1) A ranking-based distance metric learning method is proposed for image retrieval problem, by optimizing the leave-one-out retrieval performance on the training data. 2) To be scalable, millions of images together with rich textual information have been crawled from the Web to learn the similarity measure, and the learning framework particularly considers the indexing problem to ensure the retrieval efficiency. 3) To alleviate the noises in the unbalanced labels of images and fully utilize the textual information, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation based topic-level text model is introduced to define pairwise semantic similarity between any two images. The learnt distance measure can be directly applied to applications such as content-based image retrieval and search-based image annotation. Experimental results on the two applications in a two million Web image database show both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.
1390399	A few examples go a long way: constructing query models from elaborate query formulations We address a specific enterprise document search scenario, where the information need is expressed in an elaborate manner. In our scenario, information needs are expressed using a short query (of a few keywords) together with examples of key reference pages. Given this setup, we investigate how the examples can be utilized to improve the end-to-end performance on the document retrieval task. Our approach is based on a language modeling framework, where the query model is modified to resemble the example pages. We compare several methods for sampling expansion terms from the example pages to support query-dependent and query-independent query expansion; the latter is motivated by the wish to increase "aspect recall", and attempts to uncover aspects of the information need not captured by the query. For evaluation purposes we use the CSIRO data set created for the TREC 2007 Enterprise track. The best performance is achieved by query models based on query-independent sampling of expansion terms from the example documents.
1390400	A unified and discriminative model for query refinement This paper addresses the issue of query refinement, which involves reformulating ill-formed search queries in order to enhance relevance of search results. Query refinement typically includes a number of tasks such as spelling error correction, word splitting, word merging, phrase segmentation, word stemming, and acronym expansion. In previous research, such tasks were addressed separately or through employing generative models. This paper proposes employing a unified and discriminative model for query refinement. Specifically, it proposes a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model suitable for the problem, referred to as Conditional Random Field for Query Refinement (CRF-QR). Given a sequence of query words, CRF-QR predicts a sequence of refined query words as well as corresponding refinement operations. In that sense, CRF-QR differs greatly from conventional CRF models. Two types of CRF-QR models, namely a basic model and an extended model are introduced. One merit of employing CRF-QR is that different refinement tasks can be performed simultaneously and thus the accuracy of refinement can be enhanced. Furthermore, the advantages of discriminative models over generative models can be fully leveraged. Experimental results demonstrate that CRF-QR can significantly outperform baseline methods. Furthermore, when CRF-QR is used in web search, a significant improvement of relevance can be obtained.
1390401	Query expansion using gaze-based feedback on the subdocument level We examine the effect of incorporating gaze-based attention feedback from the user on personalizing the search process. Employing eye tracking data, we keep track of document parts the user read in some way. We use this information on the subdocument level as implicit feedback for query expansion and reranking. We evaluated three different variants incorporating gaze data on the subdocument level and compared them against a baseline based on context on the document level. Our results show that considering reading behavior as feedback yields powerful improvements of the search result accuracy of ca. 32% in the general case. However, the extent of the improvements varies depending on the internal structure of the viewed documents and the type of the current information need.
1390403	Affective feedback: an investigation into the role of emotions in the information seeking process User feedback is considered to be a critical element in the information seeking process, especially in relation to relevance assessment. Current feedback techniques determine content relevance with respect to the cognitive and situational levels of interaction that occurs between the user and the retrieval system. However, apart from real-life problems and information objects, users interact with intentions, motivations and feelings, which can be seen as critical aspects of cognition and decision-making. The study presented in this paper serves as a starting point to the exploration of the role of emotions in the information seeking process. Results show that the latter not only interweave with different physiological, psychological and cognitive processes, but also form distinctive patterns, according to specific task, and according to specific user.
1390404	Optimizing relevance and revenue in ad search: a query substitution approach The primary business model behind Web search is based on textual advertising, where contextually relevant ads are displayed alongside search results. We address the problem of selecting these ads so that they are both relevant to the queries and profitable to the search engine, showing that optimizing ad relevance and revenue is not equivalent. Selecting the best ads that satisfy these constraints also naturally incurs high computational costs, and time constraints can lead to reduced relevance and profitability. We propose a novel two-stage approach, which conducts most of the analysis ahead of time. An offine preprocessing phase leverages additional knowledge that is impractical to use in real time, and rewrites frequent queries in a way that subsequently facilitates fast and accurate online matching. Empirical evaluation shows that our method optimized for relevance matches a state-of-the-art method while improving expected revenue. When optimizing for revenue, we see even more substantial improvements in expected revenue.
1390405	A generation model to unify topic relevance and lexicon-based sentiment for opinion retrieval Opinion retrieval is a task of growing interest in social life and academic research, which is to find relevant and opinionate documents according to a user's query. One of the key issues is how to combine a document's opinionate score (the ranking score of to what extent it is subjective or objective) and topic relevance score. Current solutions to document ranking in opinion retrieval are generally ad-hoc linear combination, which is short of theoretical foundation and careful analysis. In this paper, we focus on lexicon-based opinion retrieval. A novel generation model that unifies topic-relevance and opinion generation by a quadratic combination is proposed in this paper. With this model, the relevance-based ranking serves as the weighting factor of the lexicon-based sentiment ranking function, which is essentially different from the popular heuristic linear combination approaches. The effect of different sentiment dictionaries is also discussed. Experimental results on TREC blog datasets show the significant effectiveness of the proposed unified model. Improvements of 28.1% and 40.3% have been obtained in terms of MAP and p@10 respectively. The conclusion is not limited to blog environment. Besides the unified generation model, another contribution is that our work demonstrates that in the opinion retrieval task, a Bayesian approach to combining multiple ranking functions is superior to using a linear combination. It is also applicable to other result re-ranking applications in similar scenario.
1390407	Discriminative probabilistic models for passage based retrieval The approach of using passage-level evidence for document retrieval has shown mixed results when it is applied to a variety of test beds with different characteristics. One main reason of the inconsistent performance is that there exists no unified framework to model the evidence of individual passages within a document. This paper proposes two probabilistic models to formally model the evidence of a set of top ranked passages in a document. The first probabilistic model follows the retrieval criterion that a document is relevant if any passage in the document is relevant, and models each passage independently. The second probabilistic model goes a step further and incorporates the similarity correlations among the passages. Both models are trained in a discriminative manner. Furthermore, we present a combination approach to combine the ranked lists of document retrieval and passage-based retrieval. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on four different TREC test beds to show the effectiveness of the proposed discriminative probabilistic models for passage-based retrieval. The proposed algorithms are compared with a state-of-the-art document retrieval algorithm and a language model approach for passage-based retrieval. Furthermore, our combined approach has been shown to provide better results than both document retrieval and passage-based retrieval approaches.
1390408	A new probabilistic retrieval model based on the dirichlet compound multinomial distribution The classical probabilistic models attempt to capture the Ad hoc information retrieval problem within a rigorous probabilistic framework. It has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of the probabilistic models is the need to estimate a relevance model. The Dirichlet compound multinomial (DCM) distribution, which relies on hierarchical Bayesian modeling techniques, or the Polya Urn scheme, is a more appropriate generative model than the traditional multinomial distribution for text documents. We explore a new probabilistic model based on the DCM distribution, which enables efficient retrieval and accurate ranking. Because the DCM distribution captures the dependency of repetitive word occurrences, the new probabilistic model is able to model the concavity of the score function more effectively. To avoid the empirical tuning of retrieval parameters, we design several parameter estimation algorithms to automatically set model parameters. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-relevance feedback algorithm based on the latent mixture modeling of the Dirichlet compound multinomial distribution to further improve retrieval accuracy. Finally, our experiments show that both the baseline probabilistic retrieval algorithm based on the DCM distribution and the corresponding pseudo-relevance feedback algorithm outperform the existing language modeling systems on several TREC retrieval tasks.
1390409	TF-IDF uncovered: a study of theories and probabilities Interpretations of TF-IDF are based on binary independence retrieval, Poisson, information theory, and language modelling. This paper contributes a review of existing interpretations, and then, TF-IDF is systematically related to the probabilities P ( q | d ) and P ( d | q ). Two approaches are explored: a space of independent , and a space of disjoint terms. For independent terms, an "extreme" query/non-query term assumption uncovers TF-IDF, and an analogy of P ( d | q ) and the probabilistic odds O ( r | d , q ) mirrors relevance feedback. For disjoint terms, a relationship between probability theory and TF-IDF is established through the integral + 1/ x d x = log x . This study uncovers components such as divergence from randomness and pivoted document length to be inherent parts of a document-query independence (DQI) measure, and interestingly, an integral of the DQI over the term occurrence probability leads to TF-IDF.
1390412	BrowseRank: letting web users vote for page importance This paper proposes a new method for computing page importance, referred to as BrowseRank. The conventional approach to compute page importance is to exploit the link graph of the web and to build a model based on that graph. For instance, PageRank is such an algorithm, which employs a discrete-time Markov process as the model. Unfortunately, the link graph might be incomplete and inaccurate with respect to data for determining page importance, because links can be easily added and deleted by web content creators. In this paper, we propose computing page importance by using a 'user browsing graph' created from user behavior data. In this graph, vertices represent pages and directed edges represent transitions between pages in the users' web browsing history. Furthermore, the lengths of staying time spent on the pages by users are also included. The user browsing graph is more reliable than the link graph for inferring page importance. This paper further proposes using the continuous-time Markov process on the user browsing graph as a model and computing the stationary probability distribution of the process as page importance. An efficient algorithm for this computation has also been devised. In this way, we can leverage hundreds of millions of users' implicit voting on page importance. Experimental results show that BrowseRank indeed outperforms the baseline methods such as PageRank and TrustRank in several tasks.
1390415	Finding question-answer pairs from online forums Online forums contain a huge amount of valuable user generated content. In this paper we address the problem of extracting question-answer pairs from forums. Question-answer pairs extracted from forums can be used to help Question Answering services (e.g. Yahoo! Answers) among other applications. We propose a sequential patterns based classification method to detect questions in a forum thread, and a graph based propagation method to detect answers for questions in the same thread. Experimental results show that our techniques are very promising.
1390416	Retrieval models for question and answer archives Retrieval in a question and answer archive involves finding good answers for a user's question. In contrast to typical document retrieval, a retrieval model for this task can exploit question similarity as well as ranking the associated answers. In this paper, we propose a retrieval model that combines a translation-based language model for the question part with a query likelihood approach for the answer part. The proposed model incorporates word-to-word translation probabilities learned through exploiting different sources of information. Experiments show that the proposed translation based language model for the question part outperforms baseline methods significantly. By combining with the query likelihood language model for the answer part, substantial additional effectiveness improvements are obtained.
1390417	Predicting information seeker satisfaction in community question answering Question answering communities such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers have emerged as popular, and often effective, means of information seeking on the web. By posting questions for other participants to answer, information seekers can obtain specific answers to their questions. Users of popular portals such as Yahoo! Answers already have submitted millions of questions and received hundreds of millions of answers from other participants. However, it may also take hours --and sometime days-- until a satisfactory answer is posted. In this paper we introduce the problem of predicting information seeker satisfaction in collaborative question answering communities, where we attempt to predict whether a question author will be satisfied with the answers submitted by the community participants. We present a general prediction model, and develop a variety of content, structure, and community-focused features for this task. Our experimental results, obtained from a largescale evaluation over thousands of real questions and user ratings, demonstrate the feasibility of modeling and predicting asker satisfaction. We complement our results with a thorough investigation of the interactions and information seeking patterns in question answering communities that correlate with information seeker satisfaction. Our models and predictions could be useful for a variety of applications such as user intent inference, answer ranking, interface design, and query suggestion and routing.
1390419	Discovering key concepts in verbose queries Current search engines do not, in general, perform well with longer, more verbose queries. One of the main issues in processing these queries is identifying the key concepts that will have the most impact on effectiveness. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a technique that uses query-dependent, corpus-dependent, and corpus-independent features for automatic extraction of key concepts from verbose queries. We show that our method achieves higher accuracy in the identification of key concepts than standard weighting methods such as inverse document frequency. Finally, we propose a probabilistic model for integrating the weighted key concepts identified by our method into a query, and demonstrate that this integration significantly improves retrieval effectiveness for a large set of natural language description queries derived from TREC topics on several newswire and web collections.
1390420	Ambiguous queries: test collections need more sense Although there are many papers examining ambiguity in Information Retrieval, this paper shows that there is a whole class of ambiguous word that past research has barely explored. It is shown that the class is more ambiguous than other word types and is commonly used in queries. The lack of test collections containing ambiguous queries is highlighted and a method for creating collections from existing resources is described. Tests using the new collection show the impact of query ambiguity on an IR system: it is shown that conventional systems are incapable of dealing effectively with such queries and that current assumptions about how to improve search effectiveness do not hold when searching on this common query type.
1390423	Real-time automatic tag recommendation Tags are user-generated labels for entities. Existing research on tag recommendation either focuses on improving its accuracy or on automating the process, while ignoring the efficiency issue. We propose a highly-automated novel framework for real-time tag recommendation. The tagged training documents are treated as triplets of (words, docs, tags), and represented in two bipartite graphs, which are partitioned into clusters by Spectral Recursive Embedding (SRE). Tags in each topical cluster are ranked by our novel ranking algorithm. A two-way Poisson Mixture Model (PMM) is proposed to model the document distribution into mixture components within each cluster and aggregate words into word clusters simultaneously. A new document is classified by the mixture model based on its posterior probabilities so that tags are recommended according to their ranks. Experiments on large-scale tagging datasets of scientific documents (CiteULike) and web pages del.icio.us) indicate that our framework is capable of making tag recommendation efficiently and effectively. The average tagging time for testing a document is around 1 second, with over 88% test documents correctly labeled with the top nine tags we suggested.
1390424	Efficient top-k querying over social-tagging networks Online communities have become popular for publishing and searching content, as well as for finding and connecting to other users. User-generated content includes, for example, personal blogs, bookmarks, and digital photos. These items can be annotated and rated by different users, and these social tags and derived user-specific scores can be leveraged for searching relevant content and discovering subjectively interesting items. Moreover, the relationships among users can also be taken into consideration for ranking search results, the intuition being that you trust the recommendations of your close friends more than those of your casual acquaintances. Queries for tag or keyword combinations that compute and rank the top-k results thus face a large variety of options that complicate the query processing and pose efficiency challenges. This paper addresses these issues by developing an incremental top-k algorithm with two-dimensional expansions: social expansion considers the strength of relations among users, and semantic expansion considers the relatedness of different tags. It presents a new algorithm, based on principles of threshold algorithms, by folding friends and related tags into the search space in an incremental on-demand manner. The excellent performance of the method is demonstrated by an experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets, crawled from deli.cio.us, Flickr, and LibraryThing.
1390425	Social tag prediction In this paper, we look at the "social tag prediction" problem. Given a set of objects, and a set of tags applied to those objects by users, can we predict whether a given tag could/should be applied to a particular object? We investigated this question using one of the largest crawls of the social bookmarking system del.icio.us gathered to date. For URLs in del.icio.us, we predicted tags based on page text, anchor text, surrounding hosts, and other tags applied to the URL. We found an entropy-based metric which captures the generality of a particular tag and informs an analysis of how well that tag can be predicted. We also found that tag-based association rules can produce very high-precision predictions as well as giving deeper understanding into the relationships between tags. Our results have implications for both the study of tagging systems as potential information retrieval tools, and for the design of such systems.
1390428	A rank-aggregation approach to searching for optimal query-specific clusters To improve the precision at the very top ranks of a document list presented in response to a query, researchers suggested to exploit information induced from clustering of documents highly ranked by some initial search. We propose a novel model for ranking such ( query-specific ) clusters by the presumed percentage of relevant documents that they contain. The model is based on (i) proposing a palette of "witness" cluster properties that purportedly correlate with this percentage, (ii) devising concrete quantitative measures for these properties, and (iii) ordering the clusters via aggregation of rankings induced by these individual measures. Empirical evaluation shows that our model is consistently more effective than previously suggested methods in detecting clusters containing a high relevant-document percentage. Furthermore, the precision-at-top-ranks performance of this model transcends that of standard document-based retrieval, and competes with that of a state-of-the-art document-based retrieval approach.
1390431	SpotSigs: robust and efficient near duplicate detection in large web collections Motivated by our work with political scientists who need to manually analyze large Web archives of news sites, we present SpotSigs , a new algorithm for extracting and matching signatures for near duplicate detection in large Web crawls. Our spot signatures are designed to favor natural-language portions of Web pages over advertisements and navigational bars. The contributions of SpotSigs are twofold: 1) by combining stopword antecedents with short chains of adjacent content terms, we create robust document signatures with a natural ability to filter out noisy components of Web pages that would otherwise distract pure n-gram-based approaches such as Shingling; 2) we provide an exact and efficient , self-tuning matching algorithm that exploits a novel combination of collection partitioning and inverted index pruning for high-dimensional similarity search. Experiments confirm an increase in combined precision and recall of more than 24 percent over state-of-the-art approaches such as Shingling or I-Match and up to a factor of 3 faster execution times than Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), over a demonstrative "Gold Set" of manually assessed near-duplicate news articles as well as the TREC WT10g Web collection.
1390432	Local text reuse detection Text reuse occurs in many different types of documents and for many different reasons. One form of reuse, duplicate or near-duplicate documents, has been a focus of researchers because of its importance in Web search. Local text reuse occurs when sentences, facts or passages, rather than whole documents, are reused and modified. Detecting this type of reuse can be the basis of new tools for text analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to detecting local text reuse and compare it to other approaches. This comparison involves a study of the amount and type of reuse that occurs in real documents, including TREC newswire and blog collections.
1390433	TSCAN: a novel method for topic summarization and content anatomy A topic is defined as a seminal event or activity along with all directly related events and activities. It is represented as a chronological sequence of documents by different authors published on the Internet. In this paper, we define a task called topic anatomy, which summarizes and associates core parts of a topic graphically so that readers can understand the content easily. The proposed topic anatomy model, called TSCAN, derives the major themes of a topic from the eigenvectors of a temporal block association matrix. Then, the significant events of the themes and their summaries are extracted by examining the constitution of the eigenvectors. Finally, the extracted events are associated through their temporal closeness and context similarity to form the evolution graph of the topic. Experiments based on the official TDT4 corpus demonstrate that the generated evolution graphs comprehensibly describe the storylines of topics. Moreover, in terms of content coverage and consistency, the produced summaries are superior to those of other summarization methods based on human composed reference summaries.
1390435	A new rank correlation coefficient for information retrieval In the field of information retrieval, one is often faced with the problem of computing the correlation between two ranked lists. The most commonly used statistic that quantifies this correlation is Kendall's ?. Often times, in the information retrieval community, discrepancies among those items having high rankings are more important than those among items having low rankings. The Kendall's ? statistic, however, does not make such distinctions and equally penalizes errors both at high and low rankings. In this paper, we propose a new rank correlation coefficient, AP correlation (? ap ), that is based on average precision and has a probabilistic interpretation. We show that the proposed statistic gives more weight to the errors at high rankings and has nice mathematical properties which make it easy to interpret. We further validate the applicability of the statistic using experimental data.
1390436	Learning from labeled features using generalized expectation criteria It is difficult to apply machine learning to new domains because often we lack labeled problem instances. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem that leverages domain knowledge in the form of affinities between input features and classes. For example, in a baseball vs. hockey text classification problem, even without any labeled data, we know that the presence of the word puck is a strong indicator of hockey . We refer to this type of domain knowledge as a labeled feature . In this paper, we propose a method for training discriminative probabilistic models with labeled features and unlabeled instances. Unlike previous approaches that use labeled features to create labeled pseudo-instances, we use labeled features directly to constrain the model's predictions on unlabeled instances. We express these soft constraints using generalized expectation (GE) criteria --- terms in a parameter estimation objective function that express preferences on values of a model expectation. In this paper we train multinomial logistic regression models using GE criteria, but the method we develop is applicable to other discriminative probabilistic models. The complete objective function also includes a Gaussian prior on parameters, which encourages generalization by spreading parameter weight to unlabeled features. Experimental results on text classification data sets show that this method outperforms heuristic approaches to training classifiers with labeled features. Experiments with human annotators show that it is more beneficial to spend limited annotation time labeling features rather than labeling instances. For example, after only one minute of labeling features, we can achieve 80% accuracy on the ibm vs. mac text classification problem using GE-FL, whereas ten minutes labeling documents results in an accuracy of only 77%
1390437	A simple and efficient sampling method for estimating AP and NDCG We consider the problem of large scale retrieval evaluation. Recently two methods based on random sampling were proposed as a solution to the extensive effort required to judge tens of thousands of documents. While the first method proposed by Aslam et al. [1] is quite accurate and efficient, it is overly complex, making it difficult to be used by the community, and while the second method proposed by Yilmaz et al., infAP [14], is relatively simple, it is less efficient than the former since it employs uniform random sampling from the set of complete judgments. Further, none of these methods provide confidence intervals on the estimated values. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (1) we derive confidence intervals for infAP, (2) we extend infAP to incorporate nonrandom relevance judgments by employing stratified random sampling, hence combining the efficiency of stratification with the simplicity of random sampling, (3) we describe how this approach can be utilized to estimate nDCG from incomplete judgments. We validate the proposed methods using TREC data and demonstrate that these new methods can be used to incorporate nonrandom samples, as were available in TREC Terabyte track '06.
1390438	A general optimization framework for smoothing language models on graph structures Recent work on language models for information retrieval has shown that smoothing language models is crucial for achieving good retrieval performance. Many different effective smoothing methods have been proposed, which mostly implement various heuristics to exploit corpus structures. In this paper, we propose a general and unified optimization framework for smoothing language models on graph structures. This framework not only provides a unified formulation of the existing smoothing heuristics, but also serves as a road map for systematically exploring smoothing methods for language models. We follow this road map and derive several different instantiations of the framework. Some of the instantiations lead to novel smoothing methods. Empirical results show that all such instantiations are effective with some outperforming the state of the art smoothing methods.
1390440	Deep classification in large-scale text hierarchies Most classification algorithms are best at categorizing the Web documents into a few categories, such as the top two levels in the Open Directory Project. Such a classification method does not give very detailed topic-related class information for the user because the first two levels are often too coarse. However, classification on a large-scale hierarchy is known to be intractable for many target categories with cross-link relationships among them. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-classification approach to categorize Web documents into categories in a large-scale taxonomy. The approach consists of two stages: a search stage and a classification stage. In the first stage, a category-search algorithm is used to acquire the category candidates for a given document. Based on the category candidates, we prune the large-scale hierarchy to focus our classification effort on a small subset of the original hierarchy. As a result, the classification model is trained on the small subset before being applied to assign the category for a new document. Since the category candidates are sufficiently close to each other in the hierarchy, a statistical-language-model based classifier using n-gram features is exploited. Furthermore, the structure of the taxonomy can be utilized in this stage to improve the performance of classification. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms on the Open Directory Project with over 130,000 categories. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can reach 51.8% on the measure of Mi-F1 at the 5th level, which is 77.7% improvement over top-down based SVM classification algorithms.
1390441	Topic-bridged PLSA for cross-domain text classification In many Web applications, such as blog classification and new-sgroup classification, labeled data are in short supply. It often happens that obtaining labeled data in a new domain is expensive and time consuming, while there may be plenty of labeled data in a related but different domain. Traditional text classification ap-proaches are not able to cope well with learning across different domains. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain text classification algorithm which extends the traditional probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) algorithm to integrate labeled and unlabeled data, which come from different but related domains, into a unified probabilistic model. We call this new model Topic-bridged PLSA , or TPLSA. By exploiting the common topics between two domains, we transfer knowledge across different domains through a topic-bridge to help the text classification in the target domain. A unique advantage of our method is its ability to maximally mine knowledge that can be transferred between domains, resulting in superior performance when compared to other state-of-the-art text classification approaches. Experimental eval-uation on different kinds of datasets shows that our proposed algorithm can improve the performance of cross-domain text classification significantly.
1390445	Evaluation over thousands of queries Information retrieval evaluation has typically been performed over several dozen queries, each judged to near-completeness. There has been a great deal of recent work on evaluation over much smaller judgment sets: how to select the best set of documents to judge and how to estimate evaluation measures when few judgments are available. In light of this, it should be possible to evaluate over many more queries without much more total judging effort. The Million Query Track at TREC 2007 used two document selection algorithms to acquire relevance judgments for more than 1,800 queries. We present results of the track, along with deeper analysis: investigating tradeoffs between the number of queries and number of judgments shows that, up to a point, evaluation over more queries with fewer judgments is more cost-effective and as reliable as fewer queries with more judgments. Total assessor effort can be reduced by 95% with no appreciable increase in evaluation errors.
1390446	Novelty and diversity in information retrieval evaluation Evaluation measures act as objective functions to be optimized by information retrieval systems. Such objective functions must accurately reflect user requirements, particularly when tuning IR systems and learning ranking functions. Ambiguity in queries and redundancy in retrieved documents are poorly reflected by current evaluation measures. In this paper, we present a framework for evaluation that systematically rewards novelty and diversity. We develop this framework into a specific evaluation measure, based on cumulative gain. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a test collection based on the TREC question answering track.
1390447	Relevance assessment: are judges exchangeable and does it matter We investigate to what extent people making relevance judgements for a reusable IR test collection are exchangeable. We consider three classes of judge: "gold standard" judges, who are topic originators and are experts in a particular information seeking task; "silver standard" judges, who are task experts but did not create topics; and "bronze standard" judges, who are those who did not define topics and are not experts in the task. Analysis shows low levels of agreement in relevance judgements between these three groups. We report on experiments to determine if this is sufficient to invalidate the use of a test collection for measuring system performance when relevance assessments have been created by silver standard or bronze standard judges. We find that both system scores and system rankings are subject to consistent but small differences across the three assessment sets. It appears that test collections are not completely robust to changes of judge when these judges vary widely in task and topic expertise. Bronze standard judges may not be able to substitute for topic and task experts, due to changes in the relative performance of assessed systems, and gold standard judges are preferred.
1390453	A new interpretation of average precision We consider the question of whether Average Precision, as a measure of retrieval effectiveness, can be regarded as deriving from a model of user searching behaviour. It turns out that indeed it can be so regarded, under a very simple stochastic model of user behaviour.
1390462	Exploring mouse movements for inferring query intent Clickthrough on search results have been successfully used to infer user interest and preferences, but are often noisy and potentially ambiguous. We explore the potential of a complementary, more sensitive signal -mouse movements- in providing insights into the intent behind a web search query. We report preliminary results of studying user mouse movements on search result pages, with the goal of inferring user intent - in particular, to explore whether we can automatically distinguish the different query classes such as navigational vs. informational. Our preliminary exploration confirms the value of studying mouse movements for user intent inference, and suggests interesting avenues for future exploration.
1390473	Ranking opinionated blog posts using OpinionFinder The aim of an opinion finding system is not just to retrieve relevant documents, but to also retrieve documents that express an opinion towards the query target entity. In this work, we propose a way to use and integrate an opinion-identification toolkit, OpinionFinder, into the retrieval process of an Information Retrieval (IR) system, such that opinionated, relevant documents are retrieved in response to a query. In our experiments, we vary the number of top-ranked documents that must be parsed in response to a query, and investigate the effect on opinion retrieval performance and required parsing time. We find that opinion finding retrieval performance is improved by integrating OpinionFinder into the retrieval system, and that retrieval performance grows as more posts are parsed by OpinionFinder. However, the benefit eventually tails off at a deep rank, suggesting that an optimal setting for the system has been achieved.
1390474	Searching blogs and news: a study on popular queries Blog/news search engines are very important channels to reach information about the real-time happenings. In this paper, we study the popular queries collected over one year period and compare their search results returned by a blog search engine (i.e., Technorati) and a news search engine (i.e., Google News). We observed that the numbers of hits returned by the two search engines for the same set of queries were highly correlated, suggesting that blogs often provide commentary to current events reported in news. As many popular queries are related to some events, we further observed a high cohesiveness among the returned search results for these queries.
1390477	Exploring question subjectivity prediction in community QA In this paper we begin to investigate how to automatically determine the subjectivity orientation of questions posted by real users in community question answering (CQA) portals. Subjective questions seek answers containing private states, such as personal opinion and experience. In contrast, objective questions request objective, verifiable information, often with support from reliable sources. Knowing the question orientation would be helpful not only for evaluating answers provided by users, but also for guiding the CQA engine to process questions more intelligently. Our experiments on Yahoo! Answers data show that our method exhibits promising performance.
1390481	Combining learn-based and lexicon-based techniques for sentiment detection without using labeled examples In this work, we propose a novel scheme for sentiment classification (without labeled examples) which combines the strengths of both "learn-based" and "lexicon-based" approaches as follows: we first use a lexicon-based technique to label a portion of informative examples from given task (or domain); then learn a new supervised classifier based on these labeled ones; finally apply this classifier to the task. The experimental results indicate that proposed scheme could dramatically outperform "learn-based" and "lexicon-based" techniques.
1390486	Bloggers as experts: feed distillation using expert retrieval models We address the task of (blog) feed distillation: to find blogs that are principally devoted to a given topic. The task may be viewed as an association finding task, between topics and bloggers. Under this view, it resembles the expert finding task, for which a range of models have been proposed. We adopt two language modeling-based approaches to expert finding, and determine their effectiveness as feed distillation strategies. The two models capture the idea that a human will often search for key blogs by spotting highly relevant posts (the Posting model) or by taking global aspects of the blog into account (the Blogger model). Results show the Blogger model outperforms the Posting model and delivers state-of-the art performance, out-of-the-box.
1390517	A study of query length We analyse query length, and fit power-law and Poisson distributions to four different query sets. We provide a practical model for query length, based on the truncation of a Poisson distribution for short queries and a power-law distribution for longer queries, that better fits real query length distributions than earlier proposals.
1390541	Inferring the most important types of a query: a semantic approach In this paper we present a technique for ranking the most important types or categories for a given query. Rather than trying to find the category of the query, known as query categorization, our approach seeks to find the most important types related to the query results. Not necessarily the query category falls into this ranking of types and therefore our approach can be complementary.

291014	How reliable are the results of large-scale information retrieval experiments? Two stages in measurement of techniques for information retrieval are gathering of documents for relevance assessment and use of the assessments to numerically evaluate effectiveness. We consider both of these stages in the context of the TREC experiments, to determine whether they lead to measurements that are trustworthy and fair. Our detailed empirical investigation of the TREC results shows that the measured relative performance of systems appears to be reliable, but that recall is overestimated: it is likely that many relevant documents have not been found. We propose a new pooling strategy that can significantly in- crease the number of relevant documents found for given effort, without compromising fairness.

345562	Structured translation for cross-language information retrieval The paper introduces a query translation model that reflects the structure of the cross-language information retrieval task. The model is based on a structured bilingual dictionary in which the translations of each term are clustered into groups with distinct meanings. Query translation is modeled as a two-stage process, with the system first determining the intended meaning of a query term and then selecting translations appropriate to that meaning that might appear in the document collection. An implementation of structured translation based on automatic dictionary clustering is described and evaluated by using Chinese queries to retrieve English documents. Structured translation achieved an average precision that was statistically indistinguishable from Pirkola's technique for very short queries, but Pirkola's technique outperformed structured translation on long queries. The paper concludes with some observations on future work to improve retrieval effectiveness and on other potential uses of structured translation in interactive cross-language retrieval applications.
345564	Document centered approach to text normalization In this paper we present an approach to tackle three important problems of text normalization: sentence boundary disambiguation, disambiguation of capitalized words when they are used in positions where capitalization is expected, and identification of abbreviations. The main feature of our approach is that it uses a minimum of pre-built resources, instead dynamically inferring disambiguation clues from the entire document itself. This makes it domain independent, closely targeted to each individual document and portable to other languages. We thoroughly evaluated this approach on several corpora and it showed high accuracy.
345565	OCELOT: a system for summarizing Web pages We introduce OCELOT, a prototype system for automatically generating the âgistâ of a web page by summarizing it. Although most text summarization research to date has focused on the task of news articles, web pages are quite different in both structure and content. Instead of coherent text with a well-defined discourse structure, they are more often likely to be a chaotic jumble of phrases, links, graphics and formatting commands. Such text provides little foothold for extractive summarization techniques, which attempt to generate a summary of a document by excerpting a contiguous, coherent span of text from it. This paper builds upon recent work in non-extractive summarization, producing the gist of a web page by âtranslatingâ it into a more concise representation rather than attempting to extract a text span verbatim. OCELOT uses probabilistic models to guide it in selecting and ordering words into a gist. This paper describes a technique for learning these models automatically from a collection of human-summarized web pages.
345566	Extracting sentence segments for text summarization: a machine learning approach With the proliferation of the Internet and the huge amount of data it transfers, text summarization is becoming more important. We present an approach to the design of an automatic text summarizer that generates a summary by extracting sentence segments. First, sentences are broken into segments by special cue markers. Each segment is represented by a set of predefined features (e.g. location of the segment, average term frequencies of the words occurring in the segment, number of title words in the segment, and the like). Then a supervised learning algorithm is used to train the summarizer to extract important sentence segments, based on the feature vector. Results of experiments on U.S. patents indicate that the performance of the proposed approach compares very favorably with other approaches (including Microsoft Word summarizer) in terms of precision, recall, and classification accuracy.
345569	An experimental comparison of naive Bayesian and keyword-based anti-spam filtering with personal e-mail messages The growing problem of unsolicited bulk e-mail, also known as âspamâ, has generated a need for reliable anti-spam e-mail filters. Filters of this type have so far been based mostly on manually constructed keyword patterns. An alternative approach has recently been proposed, whereby a Naive Bayesian classifier is trained automatically to detect spam messages. We test this approach on a large collection of personal e-mail messages, which we make publicly available in âencryptedâ form contributing towards standard benchmarks. We introduce appropriate cost-sensitive measures, investigating at the same time the effect of attribute-set size, training-corpus size, lemmatization, and stop lists, issues that have not been explored in previous experiments. Finally, the Naive Bayesian filter is compared, in terms of performance, to a filter that uses keyword patterns, and which is part of a widely used e-mail reader.
345572	Text filtering by boosting naive Bayes classifiers Several machine learning algorithms have recently been used for text categorization and filtering. In particular, boosting methods such as AdaBoost have shown good performance applied to real text data. However, most of existing boosting algorithms are based on classifiers that use binary-valued features. Thus, they do not fully make use of the weight information provided by standard term weighting methods. In this paper, we present a boosting-based learning method for text filtering that uses naive Bayes classifiers as a weak learner. The use of naive Bayes allows the boosting algorithm to utilize term frequency information while maintaining probabilistically accurate confidence ratio. Applied to TREC-7 and TREC-8 filtering track documents, the proposed method obtained a significant improvement in LF1, LF2, F1 and F3 measures compared to the best results submitted by other TREC entries.
345574	Question-answering by predictive annotation We present a new technique for question answering called Predictive Annotation. Predictive Annotation identifies potential answers to questions in text, annotates them accordingly and indexes them. This technique, along with a complementary analysis of questions, passage-level ranking and answer selection, produces a system effective at answering natural-language fact-seeking questions posed against large document collections. Experimental results show the effects of different parameter settings and lead to a number of general observations about the question-answering problem.
345576	Bridging the lexical chasm: statistical approaches to answer-finding This paper investigates whether a machine can automatically learn the task of finding, within a large collection of candidate responses, the answers to questions. The learning process consists of inspecting a collection of answered questions and characterizing the relation between question and answer with a statistical model. For the purpose of learning this relation, we propose two sources of data: Usenet FAQ documents and customer service call-center dialogues from a large retail company. We will show that the task of âanswer-findingâ differs from both document retrieval and tradition question-answering, presenting challenges different from those found in these problems. The central aim of this work is to discover, through theoretical and empirical investigation, those statistical techniques best suited to the answer-finding problem.
345577	Building a question answering test collection The TREC-8 Question Answering (QA) Track was the first large-scale evaluation of domain-independent question answering systems. In addition to fostering research on the QA task, the track was used to investigate whether the evaluation methodology used for document retrieval is appropriate for a different natural language processing task. As with document relevance judging, assessors had legitimate differences of opinions as to whether a response actually answers a question, but comparative evaluation of QA systems was stable despite these differences. Creating a reusable QA test collection is fundamentally more difficult than creating a document retrieval test collection since the QA task has no equivalent to document identifiers.
345578	Document clustering using word clusters via the information bottleneck method We present a novel implementation of the recently introduced information bottleneck method for unsupervised document clustering. Given a joint empirical distribution of words and documents, p ( x , y ), we first cluster the words, Y , so that the obtained word clusters, Ytilde;, maximally preserve the information on the documents. The resulting joint distribution. p ( X , Ytilde; ), contains most of the original information about the documents, I ( X ; Ytilde; ) &ap; I ( X ; Y ), but it is much less sparse and noisy. Using the same procedure we then cluster the documents, X , so that the information about the word-clusters is preserved. Thus, we first find word-clusters that capture most of the mutual information about to set of documents, and then find document clusters , that preserve the information about the word clusters. We tested this procedure over several document collections based on subsets taken from the standard 20 Newsgroups corpus. The results were assessed by calculating the correlation between the document clusters and the correct labels for these documents. Finding from our experiments show that this double clustering procedure, which uses the information bottleneck method, yields significantly superior performance compared to other common document distributional clustering algorithms. Moreover, the double clustering procedure improves all the distributional clustering methods examined here.
345579	Latent semantic space: iterative scaling improves precision of inter-document similarity measurement We present a novel algorithm that creates document vectors with reduced dimensionality. This work was motivated by an application characterizing relationships among documents in a collection. Our algorithm yielded inter-document similarities with an average precision up to 17.8% higher than that of singular value decomposition (SVD) used for Latent Semantic Indexing. The best performance was achieved with dimensional reduction rates that were 43% higher than SVD on average. Our algorithm creates basis vectors for a reduced space by iteratively âscalingâ vectors and computing eigenvectors. Unlike SVD, it breaks the symmetry of documents and terms to capture information more evenly across documents. We also discuss correlation with a probabilistic model and evaluate a method for selecting the dimensionality using log-likelihood estimation.
345582	An investigation of linguistic features and clustering algorithms for topical document clustering We investigate four hierarchical clustering methods (single-link, complete-link, groupwise-average, and single-pass) and two linguistically motivated text features (noun phrase heads and proper names) in the context of document clustering. A statistical model for combining similarity information from multiple sources is described and applied to DARPA's Topic Detection and Tracking phase 2 (TDT2) data. This model, based on log-linear regression, alleviates the need for extensive search in order to determine optimal weights for combining input features. Through an extensive series of experiments with more than 40,000 documents from multiple news sources and modalities, we establish that both the choice of clustering algorithm and the introduction of the additional features have an impact on clustering performance. We apply our optimal combination of features to the TDT2 test data, obtaining partitions of the documents that compare favorably with the results obtained by participants in the official TDT2 competition.
345584	The impact of database selection on distributed searching The proliferation of online information resources increases the importance of effective and efficient distributed searching. Distributed searching is cast in three parts â database selection, query processing, and results merging. In this paper we examine the effect of database selection on retrieval performance. We look at retrieval performance in three different distributed retrieval testbeds and distill some general results. First we find that good database selection can result in better retrieval effectiveness than can be achieved in a centralized database. Second we find that good performance can be achieved when only a few sites are selected and that the performance generally increases as more sites are selected. Finally we find that when database selection is employed, it is not necessary to maintain collection wide information (CWI), e.g. global idf. Local information can be used to achieve superior performance. This means that distributed systems can be engineered with more autonomy and less cooperation. This work suggests that improvements in database selection can lead to broader improvements in retrieval performance, even in centralized (i.e. single database) systems. Given a centralized database and a good selection mechanism, retrieval performance can be improved by decomposing that database conceptually and employing a selection step.
345591	Partial collection replication versus caching for information retrieval systems The explosion of content in distributed information retrieval (IR) systems requires new mechanisms to attain timely and accurate retrieval of unstructured text. In this paper, we compare two mechanisms to improve IR system performance: partial collection replication and caching. When queries have locality, both mechanisms return results more quickly than sending queries to the original collection(s). Caches return results when queries exactly match a previous one. Partial replicas are a form of caching that return results when the IR technology determines the query is a good match. Caches are simpler and faster, but replicas can increase locality by detecting similarity between queries that are not exactly the same. We use real traces from THOMAS and Excite to measure query locality and similarity. With a very restrictive definition of query similarity, similarity improves query locality up to 15% over exact match. We use a validated simulator to compare their performance, and find that even if the partial replica hit rate increases only 3 to 6%, it will outperform simple caching under a variety of configurations. A combined approach will probably yield the best performance.
345593	Hierarchical classification of Web content This paper explores the use of hierarchical structure for classifying a large, heterogeneous collection of web content. The hierarchical structure is initially used to train different second-level classifiers. In the hierarchical case, a model is learned to distinguish a second-level category from other categories within the same top level. In the flat non-hierarchical case, a model distinguishes a second-level category from all other second-level categories. Scoring rules can further take advantage of the hierarchy by considering only second-level categories that exceed a threshold at the top level. We use support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, which have been shown to be efficient and effective for classification, but not previously explored in the context of hierarchical classification. We found small advantages in accuracy for hierarchical models over flat models. For the hierarchical approach, we found the same accuracy using a sequential Boolean decision rule and a multiplicative decision rule. Since the sequential approach is much more efficient, requiring only 14%-16% of the comparisons used in the other approaches, we find it to be a good choice for classifying text into large hierarchical structures.
345594	A practical hypertext catergorization method using links and incrementally available class information As WWW grows at an increasing speed, a classifier targeted at hypertext has become in high demand. While document categorization is quite a mature, the issue of utilizing hypertext structure and hyperlinks has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a practical method for enhancing both the speed and the quality of hypertext categorization using hyperlinks. In comparison against a recently proposed technique that appears to be the only one of the kind, we obtained up to 18.5% of improvement in effectiveness while reducing the processing time dramatically. We attempt to explain through experiments what factors contribute to the improvement.
345597	Topical locality in the Web Most web pages are linked to others with related content . This idea, combined with another that says that text in, and possibly around, HTML anchors describe the pages to which they point , is the foundation for a usable World-Wide Web. In this paper, we examine to what extent these ideas hold by empirically testing whether topical locality mirrors spatial locality of pages on the Web. In particular, we find that the likelihood of linked pages having similar textual content to be high; the similarity of sibling pages increases when the links from the parent are close together; titles, descriptions, and anchor text represent at least part of the target page; and that anchor text may be a useful discriminator among unseen child pages. These results show the foundations necessary for the success of many web systems, including search engines, focused crawlers, linkage analyzers, and intelligent web agents.
345598	Interactive Internet search: keyword, directory and query reformulation mechanisms compared This article compares search effectiveness when using query-based Internet search (via the Google search engine), directory-based search (via Yahoo) and phrase-based query reformulation assisted search (via the Hyperindex browser) by means of a controlled, user-based experimental study. The focus was to evaluate aspects of the search process. Cognitive load was measured using a secondary digit-monitoring task to quantify the effort of the user in various search states; independent relevance judgements were employed to gauge the quality of the documents accessed during the search process. Time was monitored in various search states. Results indicated the directory-based search does not offer increased relevance over the query-based search (with or without query formulation assistance), and also takes longer. Query reformulation does significantly improve the relevance of the documents through which the user must trawl versus standard query-based internet search. However, the improvement in document relevance comes at the cost of increased search time and increased cognitive load.
345602	Incorporating quality metrics in centralized/distributed information retrieval on the World Wide Web Most information retrieval systems on the Internet rely primarily on similarity ranking algorithms based solely on term frequency statistics. Information quality is usually ignored. This leads to the problem that documents are retrieved without regard to their quality. We present an approach that combines similarity-based similarity ranking with quality ranking in centralized and distributed search environments. Six quality metrics, including the currency , availability , information-to-noise ratio , authority , popularity , and cohesiveness , were investigated. Search effectiveness was significantly improved when the currency, availability, information-to-noise ratio and page cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in centralized search. The improvement seen when the availability, information-to- noise ratio, popularity, and cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in site selection was also significant. Finally, incorporating the popularity metric in information fusion resulted in a significant improvement. In summary, the results show that incorporating quality metrics can generally improve search effectiveness in both centralized and distributed search environments.
345603	Does âauthorityâ mean quality? predicting expert quality ratings of Web documents For many topics, the World Wide Web contains hundreds or thousands of relevant documents of widely varying quality. Users face a daunting challenge in identifying a small subset of documents worthy of their attention. Link analysis algorithms have received much interest recently, in large part for their potential to identify high quality items. We report here on an experimental evaluation of this potential. We evaluated a number of link and content-based algorithms using a dataset of web documents rated for quality by human topic experts. Link-based metrics did a good job of picking out high-quality items. Precision at 5 is about 0.75, and precision at 10 is about 0.55; this is in a dataset where 0.32 of all documents were of high quality. Surprisingly, a simple content-based metric performed nearly as well; ranking documents by the total number of pages on their containing site.
345610	New paradigms in information visualization (poster session) We present three new visualization front-ends that aid navigation through the set of documents returned by a search engine (hit documents). We cluster the hit documents to visually group these documents and label the groups with related words. The different front-ends cater for different user needs, but all can browse cluster information as well as drilling up or down in one or more clusters and refining the search using one or more of the suggested related keywords.
345646	Collaborative filtering and the generalized vector space model (poster session) Collaborative filtering is a technique for recommending documents to users based on how similar their tastes are to other users. If two users tend to agree on what they like, the system will recommend the same documents to them. The generalized vector space model of information retrieval represents a document by a vector of its similarities to all other documents. The process of collaborative filtering is nearly identical to the process of retrieval using GVSM in a matrix of user ratings. Using this observation, a model for filtering collaboratively using document content is possible.
345658	SWAMI (poster session): a framework for collaborative filtering algorithm development and evaluation We present a Java-based framework, SWAMI (Shared Wisdom through the Amalgamation of Many Interpretations) for building and studying collaborative filtering systems. SWAMI consists of three components: a prediction engine, an evaluation system, and a visualization component. The prediction engine provides a common interface for implementing different prediction algorithms. The evaluation system provides a standardized testing methodology and metrics for analyzing the accuracy and run-time performance of prediction algorithms. The visualization component suggests how graphical representations can inform the development and analysis of prediction algorithms. We demonstrate SWAMI on the Each Movie data set by comparing three prediction algorithms: a traditional Pearson correlation-based method, support vector machines, and a new accurate and scalable correlation-based method based on clustering techniques.
345661	Effects of out of vocabulary words in spoken document retrieval (poster session) The effects of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) items in spoken document retrieval (SDR) are investigated. Several sets of transcriptions were created for the TREC-8 SDR task using a speech recognition system varying the vocabulary sizes and OOV rates, and the relative retrieval performance measured. The effects of OOV terms on a simple baseline IR system and on more sophisticated retrieval systems are described. The use of a parallel corpus for query and document expansion is found to be especially beneficial, and with this data set, good retrieval performance can be achieved even for fairly high OOV rates.
345665	Bayes optimal metasearch: a probabilistic model for combining the results of multiple retrieval systems (poster session) We introduce a new, probabilistic model for combining the outputs of an arbitrary number of query retrieval systems. By gathering simple statistics on the average performance of a given set of query retrieval systems, we construct a Bayes optimal mechanism for combining the outputs of these systems. Our construction yields a metasearch strategy whose empirical performance nearly always exceeds the performance of any of the constituent systems. Our construction is also robust in the sense that if âgoodâ and âbadâ systems are combined, the Performance of the composite is still on par with, or exceeds, that of the best constituent system. Finally, our model and theory provide theoretical and empirical avenues for the improvement of this metasearch strategy.
345512	Relevance and contributing information types of searched documents in task performance End-users base the relevance judgements of the searched documents on the expected contribution to their task of the information contained in the documents. There is a shortage of studies analyzing the relationships between the experienced contribution, relevance assessments and type of information initially sought. This study categorizes the types of information in documents being used in writing a research proposal for a master's thesis by eleven students throughout the various stages of the proposal writing process. The role of the specificity of the searched information in influencing its contribution is analyzed. The results demonstrate that different types of information are sought at different stages of the writing process and thus the contribution of the information also differs at the different stages. The categories of the contributing information can be understood of topicality.
345538	Relevance feedback with a small number of relevance judgements: incremental relevance feedback vs. document clustering The use of incremental relevance feedback and document clustering were investigated in an relevance feedback environment in which the number of relevance judgements was quite small. Through experiments on the TREC collection, the incremental relevance feedback approach was found not to improve the overall search effectiveness. The clustering approach was found to be promising, although it sometimes over-focuses on a particular topic in a query and ignores the others. To overcome this problem, a query-biased clustering algorithm was developed and shown to be effective.
345539	Do batch and user evaluations give the same results? Do improvements in system performance demonstrated by batch evaluations confer the same benefit for real users? We carried out experiments designed to investigate this question. After identifying a weighting scheme that gave maximum improvement over the baseline in a non-interactive evaluation, we used it with real users searching on an instance recall task. Our results showed the weighting scheme giving beneficial results in batch studies did not do so with real users. Further analysis did identify other factors predictive of instance recall, including number of documents saved by the user, document recall, and number of documents seen by the user.
345543	Evaluating evaluation measure stability This paper presents a novel way of examining the accuracy of the evaluation measures commonly used in information retrieval experiments. It validates several of the rules-of-thumb experimenters use, such as the number of queries needed for a good experiment is at least 25 and 50 is better, while challenging other beliefs, such as the common evaluation measures are equally reliable. As an example, we show that Precision at 30 documents has about twice the average error rate as Average Precision has. These results can help information retrieval researchers design experiments that provide a desired level of confidence in their results. In particular, we suggest researchers using Web measures such as Precision at 10 documents will need to use many more than 50 queries or will have to require two methods to have a very large difference in evaluation scores before concluding that the two methods are actually different.
345545	IR evaluation methods for retrieving highly relevant documents This paper proposes evaluation methods based on the use of non-dichotomous relevance judgements in IR experiments. It is argued that evaluation methods should credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This is desirable from the user point of view in modern large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1) a novel application of P-R curves and average precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance, and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. We then demonstrate the use of these evaluation methods in a case study on the effectiveness of query types, based on combinations of query structures and expansion, in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance. The test was run with a best match retrieval system (In-Query 1 ) in a text database consisting of newspaper articles. The results indicate that the tested strong query structures are most effective in retrieving highly relevant documents. The differences between the query types are practically essential and statistically significant. More generally, the novel evaluation methods and the case demonstrate that non-dichotomous relevance assessments are applicable in IR experiments, may reveal interesting phenomena, and allow harder testing of IR methods.
345546	Automatic generation of overview timelines We present a statistical model of feature occurrence over time, and develop tests based on classical hypothesis testing for significance of term appearance on a given date. Using additional classical hypothesis testing we are able to combine these terms to generate âtopicsâ as defined by the Topic Detection and Tracking study. The groupings of terms obtained can be used to automatically generate an interactive timeline displaying the major events and topics covered by the corpus. To test the validity of our technique we extracted a large number of these topics from a test corpus and had human evaluators judge how well the selected features captured the gist of the topics, and how they overlapped with a set of known topics from the corpus. The resulting topics were highly rated by evaluators who compared them to known topics.
345548	Event tracking based on domain dependency This paper proposes a method for event tracking on broadcast news stories based on distinction between a topic and an event. A topic and an event are identified using a simple criterion called domain dependency of words: how greatly a word features a given set of data. The method was tested on the TDT corpus which has been developed by the TDT Pilot Study and the result can be regarded as promising the usefulness of the method.
345550	Improving text categorization methods for event tracking Automated tracking of events from chronologically ordered document streams is a new challenge for statistical text classification. Existing learning techniques must be adapted or improved in order to effectively handle difficult situations where the number of positive training instances per event is extremely small, the majority of training documents are unlabelled, and most of the events have a short duration in time. We adapted several supervised text categorization methods, specifically several new variants of the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm and a Rocchio approach, to track events. All of these methods showed significant improvement (up to 71% reduction in weighted error rates) over the performance of the original kNN algorithm on TDT benchmark collections, making kNN among the top-performing systems in the recent TDT3 official evaluation. Furthermore, by combining these methods, we significantly reduced the variance in performance of our event tracking system over different data collections, suggesting a robust solution for parameter optimization.
345551	Evaluation of a simple and effective music information retrieval method We developed, and then evaluated, a music information retrieval (MIR) system based upon the intervals found within the melodies of a collection of 9354 folksongs. The songs were converted to an interval-only representation of monophonic melodies and then fragmented t into length-n subsections called n-grams. The length of these n-grams and the degree to which we precisely represent the intervals are variables analyzed in this paper. We constructed a collection of âmusical wordâ databases using the text-based, SMART information retrieval system. A group of simulated queries, some of which contained simulated errors, was run against these databases. The results were evaluated using the normalized precision and normalized recall measures. Our concept of âmusical wordsâ shows great merit thus implying that useful MIR systems can be constructed simply and efficiently using pre-existing text-based information retrieval software. Second, this study is a formal and comprehensive evaluation of a MIR system using rigorous statistical analyses to determine retrieval effectiveness.
345552	Phonetic confusion matrix based spoken document retrieval Combined word-based index and phonetic indexes have been used to improve the performance of spoken document retrieval systems primarily by addressing the out-of-vocabulary retrieval problem. However, a known problem with phonetic recognition is its limited accuracy in comparison with word level recognition. We propose a novel method for phonetic retrieval in the CueVideo system based on the probabilistic formulation of term weighting using phone confusion data in a Bayesian framework. We evaluate this method of spoken document retrieval against word-based retrieval for the search levels identified in a realistic video-based distributed learning setting. Using our test data, we achieved an average recall of 0.88 with an average precision of 0.69 for retrieval of out-of-vocabulary words on phonetic transcripts with 35% word error rate. For in-vocabulary words, we achieved a 17% improvement in recall over word-based retrieval with a 17% loss in precision for word error rites ranging from 35 to 65%.
345554	Link-based and content-based evidential information in a belief network model This work presents an information retrieval model developed to deal with hyperlinked environments. The model is based on belief networks and provides a framework for combining information extracted from the content of the documents with information derived from cross-references among the documents. The information extracted from the content of the documents is based on statistics regarding the keywords in the collection and is one of the basis for traditional information retrieval (IR) ranking algorithms. The information derived from cross-references among the documents is based on link references in a hyperlinked environment and has received increased attention lately due to the success of the Web. We discuss a set of strategies for combining these two types of sources of evidential information and experiment with them using a reference collection extracted from the Web. The results show that this type of combination can improve the retrieval performance without requiring any extra information from the users at query time. In our experiments, the improvements reach up to 59% in terms of average precision figures.
345556	The feature quantity: an information theoretic perspective of Tfidf-like measures The feature quantity , a quantitative representation of specificity introduced in this paper, is based on an information theoretic perspective of co-occurrence events between terms and documents. Mathematically, the feature quantity is defined as a product of probability and information, and maintains a good correspondence with the tfidf -like measures popularly used in today's IR systems. In this paper, we present a formal description of the feature quantity, as well as some illustrative examples of applying such a quantity to different types of information retrieval tasks: representative term selection and text categorization.

511709	A clustering strategy based on a formalism of the reproductive process in natural systems Given a set of objects each of which is represented by a finite number of attributes or features and a clustering criterion that associates a value of utility to any classification, the objective of a clustering method is to identify that classification of the objects which optimizes the criterion. A new strategy to solve this problem is developed. The approach is, in essence, a modification of the reproductive plan, a type of adaptive procedure devised by Holland [2], which embodies many principles found in the adaptation of natural systems through evolution. The proposed approach differs from conventional methods in the sense that the search through the space of possible solutions proceeds in a parallel fashion.The adaptive clustering strategy requires the specification of methods for the generation of an initial population of classifications, the parent selection, the modifications and the replacement of current classifications with new ones. The effects of changing several of these features are investigated. Experimental results show that it is possible to devise clustering strategies based on the principles of adaptation in natural systems that are both effective and efficient.
511759	A comparison of search term weighting: term relevance vs. inverse document frequency The term relevance weighting method has been shown to produce optimal information retrieval queries under well-defined conditions. The parameters needed to generate the term relevance factors cannot unfortunately be estimated accurately in practice; futhermore, in realistic test situations, it appears difficult to obtain improved retrieval results using the term relevance weights over much simpler term weighting systems such as, for example, the inverse document frequency weights.It is shown in this study that the inverse document frequency weights and the term relevance weights are closely related over a wide range of the frequency spectrum. Methods are introduced for estimating the term relevance weights, and experimental results are given comparing the inverse document frequency with the estimated term relevance weights.

511804	Information retrieval using a transportable natural language interface This paper describes work in progress to develop a facility for natural language access to a variety of computer databases and database systems. This facility, called IRUS for Information Retrieval using the RUS parsing system, allows users who are unfamiliar with the technical characteristics of the underlying database system to query databases using typed English input. This system can be thought of as a stand-alone query system or as part of a management information system (MIS) or a decision support system (DSS).Many systems boast of having a "user-friendly" or "English-like" or even "English" interface so that users require a minimum of special training to use the system, but most such systems use shallow, relatively ad hoc techniques that are not robust or linguistically sound. We are using a large, well-tested, theoretically-based, general parser of English that has been developed and extended in a variety of research projects for over a decade.One of the primary emphases of IRUS is transportability, which includes three types of changes: (1) changing the domain, (2) changing data bases within the same domain, and (3) changing data base systems. The use of a general parser for English is an important part of the solution to the transportability problem, but there are other parts as well, since portions of the system beyond the parser must know the conceptual content of the domain, the way in which this is reflected in a collection of datasets, and the operating characteristics of the dbms being used to access these datasets.Other researchers have investigated similar issues [8, 5, 6, 12]. We have attacked this problem by building a knowledge-based system, with procedural components independent of domain and data base structure, directed by domain and database dependent knowledge structures. We are also building tools for conveniently creating and maintaining these knowledge structures, with an eventual goal of allowing end-users to extend and modify these knowledge structures to suit their own needs. Given this set of goals, and these tools, we consider the current implementation, which uses the System 1022 dbms on the DEC KL-2060, to be only one of a set of possible implementations, and are not constraining IRUS on the basis of 1022's strengths and weaknesses.This paper presents an overview of the IRUS system, emphasizing those aspects of the design that are critical to transportability. We describe the parsing system, which is a completely independent module that has been interfaced to a variety of different applications, and then discuss the other modules which bridge the gap between the parser and the dbms.
564380	Impact transformation: effective and efficient web retrieval We extend the applicability of impact transformation, which is a technique for adjusting the term weights assigned to documents so as to boost the effectiveness of retrieval when short queries are applied to large document collections. In conjunction with techniques called quantization and thresholding, impact transformation allows improved query execution rates compared to traditional vector-space similarity computations, as the number of arithmetic operations can be reduced. The transformation also facilitates a new dynamic query pruning heuristic. We give results based upon the trec web data that show the combination of these various techniques to yield highly competitive retrieval, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, for both short and long queries.
564381	Analysis of lexical signatures for finding lost or related documents A lexical signature of a web page is often sufficient for finding the page, even if its URL has changed. We conduct a large-scale empirical study of eight methods for generating lexical signatures, including Phelps and Wilensky's [14] original proposal (PW) and seven of our own variations. We examine their performance on the web and on a TREC data set, evaluating their ability both to uniquely identify the original document and to locate other relevant documents if the original is lost. Lexical signatures chosen to minimize document frequency (DF) are good at unique identification but poor at finding relevant documents. PW works well on the relatively small TREC data set, but acts almost identically to DF on the web, which contains billions of documents. Term-frequency-based lexical signatures (TF) are very easy to compute and often perform well, but are highly dependent on the ranking system of the search engine used. In general, TFIDF-based method and hybrid methods (which combine DF with TF or TFIDF) seem to be the most promising candidates for generating effective lexical signatures.
564382	Using sampled data and regression to merge search engine results This paper addresses the problem of merging results obtained from different databases and search engines in a distributed information retrieval environment. The prior research on this problem either assumed the exchange of statistics necessary for normalizing scores (cooperative solutions) or is heuristic. Both approaches have disadvantages. We show that the problem in uncooperative environments is simpler when viewed as a component of a distributed IR system that uses query-based sampling to create resource descriptions. Documents sampled for creating resource descriptions can also be used to create a sample centralized index, and this index is a source of training data for adaptive results merging algorithms. A variety of experiments demonstrate that this new approach is more effective than a well-known alternative, and that it allows query-by-query tuning of the results merging function.
564383	The Importance of Prior Probabilities for Entry Page Search An important class of searches on the world-wide-web has the goal to find an entry page (homepage) of an organisation. Entry page search is quite different from Ad Hoc search. Indeed a plain Ad Hoc system performs disappointingly. We explored three non-content features of web pages: page length, number of incoming links and URL form. Especially the URL form proved to be a good predictor. Using URL form priors we found over 70% of all entry pages at rank 1, and up to 89% in the top 10. Non-content features can easily be embedded in a language model framework as a prior probability.
564385	Term-specific smoothing for the language modeling approach to information retrieval: the importance of a query term This paper follows a formal approach to information retrieval based on statistical language models. By introducing some simple reformulations of the basic language modeling approach we introduce the notion of importance of a query term. The importance of a query term is an unknown parameter that explicitly models which of the query terms are generated from the relevant documents (the important terms), and which are not (the unimportant terms). The new language modeling approach is shown to explain a number of practical facts of today's information retrieval systems that are not very well explained by the current state of information retrieval theory, including stop words, mandatory terms, coordination level ranking and retrieval using phrases.
564386	Title language model for information retrieval In this paper, we propose a new language model, namely, a title language model, for information retrieval. Different from the traditional language model used for retrieval, we define the conditional probability P(Q|D) as the probability of using query Q as the title for document D. We adopted the statistical translation model learned from the title and document pairs in the collection to compute the probability P(Q|D). To avoid the sparse data problem, we propose two new smoothing methods. In the experiments with four different TREC document collections, the title language model for information retrieval with the new smoothing method outperforms both the traditional language model and the vector space model for IR significantly.
564387	Two-stage language models for information retrieval The optimal settings of retrieval parameters often depend on both the document collection and the query, and are usually found through empirical tuning. In this paper, we propose a family of two-stage language models for information retrieval that explicitly captures the different influences of the query and document collection on the optimal settings of retrieval parameters. As a special case, we present a two-stage smoothing method that allows us to estimate the smoothing parameters completely automatically. In the first stage, the document language model is smoothed using a Dirichlet prior with the collection language model as the reference model. In the second stage, the smoothed document language model is further interpolated with a query background language model. We propose a leave-one-out method for estimating the Dirichlet parameter of the first stage, and the use of document mixture models for estimating the interpolation parameter of the second stage. Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.
564389	Finding relevant documents using top ranking sentences: an evaluation of two alternative schemes In this paper we present an evaluation of techniques that are designed to encourage web searchers to interact more with the results of a web search. Two specific techniques are examined: the presentation of sentences that highly match the searcher's query and the use of implicit evidence. Implicit evidence is evidence captured from the searcher's interaction with the retrieval results and is used to automatically update the display. Our evaluation concentrates on the effectiveness and subject perception of these techniques. The results show, with statistical significance, that the techniques are effective and efficient for information seeking.
564390	Predicting category accesses for a user in a structured information space In a categorized information space, predicting users' information needs at the category level can facilitate personalization, caching and other topic-oriented services. This paper presents a two-phase model to predict the category of a user's next access based on previous accesses. Phase 1 generates a snapshot of a user's preferences among categories based on a temporal and frequency analysis of the user's access history. Phase 2 uses the computed preferences to make predictions at different category granularities. Several alternatives for each phase are evaluated, using the rating behaviors of on-line raters as the form of access considered. The results show that a method based on re-access pattern and frequency analysis of a user's whole history has the best prediction quality, even over a path-based method (Markov model) that uses the combined history of all users.
564391	Detecting and Browsing Events in Unstructured text Previews and overviews of large, heterogeneous information resources help users comprehend the scope of collections and focus on particular subsets of interest. For narrative documents, questions of "what happened? where? and when?" are natural points of entry. Building on our earlier work at the Perseus Project with detecting terms, place names, and dates, we have exploited co-occurrences of dates and place names to detect and describe likely events in document collections. We compare statistical measures for determining the relative significance of various events. We have built interfaces that help users preview likely regions of interest for a given range of space and time by plotting the distribution and relevance of various collocations. Users can also control the amount of collocation information in each view. Once particular collocations are selected, the system can identify key phrases associated with each possible event to organize browsing of the documents themselves.
564393	Novelty and redundancy detection in adaptive filtering This paper addresses the problem of extending an adaptive information filtering system to make decisions about the novelty and redundancy of relevant documents. It argues that relevance and redundance should each be modelled explicitly and separately. A set of five redundancy measures are proposed and evaluated in experiments with and without redundancy thresholds. The experimental results demonstrate that the cosine similarity metric and a redundancy measure based on a mixture of language models are both effective for identifying redundant documents.
564395	Bayesian online classifiers for text classification and filtering This paper explores the use of Bayesian online classifiers to classify text documents. Empirical results indicate that these classifiers are comparable with the best text classification systems. Furthermore, the online approach offers the advantage of continuous learning in the batch-adaptive text filtering task.
564397	The use of unlabeled data to improve supervised learning for text summarization With the huge amount of information available electronically, there is an increasing demand for automatic text summarization systems. The use of machine learning techniques for this task allows one to adapt summaries to the user needs and to the corpus characteristics. These desirable properties have motivated an increasing amount of work in this field over the last few years. Most approaches attempt to generate summaries by extracting sentence segments and adopt the supervised learning paradigm which requires to label documents at the text span level. This is a costly process, which puts strong limitations on the applicability of these methods. We investigate here the use of semi-supervised algorithms for summarization. These techniques make use of few labeled data together with a larger amount of unlabeled data. We propose new semi-supervised algorithms for training classification models for text summarization. We analyze their performances on two data sets - the Reuters news-wire corpus and the Computation and Language (cmp_lg) collection of TIPSTER SUMMAC. We perform comparisons with a baseline - non learning - system, and a reference trainable summarizer system.
564398	Generic summarization and keyphrase extraction using mutual reinforcement principle and sentence clustering A novel method for simultaneous keyphrase extraction and generic text summarization is proposed by modeling text documents as weighted undirected and weighted bipartite graphs. Spectral graph clustering algorithms are useed for partitioning sentences of the documents into topical groups with sentence link priors being exploited to enhance clustering quality. Within each topical group, saliency scores for keyphrases and sentences are generated based on a mutual reinforcement principle. The keyphrases and sentences are then ranked according to their saliency scores and selected for inclusion in the top keyphrase list and summaries of the document. The idea of building a hierarchy of summaries for documents capturing different levels of granularity is also briefly discussed. Our method is illustrated using several examples from news articles, news broadcast transcripts and web documents.
564399	Cross-document summarization by concept classification In this paper we describe a Cross Document Summarizer XDoX designed specifically to summarize large document sets (50-500 documents and more). Such sets of documents are typically obtained from routing or filtering systems run against a continuous stream of data, such as a newswire. XDoX works by identifying the most salient themes within the set (at the granularity level that is regulated by the user) and composing an extraction summary, which reflects these main themes. In the current version, XDoX is not optimized to produce a summary based on a few unrelated documents; indeed, such summaries are best obtained simply by concatenating summaries of individual documents. We show examples of summaries obtained in our tests as well as from our participation in the first Document Understanding Conference (DUC).
564401	Unsupervised document classification using sequential information maximization We present a novel sequential clustering algorithm which is motivated by the Information Bottleneck (IB) method. In contrast to the agglomerative IB algorithm, the new sequential ( sIB ) approach is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum of the information with time and space complexity typically linear in the data size. information, as required by the original IB principle. Moreover, the time and space complexity are significantly improved. We apply this algorithm to unsupervised document classification. In our evaluation, on small and medium size corpora, the sIB is found to be consistently superior to all the other clustering methods we examine, typically by a significant margin. Moreover, the sIB results are comparable to those obtained by a supervised Naive Bayes classifier. Finally, we propose a simple procedure for trading cluster's recall to gain higher precision, and show how this approach can extract clusters which match the existing topics of the corpus almost perfectly.
564403	Text genre classification with genre-revealing and subject-revealing features Subject or prepositional content has been the focus of most classification research. Genre or style, on the other hand, is a different and important property of text, and automatic text genre classification is becoming important for classification and retrieval purposes as well as for some natural language processing research. In this paper, we present a method for automatic genre classification that is based on statistically selected features obtained from both subject-classified and genre classified training data. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a direct application of a statistical learner often used for subject classification. We also observe that the deviation formula and discrimination formula using document frequency ratios also work as expected. We conjecture that this dual feature set approach can be generalized to improve the performance of subject classification as well.
564404	A new family of online algorithms for category ranking We describe a new family of topic-ranking algorithms for multi-labeled documents. The motivation for the algorithms stems from recent advances in online learning algorithms. The algorithms we present are simple to implement and are time and memory efficient. We evaluate the algorithms on the Reuters-21578 corpus and the new corpus released by Reuters in 2000. On both corpora the algorithms we present outperform adaptations to topic-ranking of Rocchio's algorithm and the Perceptron algorithm. We also outline the formal analysis of the algorithm in the mistake bound model. To our knowledge, this work is the first to report performance results with the entire new Reuters corpus.
564406	Comparing cross-language query expansion techniques by degrading translation resources The quality of translation resources is arguably the most important factor affecting the performance of a cross-language information retrieval system. While many investigations have explored the use of query expansion techniques to combat errors induced by translation, no study has yet examined the effectiveness of these techniques across resources of varying quality. This paper presents results using parallel corpora and bilingual wordlists that have been deliberately degraded prior to query translation. Across different languages, translingual resources, and degrees of resource degradation, pre-translation query expansion is tremendously effective. In several instances, pre-translation expansion results in better performance when no translations are available, than when an uncompromised resource is used without pre-translation expansion. We also demonstrate that post-translation expansion using relevance feedback can confer modest performance gains. Measuring the efficacy of these techniques with resources of different quality suggests an explanation for the conflicting reports that have appeared in the literature.
564407	Statistical cross-language information retrieval using n-best query translations This paper presents a novel statistical model for cross-language information retrieval. Given a written query in the source language, documents in the target language are ranked by integrating probabilities computed by two statistical models: a query-translation model, which generates most probable term-by-term translations of the query, and a query-document model, which evaluates the likelihood of each document and translation. Integration of the two scores is performed over the set of N most probable translations of the query. Experimental results with values N =1, 5, 10 are presented on the Italian-English bilingual track data used in the CLEF 2000 and 2001 evaluation campaigns.
564408	Cross-lingual relevance models We propose a formal model of Cross-Language Information Retrieval that does not rely on either query translation or document translation. Our approach leverages recent advances in language modeling to directly estimate an accurate topic model in the target language, starting with a query in the source language. The model integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion in a unified formal framework. We describe how the topic model can be estimated with either a parallel corpus or a dictionary. We test the framework by constructing Chinese topic models from English queries and using them in the CLIR task of TREC9. The model achieves performance around 95% of the strong mono-lingual baseline in terms of average precision. In initial precision, our model outperforms the mono-lingual baseline by 20%. The main contribution of this work is the unified formal model which integrates techniques that are essential for effective Cross-Language Retrieval.
564409	Resolving query translation ambiguity using a decaying co-occurrence model and syntactic dependence relations Bilingual dictionaries have been commonly used for query translation in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). However, we are faced with the problem of translation selection. Several recent studies suggested the utilization of term co-occurrences in this selection. This paper presents two extensions to improve them. First, we extend the basic co-occurrence model by adding a decaying factor that decreases the mutual information when the distance between the terms increases. Second, we incorporate a triple translation model, in which syntactic dependence relations (represented as triples) are integrated. Our evaluation on translation accuracy shows that translating triples as units is more precise than a word-by-word translation. Our CLIR experiments show that the addition of the decaying factor leads to substantial improvements of the basic co-occurrence model; and the triple translation model brings further improvements.
564411	Document clustering with cluster refinement and model selection capabilities In this paper, we propose a document clustering method that strives to achieve: (1) a high accuracy of document clustering, and (2) the capability of estimating the number of clusters in the document corpus (i.e. the model selection capability). To accurately cluster the given document corpus, we employ a richer feature set to represent each document, and use the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) together with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to conduct an initial document clustering. From this initial result, we identify a set of discriminative featuresfor each cluster, and refine the initially obtained document clusters by voting on the cluster label of each document using this discriminative feature set. This self-refinement process of discriminative feature identification and cluster label voting is iteratively applied until the convergence of document clusters. On the other hand, the model selection capability is achieved by introducing randomness in the cluster initialization stage, and then discovering a value C for the number of clusters N by which running the document clustering process for a fixed number of times yields sufficiently similar results. Performance evaluations exhibit clear superiority of the proposed method with its improved document clustering and model selection accuracies. The evaluations also demonstrate how each feature as well as the cluster refinement process contribute to the document clustering accuracy.
564412	Document clustering with committees Document clustering is useful in many information retrieval tasks: document browsing, organization and viewing of retrieval results, generation of Yahoo-like hierarchies of documents, etc. The general goal of clustering is to group data elements such that the intra-group similarities are high and the inter-group similarities are low. We present a clustering algorithm called CBC (Clustering By Committee) that is shown to produce higher quality clusters in document clustering tasks as compared to several well known clustering algorithms. It initially discovers a set of tight clusters (high intra-group similarity), called committees, that are well scattered in the similarity space (low inter-group similarity). The union of the committees is but a subset of all elements. The algorithm proceeds by assigning elements to their most similar committee. Evaluating cluster quality has always been a difficult task. We present a new evaluation methodology that is based on the editing distance between output clusters and manually constructed classes (the answer key). This evaluation measure is more intuitive and easier to interpret than previous evaluation measures.
564413	Probabilistic combination of text classifiers using reliability indicators: models and results The intuition that different text classifiers behave in qualitatively different ways has long motivated attempts to build a better metaclassifier via some combination of classifiers. We introduce a probabilistic method for combining classifiers that considers the context-sensitive reliabilities of contributing classifiers. The method harnesses reliability indicators ---variables that provide a valuable signal about the performance of classifiers in different situations. We provide background, present procedures for building metaclassifiers that take into consideration both reliability indicators and classifier outputs, and review a set of comparative studies undertaken to evaluate the methodology.
564415	Efficient phrase querying with an auxiliary index Search engines need to evaluate queries extremely fast, a challenging task given the vast quantities of data being indexed. A significant proportion of the queries posed to search engines involve phrases. In this paper we consider how phrase queries can be efficiently supported with low disk overheads. Previous research has shown that phrase queries can be rapidly evaluated using nextword indexes, but these indexes are twice as large as conventional inverted files. We propose a combination of nextword indexes with inverted files as a solution to this problem. Our experiments show that combined use of an auxiliary nextword index and a conventional inverted file allow evaluation of phrase queries in half the time required to evaluate such queries with an inverted file alone, and the space overhead is only 10% of the size of the inverted file. Further time savings are available with only slight increases in disk requirements.
564416	Compression of inverted indexes For fast query evaluation Compression reduces both the size of indexes and the time needed to evaluate queries. In this paper, we revisit the compression of inverted lists of document postings that store the position and frequency of indexed terms, considering two approaches to improving retrieval efficiency: better implementation and better choice of integer compression schemes. First, we propose several simple optimisations to well-known integer compression schemes, and show experimentally that these lead to significant reductions in time. Second, we explore the impact of choice of compression scheme on retrieval efficiency.In experiments on large collections of data, we show two surprising results: use of simple byte-aligned codes halves the query evaluation time compared to the most compact Golomb-Rice bitwise compression schemes; and, even when an index fits entirely in memory, byte-aligned codes result in faster query evaluation than does an uncompressed index, emphasising that the cost of transferring data from memory to the CPU cache is less for an appropriately compressed index than for an uncompressed index. Moreover, byte-aligned schemes have only a modest space overhead: the most compact schemes result in indexes that are around 10% of the size of the collection, while a byte-aligned scheme is around 13%. We conclude that fast byte-aligned codes should be used to store integers in inverted lists.
564419	Collaborative filtering with privacy via factor analysis Collaborative filtering (CF) is valuable in e-commerce, and for direct recommendations for music, movies, news etc. But today's systems have several disadvantages, including privacy risks. As we move toward ubiquitous computing, there is a great potential for individuals to share all kinds of information about places and things to do, see and buy, but the privacy risks are severe. In this paper we describe a new method for collaborative filtering which protects the privacy of individual data. The method is based on a probabilistic factor analysis model. Privacy protection is provided by a peer-to-peer protocol which is described elsewhere, but outlined in this paper. The factor analysis approach handles missing data without requiring default values for them. We give several experiments that suggest that this is most accurate method for CF to date. The new algorithm has other advantages in speed and storage over previous algorithms. Finally, we suggest applications of the approach to other kinds of statistical analyses of survey or questionaire data.
564421	Methods and metrics for cold-start recommendations We have developed a method for recommending items that combines content and collaborative data under a single probabilistic framework. We benchmark our algorithm against a naÃ¯ve Bayes classifier on the cold-start problem, where we wish to recommend items that no one in the community has yet rated. We systematically explore three testing methodologies using a publicly available data set, and explain how these methods apply to specific real-world applications. We advocate heuristic recommenders when benchmarking to give competent baseline performance. We introduce a new performance metric, the CROC curve, and demonstrate empirically that the various components of our testing strategy combine to obtain deeper understanding of the performance characteristics of recommender systems. Though the emphasis of our testing is on cold-start recommending, our methods for recommending and evaluation are general.
564423	Term selection for searching printed Arabic Since many Arabic documents are available only in print, automating retrieval from collections of scanned Arabic document images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an interesting problem. Arabic combines rich morphology with a writing system that presents unique challenges to OCR systems. These factors must be considered when selecting terms for automatic indexing. In this paper, alternative choices of indexing terms are explored using both an existing electronic text collection and a newly developed collection built from images of actual printed Arabic documents. Character n-grams or lightly stemmed words were found to typically yield near-optimal retrieval effectiveness, and combining both types of terms resulted in robust performance across a broad range of conditions.
564424	Empirical studies in strategies for Arabic retrieval This work evaluates a few search strategies for Arabic monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval, using the TREC Arabic corpus as the test-bed. The release by NIST in 2001 of an Arabic corpus of nearly 400k documents with both monolingual and cross-lingual queries and relevance judgments has been a new enabler for empirical studies. Experimental results show that spelling normalization and stemming can significantly improve Arabic monolingual retrieval. Character tri-grams from stems improved retrieval modestly on the test corpus, but the improvement is not statistically significant. To further improve retrieval, we propose a novel thesaurus-based technique. Different from existing approaches to thesaurus-based retrieval, ours formulates word synonyms as probabilistic term translations that can be automatically derived from a parallel corpus. Retrieval results show that the thesaurus can significantly improve Arabic monolingual retrieval. For cross-lingual retrieval (CLIR), we found that spelling normalization and stemming have little impact.
564425	Improving stemming for Arabic information retrieval: light stemming and co-occurrence analysis Arabic, a highly inflected language, requires good stemming for effective information retrieval, yet no standard approach to stemÃÂ¿ming has emerged. We developed several light stemmers based on heuristics and a statistical stemmer based on co-occurrence for Arabic retrieval. We compared the retrieval effectiveness of our stemmers and of a morphological analyzer on the TREC-2001 data. The best light stemmer was more effective for cross-lanÃÂ¿guage retrieval than a morphological stemmer which tried to find the root for each word. A repartitioning process consisting of vowel removal followed by clustering using co-occurrence analyÃÂ¿sis proÃÂ¿duced stem classes which were better than no stemming or very light stemming, but still inferior to good light stemming or morÃÂ¿phological analysis.
564427	Automatic query wefinement using lexical affinities with maximal information gain This work describes an automatic query refinement technique, which focuses on improving precision of the top ranked documents. The terms used for refinement are lexical affinities (LAs), pairs of closely related words which contain exactly one of the original query terms. Adding these terms to the query is equivalent to re-ranking search results, thus, precision is improved while recall is preserved. We describe a novel method that selects the most "informative" LAs for refinement, namely, those LAs that best separate relevant documents from irrelevant documents in the set of results. The information gain of candidate LAs is determined using unsupervised estimation that is based on the scoring function of the search engine. This method is thus fully automatic and its quality depends on the quality of the scoring function. Experiments we conducted with TREC data clearly show a significant improvement in the precision of the top ranked documents.
564428	Web question answering: is more always better? This paper describes a question answering system that is designed to capitalize on the tremendous amount of data that is now available online. Most question answering systems use a wide variety of linguistic resources. We focus instead on the redundancy available in large corpora as an important resource. We use this redundancy to simplify the query rewrites that we need to use, and to support answer mining from returned snippets. Our system performs quite well given the simplicity of the techniques being utilized. Experimental results show that question answering accuracy can be greatly improved by analyzing more and more matching passages. Simple passage ranking and n-gram extraction techniques work well in our system making it efficient to use with many backend retrieval engines.
564429	Predicting query performance We develop a method for predicting query performance by computing the relative entropy between a query language model and the corresponding collection language model. The resulting clarity score measures the coherence of the language usage in documents whose models are likely to generate the query. We suggest that clarity scores measure the ambiguity of a query with respect to a collection of documents and show that they correlate positively with average precision in a variety of TREC test sets. Thus, the clarity score may be used to identify ineffective queries, on average, without relevance information. We develop an algorithm for automatically setting the clarity score threshold between predicted poorly-performing queries and acceptable queries and validate it using TREC data. In particular, we compare the automatic thresholds to optimum thresholds and also check how frequently results as good are achieved in sampling experiments that randomly assign queries to the two classes.
564430	Using part-of-speech patterns to reduce query ambiguity Query ambiguity is a generally recognized problem, particularly in Web environments where queries are commonly only one or two words in length. In this study, we explore one technique that finds commonly occurring patterns of parts of speech near a one-word query and allows them to be transformed into clarification questions. We use a technique derived from statistical language modeling to show that the clarification queries will reduce ambiguity much of the time, and often quite substantially.
564432	The effect of topic set size on retrieval experiment error Retrieval mechanisms are frequently compared by computing the respective average scores for some effectiveness metric across a common set of information needs or topics, with researchers concluding one method is superior based on those averages. Since comparative retrieval system behavior is known to be highly variable across topics, good experimental design requires that a "sufficient" number of topics be used in the test. This paper uses TREC results to empirically derive error rates based on the number of topics used in a test and the observed difference in the average scores. The error rates quantify the likelihood that a different set of topics of the same size would lead to a different conclusion. We directly compute error rates for topic sets up to size 25, and extrapolate those rates for larger topic set sizes. The error rates found are larger than anticipated, indicating researchers need to take care when concluding one method is better than another, especially if few topics are used.
564433	Liberal relevance criteria of TREC -: counting on negligible documents? Most test collections (like TREC and CLEF) for experimental research in information retrieval apply binary relevance assessments. This paper introduces a four-point relevance scale and reports the findings of a project in which TREC-7 and TREC-8 document pools on 38 topics were reassessed. The goal of the reassessment was to build a subcollection of TREC for experiments on highly relevant documents and to learn about the assessment process as well as the characteristics of a multigraded relevance corpus.Relevance criteria were defined so that a distinction was made between documents rich in topical information (relevant and highly relevant documents) and poor in topical information (marginally relevant documents). It turned out that about 50% of documents assessed as relevant were regarded as marginal. The characteristics of the relevance corpus and lessons learned from the reassessment project are discussed. The need to develop more elaborated relevance assessment schemes is emphasized.
564436	Video retrieval using an MPEG-7 based inference network This work proposes a model for video retrieval based upon the inference network model. The document network is constructed using video metadata encoded using MPEG-7 and captures information pertaining to the structural aspects (video breakdown into shots and scenes), conceptual aspects (video, scene and shot content) and contextual aspects (context information about the position of conceptual content within the document). The retrieval process a) exploits the distribution of evidence among the shots to perform ranking of different levels of granularity, b) addresses the idea that evidence may be inherited during evaluation, and c) exploits the contextual information to perform constrained queries.
564440	PageRank, HITS and a unified framework for link analysis Two popular link-based webpage ranking algorithms are (i) PageRank[1] and (ii) HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Selection)[3]. HITS makes the crucial distinction of hubs and authorities and computes them in a mutually reinforcing way. PageRank considers the hyperlink weight normalization and the equilibrium distribution of random surfers as the citation score. We generalize and combine these key concepts into a unified framework, in which we prove that rankings produced by PageRank and HITS are both highly correlated with the ranking by in-degree and out-degree.
564446	Do thumbnail previews help users make better relevance decisions about web search results? We describe an empirical evaluation of the utility of thumbnail previews in web search results. Results pages were constructed to show text-only summaries, thumbnail previews only, or the combination of text summaries and thumbnail previews. We found that in the combination case, users were able to make more accurate decisions about the potential relevance of results than in either of the other versions, with hardly any increase in speed of processing the page as a whole.
564454	Document normalization revisited Cosine Pivoted Document Length Normalization has reached a point of stability where many researchers indiscriminately apply a specific value of 0.2 regardless of the collection. Our efforts, however, demonstrate that applying this specific value without tuning for the document collection degrades average precision by as much as 20%.
564457	Spatial information retrieval and geographical ontologies an overview of the SPIRIT project An abstract is not available.
564464	Automatic metadata generation & evaluation The poster reports on a project in which we are investigating methods for breaking the human metadata-generation bottleneck that plagues Digital Libraries. The research question is whether metadata elements and values can be automatically generated from the content of educational resources, and correctly assigned to mathematics and science educational materials. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques were implemented to automatically assign values of the GEMgenerate metadata element set tofor learning resources provided by the Gateway for Education (GEM), a service that offers web access to a wide range of educational materials. In a user study, education professionals evaluated the metadata assigned to learning resources by either automatic tagging or manual assignment. Results show minimal difference in the eyes of the evaluators between automatically generated metadata and manually assigned metadata.
564474	Automatic evaluation of world wide web search services Users of the World-Wide Web are not only confronted by an immense overabundance of information, but also by a plethora of tools for searching for the web pages that suit their information needs. Web search engines differ widely in interface, features, coverage of the web, ranking methods, delivery of advertising, and more. In this paper, we present a method for comparing search engines automatically based on how they rank known item search results. Because the engines perform their search on overlapping (but different) subsets of the web collected at different points in time, evaluation of search engines poses significant challenges to the traditional information retrieval methodology. Our method uses known item searching; comparing the relative ranks of the items in the search engines' rankings. Our approach automatically constructs known item queries using query log analysis and automatically constructs the result via analysis of editor comments from the ODP (Open Directory Project). Additionally, we present our comparison on five (Lycos, Netscape, Fast, Google, HotBot) well-known search services and find that some services perform known item searches better than others, but the majority are statistically equivalent.
564475	Does WT10g look like the web? We measure the WT10g test collection, used in the TREC-9 and TREC 2001 Web Tracks, with common measures used in the web topology community, in order to see if WT10g "looks like" the web. This is not an idle question; characteristics of the web, such as power law relationships, diameter, and connected components have all been observed within the scope of general web crawls, constructed by blindly following links. In contrast, WT10g was carved out from a larger crawl specifically to be a web search test collection within the reach of university researchers. Does such a collection retain the properties of the larger web? In the case of WT10g, yes.

383953	Applying summarization techniques for term selection in relevance feedback Query-expansion is an effective Relevance Feedback technique for improving performance in Information Retrieval. In general query-expansion methods select terms from the complete contents of relevant documents. One problem with this approach is that expansion terms unrelated to document relevance can be introduced into the modified query due to their presence in the relevant documents and distribution in the document collection. Motivated by the hypothesis that query-expansion terms should only be sought from the most relevant areas of a document, this investigation explores the use of document summaries in query-expansion. The investigation explores the use of both context-independent standard summaries and query-biased summaries. Experimental results using the Okapi BM25 probabilistic retrieval model with the TREC-8 ad hoc retrieval task show that query-expansion using document summaries can be considerably more effective than using full-document expansion. The paper also presents a novel approach to term-selection that separates the choice of relevant documents from the selection of a pool of potential expansion terms. Again, this technique is shown to be more effective that standard methods.
383954	Temporal summaries of new topics We discuss technology to help a person monitor changes in news coverage over time. We define temporal summaries of news stories as extracting a single sentence from each event within a news topic, where the stories are presented one at a time and sentences from a story must be ranked before the next story can be considered. We explain a method for evaluation, and describe an evaluation corpus that we have built. We also propose several methods for constructing temporal summaries and evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to degenerate cases. We show that simple approaches are effective, but that the problem is far from solved.
383955	Generic text summarization using relevance measure and latent semantic analysis In this paper, we propose two generic text summarization methods that create text summaries by ranking and extracting sentences from the original documents. The first method uses standard IR methods to rank sentence relevances, while the second method uses the latent semantic analysis technique to identify semantically important sentences, for summary creations. Both methods strive to select sentences that are highly ranked and different from each other. This is an attempt to create a summary with a wider coverage of the document's main content and less redundancy. Performance evaluations on the two summarization methods are conducted by comparing their summarization outputs with the manual summaries generated by three independent human evaluators. The evaluations also study the influence of different VSM weighting schemes on the text summarization performances. Finally, the causes of the large disparities in the evaluators' manual summarization results are investigated, and discussions on human text summarization patterns are presented.
383956	A new approach to unsupervised text summarization The paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised text summarization. The novelty lies in exploiting the diversity of concepts in text for summarization, which has not received much attention in the summarization literature. A diversity-based approach here is a principled generalization of Maximal Marginal Relevance criterion by Carbonell and Goldstein cite{carbonell-goldstein98}. We propose, in addition, an information-centric approach to evaluation, where the quality of summaries is judged not in terms of how well they match human-created summaries but in terms of how well they represent their source documents in IR tasks such document retrieval and text categorization. To find the effectiveness of our approach under the proposed evaluation scheme, we set out to examine how a system with the diversity functionality performs against one without, using the BMIR-J2 corpus, a test data developed by a Japanese research consortium. The results demonstrate a clear superiority of a diversity based approach to a non-diversity based approach.
383957	Vector-space ranking with effective early termination Considerable research effort has been invested in improving the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. Techniques such as relevance feedback, thesaural expansion, and pivoting all provide better quality responses to queries when tested in standard evaluation frameworks. But such enhancements can add to the cost of evaluating queries. In this paper we consider the pragmatic issue of how to improve the cost-effectiveness of searching. We describe a new inverted file structure using quantized weights that provides superior retrieval effectiveness compared to conventional inverted file structures when early termination heuristics are employed. That is, we are able to reach similar effectiveness levels with less computational cost, and so provide a better cost/performance compromise than previous inverted file organisations.
383958	Static index pruning for information retrieval systems We introduce static index pruning methods that significantly reduce the index size in information retrieval systems.We investigate uniform and term-based methods that each remove selected entries from the index and yet have only a minor effect on retrieval results. In uniform pruning, there is a fixed cutoff threshold, and all index entries whose contribution to relevance scores is bounded above by a given threshold are removed from the index. In term-based pruning, the cutoff threshold is determined for each term, and thus may vary from term to term. We give experimental evidence that for each level of compression, term-based pruning outperforms uniform pruning, under various measures of precision. We present theoretical and experimental evidence that under our term-based pruning scheme, it is possible to prune the index greatly and still get retrieval results that are almost as good as those based on the full index.

383961	Ranking retrieval systems without relevance judgments The most prevalent experimental methodology for comparing the effectiveness of information retrieval systems requires a test collection, composed of a set of documents, a set of query topics, and a set of relevance judgments indicating which documents are relevant to which topics. It is well known that relevance judgments are not infallible, but recent retrospective investigation into results from the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) has shown that differences in human judgments of relevance do not affect the relative measured performance of retrieval systems. Based on this result, we propose and describe the initial results of a new evaluation methodology which replaces human relevance judgments with a randomly selected mapping of documents to topics which we refer to as pseudo-relevance judgments .Rankings of systems with our methodology correlate positively with official TREC rankings, although the performance of the top systems is not predicted well. The correlations are stable over a variety of pool depths and sampling techniques. With improvements, such a methodology could be useful in evaluating systems such as World-Wide Web search engines, where the set of documents changes too often to make traditional collection construction techniques practical.
383963	Evaluation by highly relevant documents Given the size of the web, the search engine industry has argued that engines should be evaluated by their ability to retrieve highly relevant pages rather than all possible relevant pages. To explore the role highly relevant documents play in retrieval system evaluation, assessors for the mbox{TREC-9} web track used a three-point relevance scale and also selected best pages for each topic. The relative effectiveness of runs evaluated by different relevant document sets differed, confirming the hypothesis that different retrieval techniques work better for retrieving highly relevant documents. Yet evaluating by highly relevant documents can be unstable since there are relatively few highly relevant documents. TREC assessors frequently disagreed in their selection of the best page, and subsequent evaluation by best page across different assessors varied widely. The discounted cumulative gain measure introduced by J"{a}rvelin and Kek"{a}l"{a}inen increases evaluation stability by incorporating all relevance judgments while still giving precedence to highly relevant documents.
383965	Improving cross language retrieval with triangulated translation Most approaches to cross language information retrieval assume that resources providing a direct translation between the query and document languages exist. This paper presents research examining the situation where such an assumption is false. Here, an intermediate (or pivot) language provides a means of transitive translation of the query language to that of the document via the pivot, at the cost, however, of introducing much error. The paper reports the novel approach of translating in parallel across multiple intermediate languages and fusing the results. Such a technique removes the error, raising the effectiveness of the tested retrieval system, up to and possibly above the level expected, had a direct translation route existed. Across a number of retrieval situations and combinations of languages, the approach proves to be highly effective.
383966	Improving query translation for cross-language information retrieval using statistical models Dictionaries have often been used for query translation in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). However, we are faced with the problem of translation ambiguity, i.e. multiple translations are stored in a dictionary for a word. In addition, a word-by-word query translation is not precise enough. In this paper, we explore several methods to improve the previous dictionary-based query translation. First, as many as possible, noun phrases are recognized and translated as a whole by using statistical models and phrase translation patterns. Second, the best word translations are selected based on the cohesion of the translation words. Our experimental results on TREC English-Chinese CLIR collection show that these techniques result in significant improvements over the simple dictionary approaches, and achieve even better performance than a high-quality machine translation system.
383968	Evaluating a probabilistic model for cross-lingual information retrieval This work proposes and evaluates a probabilistic cross-lingual retrieval system. The system uses a generative model to estimate the probability that a document in one language is relevant, given a query in another language. An important component of the model is translation probabilities from terms in documents to terms in a query. Our approach is evaluated when 1) the only resource is a manually generated bilingual word list, 2) the only resource is a parallel corpus, and 3) both resources are combined in a mixture model. The combined resources produce about 90% of monolingual performance in retrieving Chinese documents. For Spanish the system achieves 85% of monolingual performance using only a pseudo-parallel Spanish-English corpus. Retrieval results are comparable with those of the structural query translation technique (Pirkola, 1998) when bilingual lexicons are used for query translation. When parallel texts in addition to conventional lexicons are used, it achieves better retrieval results but requires more computation than the structural query translation technique. It also produces slightly better results than using a machine translation system for CLIR, but the improvement over the MT system is not significant.
383970	Document language models, query models, and risk minimization for information retrieval We present a framework for information retrieval that combines document models and query models using a probabilistic ranking function based on Bayesian decision theory. The framework suggests an operational retrieval model that extends recent developments in the language modeling approach to information retrieval. A language model for each document is estimated, as well as a language model for each query, and the retrieval problem is cast in terms of risk minimization. The query language model can be exploited to model user preferences, the context of a query, synonomy and word senses. While recent work has incorporated word translation models for this purpose, we introduce a new method using Markov chains defined on a set of documents to estimate the query models. The Markov chain method has connections to algorithms from link analysis and social networks. The new approach is evaluated on TREC collections and compared to the basic language modeling approach and vector space models together with query expansion using Rocchio. Significant improvements are obtained over standard query expansion methods for strong baseline TF-IDF systems, with the greatest improvements attained for short queries on Web data.
383972	Relevance based language models We explore the relation between classical probabilistic models of information retrieval and the emerging language modeling approaches. It has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of classical models is the need to estimate a relevance model : probabilities of words in the relevant class. We propose a novel technique for estimating these probabilities using the query alone. We demonstrate that our technique can produce highly accurate relevance models, addressing important notions of synonymy and polysemy. Our experiments show relevance models outperforming baseline language modeling systems on TREC retrieval and TDT tracking tasks. The main contribution of this work is an effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no training data.
383974	A statistical learning learning model of text classification for support vector machines This paper develops a theoretical learning model of text classification for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). It connects the statistical properties of text-classification tasks with the generalization performance of a SVM in a quantitative way. Unlike conventional approaches to learning text classifiers, which rely primarily on empirical evidence, this model explains why and when SVMs perform well for text classification. In particular, it addresses the following questions: Why can support vector machines handle the large feature spaces in text classification effectively? How is this related to the statistical properties of text? What are sufficient conditions for applying SVMs to text-classification problems successfully?
383975	A study of thresholding strategies for text categorization Thresholding strategies in automated text categorization are an underexplored area of research. This paper presents an examination of the effect of thresholding strategies on the performance of a classifier under various conditions. Using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) as the classifier and five evaluation benchmark collections as the testbets, three common thresholding methods were investigated, including rank-based thresholding (RCut), proportion-based assignments (PCut) and score-based local optimization (SCut); in addition, new variants of these methods are proposed to overcome significant problems in the existing approaches. Experimental results show that the choice of thresholding strategy can significantly influence the performance of kNN, and that the ``optimal'' strategy may vary by application. SCut is potentially better for fine-tuning but risks overfitting. PCut copes better with rare categories and exhibits a smoother trade-off in recall versus precision, but is not suitable for online decision making. RCut is most natural for online response but is too coarse-grained for global or local optimization. RTCut, a new method combining the strength of category ranking and scoring, outperforms both PCut and RCut significantly.
383976	On feature distributional clustering for text categorization We describe a text categorization approach that is based on a combination of feature distributional clusters with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our feature selection approach employs distributional clustering of words via the recently introduced information bottleneck method , which generates a more efficient word-cluster representation of documents. Combined with the classification power of an SVM, this method yields high performance text categorization that can outperform other recent methods in terms of categorization accuracy and representation efficiency. Comparing the accuracy of our method with other techniques, we observe significant dependency of the results on the data set. We discuss the potential reasons for this dependency.
383981	Iterative residual rescaling We consider the problem of creating document representations in which inter-document similarity measurements correspond to semantic similarity. We first present a novel subspace-based framework for formalizing this task. Using this framework, we derive a new analysis of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), showing a precise relationship between its performance and the uniformity of the underlying distribution of documents over topics. This analysis helps explain the improvements gained by Ando's (2000) Iterative Residual Rescaling (ours) algorithm: ours can compensate for distributional non-uniformity. A further benefit of our framework is that it provides a well-motivated, effective method for automatically determining the rescaling factor ours depends on, leading to further improvements. A series of experiments over various settings and with several evaluation metrics validates our claims.
383982	Expressive retrieval from XML documents The emergence of XML as a standard interchange format for structured documents/data has given rise to many XML query language proposals. However, some of these languages do not support information retrieval-style ranked queries based on textual similarity. There have been several extensions to these query languages to support keyword search, but the resulting query languages cannot express queries such as ``find books and CDs with similar titles'' . Either these extensions use keywords as mere boolean filters, or similarities can be calculated only between data values and constants rather than two data values. We propose ELIXIR, an textbf{underline{e}}xpressive and textbf{underline{e}}fficienttextbf{underline{l}}anguage for textbf{underline{X}}ML textbf{underline{i}}nformation textbf{underline{r}}etrieval that extends the query language XML-QL cite{deutsch-www8,deutsch-deb99} with a textual similarity operator. ELIXIR is a general-purpose XML information retrieval language, sufficiently expressive to handle the above query. Our algorithm for answering ELIXIR queries rewrites the original ELIXIR query into a series of XML-QL queries that generate intermediate relational data, and uses relational database techniques to efficiently evaluate the similarity operators on this intermediate data, yielding an XML document with nodes ranked by similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that our prototype scales well with the size of the XML data and complexity of the query.
383985	XIRQL: a query language for information retrieval in XML documents Based on the document-centric view of XML, we present the query language XIRQL. Current proposals for XML query languages lack most IR-related features, which are weighting and ranking, relevance-oriented search, datatypes with vague predicates, and semantic relativism. XIRQL integrates these features by using ideas from logic-based probabilistic IR models, in combination with concepts from the database area. For processing XIRQL queries, a path algebra is presented, that also serves as a starting point for query optimization.
383987	Generic summaries for indexing in information retrieval This paper examines the use of generic summaries for indexing in information retrieval. Our main observations are that: (1) With or without pseudo-relevance feedback, a summary index may be as effective as the corresponding fulltext index for precision-oriented search of highly relevant documents . %43 But a reasonably sophisticated summarizer, using a compression ratio of 10-30%, is desirable for this purpose. (2) In pseudo-relevance feedback, using a summary index at initial search and a fulltext index at final search is possibly effective for precision-oriented search, regardless of relevance levels . This strategy is significantly more effective than the one using the summary index only and probably more effective than using summaries as mere term selection filters. %the use of summaries as mere term selection filters. %The summary quality is probably not a critical factor for this strategy, For this strategy, the summary quality is probably not a critical factor, and a compression ratio of 5-10% appears best.
383989	Automatic generation of concise summaries of spoken dialogues in unrestricted domains Automatic summarization of open domain spoken dialogues is a new research area. This paper introduces the task, the challenges involved, and presents an approach to obtain automatic extract summaries for multi-party dialogues of four different genres, without any restriction on domain. We address the following issues which are intrinsic to spoken dialogue summarization and typically can be ignored when summarizing written text such as newswire data: (i) detection and removal of speech disfluencies; (ii) detection and insertion of sentence boundaries; (iii) detection and linking of cross-speaker information units (question-answer pairs). A global system evaluation using a corpus of 23 relevance annotated dialogues containing 80 topical segments shows that for the two more informal genres, our summarization system using dialogue specific components significantly outperforms a baseline using TFIDF term weighting with maximum marginal relevance ranking (MMR).
383990	Enhanced topic distillation using text, markup tags, and hyperlinks Topic distillation is the analysis of hyperlink graph structure to identify mutually reinforcing authorities (popular pages) and hubs (comprehensive lists of links to authorities). Topic distillation is becoming common in Web search engines, but the best-known algorithms model the Web graph at a coarse grain, with whole pages as single nodes. Such models may lose vital details in the markup tag structure of the pages, and thus lead to a tightly linked irrelevant subgraph winning over a relatively sparse relevant subgraph, a phenomenon called topic drift or contamination . The problem gets especially severe in the face of increasingly complex pages with navigation panels and advertisement links. We present an enhanced topic distillation algorithm which analyzes text, the markup tag trees that constitute HTML pages, and hyperlinks between pages. It thereby identifies subtrees which have high text- and hyperlink-based coherence w.r.t. the query. These subtrees get preferential treatment in the mutual reinforcement process. Using over 50 queries, 28 from earlier topic distillation work, we analyzed over 700,000 pages and obtained quantitative and anecdotal evidence that the new algorithm reduces topic drift.
383991	Transparent Queries: investigation users' mental models of search engines Typically, commercial Web search engines provide very little feedback to the user concerning how a particular query is processed and interpreted. Specifically, they apply key query transformations without the users knowledge. Although these transformations have a pronounced effect on query results, users have very few resources for recognizing their existence and understanding their practical importance. We conducted a user study to gain a better understanding of users knowledge of and reactions to the operation of several query transformations that web search engines automatically employ. Additionally, we developed and evaluated Transparent Queries, a software system designed to provide users with lightweight feedback about opaque query transformations. The results of the study suggest that users do indeed have difficulties understanding the operation of query transformations without additional assistance. Finally, although transparency is helpful and valuable, interfaces that allow direct control of query transformations might ultimately be more helpful for end-users.
383992	Why batch and user evaluations do not give the same results Much system-oriented evaluation of information retrieval systems has used the Cranfield approach based upon queries run against test collections in a batch mode. Some researchers have questioned whether this approach can be applied to the real world, but little data exists for or against that assertion. We have studied this question in the context of the TREC Interactive Track. Previous results demonstrated that improved performance as measured by relevance-based metrics in batch studies did not correspond with the results of outcomes based on real user searching tasks. The experiments in this paper analyzed those results to determine why this occurred. Our assessment showed that while the queries entered by real users into systems yielding better results in batch studies gave comparable gains in ranking of relevant documents for those users, they did not translate into better performance on specific tasks. This was most likely due to users being able to adequately find and utilize relevant documents ranked further down the output list.
383995	Evaluating topic-driven web crawlers Due to limited bandwidth, storage, and computational resources, and to the dynamic nature of the Web, search engines cannot index every Web page, and even the covered portion of the Web cannot be monitored continuously for changes. Therefore it is essential to develop effective crawling strategies to prioritize the pages to be indexed. The issue is even more important for topic-specific search engines, where crawlers must make additional decisions based on the relevance of visited pages. However, it is difficult to evaluate alternative crawling strategies because relevant sets are unknown and the search space is changing. We propose three different methods to evaluate crawling strategies. We apply the proposed metrics to compare three topic-driven crawling algorithms based on similarity ranking, link analysis, and adaptive agents.
383999	Effective site finding using link anchor information Link-based ranking methods have been described in the literature and applied in commercial Web search engines. However, according to recent TREC experiments, they are no better than traditional content-based methods. We conduct a different type of experiment, in which the task is to find the main entry point of a specific Web site. In our experiments, ranking based on link anchor text is twice as effective as ranking based on document content, even though both methods used the same BM25 formula. We obtained these results using two sets of 100 queries on a 18.5 million document set and another set of 100 on a 0.4 million document set. This site finding effectiveness begins to explain why many search engines have adopted link methods. It also opens a rich new area for effectiveness improvement, where traditional methods fail.
384003	Stable algorithms for link analysis The Kleinberg HITS and the Google PageRank algorithms are eigenvector methods for identifying ``authoritative'' or ``influential'' articles, given hyperlink or citation information. That such algorithms should give reliable or consistent answers is surely a desideratum, and in~cite{ijcaiPaper}, we analyzed when they can be expected to give stable rankings under small perturbations to the linkage patterns. In this paper, we extend the analysis and show how it gives insight into ways of designing stable link analysis methods. This in turn motivates two new algorithms, whose performance we study empirically using citation data and web hyperlink data.
384005	Modeling score distributions for combining the outputs of search engines In this paper the score distributions of a number of text search engines are modeled. It is shown empirically that the score distributions on a per query basis may be fitted using an exponential distribution for the set of non-relevant documents and a normal distribution for the set of relevant documents. Experiments show that this model fits TREC-3 and TREC-4 data for not only probabilistic search engines like INQUERY but also vector space search engines like SMART for English. We have also used this model to fit the output of other search engines like LSI search engines and search engines indexing other languages like Chinese. It is then shown that given a query for which relevance information is not available, a mixture model consisting of an exponential and a normal distribution can be fitted to the score distribution. These distributions can be used to map the scores of a search engine to probabilities. We also discuss how the shape of the score distributions arise given certain assumptions about word distributions in documents. We hypothesize that all 'good' text search engines operating on any language have similar characteristics. This model has many possible applications. For example, the outputs of different search engines can be combined by averaging the probabilities (optimal if the search engines are independent) or by using the probabilities to select the best engine for each query. Results show that the technique performs as well as the best current combination techniques.
384007	Models for metasearch Given the ranked lists of documents returned by multiple search engines in response to a given query, the problem of metasearch is to combine these lists in a way which optimizes the performance of the combination. This paper makes three contributions to the problem of metasearch: (1) We describe and investigate a metasearch model based on an optimal democratic voting procedure, the Borda Count; (2) we describe and investigate a metasearch model based on Bayesian inference; and (3) we describe and investigate a model for obtaining upper bounds on the performance of metasearch algorithms. Our experimental results show that metasearch algorithms based on the Borda and Bayesian models usually outperform the best input system and are competitive with, and often outperform, existing metasearch strategies. Finally, our initial upper bounds demonstrate that there is much to learn about the limits of the performance of metasearch.
384009	The score-distributional threshold optimization for adaptive binary classification tasks The thresholding of document scores has proved critical for the effectiveness of classification tasks. We review the most important approaches to thresholding, and introduce the score-distributional (S-D) threshold optimization method. The method is based on score distributions and is capable of optimizing any effectiveness measure defined in terms of the traditional contingency table. As a byproduct, we provide a model for score distributions , and demonstrate its high accuracy in describing empirical data. The estimation method can be performed incrementally, a highly desirable feature for adaptive environments. Our work in modeling score distributions is useful beyond threshold optimization problems. It directly applies to other retrieval environments that make use of score distributions,e.g., distributed retrieval, or topic detection and tracking. The most accurate version of S-D thresholding --- although incremental --- can be computationally heavy. Therefore, we also investigate more practical solutions. We suggest practical approximations and discuss adaptivity, threshold initialization, and incrementality issues. The practical version of S-D thresholding has been tested in the context of the TREC-9 Filtering Track and found to be very effective [2].
384011	A meta-learning approach for text categorization We investigate a meta-model approach, called Meta-learning Using Document Feature characteristics (MUDOF), for the task of automatic textual document categorization. It employs a meta-learning phase using document feature characteristics. Document feature characteristics, derived from the training document set, capture some inherent category-specific properties of a particular category. Different from existing categorization methods, MUDOF can automatically recommend a suitable algorithm for each category based on the category-specific statistical characteristics. Hence, different algorithms may be employed for different categories. Experiments have been conducted on a real-world document collection demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The results confirm that our meta-model approach can exploit the advantage of its component algorithms, and demonstrate a better performance than existing algorithms.
384012	Maximum likelihood estimation for filtering thresholds Information filtering systems based on statistical retrieval models usually compute a numeric score indicating how well each document matches each profile. Documents with scores above profile-specific dissemination thresholds are delivered. An optimal dissemination threshold is one that maximizes a given utility function based on the distributions of the scores of relevant and non-relevant documents. The parameters of the distribution can be estimated using relevance information, but relevance information obtained while filtering is biased . This paper presents a new method of adjusting dissemination thresholds that explicitly models and compensates for this bias. The new algorithm, which is based on the Maximum Likelihood principle, jointly estimates the parameters of the density distributions for relevant and non-relevant documents and the ratio of the relevant document in the corpus. Experiments with TREC-8 and TREC-9 Filtering Track data demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.
384013	Unsupervised and supervised clustering for topic tracking We investigate important differences between two styles of document clustering in the context of Topic Detection and Tracking. Converting a Topic Detection system into a Topic Tracking system exposes fundamental differences between these two tasks that are important to consider in both the design and the evaluation of TDT systems. We also identify features that can be used in systems for both tasks.
384017	Discovering information flow suing high dimensional conceptual space This paper presents an informational inference mechanism realized via the use of a high dimensional conceptual space. More specifically, we claim to have operationalized important aspects of GÃ?rdenforss recent three-level cognitive model. The connectionist level is primed with the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) algorithm which produces vector representations for use at the conceptual level. We show how inference at the symbolic level can be implemented by employing Barwise and Seligmans theory of information flow. This article also features heuristics for enhancing HAL-based representations via the use of quality properties, determining concept inclusion and computing concept composition. The worth of these heuristics in underpinning informational inference are demonstrated via a series of experiments. These experiments, though small in scale, show that informational inference proposed in this article has a very different character to the semantic associations produced by the Minkowski distance metric and concept similarity computed via the cosine coefficient. In short, informational inference generally uncovers concepts that are carried, or, in some cases, implied by another concept, (or combination of concepts).
384019	A study of smoothing methods for language models applied to Ad Hoc information retrieval Language modeling approaches to information retrieval are attractive and promising because they connect the problem of retrieval with that of language model estimation, which has been studied extensively in other application areas such as speech recognition. The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model for each document, and then rank documents by the likelihood of the query according to the estimated language model. A core problem in language model estimation is smoothing , which adjusts the maximum likelihood estimator so as to correct the inaccuracy due to data sparseness. In this paper, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance. We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collections.
384021	Topic segmentation with an aspect hidden Markov model We present a novel probabilistic method for topic segmentation on unstructured text. One previous approach to this problem utilizes the hidden Markov model (HMM) method for probabilistically modeling sequence data [7]. The HMM treats a document as mutually independent sets of words generated by a latent topic variable in a time series. We extend this idea by embedding Hofmann's aspect model for text [5] into the segmenting HMM to form an aspect HMM (AHMM). In doing so, we provide an intuitive topical dependency between words and a cohesive segmentation model. We apply this method to segment unbroken streams of New York Times articles as well as noisy transcripts of radio programs on SpeechBot , an online audio archive indexed by an automatic speech recognition engine. We provide experimental comparisons which show that the AHMM outperforms the HMM for this task.
384022	Finding topic words for hierarchical summarization Hierarchies have long been used for organization, summarization, and access to information. In this paper we define summarization in terms of a probabilistic language model and use the definition to explore a new technique for automatically generating topic hierarchies by applying a graph-theoretic algorithm, which is an approximation of the Dominating Set Problem. The algorithm efficiently chooses terms according to a language model. We compare the new technique to previous methods proposed for constructing topic hierarchies including subsumption and lexical hierarchies, as well as the top TF.IDF terms. Our results show that the new technique consistently performs as well as or better than these other techniques. They also show the usefulness of hierarchies compared with a list of terms.
384024	Exploiting redundancy in question answering Our goal is to automatically answer brief factual questions of the form ``When was the Battle of Hastings?'' or ``Who wrote The Wind in the Willows ?''. Since the answer to nearly any such question can now be found somewhere on the Web, the problem reduces to finding potential answers in large volumes of data and validating their accuracy. We apply a method for arbitrary passage retrieval to the first half of the problem and demonstrate that answer redundancy can be used to address the second half. The success of our approach depends on the idea that the volume of available Web data is large enough to supply the answer to most factual questions multiple times and in multiple contexts. A query is generated from a question and this query is used to select short passages that may contain the answer from a large collection of Web data. These passages are analyzed to identify candidate answers. The frequency of these candidates within the passages is used to ``vote'' for the most likely answer. The approach is experimentally tested on questions taken from the TREC-9 question-answering test collection. As an additional demonstration, the approach is extended to answer multiple choice trivia questions of the form typically asked in trivia quizzes and television game shows.
384025	High performance question/answering In this paper we present the features of a Question/Answering (Q/A) system that had unparalleled performance in the TREC-9 evaluations. We explain the accuracy of our system through the unique characteristics of its architecture: (1) usage of a wide-coverage answer type taxonomy; (2) repeated passage retrieval; (3) lexico-semantic feedback loops; (4) extraction of the answers based on machine learning techniques; and (5) answer caching. Experimental results show the effects of each feature on the overall performance of the Q/A system and lead to general conclusions about Q/A from large text collections.
384033	An experimental framework for email categorization and management Many problems are difficult to adequately explore until a prototype exists in order to elicit user feedback. One such problem is a system that automatically categorizes and manages email. Due to a myriad of user interface issues, a prototype is necessary to determine what techniques and technologies are effective in the email domain. This paper describes the implementation of an add-in for Microsoft Outlook 2000 TM that intends to address two problems with email: 1) help manage the inbox by automatically classifying email based on user folders, and 2) to aid in search and retrieval by providing a list of email relevant to the selected item. This add-in represents a first step in an experimental system for the study of other issues related to information management. The system has been set up to allow experimentation with other classification algorithms and the source code is available online in an effort to promote further experimentation.
384042	Text summarization via hidden Markov models A sentence extract summary of a document is a subset of the document's sentences that contains the main ideas in the document. We present an approach to generating such summaries, a hidden Markov model that judges the likelihood that each sentence should be contained in the summary. We compare the results of this method with summaries generated by humans, showing that we obtain significantly higher agreement than do earlier methods.

384068	Combining semantic and syntactic document classifiers to improve first story detection In this paper we describe a type of data fusion involving the combination of evidence derived from multiple document representations. Our aim is to investigate if a composite representation can improve the online detection of novel events in a stream of broadcast news stories. This classification process otherwise known as first story detection FSD (or in the Topic Detection and Tracking pilot study as online new event detection [1]), is one of three main classification tasks defined by the TDT initiative. Our composite document representation consists of a semantic representation (based on the lexical chains derived from a text) and a syntactic representation (using proper nouns). Using the TDT1 evaluation methodology, we evaluate a number of document representation combinations using these document classifiers.

636816	Vector space model of information retrieval: a reevaluation In this paper we, in essence, point out that the methods used in the current vector based systems are in conflict with the premises of the vector space model. The considerations, naturally, lead to how things might have been done differently. More importantly, it is felt that this investigation will lead to a clearer understanding of the issues and problems in using the vector space model in information retrieval.

636726	An evaluation of term dependence models in information retrieval In Practical retrieval environments the assumption is normally made that the terms assigned to the documents of a collection occur independently of each other. The term independence assumption is unrealistic in many cases, but its use leads to a simple retrieval algorithm. More realistic retrieval systems take into account dependencies between certain term pairs and possibly between term triples. In this study, methods are outlined for generating dependency factors for term pairs and term triples and for using them in retrieval. Evaluation output is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested methodologies.
62465	Coefficients of combining concept classes in a collection This report considers combining information to improve retrieval. The vector space model has been extended so different classes of data are associated with distinct concept types and their respective subvectors. Two collections with multiple concept types are described, ISI-1460 and CACM-3204. Experiments indicate that regression methods can help predict relevance, given query-document similarity values for each concept type. After sampling and transformation of data, the coefficient of determination for the best model was .48 (.66) for ISI (CACM). Average precision for the two collections was 11% (31%) better for probabilistic feedback with all types versus with terms only. These findings may be of particular interest to designers of document retrieval or hypertext systems since the role of links is shown to be especially beneficial.
62467	A cluster-based approach to thesaurus construction The importance of a thesaurus in the successful operation of an information retrieval system is well recognized. Yet techniques which support the automatic generation of thesauri remain largely undiscovered. This paper describes one approach to the automatic generation of global thesauri, based on the discrimination value model of Salton, Yang, and Yu and on an appropriate clustering algorithm. This method has been implemented and applied to two document collections. Preliminary results indicate that this method, which produces improvements in retrieval performance in excess of 10 and 15 percent in the test collections, is viable and worthy of continued investigation.
62469	Towards interactive query expansion In an era of online retrieval, it is appropriate to offer guidance to users wishing to improve their initial queries. One form of such guidance could be short lists of suggested terms gathered from feedback, nearest neighbors, and term variants of original query terms. To verify this approach, a series of experiments were run using the Cranfield test collection to discover techniques to select terms for these lists that would be effective for further retrieval. The results show that significant improvement can be expected from this approach to query expansion.
62470	The automatic indexing system AIR/PHYS - from research to applications Since October 1985, the automatic indexing system AIR/PHYS has been used in the input production of the physics data base of the Fachinformationsentrum Karlsruhe/West Germany. The texts to be indexed are abstracts written in English. The system of descriptors is prescribed. For the application of the AIR/PHYS system a large-scale dictionary containing more than 600 000 word-descriptor relations reap. phrase-descriptor relations has been developed. Most of these relations have been obtained by means of statistical and heuristical methods. In consequence, the relation system is rather imperfect. Therefore, the indexing system needs some fault- tolerating features. An appropriate indexing approach and the corresponding structure of the AIR/PHYS system are described. Finally, the conditions of the application as well as problems of further development are discussed.
62487	Information retrieval using a singular value decomposition model of latent semantic structure In a new method for automatic indexing and retrieval, implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents is modeled to improve estimates of term-document association, and therefore the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. Singular-value decomposition is used to decompose a large term by document matrix into 50 to 150 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination; both documents and terms are represented as vectors in a 50- to 150- dimensional space. Queries are represented as pseudo-documents vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents are ordered by their similarity to the query. Initial tests find this automatic method very promising.
62493	An outline of a general model for information retrieval systems This paper is a contribution to the construction of a general model for information retrieval. As in the paper of Van Rijsbergen ([RIJ86]), the implicit base in all information retrieval systems is considered as a logical implication. The measure of correspondence between a document and a query is transformed into the estimation of the strength (or certainty) of logical implication. The modal logics will show its suitability for representing the behavior of information retrieval systems. In existing Information Retrieval models, several aspects are often mixed. A part of this paper is contributed to separate these aspects to give a clearer view of information retrieval systems. This general model is also compared with some existing models to show its generality.
62500	Compression of concordances in full-text retrieval systems The concordance of a full-text information retrieval system contains for every different word W of the data base, a list L(W) of âcoordinatesâ, each of which describes the exact location of an occurrence of W in the text. The concordance should be compressed, not only for the savings in storage space, but also in order to reduce the number of I/O operations, since the file is usually kept in secondary memory. Several methods are presented, which efficiently compress concordances of large fulltext retrieval systems. The methods were tested on the concordance of the Responsa Retrieval Project and yield savings of up to 49% relative to the non-compressed file; this is a relative improvement of about 27% over the currently used prefix-omission compression technique.
62439	Experiments on incorporating syntactic processing of user queries into a document retrieval strategy Traditional information has relied on the extensive use of statistical parameters in the implementation of retrieval strategies. This paper sets out to investigate whether linguistic processes can be used as part of a document retrieval strategy. This is done by predefining a level of syntactic analysis of user queries only, to be used as part of the retrieval process. A large series of experiments on an experimental test collection are reported which use a parser for noun phrases as part of the retrieval strategy. The results obtained from the experiments do yield improvements in the level of retrieval effectiveness and given the crude linguistic process used and the way it was used on queries and not on document texts, suggests that the approach of using linguistic processing in retrieval, is valid.
62447	On the use of spreading activation methods in automatic information Spreading activation methods have been recommended in information retrieval to expand the search vocabulary and to complement the retrieved document sets. The spreading activation strategy is reminiscent of earlier associative indexing and retrieval systems. Some spreading activation procedures are briefly described, and evaluation output is given, reflecting the effectiveness of one of the proposed procedures.
62452	Linear structure in information retrieval Based on the concept of user preference, we investigate the linear structure in information retrieval. We also discuss a practical procedure to determine the linear decision function and present an analysis of term weighting. Our experimental results seem to demonstrate that our model provides a useful framework for the design of an adaptive system.
75337	Adaptive information retrieval: using a connectionist representation to retrieve and learn about documents AIR represents a connectionist approach to the task of information retrieval. The system uses relevance feedback from its users to change its representation of authors, index terms and documents so that, over time, AIR improves at its task. The result is a representation of the consensual meaning of keywords and documents shared by some group of users. The central focus goal of this paper is to use our experience with AIR to highlight those characteristics of connectionist representations that make them particularly appropriate for IR applications. We argue that this associative representation is a natural generalization of traditional IR techniques, and that connectionist learning techniques are effective in this setting.
75338	A neural network for probabilistic information retrieval This paper demonstrates how a neural network may be constructed, together with learning algorithms and modes of operation, that will provide retrieval effectiveness similar to that of the probabilistic indexing and retrieval model based on single terms as document components.
75339	Design of a browsing interface for information retrieval In conventional Boolean retrieval systems, users have difficulty controlling the amount of output obtained from a given query. This paper describes the design of a user interface which permits gradual enlargement or refinement of the user's query by browsing through a graph of term and document subsets. This graph is obtained from a lattice automatically generated from the usual document-term relation. The major design features of the proposed interface are the integration of menu, fill-in the blank and direct manipulation modes of interaction within the âfisheye viewâ [Furnas, 1986] paradigm. A prototype user interface incorporating some of these ideas has been implemented on a microcomputer. The resulting interface is well adapted to various kinds of users and needs. More experienced users with a particular subject in mind can directly specify a query which results into a jump to a particular vertex in the graph. From there, the user can refine his initial query by browsing through the graph from that point on. On the other hand, casual users without any prior knowledge of the contents of the system or users without any particular subject in mind can freely navigate through the graph without ever specifying any query.
75340	A library system for information retrieval based on a cognitive task analysis and supported by an icon-based interface An abstract is not available.
75344	Towards an information logic 'Probability is expectation founded upon partial knowledge.' (Boole, 1854) Information retrieval based on stored program electronic computers has been an active area of research since the time these machines were invented. It is therefore somewhat surprising that even now no formal computational model for IR exists. There is no well-defined logic to describe information retrieval, and there is no proof or model theory to talk about the truths of IR. This paper argues that much of the research work in the past has been steps in the direction of a logic for IR. These steps have been taken by developing formal models for information retrieval, but to date none of these are complete nor could any claim to be a computational model for IR. To appreciate this development I shall present a picture of IR, describing bits of a puzzle which may fit together to point to a new framework within which a computational model or logic could be described.
75345	A parallel indexed algorithm for information retrieval In this paper we present a parallel document ranking algorithm suitable for use on databases of 1-1000 GB, resident on primary or secondary storage. The algorithm is based on inverted indexes, and has two advantages over a previously published parallel algorithm for retrieval based on signature files. First, it permits the employment of ranking strategies which cannot be easily implemented using signature files, specifically methods which depend on document-term weighting. Second, it permits the interactive searching of databases resident on secondary storage. The algorithm is evaluated via a mixture of analytic and simulation techniques, with a particular focus on how cost-effectiveness and efficiency change as the size of the database, number of processors, and cost of memory are altered. In particular, we find that if the ratio of the number of processors and/or disks to the size of the database is held constant, then the cost-effectiveness of the resulting system remains constant. Furthermore, for a given size of database, there is a number of processors which optimizes cost-effectiveness. Estimated response times are also presented. Using these methods, it appears that cost-effective interactive access to databases in the 100-1000 GB range can be achieved using current technology.
75349	Word sense disambiguation using machine-readable dictionaries An abstract is not available.
75355	Full text indexing based on lexical relations an application: software libraries In contrast to other kinds of libraries, software libraries need to be conceptually organized. When looking for a component, the main concern of users is the functionality of the desired component; implementation details are secondary. Software reuse would be enhanced with conceptually organized large libraries of software components. In this paper, we present GURU, a tool that allows automatical building of such large software libraries from documented software components. We focus here on GURU's indexing component which extracts conceptual attributes from natural language documentation. This indexing method is based on words' co-occurrences. It first uses EXTRACT, a co-occurrence knowledge compiler for extracting potential attributes from textual documents. Conceptually relevant collocations are then selected according to their resolving power, which scales down the noise due to context words. This fully automated indexing tool thus goes further than keyword-based tools in the understanding of a document without the brittleness of knowledge based tools. The indexing component of GURU is fully implemented, and some results are given in the paper.
75356	How a personal document's intended use or purpose affects its classification in an office This paper reports on one of the findings of a larger case study that attempts to describe how people organize documents in their own offices. In that study, several dimensions along which people make classificatory decisions were identified. Of these, the use to which a document is put emerged as a strong determiner of that document's classification. The method of analysis is reviewed, and examples of different kinds of uses are presented, demonstrating that it is possible to describe a wide variety of specific instances using a closed set of descriptors. The suggestion is made that, in designing systems for organizing materials, it might be advantageous to incorporate information about contextual variables, such as use, since these seem to be particularly important in classification decisions made within personal environments.
75479	On the application of syntactic methodologies in automatic text analysis This study summarizes various linguistic approaches proposed for document analysis in information retrieval environments. Included are standard syntactic methods to generate complex content identifiers, and the use of semantic know-how obtained from machine-readable dictionaries and from specially constructed knowledge bases. A particular syntactic analysis methodology is also outlined and its usefulness for the automatic construction of book indexes is examined.
860439	Bayesian extension to the language model for ad hoc information retrieval We propose a Bayesian extension to the ad-hoc Language Model. Many smoothed estimators used for the multinomial query model in ad-hoc Language Models (including Laplace and Bayes-smoothing) are approximations to the Bayesian predictive distribution. In this paper we derive the full predictive distribution in a form amenable to implementation by classical IR models, and then compare it to other currently used estimators. In our experiments the proposed model outperforms Bayes-smoothing, and its combination with linear interpolation smoothing outperforms all other estimators.
860440	Beyond independent relevance: methods and evaluation metrics for subtopic retrieval We present a non-traditional retrieval problem we call subtopic retrieval . The subtopic retrieval problem is concerned with finding documents that cover many different subtopics of a query topic. In such a problem, the utility of a document in a ranking is dependent on other documents in the ranking, violating the assumption of independent relevance which is assumed in most traditional retrieval methods. Subtopic retrieval poses challenges for evaluating performance, as well as for developing effective algorithms. We propose a framework for evaluating subtopic retrieval which generalizes the traditional precision and recall metrics by accounting for intrinsic topic difficulty as well as redundancy in documents. We propose and systematically evaluate several methods for performing subtopic retrieval using statistical language models and a maximal marginal relevance (MMR) ranking strategy. A mixture model combined with query likelihood relevance ranking is shown to modestly outperform a baseline relevance ranking on a data set used in the TREC interactive track.
860443	Question classification using support vector machines Question classification is very important for question answering. This paper presents our research work on automatic question classification through machine learning approaches. We have experimented with five machine learning algorithms: Nearest Neighbors (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Sparse Network of Winnows (SNoW), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) using two kinds of features: bag-of-words and bag-of-ngrams. The experiment results show that with only surface text features the SVM outperforms the other four methods for this task. Further, we propose to use a special kernel function called the tree kernel to enable the SVM to take advantage of the syntactic structures of questions. We describe how the tree kernel can be computed efficiently by dynamic programming. The performance of our approach is promising, when tested on the questions from the TREC QA track.
860444	Structured use of external knowledge for event-based open domain question answering One of the major problems in question answering (QA) is that the queries are either too brief or often do not contain most relevant terms in the target corpus. In order to overcome this problem, our earlier work integrates external knowledge extracted from the Web and WordNet to perform Event-based QA on the TREC-11 task. This paper extends our approach to perform event-based QA by uncovering the structure within the external knowledge. The knowledge structure loosely models different facets of QA events, and is used in conjunction with successive constraint relaxation algorithm to achieve effective QA. Our results obtained on TREC-11 QA corpus indicate that the new approach is more effective and able to attain a confidence-weighted score of above 80%.
860445	Quantitative evaluation of passage retrieval algorithms for question answering Passage retrieval is an important component common to many question answering systems. Because most evaluations of question answering systems focus on end-to-end performance, comparison of common components becomes difficult. To address this shortcoming, we present a quantitative evaluation of various passage retrieval algorithms for question answering, implemented in a framework called Pauchok. We present three important findings: Boolean querying schemes perform well in the question answering task. The performance differences between various passage retrieval algorithms vary with the choice of document retriever, which suggests significant interactions between document retrieval and passage retrieval. The best algorithms in our evaluation employ density-based measures for scoring query terms. Our results reveal future directions for passage retrieval and question answering.
860447	Building a web thesaurus from web link structure Thesaurus has been widely used in many applications, including information retrieval, natural language processing, and question answering. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically constructing a domain-specific thesaurus from the Web using link structure information. The proposed approach is able to identify new terms and reflect the latest relationship between terms as the Web evolves. First, a set of high quality and representative websites of a specific domain is selected. After filtering out navigational links, link analysis is applied to each website to obtain its content structure. Finally, the thesaurus is constructed by merging the content structures of the selected websites. The experimental results on automatic query expansion based on our constructed thesaurus show 20% improvement in search precision compared to the baseline.
860448	Implicit link analysis for small web search Current Web search engines generally impose link analysis-based re-ranking on web-page retrieval. However, the same techniques, when applied directly to small web search such as intranet and site search, cannot achieve the same performance because their link structures are different from the global Web. In this paper, we propose an approach to constructing implicit links by mining users' access patterns, and then apply a modified PageRank algorithm to re-rank web-pages for small web search. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms content-based method by 16%, explicit link-based PageRank by 20% and DirectHit by 14%, respectively.
860449	Query type classification for web document retrieval The heterogeneous Web exacerbates IR problems and short user queries make them worse. The contents of web documents are not enough to find good answer documents. Link information and URL information compensates for the insufficiencies of content information. However, static combination of multiple evidences may lower the retrieval performance. We need different strategies to find target documents according to a query type. We can classify user queries as three categories, the topic relevance task, the homepage finding task, and the service finding task. In this paper, a user query classification scheme is proposed. This scheme uses the difference of distribution, mutual information, the usage rate as anchor texts, and the POS information for the classification. After we classified a user query, we apply different algorithms and information for the better results. For the topic relevance task, we emphasize the content information, on the other hand, for the homepage finding task, we emphasize the Link information and the URL information. We could get the best performance when our proposed classification method with the OKAPI scoring algorithm was used.
860451	Stuff I've seen: a system for personal information retrieval and re-use Most information retrieval technologies are designed to facilitate information discovery. However, much knowledge work involves finding and re-using previously seen information. We describe the design and evaluation of a system, called Stuff I've Seen (SIS) , that facilitates information re-use. This is accomplished in two ways. First, the system provides a unified index of information that a person has seen, whether it was seen as email, web page, document, appointment, etc. Second, because the information has been seen before, rich contextual cues can be used in the search interface. The system has been used internally by more than 230 employees. We report on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of system use. Initial findings show that time and people are important retrieval cues. Users find information more easily using SIS, and use other search tools less frequently after installation.
860452	Search strategies in content-based image retrieval This paper describes two studies that looked at users' ability to formulate visual queries with a Content-Based Image Retrieval system that uses dominant image colour as the primary indexing key. The first experiment examined users' performance with two visual search tools, a sketch tool and a structured browsing tool, with different types of image query. The results showed that while users were able to successfully search on the basis of colour, and were able to formulate visual queries, their ability to do so was affected by search task type. Search task type was also shown to be related to search tool choice. However, the results of study two showed that while users were able to complete all of the tasks, there was evidence to suggest that a degree of compromise was present in the users' choice of image that was largely due to problems relating to query formulation.
860453	Using terminological feedback for web search refinement: a log-based study Although interactive query reformulation has been actively studied in the laboratory, little is known about the actual behavior of web searchers who are offered terminological feedback along with their search results. We analyze log sessions for two groups of users interacting with variants of the AltaVista search engine - a baseline group given no terminological feedback and a feedback group to whom twelve refinement terms are offered along with the search results. We examine uptake, refinement effectiveness, conditions of use, and refinement type preferences. Although our measure of overall session "success" shows no difference between outcomes for the two groups, we find evidence that a subset of those users presented with terminological feedback do make effective use of it on a continuing basis.
860455	A scalability analysis of classifiers in text categorization Real-world applications of text categorization often require a system to deal with tens of thousands of categories defined over a large taxonomy. This paper addresses the problem with respect to a set of popular algorithms in text categorization, including Support Vector Machines, k-nearest neighbor, ridge regression, linear least square fit and logistic regression. By providing a formal analysis of the computational complexity of each classification method, followed by an investigation on the usage of different classifiers in a hierarchical setting of categorization, we show how the scalability of a method depends on the topology of the hierarchy and the category distributions. In addition, we are able to obtain tight bounds for the complexities by using the power law to approximate category distributions over a hierarchy. Experiments with kNN and SVM classifiers on the OHSUMED corpus are reported on, as concrete examples.
860456	A repetition based measure for verification of text collections and for text categorization We suggest a way for locating duplicates and plagiarisms in a text collection using an R-measure , which is the normalized sum of the lengths of all suffixes of the text repeated in other documents of the collection. The R-measure can be effectively computed using the suffix array data structure. Additionally, the computation procedure can be improved to locate the sets of duplicate or plagiarised documents. We applied the technique to several standard text collections and found that they contained a significant number of duplicate and plagiarised documents. Another reformulation of the method leads to an algorithm that can be applied to supervised multi-class categorization. We illustrate the approach using the recently available Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1). The results show that the method outperforms SVM at multi-class categorization, and interestingly, that results correlate strongly with compression-based methods.
860457	Using asymmetric distributions to improve text classifier probability estimates Text classifiers that give probability estimates are more readily applicable in a variety of scenarios. For example, rather than choosing one set decision threshold, they can be used in a Bayesian risk model to issue a run-time decision which minimizes a user-specified cost function dynamically chosen at prediction time. However, the quality of the probability estimates is crucial. We review a variety of standard approaches to converting scores (and poor probability estimates) from text classifiers to high quality estimates and introduce new models motivated by the intuition that the empirical score distribution for the "extremely irrelevant", "hard to discriminate", and "obviously relevant" items are often significantly different. Finally, we analyze the experimental performance of these models over the outputs of two text classifiers. The analysis demonstrates that one of these models is theoretically attractive (introducing few new parameters while increasing flexibility), computationally efficient, and empirically preferable.
860459	Automatic image annotation and retrieval using cross-media relevance models Libraries have traditionally used manual image annotation for indexing and then later retrieving their image collections. However, manual image annotation is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content. Here, we propose an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set of images. We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs. Blobs are generated from image features using clustering. Given a training set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. We show that relevance models allow us to derive these probabilities in a natural way. Experiments show that the annotation performance of this cross-media relevance model is almost six times as good (in terms of mean precision) than a model based on word-blob co-occurrence model and twice as good as a state of the art model derived from machine translation. Our approach shows the usefulness of using formal information retrieval models for the task of image annotation and retrieval.
860460	Modeling annotated data We consider the problem of modeling annotated data---data with multiple types where the instance of one type (such as a caption) serves as a description of the other type (such as an image). We describe three hierarchical probabilistic mixture models which aim to describe such data, culminating in correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation , a latent variable model that is effective at modeling the joint distribution of both types and the conditional distribution of the annotation given the primary type. We conduct experiments on the Corel database of images and captions, assessing performance in terms of held-out likelihood, automatic annotation, and text-based image retrieval.
860461	Experimental result analysis for a generative probabilistic image retrieval model The main conclusion from the metrics-based evaluation of video retrieval systems at TREC's video track is that non-interactive image retrieval from general collections using visual information only is not yet feasible. We show how a detailed analysis of retrieval results -- looking beyond mean average precision (MAP) scores on topical relevance -- gives significant insight in the main problems with the visual part of the retrieval model under study. Such an analytical approach proves an important addition to standard evaluation measures.
860463	Combining document representations for known-item search This paper investigates the pre-conditions for successful combination of document representations formed from structural markup for the task of known-item search. As this task is very similar to work in meta-search and data fusion, we adapt several hypotheses from those research areas and investigate them in this context. To investigate these hypotheses, we present a mixture-based language model and also examine many of the current meta-search algorithms. We find that compatible output from systems is important for successful combination of document representations. We also demonstrate that combining low performing document representations can improve performance, but not consistently. We find that the techniques best suited for this task are robust to the inclusion of poorly performing document representations. We also explore the role of variance of results across systems and its impact on the performance of fusion, with the surprising result that the correct documents have higher variance across document representations than highly ranking incorrect documents.
860464	Searching XML documents via XML fragments Most of the work on XML query and search has stemmed from the publishing and database communities, mostly for the needs of business applications. Recently, the Information Retrieval community began investigating the XML search issue to answer information discovery needs. Following this trend, we present here an approach where information needs can be expressed in an approximate manner as pieces of XML documents or "XML fragments" of the same nature as the documents that are being searched. We present an extension of the vector space model for searching XML collections via XML fragments and ranking results by relevance. We describe how we have extended a full-text search engine to comply with this model. The value of the proposed method is demonstrated by the relative high precision of our system, which was among the top performers in the recent INEX workshop. Our results indicate that certain queries are more appropriate than others for the extended vector space model. Specifically, queries with relatively specific contexts but vague information needs are best situated to reap the benefit of this model. Finally our results show that one method may not fit all types of queries and that it could be worthwhile to use different solutions for different applications.
860466	Word sense disambiguation in information retrieval revisited Word sense ambiguity is recognized as having a detrimental effect on the precision of information retrieval systems in general and web search systems in particular, due to the sparse nature of the queries involved. Despite continued research into the application of automated word sense disambiguation, the question remains as to whether less than 90% accurate automated word sense disambiguation can lead to improvements in retrieval effectiveness. In this study we explore the development and subsequent evaluation of a statistical word sense disambiguation system which demonstrates increased precision from a sense based vector space retrieval model over traditional TF*IDF techniques.
860469	A maximal figure-of-merit learning approach to text categorization A novel maximal figure-of-merit (MFoM) learning approach to text categorization is proposed. Different from the conventional techniques, the proposed MFoM method attempts to integrate any performance metric of interest (e.g. accuracy, recall, precision, or F1 measure) into the design of any classifier. The corresponding classifier parameters are learned by optimizing an overall objective function of interest. To solve this highly nonlinear optimization problem, we use a generalized probabilistic descent algorithm. The MFoM learning framework is evaluated on the Reuters-21578 task with LSI-based feature extraction and a binary tree classifier. Experimental results indicate that the MFoM classifier gives improved F1 and enhanced robustness over the conventional one. It also outperforms the popular SVM method in micro-averaging F1. Other extensions to design discriminative multiple-category MFoM classifiers for application scenarios with new performance metrics could be envisioned too.
860470	Text categorization by boosting automatically extracted concepts Term-based representations of documents have found wide-spread use in information retrieval. However, one of the main shortcomings of such methods is that they largely disregard lexical semantics and, as a consequence, are not sufficiently robust with respect to variations in word usage.In this paper we investigate the use of concept-based document representations to supplement word- or phrase-based features. The utilized concepts are automatically extracted from documents via probabilistic latent semantic analysis. We propose to use AdaBoost to optimally combine weak hypotheses based on both types of features. Experimental results on standard benchmarks confirm the validity of our approach, showing that AdaBoost achieves consistent improvements by including additional semantic features in the learned ensemble.
860471	Robustness of regularized linear classification methods in text categorization Real-world applications often require the classification of documents under situations of small number of features, mis-labeled documents and rare positive examples. This paper investigates the robustness of three regularized linear classification methods (SVM, ridge regression and logistic regression) under above situations. We compare these methods in terms of their loss functions and score distributions, and establish the connection between their optimization problems and generalization error bounds. Several sets of controlled experiments on the Reuters-21578 corpus are conducted to investigate the robustness of these methods. Our results show that ridge regression seems to be the most promising candidate for rare class problems.
860473	Building and applying a concept hierarchy representation of a user profile Term dependence is a natural consequence of language use. Its successful representation has been a long standing goal for Information Retrieval research. We present a methodology for the construction of a concept hierarchy that takes into account the three basic dimensions of term dependence. We also introduce a document evaluation function that allows the use of the concept hierarchy as a user profile for Information Filtering. Initial experimental results indicate that this is a promising approach for incorporating term dependence in the way documents are filtered.
860474	Query length in interactive information retrieval Query length in best-match information retrieval (IR) systems is well known to be positively related to effectiveness in the IR task, when measured in experimental, non-interactive environments. However, in operational, interactive IR systems, query length is quite typically very short, on the order of two to three words. We report on a study which tested the effectiveness of a particular query elicitation technique in increasing initial searcher query length, and which tested the effectiveness of queries elicited using this technique, and the relationship in general between query length and search effectiveness in interactive IR. Results show that the specific technique results in longer queries than a standard query elicitation technique, that this technique is indeed usable, that the technique results in increased user satisfaction with the search, and that query length is positively correlated with user satisfaction with the search.
860475	Re-examining the potential effectiveness of interactive query expansion Much attention has been paid to the relative effectiveness of interactive query expansion versus automatic query expansion. Although interactive query expansion has the potential to be an effective means of improving a search, in this paper we show that, on average, human searchers are less likely than systems to make good expansion decisions. To enable good expansion decisions, searchers must have adequate instructions on how to use interactive query expansion functionalities. We show that simple instructions on using interactive query expansion do not necessarily help searchers make good expansion decisions and discuss difficulties found in making query expansion decisions.
860479	Table extraction using conditional random fields The ability to find tables and extract information from them is a necessary component of data mining, question answering, and other information retrieval tasks. Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells.
860481	Building a filtering test collection for TREC 2002 Test collections for the filtering track in TREC have typically used either past sets of relevance judgments, or categorized collections such as Reuters Corpus Volume 1 or OHSUMED, because filtering systems need relevance judgments during the experiment for training and adaptation. For TREC 2002, we constructed an entirely new set of search topics for the Reuters Corpus for measuring filtering systems. Our method for building the topics involved multiple iterations of feedback from assessors, and fusion of results from multiple search systems using different search algorithms. We also developed a second set of "inexpensive" topics based on categories in the document collection. We found that the initial judgments made for the experiment were sufficient; subsequent pooled judging changed system rankings very little. We also found that systems performed very differently on the category topics than on the assessor-built topics.
860482	An empirical study on retrieval models for different document genres: patents and newspaper articles Reflecting the rapid growth in the utilization of large test collections for information retrieval since the 1990s, extensive comparative experiments have been performed to explore the effectiveness of various retrieval models. However, most collections were intended for retrieving newspaper articles and technical abstracts. In this paper, we describe the process of producing a test collection for patent retrieval, the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Collection, which includes two years of Japanese patent applications and 31 topics produced by professional patent searchers. We also report experimental results obtained by using this collection to re-examine the effectiveness of existing retrieval models in the context of patent retrieval. The relative superiority among existing retrieval models did not significantly differ depending on the document genre, that is, patents and newspaper articles. Issues related to patent retrieval are also discussed.
860483	Collaborative filtering via gaussian probabilistic latent semantic analysis Collaborative filtering aims at learning predictive models of user preferences, interests or behavior from community data, i.e. a database of available user preferences. In this paper, we describe a new model-based algorithm designed for this task, which is based on a generalization of probabilistic latent semantic analysis to continuous-valued response variables. More specifically, we assume that the observed user ratings can be modeled as a mixture of user communities or interest groups, where users may participate probabilistically in one or more groups. Each community is characterized by a Gaussian distribution on the normalized ratings for each item. The normalization of ratings is performed in a user-specific manner to account for variations in absolute shift and variance of ratings. Experiments on the EachMovie data set show that the proposed approach compares favorably with other collaborative filtering techniques.
860485	Document clustering based on non-negative matrix factorization In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering method based on the non-negative factorization of the term-document matrix of the given document corpus. In the latent semantic space derived by the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), each axis captures the base topic of a particular document cluster, and each document is represented as an additive combination of the base topics. The cluster membership of each document can be easily determined by finding the base topic (the axis) with which the document has the largest projection value. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed document clustering method surpasses the latent semantic indexing and the spectral clustering methods not only in the easy and reliable derivation of document clustering results, but also in document clustering accuracies.
860486	ReCoM: reinforcement clustering of multi-type interrelated data objects Most existing clustering algorithms cluster highly related data objects such as Web pages and Web users separately. The interrelation among different types of data objects is either not considered, or represented by a static feature space and treated in the same ways as other attributes of the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering approach for clustering multi-type interrelated data objects, ReCoM (Reinforcement Clustering of Multi-type Interrelated data objects). Under this approach, relationships among data objects are used to improve the cluster quality of interrelated data objects through an iterative reinforcement clustering process. At the same time, the link structure derived from relationships of the interrelated data objects is used to differentiate the importance of objects and the learned importance is also used in the clustering process to further improve the clustering results. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only effectively overcomes the problem of data sparseness caused by the high dimensional relationship space but also significantly improves the clustering accuracy.
860487	A comparative study on content-based music genre classification Content-based music genre classification is a fundamental component of music information retrieval systems and has been gaining importance and enjoying a growing amount of attention with the emergence of digital music on the Internet. Currently little work has been done on automatic music genre classification, and in addition, the reported classification accuracies are relatively low. This paper proposes a new feature extraction method for music genre classification, DWCHs . DWCHs stands for Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histograms. DWCHs capture the local and global information of music signals simultaneously by computing histograms on their Daubechies wavelet coefficients. Effectiveness of this new feature and of previously studied features are compared using various machine learning classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines and Linear Discriminant Analysis. It is demonstrated that the use of DWCHs significantly improves the accuracy of music genre classification.
860489	Evaluating different methods of estimating retrieval quality for resource selection In a federated digital library system, it is too expensive to query every accessible library. Resource selection is the task to decide to which libraries a query should be routed. Most existing resource selection algorithms compute a library ranking in a heuristic way. In contrast, the decision-theoretic framework (DTF) follows a different approach on a better theoretic foundation: It computes a selection which minimises the overall costs (e.g. retrieval quality, time, money) of the distributed retrieval. For estimating retrieval quality the recall-precision function is proposed. In this paper, we introduce two new methods: The first one computes the empirical distribution of the probabilities of relevance from a small library sample, and assumes it to be representative for the whole library. The second method assumes that the indexing weights follow a normal distribution, leading to a normal distribution for the document scores. Furthermore, we present the first evaluation of DTF by comparing this theoretical approach with the heuristical state-of-the-art system CORI; here we find that DTF outperforms CORI in most cases.
860490	Relevant document distribution estimation method for resource selection Prior research under a variety of conditions has shown the CORI algorithm to be one of the most effective resource selection algorithms, but the range of database sizes studied was not large. This paper shows that the CORI algorithm does not do well in environments with a mix of "small" and "very large" databases. A new resource selection algorithm is proposed that uses information about database sizes as well as database contents. We also show how to acquire database size estimates in uncooperative environments as an extension of the query-based sampling used to acquire resource descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that the database size estimates are more accurate for large databases than estimates produced by a competing method; the new resource ranking algorithm is always at least as effective as the CORI algorithm; and the new algorithm results in better document rankings than the CORI algorithm.
860491	SETS: search enhanced by topic segmentation We present SETS , an architecture for efficient search in peer-to-peer networks, building upon ideas drawn from machine learning and social network theory. The key idea is to arrange participating sites in a topic-segmented overlay topology in which most connections are short-distance , connecting pairs of sites with similar content. Topically focused sets of sites are then joined together into a single network by long-distance links. Queries are matched and routed to only the topically closest regions. We discuss a variety of design issues and tradeoffs that an implementor of SETS would face. We show that SETS is efficient in network traffic and query processing load.
860493	Retrieval and novelty detection at the sentence level Previous research in novelty detection has focused on the task of finding novel material, given a set or stream of documents on a certain topic. This study investigates the more difficult two-part task defined by the TREC 2002 novelty track: given a topic and a group of documents relevant to that topic, 1) find the relevant sentences from the documents, and 2) find the novel sentences from the collection of relevant sentences. Our research shows that the former step appears to be the more difficult part of this task, and that the performance of novelty measures is very sensitive to the presence of non-relevant sentences.
860494	Domain-independent text segmentation using anisotropic diffusion and dynamic programming This paper presents a novel domain-independent text segmentation method, which identifies the boundaries of topic changes in long text documents and/or text streams. The method consists of three components: As a preprocessing step, we eliminate the document-dependent stop words as well as the generic stop words before the sentence similarity is computed. This step assists in the discrimination of the sentence semantic information. Then the cohesion information of sentences in a document or a text stream is captured with a sentence-distance matrix with each entry corresponding to the similarity between a sentence pair. The distance matrix can be represented with a gray-scale image. Thus, a text segmentation problem is converted into an image segmentation problem. We apply the anisotropic diffusion technique to the image representation of the distance matrix to enhance the semantic cohesion of sentence topical groups as well as sharpen topical boundaries. At last, the dynamic programming technique is adapted to find the optimal topical boundaries and provide a zoom-in and zoom-out mechanism for topics access by segmenting text in variable numbers of sentence topical groups. Our approach involves no domain-specific training, and it can be applied to texts in a variety of domains. The experimental results show that our approach is effective in text segmentation and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
860495	A System for new event detection We present a new method and system for performing the New Event Detection task, i.e., in one or multiple streams of news stories, all stories on a previously unseen (new) event are marked. The method is based on an incremental TF-IDF model. Our extensions include: generation of source-specific models, similarity score normalization based on document-specific averages, similarity score normalization based on source-pair specific averages, term reweighting based on inverse event frequencies, and segmentation of the documents. We also report on extensions that did not improve results. The system performs very well on TDT3 and TDT4 test data and scored second in the TDT-2002 evaluation.
860497	Probabilistic structured query methods Structured methods for query term replacement rely on separate estimates of term tes of replacement probabilities. Statistically significantfrequency and document frequency to compute a weight for each query term. This paper reviews prior work on structured query techniques and introduces three new variants that leverage estima improvements in retrieval effectiveness are demonstrated for cross-language retrieval and for retrieval based on optical character recognition when replacement probabilities are used to estimate both term frequency and document frequency.
860498	Fuzzy translation of cross-lingual spelling variants We will present a novel two-step fuzzy translation technique for cross-lingual spelling variants. In the first stage, transformation rules are applied to source words to render them more similar to their target language equivalents. The rules are generated automatically using translation dictionaries as source data. In the second stage, the intermediate forms obtained in the first stage are translated into a target language using fuzzy matching. The effectiveness of the technique was evaluated empirically using five source languages and English as a target language. The target word list contained 189 000 English words with the correct equivalents for the source words among them. The source words were translated using the two-step fuzzy translation technique, and the results were compared with those of plain fuzzy matching based translation. The combined technique performed better, sometimes considerably better, than fuzzy matching alone.
860499	Automatic transliteration for Japanese-to-English text retrieval For cross language information retrieval (CLIR) based on bilingual translation dictionaries, good performance depends upon lexical coverage in the dictionary. This is especially true for languages possessing few inter-language cognates, such as between Japanese and English. In this paper, we describe a method for automatically creating and validating candidate Japanese transliterated terms of English words. A phonetic English dictionary and a set of probabilistic mapping rules are used for automatically generating transliteration candidates. A monolingual Japanese corpus is then used for automatically validating the transliterated terms. We evaluate the usage of the extracted English-Japanese transliteration pairs with Japanese to English retrieval experiments over the CLEF bilingual test collections. The use of our automatically derived extension to a bilingual translation dictionary improves average precision, both before and after pseudo-relevance feedback, with gains ranging from 2.5% to 64.8%.
860501	On the effectiveness of evaluating retrieval systems in the absence of relevance judgments Soboroff, Nicholas and Cahan recently proposed a method for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems without relevance judgments. They demonstrated that the system evaluations produced by their methodology are correlated with actual evaluations using relevance judgments in the TREC competition. In this work, we propose an explanation for this phenomenon. We devise a simple measure for quantifying the similarity of retrieval systems by assessing the similarity of their retrieved results. Then, given a collection of retrieval systems and their retrieved results, we use this measure to assess the average similarity of a system to the other systems in the collection. We demonstrate that evaluating retrieval systems according to average similarity yields results quite similar to the methodology proposed by Soboroff et~al., and we further demonstrate that these two techniques are in fact highly correlated. Thus, the techniques are effectively evaluating and ranking retrieval systems by "popularity" as opposed to "performance.

860505	Investigating the relationship between language model perplexity and IR precision-recall measures An empirical study has been conducted investigating the relationship between the performance of an aspect based language model in terms of perplexity and the corresponding information retrieval performance obtained. It is observed, on the corpora considered, that the perplexity of the language model has a systematic relationship with the achievable precision recall performance though it is not statistically significant.

860509	Exploiting query history for document ranking in interactive information retrieval In this poster,we incorporate user query history, as context information, to improve the retrieval performance in interactive retrieval. Experiments using the TREC data show that incorporating such context information indeed consistently improves the retrieval performance in both average precision and precision at 20 documents.
860525	XML retrieval: what to retrieve? The fundamental difference between standard information retrieval and XML retrieval is the unit of retrieval. In traditional IR, the unit of retrieval is fixed: it is the complete document. In XML retrieval, every XML element in a document is a retrievable unit. This makes XML retrieval more difficult: besides being relevant, a retrieved unit should be neither too large nor too small. The research presented here, a comparative analysis of two approaches to XML retrieval, aims to shed light on which XML elements should be retrieved. The experimental evaluation uses data from the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML retrieval (INEX 2002).
860528	Single n-gram stemming Stemming can improve retrieval accuracy, but stemmers are language-specific. Character n-gram tokenization achieves many of the benefits of stemming in a language independent way, but its use incurs a performance penalty. We demonstrate that selection of a single n-gram as a pseudo-stem for a word can be an effective and efficient language-neutral approach for some languages.

860536	Image classification using hybrid neural networks Use of semantic content is one of the major issues which needs to be addressed for improving image retrieval effectiveness. We present a new approach to classify images based on the combination of image processing techniques and hybrid neural networks. Multiple keywords are assigned to an image to represent its main contents, i.e. semantic content. Images are divided into a number of regions and colour and texture features are extracted. The first classifier, a self-organising map (SOM) clusters similar images based on the extracted features. Then, regions of the representative images of these clusters were labeled and used to train the second classifier, composed of several support vector machines (SVMs). Initial experiments on the accuracy of keyword assignment for a small vocabulary are reported.
860537	On an equivalence between PLSI and LDA Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a fully generative approach to language modelling which overcomes the inconsistent generative semantics of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI). This paper shows that PLSI is a maximum a posteriori estimated LDA model under a uniform Dirichlet prior, therefore the perceived shortcomings of PLSI can be resolved and elucidated within the LDA framework.
860538	Query word deletion prediction Web search query logs contain traces of users' search modifications. One strategy users employ is deleting terms, presumably to obtain greater coverage. It is useful to model and automate term deletion when arbitrary searches are conjunctively matched against a small hand constructed collection, such as a hand-built hierarchy, or collection of high-quality pages matched with key phrases. Queries with no matches can have words deleted till a match is obtained. We provide algorithms which perform substantially better than the baseline in predicting which word should be deleted from a reformulated query, for increasing query coverage in the context of web search on small high-quality collections.
860545	An information-theoretic measure for document similarity Recent work has demonstrated that the assessment of pairwise object similarity can be approached in an axiomatic manner using information theory. We extend this concept specifically to document similarity and test the effectiveness of an information-theoretic measure for pairwise document similarity. We adapt query retrieval to rate the quality of document similarity measures and demonstrate that our proposed information-theoretic measure for document similarity yields statistically significant improvements over other popular measures of similarity.
860549	Generating hierarchical summaries for web searches Hierarchies provide a means of organizing, summarizing and accessing information. We describe a method for automatically generating hierarchies from small collections of text, and then apply this technique to summarizing the documents retrieved by a search engine.

42009	An approach to natural language for document retrieval Document retrieval systems have been restricted, by the nature of the task, to techniques that can be used with large numbers of documents and broad domains. The most effective techniques that have been developed are based on the statistics of word occurrences in text. In this paper, we describe an approach to using natural language processing (NLP) techniques for what is essentially a natural language problem - the comparison of a request text with the text of document titles and abstracts. The proposed NLP techniques are used to develop a request model based on âconceptual case framesâ and to compare this model with the texts of candidate documents. The request model is also used to provide information to statistical search techniques that identify the candidate documents. As part of a preliminary evaluation of this approach, case frame representations of a set of requests from the CACM collection were constructed. Statistical searches carried out using dependency and relative importance information derived from the request models indicate that performance benefits can be obtained.
42016	Automatic phrase indexing for document retrieval An automatic phrase indexing method based on the term discrimination model is described, and the results of retrieval experiments on five document collections are presented. Problems related to this non-syntactic phrase construction method are discussed, and some possible solutions are proposed that make use of information about the syntactic structure of document and query texts.

98006	Inference networks for document retrieval The use of inference networks to support document retrieval is introduced. A network-based retrieval model is described and compared to conventional probabilistic and Boolean models.
98007	A retrieval model based on an extended modal logic and its application to the RIME experimental approach This paper focuses on the query processing module of RIME, an experimental prototype of an intelligent information retrieval system designed to manage high-precision queries on a corpus of medical reports. Though highly specific this particular corpus is representative of an important class of applications: information retrieval among full-text specialized documents which constitute critical sources of information in several organizations (medicine, law, space industryâ¦). This experience allowed us to design and implement an elaborate model for the semantic content of the documents which is an extension of the Conceptual Dependency approach. The underlying retrieval model is inspired from the Logic model proposed by C.J. Van Rijsbergen, which has been considerably refined using an Extended Modal Logic. After presenting the context of the RIME project, we briefly describe the models designed for the internal representation of medical reports and queries. The main part of the paper is then devoted to the retrieval model and its application to the query processing module of RIME which has a natural language interface. Processing a query involves two main phases: the interpretation which transforms the natural language query into a search expression, and the evaluation phases which retrieves the corresponding medical reports. We focus here on the evaluation phases and show its relationship with the underlying retrieval model. Evaluations from practical experiments are also given, along with indications about current developments of the project.
98008	Probabilistic document indexing from relevance feedback data Based on the binary independence indexing model, we apply three new concepts for probabilistic document indexing from relevance feedback data: Abstraction from specific terms and documents, which overcomes the restriction of limited relevance information for parameter estimation. Flexibility of the representation, which allows the integration of new text analysis and knowledge-based methods in our approach as well as the consideration of more complex document structures or different types of terms (e.g. single words and noun phrases). Probabilistic learning or classification methods for the estimation of the indexing weights making better use of the available relevance information. We give experimental results for five test collections which show improvements over other indexing methods.
98010	Hypertext, full text, and automatic linking Current computing systems typically support only mid-century information structures: simple hierarchies. Hypertext technologies enable users to impose many structures on document sets and, consequently, provide many paths to desired information, but they require that users work their way through some structure. Full-text search eliminates this requirement by ignoring structure altogether. The search strategy can also be restricted to work within specified contexts. The architecture provided for search readily supports automatic linking. These ideas have been tested in IRIS Intermedia.
98015	A direct manipulation interface for boolean information retrieval via natural language query This paper describes the design of a direct manipulation user interface for Boolean information retrieval. Intended to overcome the difficulties of manipulating explicit Boolean queries as well as the âblack boxâ drawbacks of so-called natural language query systems, the interface presents a two-dimensional graphical representation of a user's natural language query which not only exposes heuristic query transformations performed by the system, but also supports query reformulation by the user via direct manipulation of the representation. The paper illustrates the operation of the interface as implemented in the AI-STARS full-text information retrieval system.
98240	Experiments with query acquisition and use in document retrieval systems In some recent experimental document retrieval systems, emphasis has been placed on the acquisition of a detailed model of the information need through interaction with the user. It has been argued that these âenhancedâ queries, in combination with relevance feedback, will improve retrieval performance. In this paper, we describe a study with the aim of evaluating how easily enhanced queries can be acquired from users and how effectively this additional knowledge can be used in retrieval. The results indicate that significant effectiveness benefits can be obtained through the acquisition of domain concepts related to query concepts, together with their level of importance to the information need.
98244	Term clustering of syntactic phrases Term clustering and syntactic phrase formation are methods for transforming natural language text. Both have had only mixed success as strategies for improving the quality of text representations for document retrieval. Since the strengths of these methods are complementary, we have explored combining them to produce superior representations. In this paper we discuss our implementation of a syntactic phrase generator, as well as our preliminary experiments with producing phrase clusters. These experiments show small improvements in retrieval effectiveness resulting from the use of phrase clusters, but it is clear that corpora much larger than standard information retrieval test collections will be required to thoroughly evaluate the use of this technique.
98245	Optimization for dynamic inverted index maintenance For free-text search over rapidly evolving corpora, dynamic update of inverted indices is a basic requirement. B-trees are an effective tool in implementing such indices. The Zipfian distribution of postings suggests space and time optimizations unique to this task. In particular, we present two novel optimizations, merge update , which performs better than straight forward block update, and pulsing which significantly reduces space requirements without sacrificing performance.
98247	Partitioned posting files: a parallel inverted file structure for information retrieval This paper describes algorithms and data structures for applying a parallel computer to information retrieval. Previous work has described an implementation based on overlap encoded signatures. That system was limited by 1) the necessity of keeping the signatures in primary memory, and 2) the difficulties involved in implementing document-term weighting. Overcoming these limitations requires adapting the inverted index techniques used on serial machines. The most obvious adaptation, also previously described, suffers from the fact that data must be sent between processors at query-time. Since interprocessor communication is generally slower than local computation, this suggests that an algorithm which does not perform such communication might be faster. This paper presents a data structure, called a partitioned posting file, in which the interprocessor communication takes place at database-construction time, so that no data movement is needed at query-time. Algorithms for constructing the data structure are also described. Performance characteristics and storage overhead are established by benchmarking against a synthetic database.
2348405	Improving retrieval of short texts through document expansion Collections containing a large number of short documents are becoming increasingly common. As these collections grow in number and size, providing effective retrieval of brief texts presents a significant research problem. We propose a novel approach to improving information retrieval (IR) for short texts based on aggressive document expansion. Starting from the hypothesis that short documents tend to be about a single topic, we submit documents as pseudo-queries and analyze the results to learn about the documents themselves. Document expansion helps in this context because short documents yield little in the way of term frequency information. However, as we show, the proposed technique helps us model not only lexical properties, but also temporal properties of documents. We present experimental results using a corpus of microblog (Twitter) data and a corpus of metadata records from a federated digital library. With respect to established baselines, results of these experiments show that applying our proposed document expansion method yields significant improvements in effectiveness. Specifically, our method improves the lexical representation of documents and the ability to let time influence retrieval.
2348408	Modeling higher-order term dependencies in information retrieval using query hypergraphs Many of the recent, and more effective, retrieval models have incorporated dependencies between the terms in the query. In this paper, we advance this query representation one step further, and propose a retrieval framework that models higher-order term dependencies, i.e., dependencies between arbitrary query concepts rather than just query terms. In order to model higher-order term dependencies, we represent a query using a hypergraph structure -- a generalization of a graph, where a (hyper)edge connects an arbitrary subset of vertices. A vertex in a query hypergraph corresponds to an individual query concept, and a dependency between a subset of these vertices is modeled through a hyperedge. An extensive empirical evaluation using both newswire and web corpora demonstrates that query representation using hypergraphs is highly beneficial for verbose natural language queries. For these queries, query hypergraphs significantly improve the retrieval effectiveness of several state-of-the-art models that do not employ higher-order term dependencies.
2348400	Quality through flow and immersion: gamifying crowdsourced relevance assessments Crowdsourcing is a market of steadily-growing importance upon which both academia and industry increasingly rely. However, this market appears to be inherently infested with a significant share of malicious workers who try to maximise their profits through cheating or sloppiness. This serves to undermine the very merits crowdsourcing has come to represent. Based on previous experience as well as psychological insights, we propose the use of a game in order to attract and retain a larger share of reliable workers to frequently-requested crowdsourcing tasks such as relevance assessments and clustering. In a large-scale comparative study conducted using recent TREC data, we investigate the performance of traditional HIT designs and a game-based alternative that is able to achieve high quality at significantly lower pay rates, facing fewer malicious submissions.
2348313	Improving searcher models using mouse cursor activity Web search components such as ranking and query suggestions analyze the user data provided in query and click logs. While this data is easy to collect and provides information about user behavior, it omits user interactions with the search engine that do not hit the server; these logs omit search data such as users' cursor movements. Just as clicks provide signals for relevance in search results, cursor hovering and scrolling can be additional implicit signals. In this work, we demonstrate a technique to extend models of the user's search result examination state to infer document relevance. We start by exploring recorded user interactions with the search results, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We find that cursor hovering and scrolling are signals telling us which search results were examined, and we use these interactions to reveal latent variables in searcher models to more accurately compute document attractiveness and satisfaction. Accuracy is evaluated by computing how well our model using these parameters can predict future clicks for a particular query. We are able to improve the click predictions compared to a basic searcher model for higher ranked search results using the additional log data.
2348312	Modeling the impact of short- and long-term behavior on search personalization User behavior provides many cues to improve the relevance of search results through personalization. One aspect of user behavior that provides especially strong signals for delivering better relevance is an individual's history of queries and clicked documents. Previous studies have explored how short-term behavior or long-term behavior can be predictive of relevance. Ours is the first study to assess how short-term (session) behavior and long-term (historic) behavior interact, and how each may be used in isolation or in combination to optimally contribute to gains in relevance through search personalization. Our key findings include: historic behavior provides substantial benefits at the start of a search session; short-term session behavior contributes the majority of gains in an extended search session; and the combination of session and historic behavior out-performs using either alone. We also characterize how the relative contribution of each model changes throughout the duration of a session. Our findings have implications for the design of search systems that leverage user behavior to personalize the search experience.
2348308	TFMAP: optimizing MAP for top-n context-aware recommendation In this paper, we tackle the problem of top-N context-aware recommendation for implicit feedback scenarios. We frame this challenge as a ranking problem in collaborative filtering (CF). Much of the past work on CF has not focused on evaluation metrics that lead to good top-N recommendation lists in designing recommendation models. In addition, previous work on context-aware recommendation has mainly focused on explicit feedback data, i.e., ratings. We propose TFMAP, a model that directly maximizes Mean Average Precision with the aim of creating an optimally ranked list of items for individual users under a given context. TFMAP uses tensor factorization to model implicit feedback data (e.g., purchases, clicks) with contextual information. The optimization of MAP in a large data collection is computationally too complex to be tractable in practice. To address this computational bottleneck, we present a fast learning algorithm that exploits several intrinsic properties of average precision to improve the learning efficiency of TFMAP, and to ensure its scalability. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed fast learning algorithm, and demonstrate that TFMAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.
2348302	Evaluating aggregated search pages Aggregating search results from a variety of heterogeneous sources or verticals such as news, image and video into a single interface is a popular paradigm in web search. Although various approaches exist for selecting relevant verticals or optimising the aggregated search result page, evaluating the quality of an aggregated page is an open question. This paper proposes a general framework for evaluating the quality of aggregated search pages. We evaluate our approach by collecting annotated user preferences over a set of aggregated search pages for 56 topics and 12 verticals. We empirically demonstrate the fidelity of metrics instantiated from our proposed framework by showing that they strongly agree with the annotated user preferences of pairs of simulated aggregated pages. Furthermore, we show that our metrics agree with the majority preference more often than current diversity-based information retrieval metrics. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by showing that personalised historical preference data can be used to improve the performance of our proposed metrics.
2348304	Combining inverted indices and structured search for ad-hoc object retrieval Retrieving semi-structured entities to answer keyword queries is an increasingly important feature of many modern Web applications. The fast-growing Linked Open Data (LOD) movement makes it possible to crawl and index very large amounts of structured data describing hundreds of millions of entities. However, entity retrieval approaches have yet to find efficient and effective ways of ranking and navigating through those large data sets. In this paper, we address the problem of Ad-hoc Object Retrieval over large-scale LOD data by proposing a hybrid approach that combines IR and structured search techniques. Specifically, we propose an architecture that exploits an inverted index to answer keyword queries as well as a semi-structured database to improve the search effectiveness by automatically generating queries over the LOD graph. Experimental results show that our ranking algorithms exploiting both IR and graph indices outperform state-of-the-art entity retrieval techniques by up to 25% over the BM25 baseline.
2348300	Time-based calibration of effectiveness measures Many current effectiveness measures incorporate simplifying assumptions about user behavior. These assumptions prevent the measures from reflecting aspects of the search process that directly impact the quality of retrieval results as experienced by the user. In particular, these measures implicitly model users as working down a list of retrieval results, spending equal time assessing each document. In reality, even a careful user, intending to identify as much relevant material as possible, must spend longer on some documents than on others. Aspects such as document length, duplicates and summaries all influence the time required. In this paper, we introduce a time-biased gain measure, which explicitly accommodates such aspects of the search process. By conducting an appropriate user study, we calibrate and validate the measure against the TREC 2005 Robust Track test collection. We examine properties of the measure, contrasting it to traditional effectiveness measures, and exploring its extension to other aspects and environments. As its primary benefit, the measure allows us to evaluate system performance in human terms, while maintaining the simplicity and repeatability of system-oriented tests. Overall, we aim to achieve a clearer connection between user-oriented studies and system-oriented tests, allowing us to better transfer insights and outcomes from one to the other.
2348381	Adaptive context features for toponym resolution in streaming news News sources around the world generate constant streams of information, but effective streaming news retrieval requires an intimate understanding of the geographic content of news. This process of understanding, known as geotagging, consists of first finding words in article text that correspond to location names (toponyms), and second, assigning each toponym its correct lat/long values. The latter step, called toponym resolution, can also be considered a classification problem, where each of the possible interpretations for each toponym is classified as correct or incorrect. Hence, techniques from supervised machine learning can be applied to improve accuracy. New classification features to improve toponym resolution, termed adaptive context features, are introduced that consider a window of context around each toponym, and use geographic attributes of toponyms in the window to aid in their correct resolution. Adaptive parameters controlling the window's breadth and depth afford flexibility in managing a tradeoff between feature computation speed and resolution accuracy, allowing the features to potentially apply to a variety of textual domains. Extensive experiments with three large datasets of streaming news demonstrate the new features' effectiveness over two widely-used competing methods.
2348380	TwiNER: named entity recognition in targeted twitter stream Many private and/or public organizations have been reported to create and monitor targeted Twitter streams to collect and understand users' opinions about the organizations. Targeted Twitter stream is usually constructed by filtering tweets with user-defined selection criteria e.g. tweets published by users from a selected region, or tweets that match one or more predefined keywords. Targeted Twitter stream is then monitored to collect and understand users' opinions about the organizations. There is an emerging need for early crisis detection and response with such target stream. Such applications require a good named entity recognition (NER) system for Twitter, which is able to automatically discover emerging named entities that is potentially linked to the crisis. In this paper, we present a novel 2-step unsupervised NER system for targeted Twitter stream, called TwiNER. In the first step, it leverages on the global context obtained from Wikipedia and Web N-Gram corpus to partition tweets into valid segments (phrases) using a dynamic programming algorithm. Each such tweet segment is a candidate named entity. It is observed that the named entities in the targeted stream usually exhibit a gregarious property, due to the way the targeted stream is constructed. In the second step, TwiNER constructs a random walk model to exploit the gregarious property in the local context derived from the Twitter stream. The highly-ranked segments have a higher chance of being true named entities. We evaluated TwiNER on two sets of real-life tweets simulating two targeted streams. Evaluated using labeled ground truth, TwiNER achieves comparable performance as with conventional approaches in both streams. Various settings of TwiNER have also been examined to verify our global context + local context combo idea.
2348372	Collaborative personalized tweet recommendation Twitter has rapidly grown to a popular social network in recent years and provides a large number of real-time messages for users. Tweets are presented in chronological order and users scan the followees' timelines to find what they are interested in. However, an information overload problem has troubled many users, especially those with many followees and thousands of tweets arriving every day. In this paper, we focus on recommending useful tweets that users are really interested in personally to reduce the users' effort to find useful information. Many kinds of information on Twitter are available for helping recommendation, including the user's own tweet history, retweet history and social relations between users. We propose a method of making tweet recommendations based on collaborative ranking to capture personal interests. It can also conveniently integrate the other useful contextual information. Our final method considers three major elements on Twitter: tweet topic level factors, user social relation factors and explicit features such as authority of the publisher and quality of the tweet. The experiments show that all the proposed elements are important and our method greatly outperforms several baseline methods.
2348371	Learning to rank social update streams As online social media further integrates deeper into our lives, we spend more time consuming social update streams that come from our online connections. Although social update streams provide a tremendous opportunity for us to access information on-the-fly, we often complain about its relevance. Some of us are flooded with a steady stream of information and simply cannot process it in full. Ranking the incoming content becomes the only solution for the overwhelmed users. For some others, in contrast, the incoming information stream is pretty weak, and they have to actively search for relevant information which is quite tedious. For these users, augmenting their incoming content flow with relevant information from outside their first-degree network would be a viable solution. In that case, the problem of relevance becomes even more prominent. In this paper, we start an open discussion on how to build effective systems for ranking social updates from a unique perspective of LinkedIn -- the largest professional network in the world. More specifically, we address this problem as an intersection of learning to rank, collaborative filtering, and clickthrough modeling, while leveraging ideas from information retrieval and recommender systems. We propose a novel probabilistic latent factor model with regressions on explicit features and compare it with a number of non-trivial baselines. In addition to demonstrating superior performance of our model, we shed some light on the nature of social updates on LinkedIn and how users interact with them, which might be applicable to social update streams in general.
2348373	Exploring social influence for recommendation: a generative model approach Social friendship has been shown beneficial for item recommendation for years. However, existing approaches mostly incorporate social friendship into recommender systems by heuristics. In this paper, we argue that social influence between friends can be captured quantitatively and propose a probabilistic generative model, called social influenced selection(SIS), to model the decision making of item selection (e.g., what book to buy or where to dine). Based on SIS, we mine the social influence between linked friends and the personal preferences of users through statistical inference. To address the challenges arising from multiple layers of hidden factors in SIS, we develop a new parameter learning algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM). Moreover, we show that the mined social influence and user preferences are valuable for group recommendation and viral marketing. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation using real datasets crawled from last.fm and whrrl.com to validate our proposal. Experimental results show that social influence captured based on our SIS model is effective for enhancing both item recommendation and group recommendation, essential for viral marketing, and useful for various user analysis.
2348361	Cognos: crowdsourcing search for topic experts in microblogs Finding topic experts on microblogging sites with millions of users, such as Twitter, is a hard and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose and investigate a new methodology for discovering topic experts in the popular Twitter social network. Our methodology relies on the wisdom of the Twitter crowds -- it leverages Twitter Lists, which are often carefully curated by individual users to include experts on topics that interest them and whose meta-data (List names and descriptions) provides valuable semantic cues to the experts' domain of expertise. We mined List information to build Cognos, a system for finding topic experts in Twitter. Detailed experimental evaluation based on a real-world deployment shows that: (a) Cognos infers a user's expertise more accurately and comprehensively than state-of-the-art systems that rely on the user's bio or tweet content, (b) Cognos scales well due to built-in mechanisms to efficiently update its experts' database with new users, and (c) Despite relying only on a single feature, namely crowdsourced Lists, Cognos yields results comparable to, if not better than, those given by the official Twitter experts search engine for a wide range of queries in user tests. Our study highlights Lists as a potentially valuable source of information for future content or expert search systems in Twitter.
2348364	Time-sensitive query auto-completion Query auto-completion (QAC) is a common feature in modern search engines. High quality QAC candidates enhance search experience by saving users time that otherwise would be spent on typing each character or word sequentially. Current QAC methods rank suggestions according to their past popularity. However, query popularity changes over time, and the ranking of candidates must be adjusted accordingly. For instance, while halloween might be the right suggestion after typing ha in October, harry potter might be better any other time. Surprisingly, despite the importance of QAC as a key feature in most online search engines, its temporal dynamics have been under-studied. In this paper, we propose a time-sensitive approach for query auto-completion. Instead of ranking candidates according to their past popularity, we apply time-series and rank candidates according their forecasted frequencies. Our experiments on 846K queries and their daily frequencies sampled over a period of 4.5 years show that predicting the popularity of queries solely based on their past frequency can be misleading, and the forecasts obtained by time-series modeling are substantially more reliable. Our results also suggest that modeling the temporal trends of queries can significantly improve the ranking of QAC candidates.
2348359	Friend or frenemy?: predicting signed ties in social networks We study the problem of labeling the edges of a social network graph (e.g., acquaintance connections in Facebook) as either positive (i.e., trust, true friendship) or negative (i.e., distrust, possible frenemy) relations. Such signed relations provide much stronger signal in tying the behavior of online users than the unipolar Homophily effect, yet are largely unavailable as most social graphs only contain unsigned edges. We show the surprising fact that it is possible to infer signed social ties with good accuracy solely based on users' behavior of decision making (or using only a small fraction of supervision information) via unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms. This work hereby makes it possible to turn an unsigned acquaintance network (e.g. Facebook, Myspace) into a signed trust-distrust network (e.g. Epinion, Slashdot). Our results are based on a mixed effects framework that simultaneously captures users' behavior, social interactions as well as the interplay between the two. The framework includes a series of latent factor models and it also encodes the principles of balance and status from Social psychology. Experiments on Epinion and Yahoo! Pulse networks illustrate that (1) signed social ties can be predicted with high-accuracy even in fully unsupervised settings, and (2) the predicted signed ties are significantly more useful for social behavior prediction than simple Homophily.
2348343	Task complexity, vertical display and user interaction in aggregated search Aggregated search is the task of blending results from specialized search services or verticals into the Web search results. While many studies have focused on aggregated search techniques, few studies have tried to better understand how users interact with aggregated search results. This study investigates how task complexity and vertical display (the blending of vertical results into the web results) affect the use of vertical content. Twenty-nine subjects completed six search tasks of varying levels of task complexity using two aggregated search interfaces: one that blended vertical results into the web results and one that only provided indirect vertical access. Our results show that more complex tasks required significantly more interaction and that subjects completing these tasks examined more vertical results. While the amount of interaction was the same between interfaces, subjects clicked on more vertical results when these were blended into the web results. Our results also show an interaction between task complexity and vertical display; subjects clicked on more verticals when completing the more complex tasks with the interface that blended vertical results. Subjects' evaluations of the two interfaces were nearly identical, but when analyzed with respect to their interface preferences, we found a positive relationship between system evaluations and individual preferences. Subjects justified their preference using similar rationales and their comments illustrate how the display itself can influence judgments of information quality, especially in cases when the vertical results might not be relevant to the search task.
2348296	Diversity by proportionality: an election-based approach to search result diversification This paper presents a different perspective on diversity in search results: diversity by proportionality. We consider a result list most diverse, with respect to some set of topics related to the query, when the number of documents it provides on each topic is proportional to the topic's popularity. Consequently, we propose a framework for optimizing proportionality for search result diversification, which is motivated by the problem of assigning seats to members of competing political parties. Our technique iteratively determines, for each position in the result ranked list, the topic that best maintains the overall proportionality. It then selects the best document on this topic for this position. We demonstrate empirically that our method significantly outperforms the top performing approach in the literature not only on our proposed metric for proportionality, but also on several standard diversity measures. This result indicates that promoting proportionality naturally leads to minimal redundancy, which is a goal of the current diversity approaches.
2348297	Explicit relevance models in intent-oriented information retrieval diversification The intent-oriented search diversification methods developed in the field so far tend to build on generative views of the retrieval system to be diversified. Core algorithm components in particular redundancy assessment are expressed in terms of the probability to observe documents, rather than the probability that the documents be relevant. This has been sometimes described as a view considering the selection of a single document in the underlying task model. In this paper we propose an alternative formulation of aspect-based diversification algorithms which explicitly includes a formal relevance model. We develop means for the effective computation of the new formulation, and we test the resulting algorithm empirically. We report experiments on search and recommendation tasks showing competitive or better performance than the original diversification algorithms. The relevance-based formulation has further interesting properties, such as unifying two well-known state of the art algorithms into a single version. The relevance-based approach opens alternative possibilities for further formal connections and developments as natural extensions of the framework. We illustrate this by modeling tolerance to redundancy as an explicit configurable parameter, which can be set to better suit the characteristics of the IR task, or the evaluation metrics, as we illustrate empirically.
2484049	How query cost affects search behavior affects how users interact with a search system. Microeconomic theory is used to generate the cost-interaction hypothesis that states as the cost of querying increases, users will pose fewer queries and examine more documents per query. A between-subjects laboratory study with 36 undergraduate subjects was conducted, where subjects were randomly assigned to use one of three search interfaces that varied according to the amount of physical cost required to query: Structured (high cost), Standard (medium cost) and Query Suggestion (low cost). Results show that subjects who used the Structured interface submitted significantly fewer queries, spent more time on search results pages, examined significantly more documents per query, and went to greater depths in the search results list. Results also showed that these subjects spent longer generating their initial queries, saved more relevant documents and rated their queries as more successful. These findings have implications for the usefulness of microeconomic theory as a way to model and explain search interaction, as well as for the design of query facilities.
2484030	Time-aware point-of-interest recommendation The availability of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growing location based social networks (LBSNs) enables many important location-aware services to users. Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services, which is to recommend places where users have not visited before. Several techniques have been recently proposed for the recommendation service. However, no existing work has considered the temporal information for POI recommendations in LBSNs. We believe that time plays an important role in POI recommendations because most users tend to visit different places at different time in a day, eg visiting a restaurant at noon and visiting a bar at night. In this paper, we define a new problem, namely, the time-aware POI recommendation, to recommend POIs for a given user at a specified time in a day. To solve the problem, we develop a collaborative recommendation model that is able to incorporate temporal information. Moreover, based on the observation that users tend to visit nearby POIs, we further enhance the recommendation model by considering geographical information. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art POI recommendation methods substantially.
2484055	Utilizing query change for session search Session search is the Information Retrieval (IR) task that performs document retrieval for a search session. During a session, a user constantly modifies queries in order to find relevant documents that fulfill the information need. This paper proposes a novel query change retrieval model (QCM), which utilizes syntactic editing changes between adjacent queries as well as the relationship between query change and previously retrieved documents to enhance session search. We propose to model session search as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We consider two agents in this MDP: the user agent and the search engine agent. The user agent's actions are query changes that we observe and the search agent's actions are proposed in this paper. Experiments show that our approach is highly effective and outperforms top session search systems in TREC 2011 and 2012.
2484089	Toward whole-session relevance: exploring intrinsic diversity in web search Current research on web search has focused on optimizing and evaluating single queries. However, a significant fraction of user queries are part of more complex tasks [20] which span multiple queries across one or more search sessions [26,24]. An ideal search engine would not only retrieve relevant results for a user's particular query but also be able to identify when the user is engaged in a more complex task and aid the user in completing that task [29,1]. Toward optimizing whole-session or task relevance, we characterize and address the problem of intrinsic diversity (ID) in retrieval [30], a type of complex task that requires multiple interactions with current search engines. Unlike existing work on extrinsic diversity [30] that deals with ambiguity in intent across multiple users, ID queries often have little ambiguity in intent but seek content covering a variety of aspects on a shared theme. In such scenarios, the underlying needs are typically exploratory, comparative, or breadth-oriented in nature. We identify and address three key problems for ID retrieval: identifying authentic examples of ID tasks from post-hoc analysis of behavioral signals in search logs; learning to identify initiator queries that mark the start of an ID search task; and given an initiator query, predicting which content to prefetch and rank.
2484076	Learning to personalize query auto-completion Query auto-completion (QAC) is one of the most prominent features of modern search engines. The list of query candidates is generated according to the prefix entered by the user in the search box and is updated on each new key stroke. Query prefixes tend to be short and ambiguous, and existing models mostly rely on the past popularity of matching candidates for ranking. However, the popularity of certain queries may vary drastically across different demographics and users. For instance, while instagram and imdb have comparable popularities overall and are both legitimate candidates to show for prefix i, the former is noticeably more popular among young female users, and the latter is more likely to be issued by men. In this paper, we present a supervised framework for personalizing auto-completion ranking. We introduce a novel labelling strategy for generating offline training labels that can be used for learning personalized rankers. We compare the effectiveness of several user-specific and demographic-based features and show that among them, the user's long-term search history and location are the most effective for personalizing auto-completion rankers. We perform our experiments on the publicly available AOL query logs, and also on the larger-scale logs of Bing. The results suggest that supervised rankers enhanced by personalization features can significantly outperform the existing popularity-based base-lines, in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR) by up to 9%.
2484071	Click model-based information retrieval metrics In recent years many models have been proposed that are aimed at predicting clicks of web search users. In addition, some information retrieval evaluation metrics have been built on top of a user model. In this paper we bring these two directions together and propose a common approach to converting any click model into an evaluation metric. We then put the resulting model-based metrics as well as traditional metrics (like DCG or Precision) into a common evaluation framework and compare them along a number of dimensions. One of the dimensions we are particularly interested in is the agreement between offline and online experimental outcomes. It is widely believed, especially in an industrial setting, that online A/B-testing and interleaving experiments are generally better at capturing system quality than offline measurements. We show that offline metrics that are based on click models are more strongly correlated with online experimental outcomes than traditional offline metrics, especially in situations when we have incomplete relevance judgements.
