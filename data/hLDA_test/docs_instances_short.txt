book1_ch01_2_2	no label	Factors Factors Factors Let’s begin our review of arithmetic by recalling the meaning of multiplication for whole numbers (the counting numbers and zero). Multiplication Multiplication is a description of repeated addition. In the addition 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 the number 7 is repeated as an addend* 4 times. Therefore, we say we have four times seven and describe it by writing 4  ·  7 The raised dot between the numbers 4 and 7 indicates multiplication. The dot directs us to multiply the two numbers that it separates. In algebra, the dot is preferred over the symbol × to denote multiplication because the letter x is often used to represent a number. Thus, 4  ·  7 = 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 Factors and Products In a multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are called factors. The result of a multiplication is called the product. For example, in the multiplication 4  ·  7 = 28 the numbers 4 and 7 are factors, and the number 28 is the product. We say that 4 and 7 are factors of 28. (They are not the only factors of 28. Can you think of others?)Now we know thatThis indicates that a first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number with no remainder. For example, since 4  ·  7 = 28 both 4 and 7 are factors of 28 since both 4 and 7 divide into 28 with no remainder. 
book1_ch01_2_3	no label	Exponential Notation Exponential Notation Exponential Notation Quite often, a particular number will be repeated as a factor in a multiplication. For example, in the multiplication 7  ·  7  ·  7  ·  7 the number 7 is repeated as a factor 4 times. We describe this by writing 74 . Thus, 7  ·  7  ·  7  ·  7 = 74 The repeated factor is the lower number (the base), and the number recording how many times the factor is repeated is the higher number (the superscript). The superscript number is called an exponent. Exponent An exponent is a number that records how many times the number to which it is attached occurs as a factor in a multiplication.

Prime Number A whole number greater than 1 whose only whole number factors are itself and 1 is called a prime number. The first seven prime numbers are2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17The number 1 is not considered to be a prime number, and the number 2 is the first and only even prime number.Many numbers have factors other than themselves and 1. For example, the factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 (since each of these whole numbers and only these whole numbers divide into 28 without a remainder). Composite Numbers A whole number that is composed of factors other than itself and 1 is called a composite number. Composite numbers are not prime numbers.Some composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15.

We will use them soon in our study of fractions. We will now, however, be introduced to an important mathematical principle. The Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic Except for the order of the factors, every whole number, other than 1, can be factored in one and only one way as a product of prime numbers. Prime Factorization When a number is factored so that all its factors are prime numbers, the factorization is called the prime factorization of the number.

When a fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction that has the smallest numerator and denominator in the collection of equivalent fractions, it is said to be reduced to lowest terms. The conversion process is called reducing a fraction. We can reduce a fraction to lowest terms by Expressing the numerator and denominator as a product of prime numbers. (Find the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. See Section (Section 1.3) for this technique.) Divide the numerator and denominator by all common factors. (This technique is commonly called “cancelling.”) 
book1_ch01_5_5	no label	Raising a Fraction to Higher Terms Raising a Fraction to Higher Terms Raising a Fraction to Higher Terms Equally important as reducing fractions is raising fractions to higher terms. Raising a fraction to higher terms is the process of constructing an equivalent fraction that has higher values in the numerator and denominator. The higher, equivalent fraction is constructed by multiplying the original fraction by 1.Notice that and are equivalent, that is Also, This observation helps us suggest the following method for raising a fraction to higher terms. Raising a Fraction to Higher Terms A fraction can be raised to higher terms by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number. For example, can be raised to by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 8, that is, multiplying by 1 in the form How did we know to choose 8 as the proper factor? Since we wish to convert 4 to 32 by multiplying it by some number, we know that 4 must be a factor of 32. This means that 4 divides into 32. In fact, 32÷4 = 8. We divided the original denominator into the new, specified denominator to obtain the proper factor for the multiplication.

Variable A letter or symbol that represents any member of a collection of two or more numbers is called a variable. Constant A letter or symbol that represents a specific number, known or unknown is called a constant. In the following examples, the letter x is a variable since it can be any member of the collection of numbers {35, 25, 10} . The letter h is a constant since it can assume only the value 5890. Example 2.1.  Suppose that the streets on your way from home to school have speed limits of 35 mph, 25 mph, and 10 mph. In algebra we can let the letter x represent our speed as we travel from home to school. The maximum value of x depends on what section of street we are on. The letter x can assume any one of the various values 35,25,10. Example 2.2.  Suppose that in writing a term paper for a geography class we need to specify the height of Mount Kilimanjaro. If we do not happen to know the height of the mountain, we can represent it (at least temporarily) on our paper with the letter h . Later, we look up the height in a reference book and find it to be 5890 meters. The letter h can assume only the one value, 5890, and no others. The value of h is constant.

book1_ch02_3_2	no label	The Real Number Line The Real Number Line The Real Number Line Real Number Line In our study of algebra, we will use several collections of numbers. The real number line allows us to visually display the numbers in which we are interested. A line is composed of infinitely many points. To each point we can associate a unique number, and with each number we can associate a particular point. Coordinate The number associated with a point on the number line is called the coordinate of the point. Graph The point on a line that is associated with a particular number is called the graph of that number. We construct the real number line as follows: Construction of the Real Number Line Draw a horizontal line. Choose any point on the line and label it 0. This point is called the origin. Choose a convenient length. This length is called "1 unit." Starting at 0, mark this length off in both directions, being careful to have the lengths look like they are about the same. We now define a real number. Real Number A real number is any number that is the coordinate of a point on the real number line. Positive and Negative Real Numbers The collection of these infinitely many numbers is called the collection of real numbers. The real numbers whose graphs are to the right of 0 are called the positive real numbers. The real numbers whose graphs appear to the left of 0 are called the negative real numbers. The number 0 is neither positive nor negative. 
book1_ch02_3_3	no label	The Real Numbers The Real Numbers The Real Numbers The collection of real numbers has many subcollections. The subcollections that are of most interest to us are listed below along with their notations and graphs. Natural Numbers The natural numbers (N) :   {1, 2,3, …} Whole Numbers The whole numbers (W) :   {0, 1, 2,3, …} Notice that every natural number is a whole number. Integers The integers (Z) :   {…,  − 3, −  2, − 1,0,1, 2, 3, …} Notice that every whole number is an integer. Rational Numbers The rational numbers (Q) : Rational numbers are real numbers that can be written in the form a / b , where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0 . Fractions Rational numbers are commonly called fractions. Division by 1 Since b can equal 1, every integer is a rational number: . Division by 0 Recall that 10 / 2 = 5 since 2⋅5 = 10 . However, if 10 / 0 = x , then 0⋅x = 10 . But 0⋅x = 0 , not 10. This suggests that no quotient exists. Now consider 0 / 0 = x . If 0 / 0 = x , then 0⋅x = 0 . But this means that x could be any number, that is, 0 / 0 = 4 since 0⋅4 = 0 , or 0 / 0 = 28 since 0⋅28 = 0 . This suggests that the quotient is indeterminant. x / 0 Is Undefined or Indeterminant Division by 0 is undefined or indeterminant.Do not divide by 0. Rational numbers have decimal representations that either terminate or do not terminate but contain a repeating block of digits. Some examples are: Some rational numbers are graphed below. Irrational Numbers The irrational numbers (I r) : Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as the quotient of two integers. They are numbers whose decimal representations are nonterminating and nonrepeating. Some examples are Notice that the collections of rational numbers and irrational numbers have no numbers in common. When graphed on the number line, the rational and irrational numbers account for every point on the number line. Thus each point on the number line has a coordinate that is either a rational or an irrational number. In summary, we have

Hence, 3 times 4.We know that algebra is generalized arithmetic. We can now make an important generalization. When a number a is added repeatedly n times, we have Then, using multiplication as a description for repeated addition, we can replace For example: Example 2.47.  x + x + x + x can be written as 4x since x is repeatedly added 4 times. x + x + x + x = 4x Example 2.48.  r + r can be written as 2r since r is repeatedly added 2 times. r + r = 2r The distributive property involves both multiplication and addition. Let’s rewrite 4(a + b). We proceed by reading 4(a + b) as a multiplication: 4 times the quantity (a + b) . This directs us to write Now we use the commutative property of addition to collect all the a ' s together and all the b ' s together.

A natural question is “Is there a description for repeated multiplication?” The answer is yes. The notation that describes repeated multiplication is exponential notation. Factors In multiplication, the numbers being multiplied together are called factors. In repeated multiplication, all the factors are the same. In nonrepeated multiplication, none of the factors are the same. For example, Example 2.52.  Exponential notation is used to show repeated multiplication of the same factor. The notation consists of using a superscript on the factor that is repeated. The superscript is called an exponent. Exponential Notation If x is any real number and n is a natural number, thenAn exponent records the number of identical factors in a multiplication. Note that the definition for exponential notation only has meaning for natural number exponents. We will extend this notation to include other numbers as exponents later.

A natural question is "Why are geometric terms appearing in the exponent expression?" The answer for x 3 is this: x 3 means x⋅x⋅x . In geometry, the volume of a rectangular box is found by multiplying the length by the width by the depth. A cube has the same length on each side. If we represent this length by the letter x then the volume of the cube is x⋅x⋅x , which, of course, is described by x 3 . (Can you think of why x 2 is read as x squared?)

book1_ch03_2_2	no label	Positive and Negative Numbers Positive and Negative Numbers Positive and Negative Numbers When we studied the number line in Section Section 2.3 we noted that Each point on the number line corresponds to a real number, and each real number is located at a unique point on the number line. Positive and Negative Numbers Each real number has a sign inherently associated with it. A real number is said to be a positive number if it is located to the right of 0 on the number line. It is a negative number if it is located to the left of 0 on the number line. THE NOTATION OF SIGNED NUMBERS A number is denoted as positive if it is directly preceded by a " + " sign or no sign at all.A number is denoted as negative if it is directly preceded by a " − " sign. The " + " and " – " signs now have two meanings: + can denote the operation of addition or a positive number. − can denote the operation of subtraction or a negative number. Read the "-" Sign as "Negative" To avoid any confusion between "sign" and "operation," it is preferable to read the sign of a number as "positive" or "negative." 
book1_ch03_2_5	no label	Opposites Opposites Opposites Opposites On the number line, each real number has an image on the opposite side of 0. For this reason we say that each real number has an opposite. Opposites are the same distance from zero but have opposite signs. The opposite of a real number is denoted by placing a negative sign directly in front of the number. Thus, if a is any real number, then − a is its opposite. Notice that the letter a is a variable. Thus, " a " need not be positive, and " − a " need not be negative. If a is a real number, − a is opposite a on the number line and a is opposite − a on the number line. − ( − a ) is opposite − a on the number line. This implies that − ( − a ) = a . This property of opposites suggests the double-negative property for real numbers. THE DOUBLE-NEGATIVE PROPERTY If a is a real number, then − ( − a ) = a 
book1_ch03_3_2	no label	Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Absolute Value—Geometric Approach The absolute value of a number a , denoted | a | , is the distance from a to 0 on the number line. Absolute value speaks to the question of "how far," and not "which way." The phrase how far implies length, and length is always a nonnegative (zero or positive) quantity. Thus, the absolute value of a number is a nonnegative number. This is shown in the following examples: Example 3.9.  | 4 | = 4 Example 3.10.  | − 4 | = 4 Example 3.11.  | 0 | = 0 Example 3.12.  − | 5 | = − 5 .The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of 5." The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence, negative the absolute value of 5 is − 5 . Example 3.13.  − | − 3 | = − 3 .The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of − 3 ." The absolute value of − 3 is 3. Hence, negative the absolute value of − 3 is − ( 3 ) = − 3 . 
book1_ch03_3_3	no label	Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value The problems in the first example may help to suggest the following algebraic definition of absolute value. The definition is interpreted below. Examples follow the interpretation. Absolute Value—Algebraic Approach The absolute value of a number a is The algebraic definition takes into account the fact that the number a could be either positive or zero ( ≥ 0 ) or negative ( < 0 ) . If the number a is positive or zero ( ≥ 0 ) , the first part of the definition applies. The first part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed in the absolute bars is a nonnegative number, the absolute value of the number is the number itself. If the number a is negative ( < 0 ) , the second part of the definition applies. The second part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a negative number, the absolute value of the number is the opposite of the number. The opposite of a negative number is a positive number.

We perform this addition on the number line as follows. We begin at 0, the origin.Since 2 is positive, we move 2 units to the right.Since 3 is positive, we move 3 more units to the right.We are now located at 5.Thus, 2 + 3 = 5 . Summarizing, we have (2 positive units) + (3 positive units) = (5 positive units) Now let us add the two negative numbers − 2 and − 3 . We perform this addition on the number line as follows. We begin at 0, the origin.Since − 2 is negative, we move 2 units to the left.Since − 3 is negative, we move 3 more units to the left.We are now located at − 5 . Thus, ( − 2) + ( − 3) = − 5 . Summarizing, we have (2 negative units) + (3 negative units) = (5 negative units) These two examples suggest that Adding Numbers with the Same Sign To add two real numbers that have the same sign, add the absolute values of the numbers and associate the common sign with the sum.

These two numbers have unlike signs. This type of addition can also be illustrated using the number line. We begin at 0, the origin.Since 2 is positive, we move 2 units to the right.Since − 6 is negative, we move, from the 2, 6 units to the left.We are now located at − 4 . A rule for adding two numbers that have unlike signs is suggested by noting that if the signs are disregarded, 4 can be obtained from 2 and 6 by subtracting 2 from 6. But 2 and 6 are precisely the absolute values of 2 and − 6 . Also, notice that the sign of the number with the larger absolute value is negative and that the sign of the resulting sum is negative. Adding Numbers with Unlike Signs To add two real numbers that have unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and associate the sign of the number with the larger absolute value with this difference.

Then, we move 2 units to the left to get to 3. (This reminds us of addition with a negative number.) This illustration suggests that 5 − 2 is the same as 5 + ( − 2) .This leads us directly to the definition of subtraction.

Multiply: 3⋅5 . 3⋅5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 . This suggests that (positive number)⋅(positive number) = positive number . More briefly, ( + )( + ) = + . Now consider the product of a positive number and a negative number. Multiply: (3)( − 5) . (3)( − 5) means ( − 5) + ( − 5) + ( − 5) = − 15 . This suggests that (positive number)⋅(negative number) = negative number More briefly, ( + )( – ) = – . By the commutative property of multiplication, we get (negative number)⋅(positive number) = negative number More briefly, ( – )( + ) = – .

Such numbers can be expressed more conveniently by writing them as part of a power of 10. To see how this is done, let us start with a somewhat smaller number such as 2480. Notice that Scientific Form The last form is called the scientific form of the number. There is one nonzero digit to the left of the decimal point and the absolute value of the exponent on 10 records the number of places the original decimal point was moved to the left. There is one nonzero digit to the left of the decimal point and the absolute value of the exponent of 10 records the number of places the original decimal point was moved to the right. Scientific Notation Numbers written in scientific form are also said to be written using scientific notation. In scientific notation, a number is written as the product of a number between and including 1 and 10 (1 is included,10 is not) and some power of 10. Writing a Number in Scientific Notation To write a number in scientific notation: Move the decimal point so that there is one nonzero digit to its left.

book1_ch03_8_8	no label	Working with Numbers in Scientific Notation Working with Numbers in Scientific Notation Working with Numbers in Scientific Notation Multiplying Numbers Using Scientific Notation There are many occasions (particularly in the sciences) when it is necessary to find the product of two numbers written in scientific notation. This is accomplished by using two of the basic rules of algebra. Suppose we wish to find (a × 10 n )(b × 10 m ) . Since the only operation is multiplication, we can use the commutative property of multiplication to rearrange the numbers. (a × 10 n )(b × 10 m ) = (a × b)( 10 n × 10 m ) Then, by the rules of exponents, 10 n × 10 m = 10 n + m . Thus, (a × 10 n )(b × 10 m ) = (a × b) × 10 n + m The product of (a × b) may not be between 1 and 10, so (a × b) × 10 n + m may not be in scientific form. The decimal point in (a × b) may have to be moved. An example of this situation is in Sample Set C, problem 2.

An important concept that all students of algebra must be aware of is the difference between terms and factors.

book1_ch04_4_3	no label	Classification of Polynomials Classification of Polynomials Classification of Polynomials Polynomials can be classified using two criteria: the number of terms and degree of the polynomial. Table 4.1. Number of Terms Name Example Comment One Monomial 4x 2 mono means “one” in Greek. Two Binomial 4x 2 − 7x bi means “two” in Latin. Three Trinomial 4x 2 − 7x + 3 tri means “three” in Greek. Four or more Polynomial 4x 3 − 7x 2 + 3x − 1 poly means “many” in Greek. Degree of a Term Containing One Variable The degree of a term containing only one variable is the value of the exponent of the variable. Exponents appearing on numbers do not affect the degree of the term. We consider only the exponent of the variable. For example: Example 4.43.  5x 3 is a monomial of degree 3. Example 4.44.  60a 5 is a monomial of degree 5. Example 4.45.  21b 2 is a monomial of degree 2. Example 4.46.  8 is a monomial of degree 0. We say that a nonzero number is a term of 0 degree since it could be written as 8x 0 . Since x 0 = 1(x ≠ 0) , 8x 0 = 8 . The exponent on the variable is 0 so it must be of degree 0. (By convention, the number 0 has no degree.) Example 4.47.  4x is a monomial of the first degree. 4x could be written as 4x 1 . The exponent on the variable is 1 so it must be of the first degree. Degree of a Term Containing Several Variables The degree of a term containing more than one variable is the sum of the exponents of the variables, as shown below. Example 4.48.  4x 2 y 5 is a monomial of degree 2 + 5 = 7 . This is a 7th degree monomial. Example 4.49.  37a b 2 c 6 d 3 is a monomial of degree 1 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 12 . This is a 12th degree monomial. Example 4.50.  5x y is a monomial of degree 1 + 1 = 2 . This is a 2nd degree monomial. Degree of a Polynomial The degree of a polynomial is the degree of the term of highest degree; for example: Example 4.51.  2x 3 + 6x − 1 is a trinomial of degree 3. The first term, 2x 3 , is the term of the highest degree. Therefore, its degree is the degree of the polynomial. Example 4.52.  7y − 10y 4 is a binomial of degree 4. Example 4.53.  a − 4 + 5a 2 is a trinomial of degree 2. Example 4.54.  2x 6 + 9x 4 − x 7 − 8x 3 + x − 9 is a polynomial of degree 7. Example 4.55.  4x 3 y 5 − 2x y 3 is a binomial of degree 8. The degree of the first term is 8. Example 4.56.  3x + 10 is a binomial of degree 1. Linear Quadratic Cubic Polynomials of the first degree are called linear polynomials.Polynomials of the second degree are called quadratic polynomials.Polynomials of the third degree are called cubic polynomials.Polynomials of the fourth degree are called fourth degree polynomials.Polynomials of the n th degree are called n th degree polynomials. Nonzero constants are polynomials of the 0th degree. Some examples of these polynomials follow: Example 4.57.  4x − 9 is a linear polynomial. Example 4.58.  3x 2 + 5x − 7 is a quadratic polynomial. Example 4.59.  8y − 2x 3 is a cubic polynomial. Example 4.60.  16a 2 − 32a 5 − 64 is a 5th degree polynomial. Example 4.61.  x 12 − y 12 is a 12th degree polynomial. Example 4.62.  7x 5 y 7 z 3 − 2x 4 y 7 z + x 3 y 7 is a 15th degree polynomial. The first term is of degree 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 . Example 4.63.  43 is a 0th degree polynomial.

book1_ch05_7_9	no label	Compound Inequalities Compound Inequalities Compound Inequalities Compound Inequality Another type of inequality is the compound inequality. A compound inequality is of the form: a < x < b There are actually two statements here. The first statement is a < x . The next statement is x < b . When we read this statement we say " a is less than x ," then continue saying "and x is less than b ." Just by looking at the inequality we can see that the number x is between the numbers a and b . The compound inequality a < x < b indicates "betweenness." Without changing the meaning, the statement a < x can be read x > a . (Surely, if the number a is less than the number x , the number x must be greater than the number a .) Thus, we can read a < x < b as " x is greater than a and at the same time is less than b ." For example: 4 < x < 9 .The letter x is some number strictly between 4 and 9. Hence, x is greater than 4 and, at the same time, less than 9. The numbers 4 and 9 are not included so we use open circles at these points. − 2 < z < 0 .The z stands for some number between − 2 and 0. Hence, z is greater than − 2 but also less than 0. 1 < x + 6 < 8 .The expression x + 6 represents some number strictly between 1 and 8. Hence, x + 6 represents some number strictly greater than 1, but less than 8. .The term represents some number between and including and . Hence, represents some number greater than or equal to to but less than or equal to . Consider problem 3 above, 1 < x + 6 < 8 . The statement says that the quantity x + 6 is between 1 and 8. This statement will be true for only certain values of x . For example, if x = 1 , the statement is true since 1 < 1 + 6 < 8 . However, if x = 4.9 , the statement is false since 1 < 4.9 + 6 < 8 is clearly not true. The first of the inequalities is satisfied since 1 is less than 10.9 , but the second inequality is not satisfied since 10.9 is not less than 8. We would like to know for exactly which values of x the statement 1 < x + 6 < 8 is true. We proceed by using the properties discussed earlier in this section, but now we must apply the rules to all three parts rather than just the two parts in a regular inequality.

A solution is not completely known until the values of both variables are specified. Independent and Dependent Variables Recall that, in an equation, any variable whose value can be freely assigned is said to be an independent variable. Any variable whose value is determined once the other value or values have been assigned is said to be a dependent variable. If, in a linear equation, the independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y , and a solution to the equation is x = a and y = b , the solution is written as the ORDERED PAIR      (a, b) Ordered Pair In an ordered pair, (a, b) , the first component, a , gives the value of the independent variable, and the second component, b , gives the value of the dependent variable. We can use ordered pairs to show some solutions to the equation y = 6x − 7 . Example 5.60.  (0, − 7) .If x = 0 and y = − 7 , we get a true statement upon substitution and computataion.

Divide each term of the product by the known factor a. Thus, b and c are the required terms of the other factor.

book1_ch07_2_2	no label	Graphs Graphs Graphs We have, thus far in our study of algebra, developed and used several methods for obtaining solutions to linear equations in both one and two variables. Quite often it is helpful to obtain a picture of the solutions to an equation. These pictures are called graphs and they can reveal information that may not be evident from the equation alone. The Graph of an Equation The geometric representation (picture) of the solutions to an equation is called the graph of the equation. 
book1_ch07_2_3	no label	Axes, Coordinate Systems, and Dimension Axes, Coordinate Systems, and Dimension Axes, Coordinate Systems, and Dimension Axis The basic structure of the graph is the axis. It is with respect to the axis that all solutions to an equation are located. The most fundamental type of axis is the number line. The Number Line is an Axis We have the following general rules regarding axes. Number of Variables and Number of Axes An equation in one variable requires one axis. An equation in two variables requires two axes. An equation in three variables requires three axes. ... An equation in n variables requires n axes. We shall always draw an axis as a straight line, and if more than one axis is required, we shall draw them so they are all mutually perpendicular (the lines forming the axes will be at 90° angles to one another). Coordinate System A system of axes constructed for graphing an equation is called a coordinate system. The Phrase, Graphing an Equation The phrase graphing an equation is used frequently and should be interpreted as meaning geometrically locating the solutions to an equation. Relating the Number of Variables and the Number of Axes We will not start actually graphing equations until Section Section 7.3, but in the following examples we will relate the number of variables in an equation to the number of axes in the coordinate system. 1. One-Dimensional Graphs: If we wish to graph the equation 5x + 2 = 17 , we would need to construct a coordinate system consisting of a single axis (a single number line) since the equation consists of only one variable. We label the axis with the variable that appears in the equation. We might interpret an equation in one variable as giving information in one-dimensional space. Since we live in three-dimensional space, one-dimensional space might be hard to imagine. Objects in one-dimensional space would have only length, no width or depth. 2. Two-Dimensional Graphs: To graph an equation in two variables such as y = 2x–3 , we would need to construct a coordinate system consisting of two mutually perpendicular number lines (axes). We call the intersection of the two axes the origin and label it with a 0. The two axes are simply number lines; one drawn horizontally, one drawn vertically. Recall that an equation in two variables requires a solution to be a pair of numbers. The solutions can be written as ordered pairs (x,y) . Since the equation y = 2x–3 involves the variables x and y , we label one axis x and the other axis y . In mathematics it is customary to label the horizontal axis with the independent variable and the vertical axis with the dependent variable. We might interpret equations in two variables as giving information in two-dimensional space. Objects in two-dimensional space would have length and width, but no depth. 3. Three-Dimensional Graphs: An equation in three variables, such as 3x 2 –4y 2 + 5z = 0 , requires three mutually perpendicular axes, one for each variable. We would construct the following coordinate system and graph. We might interpret equations in three variables as giving information about three-dimensional space. 4. Four-Dimensional Graphs: To graph an equation in four variables, such as 3x–2y + 8x–5w = –7 , would require four mutually perpendicular number lines. These graphs are left to the imagination. We might interpret equations in four variables as giving information in four-dimensional space. Four-dimensional objects would have length, width, depth, and some other dimension. Black Holes These other spaces are hard for us to imagine, but the existence of “black holes” makes the possibility of other universes of one-, two-, four-, or n-dimensions not entirely unlikely. Although it may be difficult for us “3-D” people to travel around in another dimensional space, at least we could be pretty sure that our mathematics would still work (since it is not restricted to only three dimensions)! 
book1_ch07_2_4	no label	Graphing in One Dimension Graphing in One Dimension Graphing in One Dimension Graphing a linear equation in one variable involves solving the equation, then locating the solution on the axis (number line), and marking a point at this location. We have observed that graphs may reveal information that may not be evident from the original equation. The graphs of linear equations in one variable do not yield much, if any, information, but they serve as a foundation to graphs of higher dimension (graphs of two variables and three variables).

book1_ch07_3_2	no label	The Plane The Plane The Plane Ordered Pairs We are now interested in studying graphs of linear equations in two variables. We know that solutions to equations in two variables consist of a pair of values, one value for each variable. We have called these pairs of values ordered pairs. Since we have a pair of values to graph, we must have a pair of axes (number lines) upon which the values can be located. Origin We draw the axes so they are perpendicular to each other and so that they intersect each other at their 0 ' s . This point is called the origin. Rectangular Coordinate System These two lines form what is called a rectangular coordinate system. They also determine a plane. x y-plane   A plane is a flat surface, and a result from geometry states that through any two intersecting lines (the axes) exactly one plane (flat surface) may be passed. If we are dealing with a linear equation in the two variables x and y , we sometimes say we are graphing the equation using a rectangular coordinate system, or that we are graphing the equation in the x y-plane . Quadrant Notice that the two intersecting coordinate axes divide the plane into four equal regions. Since there are four regions, we call each one a quadrant and number them counterclockwise using Roman numerals. Recall that when we first studied the number line we observed the following: For each real number there exists a unique point on the number line, and for each point on the number line we can associate a unique real number. We have a similar situation for the plane. For each ordered pair (a, b) , there exists a unique point in the plane, and to each point in the plane we can associate a unique ordered pair (a, b) of real numbers.

The first number in the ordered pair expresses the point’s horizontal distance and direction (left or right) from the origin. The second number expresses the point’s vertical distance and direction (up or down) from the origin. The Coordinates Determine Distance and Direction A positive number means a direction to the right or up. A negative number means a direction to the left or down.

book1_ch07_4_2	no label	Solutions and Lines Solutions and Lines Solutions and Lines We know that solutions to linear equations in two variables can be expressed as ordered pairs. Hence, the solutions can be represented by point in the plane. We also know that the phrase “graph the equation” means to locate the solution to the given equation in the plane. Consider the equation y − 2x = − 3 . We’ll graph six solutions (ordered pairs) to this equation on the coordinates system below. We’ll find the solutions by choosing x-values (from − 1 to  + 4 ), substituting them into the equation y − 2x = − 3 , and then solving to obtain the corresponding y-values . We can keep track of the ordered pairs by using a table. y − 2x = − 3 Table 7.8. If x = Then y = Ordered Pairs − 1 − 5 ( − 1,  − 5 ) 0 − 3 ( 0,  − 3 ) 1 − 1 ( 1,  − 1 ) 2 1 ( 2, 1 ) 3 3 ( 3, 3 ) 4 5 ( 4, 5 ) We have plotted only six solutions to the equation y − 2x = − 3 . There are, as we know, infinitely many solutions. By observing the six points we have plotted, we can speculate as to the location of all the other points. The six points we plotted seem to lie on a straight line. This would lead us to believe that all the other points (solutions) also lie on that same line. Indeed, this is true. In fact, this is precisely why first-degree equations are called linear equations. Linear Equations Produce Straight Lines 
book1_ch07_4_3	no label	General Form of a Linear Equation General Form of a Linear Equation General Form of a Linear Equation General Form of a Linear Equation in Two Variables There is a standard form in which linear equations in two variables are written. Suppose that a , b , and c are any real numbers and that a and b cannot both be zero at the same time. Then, the linear equation in two variables a x + b y = c is said to be in general form. We must stipulate that a and b cannot both equal zero at the same time, for if they were we would have 0x + 0y = c 0 = c This statement is true only if c = 0 . If c were to be any other number, we would get a false statement. Now, we have the following: The graphing of all ordered pairs that solve a linear equation in two variables produces a straight line. This implies, The graph of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line. From these statements we can conclude, If an ordered pair is a solution to a linear equations in two variables, then it lies on the graph of the equation. Also, Any point (ordered pairs) that lies on the graph of a linear equation in two variables is a solution to that equation.

Since a straight line is determined by only two points, we need only find two solutions to the equation (although a third point is helpful as a check). Intercepts When a linear equation in two variables is given in general from, a x + b y = c , often the two most convenient points (solutions) to fine are called the Intercepts: these are the points at which the line intercepts the coordinate axes. Of course, a horizontal or vertical line intercepts only one axis, so this method does not apply. Horizontal and vertical lines are easily recognized as they contain only one variable. (See Sample Set C .) y-Intercept  The point at which the line crosses the y-axis is called the y-intercept . The x-value at this point is zero (since the point is neither to the left nor right of the origin). x-Intercept  The point at which the line crosses the x-axis is called the x-intercept  and the y-value at that point is zero. The y-intercept can be found by substituting the value 0 for x into the equation and solving for y . The x-intercept can be found by substituting the value 0 for y into the equation and solving for x . Intercept Method Since we are graphing an equation by finding the intercepts, we call this method the intercept method

Actually, any two points will do. We chose to use the intercepts because they are usually the easiest to work with. In the next example, we will graph two equations using points other than the intercepts. We’ll use three points, the extra point serving as a check. 
book1_ch07_4_10	no label	Slanted, Horizontal, and Vertical Lines Slanted, Horizontal, and Vertical Lines Slanted, Horizontal, and Vertical Lines In all the graphs we have observed so far, the lines have been slanted. This will always be the case when both variables appear in the equation. If only one variable appears in the equation, then the line will be either vertical or horizontal. To see why, let’s consider a specific case: Using the general form of a line, a x + b y = c , we can produce an equation with exactly one variable by choosing a = 0 , b = 5 , and c = 15 . The equation a x + b y = c then becomes 0x + 5y = 15 Since 0⋅( any number ) = 0 , the term 0x is 0 for any number that is chosen for x . Thus, 0x + 5y = 15 becomes 0 + 5y = 15 But, 0 is the additive identity and 0 + 5y = 5y . 5y = 15 Then, solving for y we get y = 3 This is an equation in which exactly one variable appears. This means that regardless of which number we choose for x , the corresponding y-value is 3. Since the y-value is always the same as we move from left-to-right through the x-values , the height of the line above the x-axis is always the same (in this case, 3 units). This type of line must be horizontal. An argument similar to the one above will show that if the only variable that appears is x , we can expect to get a vertical line.

When this equation is solved for y , the resulting form is called the slope-intercept form. Let's generate this new form. This equation is of the form y = m x + b if we replace with m and constant with b . (Note: The fact that we let is unfortunate and occurs beacuse of the letters we have chosen to use in the general form. The letter b occurs on both sides of the equal sign and may not represent the same value at all. This problem is one of the historical convention and, fortunately, does not occur very often.)

book1_ch07_5_11	no label	The Formula for the Slope of a Line The Formula for the Slope of a Line The Formula for the Slope of a Line We have observed that the slope is a measure of the steepness of a line. We wish to develop a formula for measuring this steepness. It seems reasonable to develop a slope formula that produces the following results: Steepness of line 1 > steepness of line 2. Consider a line on which we select any two points. We’ll denote these points with the ordered pairs (x 1,  y 1  ) and (x 2,  y 2  ) . The subscripts help us to identify the points. (x 1,  y 1  ) is the first point. Subscript 1 indicates the first point. (x 2,  y 2  ) is the second point. Subscript 2 indicates the second point. The difference in x values (x 2 − x 1 ) gives us the horizontal change, and the difference in y values (y 2 − y 1 ) gives us the vertical change. If the line is very steep, then when going from the first point to the second point, we would expect a large vertical change compared to the horizontal change. If the line is not very steep, then when going from the first point to the second point, we would expect a small vertical change compared to the horizontal change. We are comparing changes. We see that we are comparing This is a comparison and is therefore a ratio. Ratios can be expressed as fractions. Thus, a measure of the steepness of a line can be expressed as a ratio. The slope of a line is defined as the ratio Mathematically, we can write these changes as Finding the Slope of a Line The slope of a nonvertical line passing through the points (x 1,  y 1  ) and (x 2,  y 2  ) is found by the formula

When an equation is written in the slope-intercept form, y = m x + b , there are also efficient ways of constructing the graph. One way, but less efficient, is to choose two or three x-values and compute to find the corresponding y-values . However, computations are tedious, time consuming, and can lead to errors.

Now, however, suppose we're given some geometric information about the line and we wish to construct the corresponding equation. We wish to find the equation of a line. We know that the formula for the slope of a line is We can find the equation of a line using the slope formula in either of two ways: Example 7.40.  If we’re given the slope, m , and any point (x, y 1 ) on the line, we can substitute this information into the formula for slope.Let (x, y 1 ) be the known point on the line and let (x,y) be any other point on the line. Then Since this equation was derived using a point and the slope of a line, it is called the point-slope form of a line. Example 7.41.  If we are given the slope, m , y-intercept, (0,b) , we can substitute this information into the formula for slope.Let (0,b) be the y-intercept and (x,y) be any other point on the line. Then, Since this equation was derived using the slope and the intercept, it was called the slope-intercept form of a line. We summarize these two derivations as follows. Forms of the Equation of a Line We can find the equation of a line if we’re given either of the following sets of information: The slope, m, and the y-intercept, (0,b), by substituting these values into This is the slope-intercept form. The slope, m, and any point, (x 1 ,y 1 ), by substituting these values into This is the point-slope form. Notice that both forms rely on knowing the slope. If we are given two points on the line we may still find the equation of the line passing through them by first finding the slope of the line, then using the point-slope form. It is customary to use either the slope-intercept form or the general form for the final form of the line. We will use the slope-intercept form as the final form.

We now wish to determine the location of the solutions to linear inequalities in two variables. Linear inequalities in two variables are inequalities of the forms: Half-Planes A straight line drawn through the plane divides the plane into two half-planes. Boundary Line The straight line is called the boundary line. Solution to an Inequality in Two Variables Recall that when working with linear equations in two variables, we observed that ordered pairs that produced true statements when substituted into an equation were called solutions to that equation. We can make a similar statement for inequalities in two variables. We say that an inequality in two variables has a solution when a pair of values has been found such that when these values are substituted into the inequality a true statement results. The Location of Solutions in the Plane As with equations, solutions to linear inequalities have particular locations in the plane. All solutions to a linear inequality in two variables are located in one and only in one entire half-plane. For example, consider the inequality 2x + 3y ≤ 6 All the solutions to the inequality 2x + 3y ≤ 6 lie in the shaded half-plane.

book1_ch07_8_3	no label	Method of Graphing Method of Graphing Method of Graphing The method of graphing linear inequalities in two variables is as follows: Graph the boundary line (consider the inequality as an equation, that is, replace the inequality sign with an equal sign). If the inequality is ≤ or ≥ , draw the boundary line solid. This means that points on the line are solutions and are part of the graph. If the inequality is < or > , draw the boundary line dotted. This means that points on the line are not solutions and are not part of the graph. Determine which half-plane to shade by choosing a test point. If, when substituted, the test point yields a true statement, shade the half-plane containing it. If, when substituted, the test point yields a false statement, shade the half-plane on the opposite side of the boundary line.

The expression , where a and b are any two whole numbers and b ≠ 0, is called a fraction. The top number, a , is called the numerator, and the bottom number, b , is called the denominator. Simple Algebraic Fraction We define a simple algebraic fraction in a similar manner. Rather than restrict­ing ourselves only to numbers, we use polynomials for the numerator and denomi­nator. Another term for a simple algebraic fraction is a rational expression. A rational expression is an expression of the form , where P and Q are both polyno­mials and Q never represents the zero polynomial. Rational Expression A rational expression is an algebraic expression that can be written as the quotient of two polynomials. Examples 1–4 are rational expressions: Example 8.1.  is a rational expression: P is x + 9 and Q is x – 7. Example 8.2.  is a rational expression: P is x 3 + 5x 2 – 12x + 1 and Q is x 4 – 10. Example 8.3.  is a rational expression: P is 3 and Q is 8. Example 8.4.  4x – 5 is a rational expression since 4x – 5 can be written as : P is 4x – 5 and Q is 1. Example 8.5.  is not a rational expression since is not a polynomial. In the rational expression , P is called the numerator and Q is called the denominator. Domain of a Rational Expression Since division by zero is not defined, we must be careful to note the values for which the rational expression is valid. The collection of values for which the rational expression is defined is called the domain of the rational expression. (Recall our study of the domain of an equation in Section Section 4.8.) Finding the Domain of a Rational Expression To find the domain of a rational expression we must ask, "What values, if any, of the variable will make the denominator zero?" To find these values, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve. If any zero-producing values are obtained, they are not included in the domain. All other real numbers are included in the domain (unless some have been excluded for particular situational reasons). 
book1_ch08_2_3	no label	Zero-Factor Property Zero-Factor Property Zero-Factor Property Sometimes to find the domain of a rational expression, it is necessary to factor the denominator and use the zero-factor property of real numbers. Zero-factor Property If two real numbers a and b are multiplied together and the resulting product is 0, then at least one of the factors must be zero, that is, either a = 0, b = 0, or both a = 0 and b = 0. The following examples illustrate the use of the zero-factor property. Example 8.6.  What value will produce zero in the expression 4x ? By the zero-factor property, if 4x = 0, then x = 0. Example 8.7.  What value will produce zero in the expression 8(x – 6)? By the zero-factor property, if 8(x – 6) = 0, then Thus, 8(x – 6) = 0 when x = 6. Example 8.8.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression (x – 3)(x + 5)? By the zero-factor property, if (x – 3)(x + 5) = 0, then Thus, (x – 3)(x + 5) = 0 when x = 3 or x = – 5. Example 8.9.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression x 2 + 6x + 8? We must factor x 2 + 6x + 8 to put it into the zero-factor property form. x 2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4) Now, (x + 2)(x + 4) = 0 when Thus, x 2 + 6x + 8 = 0 when x = – 2 or x = – 4. Example 8.10.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression 6x 2 – 19x – 7? We must factor 6x 2 – 19x – 7 to put it into the zero-factor property form. 6x 2 – 19x – 7 = (3x + 1)(2x – 7) Now, (3x + 1)(2x – 7) = 0 when Thus, 6x 2 – 19x – 7 = 0 when or .

This same property holds for rational expressions and negative signs. This property is often quite helpful in simplifying a rational expression (as we shall need to do in subsequent sections). If either the numerator or denominator of a fraction or a fraction itself is immediately preceded by a negative sign, it is usually most convenient to place the negative sign in the numerator for later operations.

For example, the rational expression can be reduced to the simpler expression for all x except x = 2,4 . From our discussion of equality of fractions in Section Section 8.2, we know that when a d = b c . This fact allows us to deduce that, if since a k b = a b k (recall the commutative property of multiplication). But this fact means that if a factor (in this case, k ) is common to both the numerator and denominator of a fraction, we may remove it without changing the value of the fraction. Cancelling The process of removing common factors is commonly called cancelling.

Using the fact that , and that 1 is the multiplicative identity, it follows that if is a rational expression, then This equation asserts that a rational expression can be transformed into an equivalent rational expression by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number. Process of Building Rational Expressions This process is known as the process of building rational expressions and it is exactly the opposite of reducing rational expressions. The process is shown in these examples: Example 8.50.  can be built to since Example 8.51.  can be built to since Example 8.52.  can be built to since Example 8.53.  can be built to since Suppose we're given a rational expression and wish to build it into a rational expression with denominator Q b 2 , that is, Since we changed the denominator, we must certainly change the numerator in the same way. To determine how to change the numerator we need to know how the denominator was changed. Since one rational expression is built into another equivalent expression by multiplication by 1, the first denominator must have been multiplied by some quantity. Observation of tells us that Q was multiplied by b 2 . Hence, we must multiply the numerator P by b 2 . Thus, Quite often a simple comparison of the original denominator with the new denominator will tell us the factor being used. However, there will be times when the factor is unclear by simple observation. We need a method for finding the factor. Observe the following examples; then try to speculate on the method. Example 8.54.  The original denominator 4 was multiplied by 5 to yield 20. What arithmetic process will yield 5 using 4 and 20? Example 8.55.  The original denominator 10 was multiplied by y to yield 10y . Example 8.56.  The original denominator 2a 3 b was multiplied by 8a 2 b 2 to yield 16a 5 b 3 . Example 8.57.  The original denominator ( a + 1 ) 2 was multiplied by 4( a − 2 ) to yield 4 ( a + 1 ) 2 ( a − 2 ) . To determine the quantity that the original denominator was multiplied by to yield the new denominator, we ask, "What did I multiply the original denominator by to get the new denominator?" We find this factor by dividing the original denominator into the new denominator. It is precisely this quantity that we multiply the numerator by to build the rational expression.

The most convenient new denominator is the least common denominator (LCD) of the given fractions. 
book1_ch08_5_6	no label	The Least Common Denominator (LCD) The Least Common Denominator (LCD) The Least Common Denominator (LCD) In arithmetic, the least common denominator is the smallest (least) quantity that each of the given denominators will divide into without a remainder. For algebraic expressions, the LCD is the polynomial of least degree divisible by each denominator. Some examples are shown below. Example 8.65.  The LCD is 12 since 12 is the smallest number that 4, 6, and 12 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.66.  The LCD is 24 since 24 is the smallest number that 3, 6, 8, and 12 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.67.  The LCD is x 2 since x 2 is the smallest quantity that x and x 2 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.68.  The LCD is 24a 2 b 3 since 24a 2 b 3 is the smallest quantity that 6a 2 b and 8a b 3 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.69.  The LCD is ( y − 6 ) 3 ( y − 1 ) since ( y − 6 ) 3   ·  ( y − 1 ) is the smallest quantity that y − 6, ( y − 6 ) 3 and y − 1 will divide into without a remainder. We’ll now propose and demonstrate a method for obtaining the LCD. Method for Obtaining the LCD Factor each denominator. Use exponents for repeated factors. It is usually not necessary to factor numerical quantities. Write down each different factor that appears. If a factor appears more than once, use only the factor with the highest exponent.

book1_ch10_5_2	no label	The Logic Behind The Method The Logic Behind The Method The Logic Behind The Method Suppose we wish to solve the quadratic equation x 2 − 3x − 1 = 0. Since the equation is not of the form x 2 = K, we cannot use extraction of roots. Next, we try factoring, but after a few trials we see that x 2 − 3x − 1 is not factorable. We need another method for solving quadratic equations.The method we shall study is based on perfect square trinomials and extraction of roots. The method is called solving quadratic equations by completing the square. Consider the equation x 2 + 6x + 5 = 0. This quadratic equation could be solved by factoring, but we’ll use the method of completing the square. We will explain the method in detail after we look at this example. First we’ll rewrite the equation as x 2 + 6x = − 5 Then, we’ll add 9 to each side. We get x 2 + 6x + 9 = − 5 + 9 The left side factors as a perfect square trinomial. ( x + 3 ) 2 = 4 We can solve this by extraction of roots. Notice that when the roots are rational numbers, the equation is factorable.The big question is, “How did we know to add 9 to each side of the equation?” We can convert any quadratic trinomial appearing in an equation into a perfect square trinomial if we know what number to add to both sides. We can determine that particular number by observing the following situation: Consider the square of the binomial and the resulting perfect square trinomial ( x + p ) 2 = x 2 + 2p x + p 2 Notice that the constant term (the number we are looking for) can be obtained from the linear term 2p x. If we take one half the coefficient of and square it, we get the constant term p 2 . This is true for every perfect square trinomial with leading coefficient 1. In a perfect square trinomial with leading coefficient 1, the constant term is the square of one half the coefficient of the linear term. Study these examples to see what constant term will make the given binomial into a perfect square trinomial. Example 10.26.  x 2 + 6x.   The constant must be the square of one half the coefficient of x. Since the coefficient of x is 6, we haveThe constant is 9. x 2 + 6x + 9 = ( x + 3 ) 2 This is a perfect square trinomial. Example 10.27.  a 2 + 10a.   The constant must be the square of one half the coefficient of a.

Take one half of the coefficient of the linear term, square it, then add it to both sides of the equation. The trinomial on the left is now a perfect square trinomial and can be factored as ( ) 2 .

It is similar to the method of elimination by substitution in that the process eliminates one equation and one variable. The method of elimination by addition makes use of the following two properties. If A , B , and C are algebraic expressions such that a x + ( − a x ) = 0 Property 1 states that if we add the left sides of two equations together and the right sides of the same two equations together, the resulting sums will be equal. We call this adding equations. Property 2 states that the sum of two opposites is zero.

How can the number of nothing be a number? Is zero nothing, or is it something? Well, before this starts to sound like a Zen koan, let’s look at how we use the numeral “0.” Arab and Indian scholars were the first to use zero to develop the place-value number system that we use today. When we write a number, we use only the ten numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. These numerals can stand for ones, tens, hundreds, or whatever depending on their position in the number. In order for this to work, we have to have a way to mark an empty place in a number, or the place values won’t come out right. This is what the numeral “0” does. Think of it as an empty container, signifying that that place is empty. For example, the number 302 has 3 hundreds, no tens, and 2 ones. So is zero a number? Well, that is a matter of definition, but in mathematics we tend to call it a duck if it acts like a duck, or at least if it’s behavior is mostly duck-like. The number zero obeys most of the same rules of arithmetic that ordinary numbers do, so we call it a number. It is a rather special number, though, because it doesn’t quite obey all the same laws as other numbers—you can’t divide by zero, for example. Note for math purists: In the strict axiomatic field development of the real numbers, both 0 and 1 are singled out for special treatment. Zero is the additive identity, because adding zero to a number does not change the number. Similarly, 1 is the multiplicative identity because multiplying a number by 1 does not change it.     Even more abstract than zero is the idea of negative numbers. If, in addition to not having any sheep, the farmer owes someone 3 sheep, you could say that the number of sheep that the farmer owns is negative 3. It took longer for the idea of negative numbers to be accepted, but eventually they came to be seen as something we could call “numbers.” The expanded set of numbers that we get by including negative versions of the counting numbers is called the integers.

Well, do you have a checking account? Having less than zero means that you have to add some to it just to get it up to zero. And if you take more out of it, it will be even further less than zero, meaning that you will have to add even more just to get it up to zero. The strict mathematical definition goes something like this: For every real number n, there exists its opposite, denoted – n, such that the sum of n and – n is zero, or n + (– n) = 0 Note that the negative sign in front of a number is part of the symbol for that number: The symbol “–3” is one object—it stands for “negative three,” the name of the number that is three units less than zero. The number zero is its own opposite, and zero is considered to be neither negative nor positive. Read the discussion of subtraction for more about the meanings of the symbol “–.”     The next generalization that we can make is to include the idea of fractions. While it is unlikely that a farmer owns a fractional number of sheep, many other things in real life are measured in fractions, like a half-cup of sugar. If we add fractions to the set of integers, we get the set of rational numbers.

Think of it as the denomination—it tells you what size fraction we are talking about: fourths, fifths, etc.   The top of the fraction is called the numerator. It tells you how many fourths, fifths, or whatever.   RESTRICTION: The denominator cannot be zero! (But the numerator can) If the numerator is zero, then the whole fraction is just equal to zero. If I have zero thirds or zero fourths, than I don’t have anything. However, it makes no sense at all to talk about a fraction measured in “zeroths.” Fractions can be numbers smaller than 1, like 1/2 or 3/4 (called proper fractions), or they can be numbers bigger than 1 (called improper fractions), like two-and-a-half, which we could also write as 5/2 All integers can also be thought of as rational numbers, with a denominator of 1: This means that all the previous sets of numbers (natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers) are subsets of the rational numbers. Now it might seem as though the set of rational numbers would cover every possible case, but that is not so. There are numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction, and these numbers are called irrational because they are not rational.

After all, if I measure a length with a ruler, it is going to come out to some fraction—maybe 2 and 3/4 inches. Suppose I then measure it with more precision. I will get something like 2 and 5/8 inches, or maybe 2 and 23/32 inches. It seems that however close I look it is going to be some fraction. However, this is not always the case. Imagine a line segment exactly one unit long:     Now draw another line one unit long, perpendicular to the first one, like this:     Now draw the diagonal connecting the two ends: Congratulations! You have just drawn a length that cannot be measured by any rational number. According to the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of this diagonal is the square root of 2; that is, the number which when multiplied by itself gives 2. According to my calculator, But my calculator only stops at eleven decimal places because it can hold no more. This number actually goes on forever past the decimal point, without the pattern ever terminating or repeating. This is because if the pattern ever stopped or repeated, you could write the number as a fraction—and it can be proven that the square root of 2 can never be written as for any choice of integers for a and b. The proof of this was considered quite shocking when it was first demonstrated by the followers of Pythagoras 26 centuries ago.

The points are ordered so that points to the right are greater than points to the left: Every real number corresponds to a distance on the number line, starting at the center (zero). Negative numbers represent distances to the left of zero, and positive numbers are distances to the right. The arrows on the end indicate that it keeps going forever in both directions.

In short: If a number is positive (or zero), the absolute value function does nothing to it: If a number is negative, the absolute value function makes it positive: WARNING: If there is arithmetic to do inside the absolute value sign, you must do it before taking the absolute value—the absolute value function acts on the result of whatever is inside it.

We view a negative number as a displacement to the left on the number line, so we follow the same procedure as before but when we add a negative number we take that many steps to the left instead of the right. Examples:  2 + (–3) = –1 First we move two steps to the right, and then three steps to the left: (–2) + 3 = 1 We move two steps to the left, and then three steps to the right:  (–2) + (–3) = –5 Two steps to the left, and then three more steps to the left:   From these examples, we can make the following observations: 1.      If we add two positive numbers together, the result will be positive 2.      If we add two negative numbers together, the result will be negative 3.      If we add a positive and a negative number together, the result could be positive or negative, depending on which number represents the biggest step.

Subtraction is binary (acts on two numbers), but negation is unary (acts on only one number).           Calculators have two different keys to perform these functions. The key with a plain minus sign is only for subtraction:   Negation is performed by a key that looks like one of these: Remember that subtraction can always be thought of as adding the opposite.

book3_chapter01_3_1	no label	Multiplication with Signed Numbers Multiplication with Signed Numbers Multiplication with Signed Numbers We can apply this same rule to make sense out of what we mean by a positive number times a negative number. For example, 3 × (–4) just means to take 3 of the number “negative four” and add them together: 3 × (–4) = (–4) + (–4) + (–4) = –12 Unfortunately, this scheme breaks down when we try to multiply a negative number times a number. It doesn’t make sense to try to write down a number a negative number of times. There are two ways to look at this problem. One way is to use the fact that multiplication obeys the commutative law, which means that the order of multiplication does not matter: a × b = b × a. This lets us write a negative times a positive as a positive times a negative and proceed as before: (–3) × 4 = 4 × (–3) = (–3) + (–3) + (–3) + (–3) = –12 However, we are still in trouble when it comes to multiplying a negative times a negative. A better way to look at this problem is to demand that multiplication obey a consistent pattern. If we look at a multiplication table for positive numbers and then extend it to include negative numbers, the results in the table should continue to change in the same pattern. For example, consider the following multiplication table: a b a × b 3 2 6 2 2 4 1 2 2 0 2 0 The numbers in the last column are decreasing by 2 each time, so if we let the values for a continue into the negative numbers we should keep decreasing the product by 2: a b a × b 3 2 6 2 2 4 1 2 2 0 2 0 –1 2 –2 –2 2 –4 –3 2 –6 We can make a bigger multiplication table that shows many different possibilities. By keeping the step sizes the same in each row and column, even as we extend into the negative numbers, we see that the following sign rules hold for multiplication:

The formal development of the real number system starts with the field axioms. The field axioms are postulated, and then all the other properties follow from them. The field axioms are The associative and commutative laws for addition and multiplication The existence of the additive and multiplicative identities (0 and 1) The existence of the additive inverse (opposites, or negatives) and the multiplicative inverse (the reciprocal) The distributive law All of these are essential, but the distributive law is particularly important because it is what distinguishes the behavior of multiplication from addition. Namely, multiplication distributes over addition but not vice-versa. The rules of arithmetic like “a negative times a negative gives a positive” are what they are because that is the only way the field axioms would still hold. For example, the distributive law requires that –2(3 – 2) = (–2)(3) + (–2)(–2) We can evaluate the left side of this equation by following the order of operations, which says to do what is in parentheses first, so –2(3 – 2) = –2(1) = –2. Now for the distributive law to be true, the right side must also be equal to -2, so (–2)(3) + (–2)(–2) = –2 If we use our sign rules for multiplication then it works out the way it should: (–2)(3) + (–2)(–2) = –6 + 4 = –2   
book3_chapter01_3_3	no label	Notation for Multiplication Notation for Multiplication Notation for Multiplication We are used to using the symbol “×” to represent multiplication in arithmetic, but in algebra we prefer to avoid that symbol because we like to use the letter “x” to represent a variable, and the two symbols can be easily confused. So instead, we adopt the following notation for multiplication: 1.      Multiplication is implied if two quantities are written side-by-side with no other symbol between them. Example:  ab means a × b. 2.      If a symbol is needed to prevent confusion, we use a dot.   Example:  If we need to show 3 times 5, we cannot just write them next to each other or it would look like the number thirty-five, so we write 3 · 5. We can also use parentheses to separate factors. 3 times 5 could be written as 3(5) or (3)5 or (3)(5). 
book3_chapter01_3_4	no label	Division Division Division There are two ways to think of division: as implying a related multiplication, or as multiplying by the reciprocal. Division as Related Multiplication The statement “12 ÷ 3 = 4” is true only because 3 × 4 = 12. A division problem is really asking the question “What number can I multiply the divisor by to get the dividend?”; and so every division equation implies an equivalent multiplication equation. In general: a ÷ b = c if and only if a = b × c This also shows why you cannot divide by zero. If we asked “What is six divided by zero?” we would mean “What number times zero is equal to six?”, but any number times zero gives zero, so there is no answer to this question.

Note that the reciprocal of 1/a is a. The reciprocal of the reciprocal gives you back what you started with. This allows us to define division as multiplication by the reciprocal: a ÷ b = a × (1/b) This is usually the most convenient way to think of division when you are doing algebra.

book3_chapter01_5	no label	Order of Operations Order of Operations When we encounter an expression such as 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 22+3, it makes quite a difference how we choose which operations to perform first. We need a set of rules that would guide anyone to one unique value for this kind of expression. Some of these rules are simply based on convention, while others are forced on us by mathematical logic. In the chapter on the Properties of Real Numbers, you will see how the distributive law is consistent with these rules. The universally agreed-upon order in which to evaluate a mathematical expression is as follows:1. Parentheses from Inside OutBy “parentheses” we mean anything that acts as a grouping symbol, including anything inside symbols such as [ ], { }, |  | and . Any expression in the numerator or denominator of a fraction or in an exponent are also considered grouped and should be simplified before carrying out further operations. ·        If there are nested parentheses (parentheses inside parentheses), you work from the innermost parentheses outward.2. ExponentsAlso other special functions such as log, sin, cos, etc.3. Multiplication and Division, left to rightThe left-to-right order does not matter if only multiplication is involved, but it matters for division.4. Addition and Subtraction, left to rightThe left-to-right order does not matter if only addition is involved, but it matters for subtraction.Example:  Going back to our original example, 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 22+3Given: 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 22+3 The exponent is an implied grouping, so the 2 + 3 must be evaluated first: = 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 25 Now the exponent is carried out: = 3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 32 Now the multiplication and division, left to right, using 15 ¸ 3 = 5 and 5 ´ 32 = 160: = 3 + 5 + 160 Now the addition, left to right: = 168  Calculator Note: Most modern calculators “know” the order of operations, and you can enter expressions pretty much as they are written. Some older calculators will carry out each operation as soon as its key is pushed, which can result in the operations being carried out in the wrong order. Try some examples if you are not sure how your calculator behaves.For example, if you enter3 + 4 × 5 =The correct answer should be 23, because the multiplication should be performed before the addition, giving 3 + 20. But if your calculator carries out the “3 + 4” before getting to the “ × 5”, it will show a result of 35 because it will see it as 7 × 5.  Calculator  Note: Use the parenthesis keys to force grouping. If you are evaluating an expression such asthe denominator needs to be simplified before doing the division. If you enter it into your calculator as 4 ÷ 3 + 5, it will evaluate the “ 4 ÷ 3 “ first, and then add 5 to the result, giving the incorrect answer of 6.3333. To make it perform the addition first, use parentheses:4 ÷ (3 + 5) = 0.5 In our example problem above, the “2 + 3” in the exponent is an implied grouping, and you would need to use parentheses. To enter that expression in your calculator, you would enter it as3 + 15 ÷ 3 + 5 × 2 ^ (2 + 3) =(on some calculators the exponent button is labeled “ ^ ”, while on others it is labeled “ yx ”)
book3_chapter01_6_1	no label	Mixed Number Notation Mixed Number Notation Mixed Number  Notation One way of expressing the improper fraction 5/4 is as the mixed number , which is read as “one and one-fourth.” This notation is potentially confusing and is not advised in algebra. One cause of confusion is that in algebra we use the convention that multiplication is implied when two quantities are written next to each other with no symbols in between. However, the mixed number notation implies addition, not multiplication. For example, means 1 plus one-quarter, and 3 1/2 = 3 + 1/2. It is possible to do arithmetic with mixed numbers by treating the whole number parts and the fractional parts separately, but it is generally more convenient in algebra to always write improper fractions. When you encounter a problem with mixed numbers, the first thing you should do is convert them to improper fractions.

You can measure a half-cup of sugar or two quarter-cups of sugar, or even four eighth-cups of sugar, and you will still have the same amount of sugar. ·       Multiply by a form of One A fraction can be converted into an equivalent fraction by multiplying it by a form of 1. The number 1 can be represented as a fraction because any number divided by itself is equal to 1 (remember that the fraction notation means the same thing as division). In other words,   etc. Now if you multiply a number by 1 it does not change its value, so if we multiply a fraction by another fraction that is equal to 1, we will not be changing the value of the original fraction. For example, In this case, 2/3 represents exactly the same quantity as 4/6, because all we did was to multiply 2/3 by the number 1, represented as the fraction 2/2. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number to produce an equivalent fraction is called building up the fraction.

Example:  6 is not prime because it can be written as 2 × 3 Example:  7 is prime because the only way to write it as a product of whole numbers is 1 × 7 The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, . . . There are an infinite number of prime numbers (the list goes on forever).  Any non-prime number can be decomposed into a product of prime numbers Example:  4 = 2 × 2 Example:  12 = 2 × 2 × 3 The Branching Method This method works well for larger numbers that might have many factors. All you need to do is think of any two numbers that multiply to give your original number, and write them below it. Continue this process for each number until each branch ends in a prime number. The factors of the original number are the prime numbers on the ends of all the branches. Example:  Factor the number 60     60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 Notes Notice how I started with the smallest numbers: first 2’s, then 3’s, and so on. This is not required but it keeps the result nicely in order. If a number is even, then it is divisible by 2. If a number ends in 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. If the digits of a number add up to a number divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3. In this example 15 gives 1 + 5 = 6, which is divisible by 3, and therefore 15 is divisible by 3. Large numbers with large prime factors are notoriously hard to factor—it is mainly just a matter of trial and error. The public-key encryption system for sending secure computer data uses very large numbers that need to be factored in order to break the code. The code is essentially unbreakable because it would take an enormous amount of computer time to try every possible prime factor.

In this example, the common denominator is 1000, and we get This suggests a general rule for converting a decimal number to its fraction form: Put all the digits over the denominator that corresponds to the last decimal place value. In the number 2.345, the last decimal place value is the thousandths place, so we put the digits 2345 over the denominator 1000. Of course we would usually want to reduce the resulting fraction to its simplest form. In this case 
book3_chapter01_7_2	no label	Repeating Fractions Repeating Fractions Repeating Fractions The only time this method does not work is for repeating fractions. We know that 1/3 = 0.3333333... but how could we go from 0.3333333... back to 1/3? There is no ‘last decimal place’ because the decimals repeat forever. Fortunately, there is a simple trick for this: ·         Put the repeating digit over a denominator of 9. So we see that in the case of 0.3333333...., the repeating digit is 3, and we make the fraction 3/9, which reduces to 1/3. If there is a group of more than one digit that repeats, Put the repeating group of digits over as many 9’s as there are digits. For example, in the fraction we see that the group of digits ‘15’ repeats, so we put ‘15’ over a denominator of ‘99’ to get o        One warning: This only works for the repeating fraction part of a number. If you have a number like 2.33333..., you should just work with the decimal part and rejoin it with the whole part after you have converted it to a fraction. o        Irrational numbers like p or  have non-repeating decimals, and so they cannot be written as fractions. You can, however, round them off at some point and produce an approximate fraction for them.   Why This Trick Works  If you have learned enough algebra to follow these steps, it is not difficult to see why this works. Let’s start with the simple example 0.3333333... Since we already know that the answer is 1/3, we can concentrate on the procedure, not the answer. Let x = 0.3333333... Multiply both sides by 10 to get 10x = 3.33333... Notice that the decimal part (.33333…) is still the same. In fact, it is the very thing that we called x in the first place, so we can say that 10x= 3 + x Now solve for x: This method will also work for repeating fractions that contain a group of repeating digits, but you have to multiply by a higher power of 10 in order to make the decimal portion stay the same as it was before. For example, suppose we had 0.345345345.... Let x = 0.345345345.... Multiply both sides by 1000 to get 1000x = 345.345345345.... Notice that the decimal part is still the same. In fact, it is still the thing that we called x in the first place, so we can say that 1000x = 345 + x Now solve for x:

Remember that the fraction bar means the same thing as division. To convert a fraction to a decimal, do the division. For example, You can do the division with a calculator or by hand with long division. 
book3_chapter01_7_4	no label	Rounding Rounding Rounding Look only one digit to the right ‘5’s or higher round up (there is some dispute about this rule, but it is good enough for most purposes)   Rounding 5’s Why round fives up? The number 3.5 is exactly halfway between 3.0 and 4.0, so it makes just as much sense to round it down as it does to round it up. Most of the time there is no harm in using the ‘always round fives up’ rule. This is the rule that the United States Internal Revenue Service advises you to use on your taxes, and who is going to argue with them? Sometimes, though, it can cause problems. Suppose you are adding a very large number of values that have all been rounded by this rule. The sum that you get will be a little bit bigger than it ought to be. This can be a very serious problem in computer programs. When thousands or even millions of additions are being performed, the accumulated roundoff error can be quite large. One way of dealing with this problem is the even-odd rule. This rule says that: If the five is the last significant digit and the round-off digit (the one to the left of the 5) is odd, round up. If the five is the last significant digit and the round-off digit is even, don’t round up. Actually, you could reverse even and odd in this rule. All that matters is that about half the time you will be rounding up on a 5, and half the time down. The reason it matters that the five is the last significant digit is because if there are any other non-zero digits past the five then you must round up, because the part that you are chopping off is more than 50% of the roundoff place-value. For example, suppose you want to round 3.351 to the nearest tenth. The decimal part represents the fraction 351/1000, which is 1/1000 closer to 400/1000 than it is to 300/100. Therefore you would always round this up to 3.4.     Example:  Round 11.3826 to the nearest hundredth. Solution: The hundredths place is where the ‘8’ is. We look one digit to the right and see a ‘2’, so we do not round up, leaving us with 11.38. Example:  Round 11.3826 to the nearest thousandth. Solution: The thousandths place is where the ‘2’ is. We look one place to the right and see a ‘6’, so we round the ‘2’ up, getting 11.383. Trouble with ‘9’s. If the digit you are rounding up is a ‘9’, then rounding it up will make it a ‘10’, which is too big for one place. What happens is that the extra ‘1’ gets added to the place to the left. Example:  Round 3.49721 to the nearest hundredth. Solution: The hundredth place has a ‘9’ in it. One step to the right is a ‘7’, so we have to round up. This makes the ‘9’ into a ‘10’, but we really can’t write the new number as 3.4(10). Instead, the extra ‘1’ moves one place to the left and is added to the ‘4’, giving us 3.50. It can happen that the place to the left contains another ‘9’, in which case the extra ‘1’ will cause it to become a ‘10’, which pushes the ‘1’ still further on to the next place to the left. Example:  Round 75.69996217 to the nearest ten-thousandth Solution: The ten-thousandths place is the last ‘9’ in the number, and the place to its right is a ‘6’, which means we round up. This makes the ‘9’ into a ‘10’, like this: 75.699(10) But of course we cannot put a ‘10’ in that place, so the ‘1’ moves to the left and gets added to the ‘9’ there, making it into a ‘10’: 75.69(10)0 This leaves us with the same problem, a ‘10’ in one decimal place, so the extra ‘1’ moves one more step to the left, turning that ‘9’ into a ‘10’: 75.6(10)00 Well, we still have the same problem, so we move the ‘1’ yet another step to the left, where it adds on to the ‘6’, finally leaving us with an acceptable answer: 75.7000 In general, ·        The extra ‘1’ migrates to the left until it finds a resting-place. This means that the ‘1’ moves to the left until it can be added to a digit less than ‘9’, or until it falls off the end as a new digit out in front. Example:  Round 999.96 to the nearest tenth. The digit to the right of the tenths place is a ‘6’, so we have to round up. But when we round up the ‘9’ it becomes a ‘10’, forcing the one to be added to the left. Unfortunately, we find another ‘9’ there and the process is repeated for each of the ‘9’s until we reach the leading ‘9’, which becomes a ‘10’ resulting in 1000.0

Addition and Subtraction To add or subtract decimal numbers, you use the familiar column method that you learned back in grade school. To use this method, the place values of the two numbers must be lined up. This means that the decimal points must be lined up, and you can fill in with zeros if one number has more decimal places than the other.   Example:     5.46 + 11.2   Becomes:   Multiplication To multiply two decimal numbers, you can use the column method just as you would with whole numbers. You ignore the decimal points as you carry out the multiplication, and then you put the decimal point in the result at the correct place. The product will have the number of decimal places as the total number of decimal places in the factors. In the following example, the first factor has 2 decimal places and the second factor has 1 decimal place, so the product must have 3 decimal places:   Division You can divide decimal numbers using the familiar (?) technique of long division. This can be awkward, though, because it is hard to guess at products of decimals (long division, you may recall, is basically a guess-and-check technique). It can be made easier by multiplying both the dividend and divisor by ‘10’s to make the divisor a whole number. This will not change the result of the division, because division is the same thing as fractions, and multiplying both the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number will not change the value of the fraction. For example, consider This is the same as the fraction , which is equivalent to the fraction , obtained by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 10. Thus   ,   which can be attacked with long division:     
book3_chapter01_8_1	no label	To convert a decimal to a percent To convert a decimal to a percent To convert a decimal to a percent Multiply the decimal number by 100 (or move the decimal point two places to the right). Since x% = x/100, it is also true that 100 x% = x. Another way to look at is to consider that in order to convert a number into a percent, you have to express it in hundredths. Recall that the hundredths place is the second place to the right of the decimal, so this is the digit that gives the units digit of the percent. Of course, all this means is that you move the decimal point two places to the right. WARNING: If you just remember these rules as “move the decimal two places to the left” and “move the decimal two places to the right,” you are very likely to get them confused. If you accidentally move the decimal in the wrong direction it will end up four places off from where it should be, which means that your answer will be either ten-thousand times too big or ten-thousand times too small. This is generally not an acceptable range of error. It is much better to remember these rules by simply remembering the meaning of the percent sign, namely that “ % “ means “ /100.” If you just write the problem that way, you should be able to see what you need to do in order to solve it. Converting between percents and their decimal equivalents is so simple that it is usually best to express all percents in decimal form when you are working percent problems. The decimal numbers are what you will need to put in your calculator, and you can always express the result as a percent if you need to.   Calculator  note: Some calculators have a percent key that essentially just divides by 100, but it can do other useful things that might save you a few keystrokes. For instance, if you need to add 5% to a number (perhaps to include the sales tax on a purchase), on most calculators you can enter the original number and then press “ + 5 % = “. Just make sure you understand what it does before you blindly trust it. What it is doing in this example is multiplying the original number by 0.05 and then adding the result onto the original number. You should be able to work any percent problem without using this key, but once you understand what is going on it can be a convenient short-cut.

Examples:  In this last example, the first fraction has a decimal in it, which is not a proper way to represent a fraction. To clear the decimal, just multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to produce an equivalent fraction written with whole numbers. 
book3_chapter01_8_3	no label	To convert a fraction to a percent To convert a fraction to a percent To convert a fraction to a percent ·         Divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100 To write a fraction as a percent you need to convert the fraction into hundredths. Sometimes this is easy to do without a calculator. For example, if you saw the fraction , you should notice that doubling the numerator and the denominator will produce an equivalent fraction that has a denominator of 100. Then the numerator will be the percent that you are seeking: With other fractions, though, it is not always so easy. It is not at all obvious how to convert a fraction like 5/7 into something over 100. In this case, the best thing to do is to convert the fraction into its decimal form, and then convert the decimal into a percent. To convert the fraction to a decimal, remember that the fraction bar indicates division: The “approximately equal to” sign () is used because the decimal parts have been rounded off. Because it is understood that approximate numbers are rounded, we will not continue to use the approximately equal sign. It is more conventional to just use the standard equal sign with approximate numbers, even though it is not entirely accurate. 
book3_chapter01_8_4	no label	Working percent problems Working percent problems Working percent problems In percent problems, just as in fraction problems, the word “of” implies multiplication: “x percent of a number” means “x% times a number” Example:  What is 12% of 345? 12% is 12/100, which we can express in decimal form as 0.12. 12% of 345 means 12% times 345, or Notice how it is easier to just move the decimal over two places instead of explicitly dividing by 100. We solve a problem like this by translating the question into mathematical symbols, using x to stand for the unknown “what” and that the “of” means “times”: Example:  What percent of 2342 is 319? Once again we translate this into mathematical symbols: Solving this equation involves a little bit of algebra. To isolate the x% on one side of the equation we must divide both sides by 2342: The calculator tells us that x% = 0.1362 Now the right-hand side of this equation is the decimal equivalent that is equal to x%, which means that x = 13.62, or 319 is 13.62% of 2342 If that last step confused you, remember that the percent symbol means “over 100”, so the equation x% = 0.1362 really says or x = 100(0.1362) x = 13.62 Example:  2.4 is what percent of 19.7? Translating into math symbols: Solving for x: 2.4 = x% (19.7) x% = 0.1218 x = 12.18 So we can say that 2.4 is 12% of 19.7 (rounding to 2 significant figures) Example:  46 is 3.2% of what? Translating into math symbols: Solving for x: 46 = 3.2% (x) 46 = 0.032x x = 1437.5 Therefore, we can say that 46 is 3.2% of 1400 (rounding to 2 significant figures). Notice that in the second step the percentage (3.2%) is converted into its decimal form (0.032). 
book3_chapter01_9	no label	Properties of Real Numbers Properties of Real Numbers The following table lists the defining properties of the real numbers (technically called the field axioms). These laws define how the things we call numbers should behave. Addition Multiplication Commutative For all real a, b a + b = b + a Commutative For all real a, b ab = ba Associative For all real a, b, c a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c Associative For all real a, b, c (ab)c = a(bc) Identity There exists a real number 0 such that for every real a a + 0 = a Identity There exists a real number 1 such that for every real a a × 1 = a Additive Inverse (Opposite) For every real number a there exist a real number, denoted (-a), such that a + (–a) = 0 Multiplicative Inverse (Reciprocal) For every real number a except 0 there exist a real number, denoted , such that a ×  = 1 Distributive Law For all real a, b, c a(b + c) = ab + ac, and (a + b)c = ac + bcThe commutative and associative laws do not hold for subtraction or division:a – b is not equal to b – aa ÷ b is not equal to b ÷ aa – (b – c) is not equal to (a – b) – ca ÷ (b ÷ c) is not equal to (a ÷ b) ÷ cTry some examples with numbers and you will see that they do not work.What these laws mean is that order and grouping don't matter for addition and multiplication, but they certainly do matter for subtraction and division. In this way, addition and multiplication are “cleaner” than subtraction and division. This will become important when we start talking about algebraic expressions. Often what we will want to do with an algebraic expression will involve rearranging it somehow. If the operations are all addition and multiplication, we don't have to worry so much that we might be changing the value of an expression by rearranging its terms or factors. Fortunately, we can always think of subtraction as an addition problem (adding the opposite), and we can always think of division as a multiplication (multiplying by the reciprocal).You may have noticed that the commutative and associative laws read exactly the same way for addition and multiplication, as if there was no difference between them other than notation. The law that makes them behave differently is the distributive law, because multiplication distributes over addition, not vice-versa.. The distributive law is extremely important, and it is impossible to understand algebra without being thoroughly familiar with this law.Example:  2(3 + 4)According to the order of operations rules, we should evaluate this expression by first doing the addition inside the parentheses, giving us2(3 + 4) = 2(7) = 14But we can also look at this problem with the distributive law, and of course still get the same answer. The distributive law says that

The way to think about this operation is that if you have three x-squareds, and then you get five more x-squareds, you will then have eight x-squareds. Example:  x2 + 2x + 3x2 + 2 + 4x + 7 Starting with the highest power of x, we see that there are four x-squareds in all (1x2 + 3x2). Then we collect the first powers of x, and see that there are six of them (2x + 4x). The only thing left is the constants 2 + 7 = 9.

Think of parentheses as opaque—the stuff inside the parentheses can’t “see” the stuff outside the parentheses. If there is some factor multiplying the parentheses, then the only way to get rid of the parentheses is to multiply using the distributive law. Example:  3x + 2(x – 4) = 3x + 2x – 8 = 5x – 8 
book3_chapter02_2_3	no label	Minus Signs: Subtraction and Negatives Minus Signs: Subtraction and Negatives Minus Signs: Subtraction and Negatives Subtraction can be replaced by adding the opposite 3x – 2 = 3x + (–2) Negative signs in front of parentheses A special case is when a minus sign appears in front of parentheses. At first glance, it looks as though there is no factor multiplying the parentheses, and you may be tempted to just remove the parentheses. What you need to remember is that the minus sign indicating subtraction should always be thought of as adding the opposite. This means that you want to add the opposite of the entire thing inside the parentheses, and so you have to change the sign of each term in the parentheses. Another way of looking at it is to imagine an implied factor of one in front of the parentheses. Then the minus sign makes that factor into a negative one, which can be multiplied by the distributive law: 3x – (2 – x) = 3x + (–1)[2 + (–x)] = 3x + (–1)(2) + (–1)(–x) = 3x – 2 + x = 4x – 2 However, if there is only a plus sign in front of the parentheses, then you can simply erase the parentheses: 3x + (2 – x) = 3x + 2 – x A comment about subtraction and minus signs Although you can always explicitly replace subtraction with adding the opposite, as in this previous example, it is often tedious and inconvenient to do so. Once you get used to thinking that way, it is no longer necessary to actually write it that way. It is helpful to always think of minus signs as being “stuck” to the term directly to their right. That way, as you rearrange terms, collect like terms, and clear parentheses, the “adding the opposite” business will be taken care of because the minus signs will go with whatever was to their right. If what is immediately to the right of a minus sign happens to be a parenthesis, then the minus sign attacks every term inside the parentheses. 
book3_chapter02_3	no label	Solutions of Algebraic Equations Solutions of Algebraic Equations Up until now, we have just been talking about manipulating algebraic expressions. Now it is time to talk about equations. An expression is just a statement like2x + 3This expression might be equal to any number, depending on the choice of x. For example, if x = 3 then the value of this expression is 9. But if we are writing an equation, then we are making a statement about its value. We might say2x + 3 = 7A mathematical equation is either true or false. This equation, 2x + 3 = 7, might be true or it might be false; it depends on the value chosen for x. We call such equations conditional, because their truth depends on choosing the correct value for x. If I choose x = 3, then the equation is clearly false because 2(3) + 3 = 9, not 7. In fact, it is only true if I choose x = 2. Any other value for x produces a false equation. We say that x = 2 is the solution of this equation.Solutions The solution of an equation is the value(s) of the variable(s) that make the equation a true statement. An equation like 2x + 3 = 7 is a simple type called a linear equation in one variable. These will always have one solution, no solutions, or an infinite number of solutions. There are other types of equations, however, that can have several solutions. For example, the equation x2 = 9 is satisfied by both 3 and –3, and so it has two solutions. One Solution This is the normal case, as in our example where the equation 2x + 3 = 7 had exactly one solution, namely x = 2. The other two cases, no solution and an infinite number of solutions, are the oddball cases that you don’t expect to run into very often. Nevertheless, it is important to know that they can happen in case you do encounter one of these situations. Infinite Number of Solutions Consider the equation x = x This equation is obviously true for every possible value of x. This is, of course, a ridiculously simple example, but it makes the point. Equations that have this property are called identities. Some examples of identities would be   2x = x + x 3 = 3 (x – 2)(x + 2) = x2 – 4   All of these equations are true for any value of x. The second example, 3 = 3, is interesting because it does not even contain an x, so obviously its truthfulness cannot depend on the value of x! When you are attempting to solve an equation algebraically and you end up with an obvious identity (like 3 = 3), then you know that the original equation must also be an identity, and therefore it has an infinite number of solutions. No Solutions Now consider the equation x + 4 = x + 3 There is no possible value for x that could make this true. If you take a number and add 4 to it, it will never be the same as if you take the same number and add 3 to it. Such an equation is called a contradiction, because it cannot ever be true. If you are attempting to solve such an equation, you will end up with an extremely obvious contradiction such as 1 = 2. This indicates that the original equation is a contradiction, and has no solution.  In summary, o        An identity is always true, no matter what x is o        A contradiction is never true for any value of x o        A conditional equation is true for some values of x
book3_chapter02_4_1	no label	The Addition Principle The Addition Principle The Addition Principle ·        Adding (or subtracting) the same number to both sides of an equation does not change its solution set. Think of the balance analogy—if both sides of the equation are equal, then increasing both sides by the same amount will change the value of each side, but they will still be equal. For example, if 3 = 3, then 3 + 2 = 3 + 2.   Consequently, if   6 + x = 8   for some value of x (which in this case is x = 2), then we can add any number to both sides of the equation and x = 2 will still be the solution. If we wanted to, we could add a 3 to both sides of the equation, producing the equation   9 + x = 11.   As you can see, x = 2 is still the solution. Of course, this new equation is no simpler than the one we started with, and this maneuver did not help us solve the equation. If we want to solve the equation   6 + x = 8,   the idea is to get x by itself on one side, and so we want to get rid of the 6 that is on the left side. We can do this by subtracting a 6 from both sides of the equation (which of course can be thought of as adding a negative six):   6 – 6 + x = 8 – 6 or x = 2   You can think of this operation as moving the 6 from one side of the equation to the other, which causes it to change sign   ·        The addition principle is useful in solving equations because it allows us to move whole terms from one side of the equal sign to the other. While this is a convenient way to think of it, you should remember that you are not really “moving” the term from one side to the other—you are really adding (or subtracting) the term on both sides of the equation. 
book3_chapter02_4_2	no label	Notation notes Notation notes Notation notes In the previous example, we wrote the –6 in-line with the rest of the equation. This is analogous to writing an arithmetic subtraction problem in one line, as in   234 – 56 = 178.   You probably also learned to write subtraction and addition problems in a column format, like We can also use a similar notation for the addition method with algebraic equations. Given the equation   x + 3 = 2, we want to subtract a 3 from both sides in order to isolate the variable. In column format this would look like Here the numbers in the second row are negative 3’s, so we are adding the two rows together to produce the bottom row. The advantage of the column notation is that it makes the operation easier to see and reduces the chances for an error. The disadvantage is that it takes more space, but that is a relatively minor disadvantage. Which notation you prefer to use is not important, as long as you can follow what you are doing and it makes sense to you.

book3_chapter02_6	no label	Using the Principles Together Using the Principles Together Suppose you were given an equation like 2x – 3 = 5. You will need to use the addition principle to move the –3, and the multiplication principle to remove the coefficient 2. Which one should you use first? Strictly speaking, it does not matter—you will eventually get the right answer. In practice, however, it is usually simpler to use the addition principle first, and then the multiplication principle. The reason for this is that if we divide by 2 first we will turn everything into fractions: Given: 2x – 3 = 5 Suppose we first divide both sides by 2: Now there is nothing wrong with doing arithmetic with fractions, but it is not as simple as working with whole numbers. In this example we would have to add 3/2 to both sides of the equation to isolate the x. It is usually more convenient, though, to use the addition principle first: Given: 2x – 3 = 5 Add 3 to both sides:    At this point all we need to do is divide both sides by 2 to get x = 4.

Thus, every point on the plane can be identified by a pair of numbers (x, y), called its coordinates. Examples:  
book3_chapter04_1_2	no label	Quadrants Quadrants Quadrants Sometimes we just want to know what general part of the graph we are talking about. The axes naturally divide the plane up into quarters. We call these quadrants, and number them from one to four. Notice that the numbering begins in the upper right quadrant and continues around in the counter-clockwise direction. Notice also that each quadrant can be identified by the unique combination of positive and negative signs for the coordinates of a point in that quadrant. 
book3_chapter04_2	no label	Graphing Functions Graphing Functions Consider an equation such asy = 2x – 1We say that y is a function of x because if you choose any value for x, this formula will give you a unique value of y. For example, if we choose x = 3 then the formula gives usy = 2(3) – 1ory = 5Thus we can say that the value y = 5 is generated by the choice of x = 3. Had we chosen a different value for x, we would have gotten a different value for y. In fact, we can choose a whole bunch of different values for x and get a y value for each one. This is best shown in a table:x (Input) x→ FORMULA→ y y (Output) –2 2(–2) – 1 = –5 –5 –1 2(–1) – 1 = –3 –3 0 2(0) – 1 = –1 –1 1 2(1) – 1 = 1 1 2 2(2) – 1 = 3 3 3 2(3) – 1 = 5 5This relationship between x and its corresponding y values produces a collection of pairs of points (x, y), namely(–2, –5)(–1, –3)(0, –1)(1, 1)(2, 3)(3, 5)Since each of these pairs of numbers can be the coordinates of a point on the plane, it is natural to ask what this collection of ordered pairs would look like if we graphed them. The result is something like this:The points seem to fall in a straight line. Now, our choices for x were quite arbitrary. We could just as well have picked other values, including non-integer values. Suppose we picked many more values for x, like 2.7, 3.14, etc. and added them to our graph. Eventually the points would be so crowded together that they would form a solid line:The arrows on the ends of the line indicate that it goes on forever, because there is no limit to what numbers we could choose for x. We say that this line is the graph of the function y = 2x – 1.If you pick any point on this line and read off its x and y coordinates, they will satisfy the equation y = 2x – 1. For example, the point (1.5, 2) is on the line:and the coordinates x = 1.5, y = 2 satisfy the equation y = 2x – 1:2 = 2(1.5) – 1·        Note: This graph turned out to be a straight line only because of the particular function that we used as an example. There are many other functions whose graphs turn out to be various curves.
book3_chapter04_3_1	no label	Describing Lines Describing Lines Describing Lines Just as there are an infinite number of equations that satisfy the above conditions, there are also an infinite number of straight lines that we can draw on a graph. To describe a particular line we need to specify two distinct pieces of information concerning that line. A specific straight line can be determined by specifying two distinct points that the line passes through, or it can be determined by giving one point that it passes through and somehow describing how “tilted” the line is. 
book3_chapter04_3_2	no label	Slope Slope Slope The slope of a line is a measure of how “tilted” the line is. A highway sign might say something like “6% grade ahead.” What does this mean, other than that you hope your brakes work? What it means is that the ratio of your drop in altitude to your horizontal distance is 6%, or 6/100. In other words, if you move 100 feet forward, you will drop 6 feet; if you move 200 feet forward, you will drop 12 feet, and so on. We measure the slope of lines in much the same way, although we do not convert the result to a percent. Suppose we have a graph of an unknown straight line. Pick any two different points on the line and label them point 1 and point 2: In moving from point 1 to point 2, we cover 4 steps horizontally (the x direction) and 2 steps vertically (the y direction): Therefore, the ratio of the change in altitude to the change in horizontal distance is 2 to 4. Expressing it as a fraction and reducing, we say that the slope of this line is To formalize this procedure a bit, we need to think about the two points in terms of their x and y coordinates. Now you should be able to see that the horizontal displacement is the difference between the x coordinates of the two points, or 4 = 5 – 1, and the vertical displacement is the difference between the y coordinates, or 2 = 4 – 2. In general, if we say that the coordinates of point 1 are (x1, y1) and the coordinates of point 2 are (x2, y2), then we can define the slope m as follows: where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are any two distinct points on the line. It is customary (in the US) to use the letter m to represent slope. No one knows why. It makes no difference which two points are used for point 1 and point 2. If they were switched, both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction would be changed to the opposite sign, giving exactly the same result. Many people find it useful to remember this formula as “slope is rise over run.” Another common notation is , where the Greek letter delta (D) means “the change in.” The slope is a ratio of how much y changes per change in x: 
book3_chapter04_3_3	no label	Horizontal Lines Horizontal Lines Horizontal Lines A horizontal line has zero slope, because there is no change in y as x increases. Thus, any two points will have the same y coordinates, and since y1 = y2,   . 
book3_chapter04_3_4	no label	Vertical Lines Vertical Lines Vertical Lines A vertical line presents a different problem. If you look at the formula , you see that there is a problem with the denominator. It is not possible to get two different values for xl and x2, because if x changes then you are not on the vertical line anymore. Any two points on a vertical line will have the same x coordinates, and so x2 – x1 = 0. Since the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero, we have to say that a vertical line has undefined slope. Do not confuse this with the case of the horizontal line, which has a well-defined slope that just happens to equal zero. 
book3_chapter04_3_5	no label	Positive and Negative Slope Positive and Negative Slope Positive and Negative Slope The x coordinate increases to the right, so moving from left to right is motion in the positive x direction. Suppose that you are going uphill as you move in the positive x direction. Then both your x and y coordinates are increasing, so the ratio of rise over run will be positive—you will have a positive increase in y for a positive increase in x. On the other hand, if you are going downhill as you move from left to right, then the ratio of rise over run will be negative because you lose height for a given positive increase in x. The thing to remember is: As you go from left to right, Uphill = Positive Slope Downhill = Negative Slope And of course, no change in height means that the line has zero slope.   Some Slopes 
book3_chapter04_3_6	no label	Intercepts Intercepts Intercepts Two lines can have the same slope and be in different places on the graph. This means that in addition to describing the slope of a line we need some way to specify exactly where the line is on the graph. This can be accomplished by specifying one particular point that the line passes through. Although any point will do, it is conventional to specify the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This point is called the y-intercept, and is usually denoted by the letter b. Note that every line except vertical lines will cross the y-axis at some point, and we have to handle vertical lines as a special case anyway because we cannot define a slope for them. Same Slopes, Different y-Intercepts 
book3_chapter04_3_7	no label	Equations Equations Equations The equation of a line gives the mathematical relationship between the x and y coordinates of any point on the line. Let’s return to the example we used in graphing functions. The equation y = 2x – 1 produces the following graph: This line evidently has a slope of 2 and a y intercept equal to –1. The numbers 2 and –1 also appear in the equation—the coefficient of x is 2, and the additive constant is –1. This is not a coincidence, but is due to the standard form in which the equation was written. Standard Form (Slope-Intercept Form) If a linear equation in two unknowns is written in the form y = mx + b   where m and b are any two real numbers, then the graph will be a straight line with a slope of m and a y intercept equal to b. Point-Slope Form As mentioned earlier, a line is fully described by giving its slope and one distinct point that the line passes through. While this point is customarily the y intercept, it does not need to be. If you want to describe a line with a given slope m that passes through a given point (x1, y1), the formula is   To help remember this formula, think of solving it for m:   Since the point (x, y) is an arbitrary point on the line and the point (x1, y1) is another point on the line, this is nothing more than the definition of slope for that line. Two-Point Form Another way to completely specify a line is to give two different points that the line passes through. If you are given that the line passes through the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the formula is   This formula is also easy to remember if you notice that it is just the same as the point-slope form with the slope m replaced by the definition of slope,

Because the two equations describe the same line, they have all their points in common; hence there are an infinite number of solutions to the system. Attempting to solve gives an identity If you try to solve a dependent system by algebraic methods, you will eventually run into an equation that is an identity. An identity is an equation that is always true, independent of the value(s) of any variable(s). For example, you might get an equation that looks like x = x, or 3 = 3. This would tell you that the system is a dependent system, and you could stop right there because you will never find a unique solution.

Inconsistent Equations Lines do not intersect (Parallel Lines; have the same slope) No solutions If two lines happen to have the same slope, but are not identically the same line, then they will never intersect. There is no pair (x, y) that could satisfy both equations, because there is no point (x, y) that is simultaneously on both lines. Thus these equations are said to be inconsistent, and there is no solution. The fact that they both have the same slope may not be obvious from the equations, because they are not written in one of the standard forms for straight lines. The slope is not readily evident in the form we use for writing systems of equations. (If you think about it you will see that the slope is the negative of the coefficient of x divided by the coefficient of y). Attempting to solve gives a false statement By attempting to solve such a system of equations algebraically, you are operating on a false assumption—namely that a solution exists. This will eventually lead you to a contradiction: a statement that is obviously false, regardless of the value(s) of the variable(s). At some point in your work you would get an obviously false equation like 3 = 4. This would tell you that the system of equations is inconsistent, and there is no solution.     Solution by Graphing For more complex systems, and especially those that contain non-linear equations, finding a solution by algebraic methods can be very difficult or even impossible. Using a graphing calculator (or a computer), you can graph the equations and actually see where they intersect. The calculator can then give you the coordinates of the intersection point. The only drawback to this method is that the solution is only an approximation, whereas the algebraic method gives the exact solution. In most practical situations, though, the precision of the calculator is sufficient. For more demanding scientific and engineering applications there are computer methods that can find approximate solutions to very high precision.   
book3_chapter05_2	no label	Addition Method Addition Method The whole problem with solving a system of equations is that you cannot solve an equation that has two unknowns in it. You need an equation with only one variable so that you can isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Both methods that we will look at are techniques for eliminating one of the variables to give you an equation in just one unknown, which you can then solve by the usual methods.The first method of solving systems of linear equations is the addition method, in which the two equations are added together to eliminate one of the variables.Adding the equations means that we add the left sides of the two equations together, and we add the right sides together. This is legal because of the Addition Principle, which says that we can add the same amount to both sides of an equation. Since the left and right sides of any equation are equal to each other, we are indeed adding the same amount to both sides of an equation.Consider this simple example:Example:If we add these equations together, the terms containing y will add up to zero (2y plus -2y), and we will getor5x = 5 x = 1However, we are not finished yet—we know x, but we still don’t know y. We can solve for y by substituting the now known value for x into either of our original equations. This will produce an equation that can be solved for y:Now that we know both x and y, we can say that the solution to the system is the pair (1, 1/2).This last example was easy to see because of the fortunate presence of both a positive and a negative 2y. One is not always this lucky. ConsiderExample:Now there is nothing so obvious, but there is still something we can do. If we multiply the first equation by -3, we get(Don’t forget to multiply every term in the equation, on both sides of the equal sign). Now if we add them together the terms containing x will cancel:orAs in the previous example, now that we know y we can solve for x by substituting into either original equation. The first equation looks like the easiest to solve for x, so we will use it:And so the solution point is (-4, 7/2).Now we look at an even less obvious example:Example:Here there is nothing particularly attractive about going after either the x or the y. In either case, both equations will have to be multiplied by some factor to arrive at a common coefficient. This is very much like the situation you face trying to find a least common denominator for adding fractions, except that here we call it a Least Common Multiple (LCM). As a general rule, it is easiest to eliminate the variable with the smallest LCM. In this case that would be the y, because the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. If we wanted to eliminate the x we would have to use a LCM of 10 (5 times 2). So, we choose to make the coefficients of y into plus and minus 6. To do this, the first equation must be multiplied by 3, and the second equation by 2:orNow adding these two together will eliminate the terms containing y:orx = 2We still need to substitute this value into one of the original equations to solve for y:Thus the solution is the point (2, 2).
book3_chapter05_3	no label	Substitution Method Substitution Method When we used the Addition Method to solve a system of equations, we still had to do a substitution to solve for the remaining variable. With the substitution method, we solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other, and then substitute that into the other equation. This makes more sense with an example:Example:2y + x = 3 (1) 4y – 3x = 1 (2)Equation 1 looks like it would be easy to solve for x, so we take it and isolate x:2y + x = 3   x = 3 – 2y (3)Now we can use this result and substitute 3 - 2y in for x in equation 2:Now that we have y, we still need to substitute back in to get x. We could substitute back into any of the previous equations, but notice that equation 3 is already conveniently solved for x:And so the solution is (1, 1).As a rule, the substitution method is easier and quicker than the addition method when one of the equations is very simple and can readily be solved for one of the variables.

One way to help keep things straight is to use the column format for addition, keeping like terms lined up in columns:This method is particularly helpful in the case of subtraction, because it is too easy to make a mistake distributing the minus sign when you write it all in one row.

book3_chapter06_5_2	no label	Trinomials (Quadratic) Trinomials (Quadratic) Trinomials (Quadratic) A quadratic trinomial has the form ax2 + bx + c, where the coefficients a, b, and c, are real numbers (for simplicity we will only use integers, but in real life they could be any real number). We are interested here in factoring quadratic trinomials with integer coefficients into factors that have integer coefficients. Not all such quadratic polynomials can be factored over the real numbers, and even fewer into integers (they all can be factored of we allow for imaginary numbers and rational coefficients, but we don't). Therefore, when we say a quadratic can be factored, we mean that we can write the factors with only integer coefficients. If a quadratic can be factored, it will be the product of two first-degree binomials, except for very simple cases that just involve monomials. For example x2 by itself is a quadratic expression where the coefficient a is equal to 1, and b and c are zero. Obviously, x2 factors into (x)(x), but this is not a very interesting case. A slightly more complicated case occurs when only the coefficient c is zero. Then you get something that looks like 2x2 + 3x This can be factored very simply by factoring out (‘undistributing’) the common factor of x: 2x2 + 3x = x(2x + 3) The most general case is when all three terms are present, as in x2 + 5x + 6 We look at two cases of this type. The easiest to factor are the ones where the coefficient of x2 (which we are calling ‘a’) is equal to 1, as in the above example. If a is not 1 then things get a little bit more complicated, so we will begin by looking at a = 1 examples. Coefficient of x2 is 1 Since the trinomial comes from multiplying two first-degree binomials, let’s review what happens when we multiply binomials using the FOIL method. Remember that to do factoring we will have to think about this process in reverse (you could say we want to ‘de-FOIL’ the trinomial). Suppose we are given (x + 2)(x + 3) Using the FOIL method, we get (x + 2)(x + 3) = x2 + 3x + 2x + 6 Then, collecting like terms gives (x + 2)(x + 3) = x2 + 5x + 6 Now look at this and think about where the terms in the trinomial came from. Obviously the x2 came from x times x. The interesting part is what happens with the other parts, the ‘+ 2’ and the ‘+ 3’. The last term in the trinomial, the 6 in this case, came from multiplying the 2 and the 3. Where did the 5x in the middle come from? We got the 5x by adding the 2x and the 3x when we collected like terms. We can state this as a rule: If the coefficient of x2 is one, then to factor the quadratic you need to find two numbers that: 1. Multiply to give the constant term (which we call c) 2. Add to give the coefficient of x (which we call b) This rule works even if there are minus signs in the quadratic expression (assuming that you remember how to add and multiply positive and negative numbers). 
book3_chapter06_5_3	no label	Special Case: Perfect Square Trinomial Special Case: Perfect Square Trinomial Special Case: Perfect Square Trinomial Recall from special products of binomials that and The trinomials on the right are called perfect squares because they are the squares of a single binomial, rather than the product of two different binomials. A quadratic trinomial can also have this form: (x + 3)2 = (x + 3)(x + 3) = x2 + 6x + 9 Notice that just as before the coefficient of x is the sum 3 + 3, and the constant term is the product 3 ´ 3. One can also say that The coefficient of x is twice the number 3 The constant term is the number three squared In general, if a quadratic trinomial is a perfect square, then o        The coefficient of x is twice the square root of the constant term Or to put it another way, o        The constant term is the square of half the coefficient of x In symbolic form we can express this as It is helpful to be able to recognize perfect square trinomials. We will see them again when we talk about solving quadratic equations. Coefficient of x2 is not 1 A quadratic is more difficult to factor when the coefficient of the squared term is not 1, because that coefficient is mixed in with the other products from FOILing the two binomials. There are two methods for attacking these: either you can use a systematic guess-and-check method, or a method called factoring by grouping. We will first look at the guess-and-check method (which we could call factoring by grouping). If you need to factor a trinomial such as 2x2 + x - 3, you have to think about what combinations could give the 2x2 as well as the other two terms. In this example the 2x2 must come from (x)(2x), and the constant term might come from either (-1)(3) or (1)(-3). The hard part is figuring out which combination will give the correct middle term. This gets messy because all those coefficients will be mixed in with the middle term when you FOIL the binomials. To see what is going on, let’s see what happens when we FOIL the following binomials: What happened? There are several significant things to notice: The leading term in the trinomial (the 2x2) is just the product of the leading terms in the binomials. The constant term in the trinomial (the -3) is the product of the constant terms in the binomials (so far this is the same as in the case where the coefficient of x2 is 1) The middle term in the trinomial (the x) is the sum of the outer and inner products, which involves all the constants and coefficients in the binomials, in a messy way that is not always obvious by inspection. Because 1 and 2 are relatively simple and 3 is complicated, it makes sense to think of the possible candidates that would satisfy conditions 1 and 2, and then test them in every possible combination by multiplying the resulting binomials to see if you get the correct middle term. This seems tedious, and indeed it can be if the numbers you are working with have a lot of factors, but in practice you usually only have to try a few combinations before you see what will work. As a demonstration, let’s see how we would attack the example by this method. Given 2x2 + x - 3 We make a list of the possible factors of 2x2: The only choice is (2x)(x). Then we make a list of the possible factors of the constant term -3: it is either (1)(-3) or (-1)(3). (Notice that since we need a negative number, one factor must be negative and the other positive, but it doesn’t matter which one so we have to try it both ways). The possible factors of the trinomial are the binomials that we can make out of these possible factors, taken in every possible order. From these possibilities, we see that the candidate binomials are: (2x + 1)(x – 3) (x + 1)(2x – 3) (2x + 3)(x – 1) (x + 3)(2x – 1) If we start multiplying these out, we will find that the third one works, and then we are finished. All you really need to check is to see if the sum of the outer and inner multiplications will give you the correct middle term, since we already know that we will get the correct first and last terms. In short, the method is: 1.      List all the possible ways to get the coefficient of x2 (which we call a) by multiplying two numbers 2.      List all the possible ways to get the constant term (which we call c) by multiplying two numbers 3.      Try all possible combinations of these to see which ones give the correct middle term ·        Don’t forget that the number itself times 1 is a possibility ·        If the number (a or c) is negative, remember to try the plus and minus signs both ways   
book3_chapter06_6	no label	Factoring a Quadratic Trinomial by Grouping Factoring a Quadratic Trinomial by Grouping Another method for factoring these kinds of quadratic trinomials is called factoring by grouping. Factoring by grouping can be a bit more tedious, and is often not worth the trouble if you can find the correct factors by some quick trial and error. However, it works quite well when the factors are not immediately obvious, such as when you have a very large number of candidate factors. When this happens, the trial and error method becomes very tediousFactoring by grouping is best demonstrated with a few examples. Example: Given: 5x2 + 11x + 2 Find the product ac: (5)(2) = 10 Think of two factors of 10 that add up to 11: 1 and 10 Write the 11x as the sum of 1x and 10x: 5x2 + 1x + 10x + 2 Group the two pairs of terms: (5x2 + 1x) + (10x + 2) Remove common factors from each group: x(5x + 1) + 2(5x + 1) Notice that the two quantities in parentheses are now identical. That means we can factor out a common factor of (5x + 1): (5x + 1)(x + 2) Example: Given: 4x2 + 7x – 15 Find the product ac: (4)(-15) = -60 Think of two factors of -60 that add up to 7: -5 and 12 Write the 7x as the sum of -5x and 12x: 4x2 – 5x + 12x – 15 Group the two pairs of terms: (4x2 – 5x) + (12x – 15) Remove common factors from each group: x(4x – 5) + 3(4x – 5) Notice that the two quantities in parentheses are now identical. That means we can factor out a common factor of (4x - 5): (4x – 5)(x + 3)The ProcedureGiven a general quadratic trinomialax2 + bx + c1. Find the product ac.2. Find two numbers h and k such thathk = ac(h and k are factors of the product of the coefficient of x2 and the constant term)AND h + k = b(h and k add to give the coefficient of x)3. Rewrite the quadratic asax2 + hx + kx + c4. Group the two pairs of terms that have common factors and simplify.(ax2 + hx) + (kx + c)x(ax + h) + (kx + c)(note: because of the way you chose h and k, you will be able to factor a constant out of the second parentheses, leaving you with two identical expressions in parentheses as in the examples).·        Remember that this won’t work for all quadratic trinomials, because not all quadratic trinomials can be factored into products of binomials with integer coefficients. If you have a non-factorable trinomial, you will not be able to do step 2 above.Why this works Suppose the quadratic trinomial in question came from multiplying two arbitrary binomials: (px + n)(qx + m) If we multiply this out we will get pqx2 + pmx + qnx + nm or pqx2 + (pm + qn)x + nm Notice that the coefficient of x consists of a sum of two terms, pm and qn. These are the two numbers we called h and k above. pm = h qn = k Now we see that the two numbers h and k add up to the coefficient of x, which we called b: h + k = b Obviously they are factors of their own product pmqn, but we notice that pq = a, and mn = c, so (pm)(qn) = (pq)(nm) which is equivalent to hk = ac

book3_chapter07_1	no label	Rational Expressions Rational Expressions o        A rational expression is a ratio of polynomials:Examples: Excluded Values Whenever an expression containing variables is present in the denominator of a fraction, you should be alert to the possibility that certain values of the variables might make the denominator equal to zero, which is forbidden. This means that when we are talking about rational expressions we can no longer say that the variable represents “any real number.” Certain values may have to be excluded. For example, in the expression , we cannot allow the value x = 0 so we would parenthetically add the comment (x ¹ 0), and for we would say (x ¹ 3) . In the case of we would exclude both x = 1 and x = –1, since either choice would make the denominator zero. We don’t care if the numerator is zero. If the numerator is zero, that just makes the whole rational expression zero (assuming, of course, that the denominator is not zero), just as with common fractions. Recall that 0/4 = 0, but 4/0 is undefined. It is important to keep this in mind as you work with rational expressions, because it can happen that you are trying to solve an equation and you get one of the “forbidden” values as a solution. You would have to discard that solution as being unacceptable. You can also get some crazy results if you don’t pay attention to the possibility that the denominator might be zero for certain values of the variable. For example, the celebrated proof that 0 = 1 and other nonsense. Proof that 1 = 0 And other nonsense Can you identify the flaw in this argument? Let x = 1. Then Given: x = 1 Multiply both sides by x: x2 = x Subtract x from both sides: x2 – x = 0 Factor out an x: x(x – 1) = 0 Divide both sides by (x ‑ 1): x = 0 But x = 1, so substitute 1 for x to get: 1 = 0 This is a very simple variant of this classic ‘proof’. Once you see the trick*, you can construct more elaborate versions that do a better job of concealing the error, and you can vary it to ‘prove’ other nonsense such as 1 = 2. For example: Let x = 1 . Then Given: x = 1 Multiply both sides by –1: –x = –1 Add x2 to both sides: x2 - x = x2 – 1 Factor both sides: x(x – 1) = (x – 1)(x + 1) Divide both sides by (x – 1): x = (x + 1) Substituting 1 back in for x gives the result: 1 = 2 *The trick:  We are dividing by zero because if x = 1 then (x – 1) = 0. Thus, all of these “proofs” are invalid because they use an illegal step.

This rule is quite reasonable when m and n are positive integers and m > n. For example: where indeed 5 – 2 = 3. However, in other cases it leads to situation where we have to define new properties for exponents. First, suppose that m < n. We can simplify it by canceling like factors as before: But following our rule would give In order for these two results to be consistent, it must be true that or, in general, ·        Notice that a minus sign in the exponent does not make the result negative—instead, it makes it the reciprocal of the result with the positive exponent.

book3_chapter09_1_1	no label	Roots Roots Roots Synonyms: Solutions or Zeros  Can have 0, 1, or 2 real roots Consider the graph of quadratic equations. The quadratic equation looks like ax2 + bx + c = 0, but if we take the quadratic expression on the left and set it equal to y, we will have a function: y = ax2 + bx + c When we graph y vs. x, we find that we get a curve called a parabola. The specific values of a, b, and c control where the curve is relative to the origin (left, right, up, or down), and how rapidly it spreads out. Also, if a is negative then the parabola will be upside-down. What does this have to do with finding the solutions to our original quadratic equation? Well, whenever y = 0 then the equation y = ax2 + bx + c is the same as our original equation. Graphically, y is zero whenever the curve crosses the x-axis. Thus, the solutions to the original quadratic equation (ax2 + bx + c = 0) are the values of x where the function (y = ax2 + bx + c) crosses the x-axis. From the figures below, you can see that it can cross the x-axis once, twice, or not at all.    Actually, if you have a graphing calculator this technique can be used to find solutions to any equation, not just quadratics. All you need to do is   Move all the terms to one side, so that it is equal to zero Set the resulting expression equal to y (in place of zero) Enter the function into your calculator and graph it Look for places where the graph crosses the x-axis   Your graphing calculator most likely has a function that will automatically find these intercepts and give you the x-values with great precision. Of course, no matter how many decimal places you have it is still just an approximation of the exact solution. In real life, though, a close approximation is often good enough.
