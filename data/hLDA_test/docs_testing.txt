For example, {red, green, blue} is a set of colors. A subset A set consisting of elements that belong to a given set. is a set consisting of elements that belong to a given set. For example, {green, blue} is a subset of the color set above. A set with no elements is called the empty set A subset with no elements, denoted ∅ or { }. and has its own special notation, { } or ∅. When studying mathematics, we focus on special sets of numbers. The set of natural (or counting) numbers The set of counting numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …}. , denoted N, is The three periods (…) is called an ellipsis and indicates that the numbers continue without bound. The set of whole numbers The set of natural numbers combined with zero {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …}. , denoted W , is the set of natural numbers combined with zero. The set of integers The set of positive and negative whole numbers combined with zero {…, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …}. , denoted Z, consists of both positive and negative whole numbers, as well as zero. Notice that the sets of natural and whole numbers are both subsets of the set of integers. Rational numbers Numbers of the form a b , where a and b are integers and b is nonzero. , denoted Q, are defined as any number of the form a b , where a and b are integers and b is nonzero. Decimals that repeat or terminate are rational. For example, The set of integers is a subset of the set of rational numbers because every integer can be expressed as a ratio of the integer and 1. In other words, any integer can be written over 1 and can be considered a rational number. For example, Irrational numbers Numbers that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers. are defined as any number that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers. Nonterminating decimals that do not repeat are irrational. For example, The set of real numbers The set of all rational and irrational numbers. , denoted R, is defined as the set of all rational numbers combined with the set of all irrational numbers. Therefore, all the numbers defined so far are subsets of the set of real numbers. In summary, 
book2_chapter1_1_2	no label	Number Line Number Line A real number line A line that allows us to visually represent real numbers by associating them with points on the line. , or simply number line, allows us to visually display real numbers by associating them with unique points on a line. The real number associated with a point is called a coordinate The real number associated with a point on a number line. . A point on the real number line that is associated with a coordinate is called its graph A point on the number line associated with a coordinate. . To construct a number line, draw a horizontal line with arrows on both ends to indicate that it continues without bound. Next, choose any point to represent the number zero; this point is called the origin The point on the number line that represtents zero. . Mark off consistent lengths on both sides of the origin and label each tick mark to define the scale. Positive real numbers lie to the right of the origin and negative real numbers lie to the left. The number zero (0) is neither positive nor negative. Typically, each tick represents one unit. As illustrated below, the scale need not always be one unit. In the first number line, each tick mark represents two units. In the second, each tick mark represents 1 7 . The graph of each real number is shown as a dot at the appropriate point on the number line. A partial graph of the set of integers Z follows:   Example 1: Graph the following set of real numbers: { − 1 ,   − 1 3 ,   0 ,   5 3 } . Solution: Graph the numbers on a number line with a scale where each tick mark represents 1 3 unit. 
book2_chapter1_1_3	no label	Ordering Real Numbers Ordering Real Numbers When comparing real numbers on a number line, the larger number will always lie to the right of the smaller one. It is clear that 15 is greater than 5, but it may not be so clear to see that −1 is greater than −5 until we graph each number on a number line. We use symbols to help us efficiently communicate relationships between numbers on the number line. The symbols used to describe an equality relationship Express equality with the symbol =. If two quantities are not equal, use the symbol ≠ . between numbers follow: These symbols are used and interpreted in the following manner: We next define symbols that denote an order relationship between real numbers. These symbols allow us to compare two numbers. For example, Since the graph of −120 is to the left of the graph of –10 on the number line, that number is less than −10. We could write an equivalent statement as follows: Similarly, since the graph of zero is to the right of the graph of any negative number on the number line, zero is greater than any negative number. The symbols < and > are used to denote strict inequalities Express ordering relationships using the symbol < for “less than” and > for “greater than.” , and the symbols ≤ and ≥ are used to denote inclusive inequalities Use the symbol ≤ to express quantities that are “less than or equal to” and ≥ for quantities that are “greater than or equal to” each other. . In some situations, more than one symbol can be correctly applied. For example, the following two statements are both true: In addition, the “or equal to” component of an inclusive inequality allows us to correctly write the following: The logical use of the word “or” requires that only one of the conditions need be true: the “less than” or the “equal to.”   Example 2: Fill in the blank with <, =, or >: −2 ____ −12. Solution: Use > because the graph of −2 is to the right of the graph of −12 on a number line. Therefore, −2 > −12, which reads “negative two is greater than negative twelve.” Answer: −2 > −12   In this text, we will often point out the equivalent notation used to express mathematical quantities electronically using the standard symbols available on a keyboard. We begin with the equivalent textual notation for inequalities: Many calculators, computer algebra systems, and programming languages use this notation. 
book2_chapter1_1_4	no label	Opposites Opposites The opposite Real numbers whose graphs are on opposite sides of the origin with the same distance to the origin. of any real number a is −a. Opposite real numbers are the same distance from the origin on a number line, but their graphs lie on opposite sides of the origin and the numbers have opposite signs. For example, we say that the opposite of 10 is −10. Next, consider the opposite of a negative number. Given the integer −7, the integer the same distance from the origin and with the opposite sign is +7, or just 7. Therefore, we say that the opposite of −7 is −(−7) = 7. This idea leads to what is often referred to as the double-negative property The opposite of a negative number is positive: −(−a) = a. . For any real number a,   Example 3: What is the opposite of − 3 4 ? Solution: Here we apply the double-negative property. Answer: 3 4   Example 4: Simplify: − ( − ( 4 ) ) . Solution: Start with the innermost parentheses by finding the opposite of +4. Answer: 4   Example 5: Simplify: − ( − ( − 2 ) ) . Solution: Apply the double-negative property starting with the innermost parentheses. Answer: −2 Tip If there is an even number of consecutive negative signs, then the result is positive. If there is an odd number of consecutive negative signs, then the result is negative.   Try this! Simplify: − ( − ( − ( 5 ) ) ) . Answer: −5 
book2_chapter1_1_5	no label	Absolute Value Absolute Value The absolute value The absolute value of a number is the distance from the graph of the number to zero on a number line. of a real number a, denoted | a | , is defined as the distance between zero (the origin) and the graph of that real number on the number line. Since it is a distance, it is always positive. For example, Both 4 and −4 are four units from the origin, as illustrated below:   Example 6: Simplify: a. | − 12 | b. | 12 | Solution: Both −12 and 12 are twelve units from the origin on a number line. Therefore, Answers: a. 12; b. 12   Also, it is worth noting that The absolute value can be expressed textually using the notation abs(a). We often encounter negative absolute values, such as − | 3 | or −abs(3). Notice that the negative sign is in front of the absolute value symbol. In this case, work the absolute value first and then find the opposite of the result. Try not to confuse this with the double-negative property, which states that − ( − 7 ) = + 7 .   Example 7: Simplify: − | − ( − 7 ) | . Solution: First, find the opposite of −7 inside the absolute value. Then find the opposite of the result. Answer: −7   At this point, we can determine what real numbers have a particular absolute value. For example, Think of a real number whose distance to the origin is 5 units. There are two solutions: the distance to the right of the origin and the distance to the left of the origin, namely, { ± 5 } . The symbol (±) is read “plus or minus” and indicates that there are two answers, one positive and one negative. Now consider the following: Here we wish to find a value for which the distance to the origin is negative. Since negative distance is not defined, this equation has no solution. If an equation has no solution, we say the solution is the empty set: Ø. 
book2_chapter1_2_1	no label	Addition and Subtraction (+, −) Addition and Subtraction (+, −) Visualize adding 3 + 2 on the number line by moving from zero three units to the right then another two units to the right, as illustrated below: The illustration shows that 3 + 2 = 5. Similarly, visualize adding two negative numbers (−3) + (−2) by first moving from the origin three units to the left and then moving another two units to the left. In this example, the illustration shows (−3) + (−2) = −5, which leads to the following two properties of real numbers. Next, we will explore addition of numbers with unlike signs. To add 3 + (−7), first move from the origin three units to the right, then move seven units to the left as shown: In this case, we can see that adding a negative number is equivalent to subtraction: It is tempting to say that a positive number plus a negative number is negative, but that is not always true: 7 + ( − 3 ) = 7 − 3 = 4 . The result of adding numbers with unlike signs may be positive or negative. The sign of the result is the same as the sign of the number with the greatest distance from the origin. For example, the following results depend on the sign of the number 12 because it is farther from zero than 5:   Example 1: Simplify: 14 + ( − 25 ) . Solution: Here −25 is the greater distance from the origin. Therefore, the result is negative. Answer: −11   Given any real numbers a, b, and c, we have the following properties of addition: Additive identity property Given any real number a, a + 0 = 0 + a = a   . : a + 0 = 0 + a = a Additive inverse property Given any real number a, a + ( − a ) = ( − a ) + a = 0 . : a + ( − a ) = ( − a ) + a = 0 Associative property Given real numbers a, b and c, ( a + b ) + c = a + ( b + c ) . : ( a + b ) + c = a + ( b + c ) Commutative property Given real numbers a and b, a + b = b + a . : a + b = b + a   Example 2: Simplify: a. 5 + 0 b. 10 + ( − 10 ) Solution: a. Adding zero to any real number results in the same real number. b. Adding opposites results in zero. Answers: a. 5; b. 0   Example 3: Simplify: a. ( 3 + 7 ) + 4 b. 3 + ( 7 + 4 ) Solution: Parentheses group the operations that are to be performed first. a. b. These two examples both result in 14: changing the grouping of the numbers does not change the result. Answers: a. 14; b. 14   At this point, we highlight the fact that addition is commutative: the order in which we add does not matter and yields the same result. On the other hand, subtraction is not commutative. We will use these properties, along with the double-negative property for real numbers, to perform more involved sequential operations. To simplify things, we will make it a general rule to first replace all sequential operations with either addition or subtraction and then perform each operation in order from left to right.   Example 4: Simplify: 4 − ( − 10 ) + ( − 5 ) . Solution: Replace the sequential operations and then perform them from left to right. Answer: 9   Example 5: Simplify: − 3 + ( − 8 ) − ( − 7 ) . Solution: Answer: −4   Try this! Simplify: 12 − ( − 9 ) + ( − 6 ) . Answer: 15 Often we find the need to translate English sentences involving addition and subtraction to mathematical statements. Listed below are some key words that translate to the given operation. Key Words Operation Sum, increased by, more than, plus, added to, total + Difference, decreased by, subtracted from, less, minus −   Example 6: What is the difference of 7 and −3? Solution: The key word “difference” implies that we should subtract the numbers. Answer: The difference of 7 and −3 is 10.   Example 7: What is the sum of the first five positive integers? Solution: The initial key word to focus on is “sum”; this means that we will be adding the five numbers. The first five positive integers are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Recall that 0 is neither positive nor negative. Answer: The sum of the first five positive integers is 15.   Example 8: What is 10 subtracted from the sum of 8 and 6? Solution: We know that subtraction is not commutative; therefore, we must take care to subtract in the correct order. First, add 8 and 6 and then subtract 10 as follows: It is important to notice that the phrase “10 subtracted from” does not translate to a mathematical statement in the order it appears. In other words, 10 − ( 8 + 6 ) would be an incorrect translation and leads to an incorrect answer. After translating the sentence, perform the operations. Answer: Ten subtracted from the sum of 8 and 6 is 4. 
book2_chapter1_2_2	no label	Distance on a Number Line Distance on a Number Line One application of the absolute value is to find the distance between any two points on a number line. For real numbers a and b, the distance formula for a number line The distance between any two real numbers a and b on a number line can be calculated using the formula d = | b − a | . is given as,   Example 9: Determine the distance between 2 and 7 on a number line. Solution: On the graph we see that the distance between the two given integers is 5 units. Using the distance formula we obtain the same result. Answer: 5 units   Example 10: Determine the distance between −4 and 7 on a number line. Solution: Use the distance formula for a number line d = | b − a | , where a = − 4 and b = 7 . Answer: 11 units   It turns out that it does not matter which points are used for a and b; the absolute value always ensures a positive result. Using a = −4 and b = 7 Using a = 7 and b = −4 d = | 7 − ( − 4 ) | = | 7 + 4 | = | 11 | = 11 d = | − 4 − 7 | = | − 11 | = 11   Try this! Determine the distance between −12 and −9 on the number line. Answer: 3 
book2_chapter1_3_1	no label	Multiplication and Division Multiplication and Division We begin with a review of what it means to multiply and divide signed numbers. The result of multiplying real numbers is called the product The result of multiplying. and the result of dividing is called the quotient The result after dividing. . Recall that multiplication is equivalent to adding: Clearly, the product of two positive numbers is positive. Similarly, the product of a positive number and negative number can be written as shown: We see that the product of a positive number and a negative number is negative. Next, explore the results of multiplying two negative numbers. Consider the products in the following illustration and try to identify the pattern: This shows that the product of two negative numbers is positive. To summarize, The rules for division are the same because division can always be rewritten as multiplication: The rules for multiplication and division should not be confused with the fact that the sum of two negative numbers is negative.   Example 1: Simplify: a. ( − 3 ) + ( − 5 ) b. ( − 3 ) ( − 5 ) Solution: Here we add and multiply the same two negative numbers. a. The result of adding two negative numbers is negative. b. The result of multiplying two negative numbers is positive. Answers: a. −8; b. 15   Given any real numbers a, b, and c, we have the following properties of multiplication: Zero factor property Given any real number a, a ⋅ 0 = 0 ⋅ a = 0 . : a ⋅ 0 = 0 ⋅ a = 0 Multiplicative identity property Given any real number a, a ⋅ 1 = 1 ⋅ a = a . : a ⋅ 1 = 1 ⋅ a = a Associative property Given any real numbers a, b, and c, ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c = a ⋅ ( b ⋅ c ) . : ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c = a ⋅ ( b ⋅ c ) Commutative property Given any real numbers a and b, a ⋅ b = b ⋅ a . : a ⋅ b = b ⋅ a   Example 2: Simplify: a. 5 ⋅ 0 b. 10 ⋅ 1 Solution: a. Multiplying by zero results in zero. b. Multiplying any real number by one results in the same real number. Answers: a. 0; b. 10   Example 3: Simplify: a. ( 3 ⋅ 7 ) ⋅ 2 b. 3 ⋅ ( 7 ⋅ 2 ) Solution: a. b. The value of each expression is 42. Changing the grouping of the numbers does not change the result. Answers: a. 42; b. 42   At this point, we highlight that multiplication is commutative: the order in which we multiply does not matter and yields the same result. On the other hand, division is not commutative. Use these properties to perform sequential operations involving multiplication and division. When doing so, it is important to perform these operations in order from left to right.   Example 4: Simplify: 3 ( − 2 ) ( − 5 ) ( − 1 ) . Solution: Multiply two numbers at a time as follows: Answer: −30   Because multiplication is commutative, the order in which we multiply does not affect the final answer. When sequential operations involve multiplication and division, order does matter; hence we must work the operations from left to right to obtain a correct result.   Example 5: Simplify: 10 ÷ ( − 2 ) ( − 5 ) . Solution: Perform the division first; otherwise, the result will be incorrect. Answer: 25   Notice that the order in which we multiply and divide does affect the final result. Therefore, it is important to perform the operations of multiplication and division as they appear from left to right.   Example 6: Simplify: − 6 ( 3 ) ÷ ( − 2 ) ( − 3 ) . Solution: Work the operations one at a time from left to right.   Try this! Simplify: − 5 ÷ 5 ⋅ 2 ( − 3 ) . Answer: 6 Within text-based applications, the symbol used for multiplication is the asterisk The symbol (*) that indicates multiplication within text-based applications. (*) and the symbol used for division is the forward slash (/). The set of even integers Integers that are divisible by two or are multiples of two. is the set of all integers that are evenly divisible by 2. We can also obtain the set of even integers by multiplying each integer by 2. The set of odd integers Integers that are not divisible by 2. is the set of all integers that are not evenly divisible by 2. A prime number Integers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and itself. is an integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. The smallest prime number is 2 and the rest are necessarily odd. Any integer greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number Integers greater than 1 that are not prime. and can be written as a product of primes. When a composite number, such as 30, is written as a product, 30 = 2 ⋅ 15 , we say that 2 ⋅ 15 is a factorization Any combination of factors, multiplied together, resulting in the product. of 30 and that 2 and 15 are factors Any of the numbers or expressions that form a product. . Note that factors divide the number evenly. We can continue to write composite factors as products until only a product of primes remains. The prime factorization The unique factorization of a natural number written as a product of primes. of 30 is 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 .   Example 7: Determine the prime factorization of 70. Solution: Begin by writing 70 as a product with 2 as a factor. Then express any composite factor as a product of prime numbers. Since the prime factorization is unique, it does not matter how we choose to initially factor the number because the end result is the same. Answer: The prime factorization of 70 is 2 ⋅ 5 ⋅ 7 .   Some tests (called divisibility tests) useful for finding prime factors of composite numbers follow: If the integer is even, then 2 is a factor. If the sum of the digits is evenly divisible by 3, then 3 is a factor. If the last digit is a 5 or 0, then 5 is a factor. Often we find the need to translate English sentences that include multiplication and division terms to mathematical statements. Listed below are some key words that translate to the given operation. Key Words Operation Product, multiplied by, of, times * or ⋅ Quotient, divided by, ratio, per / or ÷   Example 8: Calculate the quotient of 20 and −10. Solution: The key word “quotient” implies that we should divide. Answer: The quotient of 20 and −10 is −2.   Example 9: What is the product of the first three positive even integers? Solution: The first three positive even integers are {2, 4, 6} and the key word “product” implies that we should multiply. Answer: The product of the first three positive even integers is 48.   Example 10: Joe is able to drive 342 miles on 18 gallons of gasoline. How many miles per gallon of gas is this? Solution: The key word “per” indicates that we must divide the number of miles driven by the number of gallons used: Answer: Joe gets 19 miles per gallon from his vehicle.   In everyday life, we often wish to use a single value that typifies a set of values. One way to do this is to use what is called the arithmetic mean A numerical value that typifies a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding up the numbers in the set and dividing by the number of elements in the set. or average Used in reference to the arithmetic mean. . To calculate an average, divide the sum of the values in the set by the number of values in that set.   Example 11: A student earns 75, 86, and 94 on his first three exams. What is the student’s test average? Solution: Add the scores and divide the sum by 3. Answer: The student’s test average is 85. 
book2_chapter1_3_2	no label	Zero and Division Zero and Division Recall the relationship between multiplication and division: In this case, the dividend The numerator of a quotient. 12 is evenly divided by the divisor The denominator of a quotient. 6 to obtain the quotient, 2. It is true in general that if we multiply the divisor by the quotient we obtain the dividend. Now consider the case where the dividend is zero and the divisor is nonzero: This demonstrates that zero divided by any nonzero real number must be zero. Now consider a nonzero number divided by zero: The zero-factor property of multiplication states that any real number times 0 is 0. We conclude that there is no real number such that 0 ⋅ ? = 12 and thus, the quotient is left undefined A quotient such as 5 0 , which is left without meaning and is not assigned an interpretation. . Try 12 ÷ 0 on a calculator. What does it say? For our purposes, we will simply write “undefined.” To summarize, given any real number a ≠ 0 , then We are left to consider the case where the dividend and divisor are both zero. Here any real number seems to work. For example, 0 ⋅ 5 = 0 and 0 ⋅ 3 = 0 . Therefore, the quotient is uncertain or indeterminate A quotient such as 0 0 , which is a quantity that is uncertain or ambiguous. . In this course, we state that 0 ÷ 0 is undefined. 
book2_chapter1_4_1	no label	Reducing Reducing A fraction A rational number written as a quotient of two integers: a b , where b is nonzero. is a real number written as a quotient, or ratio Relationship between two numbers or quantities usually expressed as a quotient. , of two integers a and b, where b ≠ 0 . The integer above the fraction bar is called the numerator The number above the fraction bar. and the integer below is called the denominator The number below the fraction bar. . The numerator is often called the “part” and the denominator is often called the “whole.” Equivalent fractions Two equal fractions expressed using different numerators and denominators. are two equal ratios expressed using different numerators and denominators. For example, Fifty parts out of 100 is the same ratio as 1 part out of 2 and represents the same real number. Consider the following factorizations of 50 and 100: The numbers 50 and 100 share the factor 25. A shared factor is called a common factor A factor that is shared by more than one real number. . We can rewrite the ratio 50 100 as follows: Making use of the multiplicative identity property and the fact that 25 25 = 1 , we have Dividing 25 25 and replacing this factor with a 1 is called canceling The process of dividing out common factors in the numerator and the denominator. . Together, these basic steps for finding equivalent fractions define the process of reducing The process of finding equivalent fractions by dividing the numerator and the denominator by common factors. . Since factors divide their product evenly, we achieve the same result by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 25 as follows: Finding equivalent fractions where the numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1 is called reducing to lowest terms Finding equivalent fractions where the numerator and the denominator share no common integer factor other than 1. . When learning how to reduce to lowest terms, it is helpful to first rewrite the numerator and denominator as a product of primes and then cancel. For example, We achieve the same result by dividing the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor (GCF) The largest shared factor of any number of integers. . The GCF is the largest number that divides both the numerator and denominator evenly. One way to find the GCF of 50 and 100 is to list all the factors of each and identify the largest number that appears in both lists. Remember, each number is also a factor of itself. Common factors are listed in bold, and we see that the greatest common factor is 50. We use the following notation to indicate the GCF of two numbers: GCF(50, 100) = 50. After determining the GCF, reduce by dividing both the numerator and the denominator as follows:   Example 1: Reduce to lowest terms: 105 300 . Solution: Rewrite the numerator and denominator as a product of primes and then cancel. Alternatively, we achieve the same result if we divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF(105, 300). A quick way to find the GCF of the two numbers requires us to first write each as a product of primes. The GCF is the product of all the common prime factors. In this case, the common prime factors are 3 and 5 and the greatest common factor of 105 and 300 is 15. Answer: 7 20   Try this! Reduce to lowest terms: 32 96 . Answer: 1 3 An improper fraction A fraction where the numerator is larger than the denominator. is one where the numerator is larger than the denominator. A mixed number A number that represents the sum of a whole number and a fraction. is a number that represents the sum of a whole number and a fraction. For example, 5   1 2 is a mixed number that represents the sum 5 + 1 2 . Use long division to convert an improper fraction to a mixed number; the remainder is the numerator of the fractional part.   Example 2: Write 23 5 as a mixed number. Solution: Notice that 5 divides into 23 four times with a remainder of 3. We then can write Note that the denominator of the fractional part of the mixed number remains the same as the denominator of the original fraction. Answer: 4 3 5   To convert mixed numbers to improper fractions, multiply the whole number by the denominator and then add the numerator; write this result over the original denominator.   Example 3: Write 3 5 7 as an improper fraction. Solution: Obtain the numerator by multiplying 7 times 3 and then add 5. Answer: 26 7   It is important to note that converting to a mixed number is not part of the reducing process. We consider improper fractions, such as 26 7 , to be reduced to lowest terms. In algebra it is often preferable to work with improper fractions, although in some applications, mixed numbers are more appropriate.   Try this! Convert 10 1 2 to an improper fraction. Answer: 21 2 
book2_chapter1_4_2	no label	Multiplying and Dividing Fractions Multiplying and Dividing Fractions In this section, assume that a, b, c, and d are all nonzero integers. The product of two fractions is the fraction formed by the product of the numerators and the product of the denominators. In other words, to multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:   Example 4: Multiply: 2 3 ⋅ 5 7 . Solution: Multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. Answer: 10 21   Example 5: Multiply: 5 9 ( − 1 4 ) . Solution: Recall that the product of a positive number and a negative number is negative. Answer: − 5 36   Example 6: Multiply: 2 3 ⋅ 5 3 4 . Solution: Begin by converting 5 3 4 to an improper fraction. In this example, we noticed that we could reduce before we multiplied the numerators and the denominators. Reducing in this way is called cross canceling Cancelling common factors in the numerator and the denominator of fractions before multiplying. , and can save time when multiplying fractions. Answer: 3 5 6   Two real numbers whose product is 1 are called reciprocals The reciprocal of a nonzero number n is 1/n. . Therefore, a b and b a are reciprocals because a b ⋅ b a = a b a b = 1 . For example, Because their product is 1, 2 3 and 3 2 are reciprocals. Some other reciprocals are listed below: This definition is important because dividing fractions requires that you multiply the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor.   Example 7: Divide: 2 3 ÷ 5 7 . Solution: Multiply 2 3 by the reciprocal of 5 7 . Answer: 14 15   You also need to be aware of other forms of notation that indicate division: / and —. For example, Or The latter is an example of a complex fraction A fraction where the numerator or denominator consists of one or more fractions. , which is a fraction whose numerator, denominator, or both are fractions. Note Students often ask why dividing is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor. A mathematical explanation comes from the fact that the product of reciprocals is 1. If we apply the multiplicative identity property and multiply numerator and denominator by the reciprocal of the denominator, then we obtain the following: Before multiplying, look for common factors to cancel; this eliminates the need to reduce the end result.   Example 8: Divide:   5 2   7 4 . Solution: Answer: 10 7   When dividing by an integer, it is helpful to rewrite it as a fraction over 1.   Example 9: Divide: 2 3 ÷ 6 . Solution: Rewrite 6 as 6 1 and multiply by its reciprocal. Answer: 1 9   Also, note that we only cancel when working with multiplication. Rewrite any division problem as a product before canceling.   Try this! Divide: 5 ÷ 2 3 5 . Answer: 1 12 13

All such forms are equivalent and interchangeable. Adding or subtracting fractions requires a common denominator A denominator that is shared by more than one fraction. . In this section, assume the common denominator c is a nonzero integer. It is good practice to use positive common denominators by expressing negative fractions with negative numerators. In short, avoid negative denominators.   Example 10: Subtract: 12 15 − 3 15 . Solution: The two fractions have a common denominator 15. Therefore, subtract the numerators and write the result over the common denominator: Answer: 3 5   Most problems that you are likely to encounter will have unlike denominators Denominators of fractions that are not the same. . In this case, first find equivalent fractions with a common denominator before adding or subtracting the numerators. One way to obtain equivalent fractions is to divide the numerator and the denominator by the same number. We now review a technique for finding equivalent fractions by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number. It should be clear that 5/5 is equal to 1 and that 1 multiplied times any number is that number: We have equivalent fractions 1 2 = 5 10 . Use this idea to find equivalent fractions with a common denominator to add or subtract fractions. The steps are outlined in the following example.   Example 11: Subtract: 7 15 − 3 10 . Solution: Step 1: Determine a common denominator. To do this, use the least common multiple (LCM) The smallest number that is evenly divisible by a set of numbers. of the given denominators. The LCM of 15 and 10 is indicated by LCM(15, 10). Try to think of the smallest number that both denominators divide into evenly. List the multiples of each number: Common multiples are listed in bold, and the least common multiple is 30. Step 2: Multiply the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by values that result in equivalent fractions with the determined common denominator. Step 3: Add or subtract the numerators, write the result over the common denominator and then reduce if possible. Answer: 1 6   The least common multiple of the denominators is called the least common denominator (LCD) The least common multiple of a set of denominators. . Finding the LCD is often the difficult step. It is worth finding because if any common multiple other than the least is used, then there will be more steps involved when reducing.   Example 12: Add: 5 10 + 1 18 . Solution: First, determine that the LCM(10, 18) is 90 and then find equivalent fractions with 90 as the denominator. Answer: 5 9   Try this! Add: 2 30 + 5 21 . Answer: 32 105   Example 13: Simplify: 2 1 3 + 3 5 − 1 2 . Solution: Begin by converting 2 1 3 to an improper fraction. Answer: 2 13 30   In general, it is preferable to work with improper fractions. However, when the original problem involves mixed numbers, if appropriate, present your answers as mixed numbers. Also, mixed numbers are often preferred when working with numbers on a number line and with real-world applications.   Try this! Subtract: 5 7 − 2 1 7 . Answer: − 1 3 7   Example 14: How many 1 2 inch thick paperback books can be stacked to fit on a shelf that is 1 1 2 feet in height? Solution: First, determine the height of the shelf in inches. To do this, use the fact that there are 12 inches in 1 foot and multiply as follows: Next, determine how many notebooks will fit by dividing the height of the shelf by the thickness of each book. Answer: 36 books can be stacked on the shelf. 
book2_chapter1_5_1	no label	Decimals Decimals In this section, we provide a brief review of the decimal system. A real number in decimal form, a decimal A real number expressed using the decimal system. consists of a decimal point, digits (0 through 9) to the left of the decimal point representing the whole number part, and digits to the right of the decimal point representing the fractional part. The digits represent powers of 10 as shown in the set {…, 1,000, 100, 10, 1, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1,000, …} according to the following diagram: For example, the decimal 538.3 can be written in the following expanded form: After simplifying, we obtain the mixed number 538 3 10 . Use this process to convert decimals to mixed numbers.   Example 1: Write as a mixed number: 32.15. Solution: In this example, 32 is the whole part and the decimal ends in the hundredths place. Therefore, the fractional part will be 15/100, and we can write Answer: 32.15 = 32 3 20   To convert fractions to decimal equivalents, divide.   Example 2: Write as a decimal: 3 4 . Solution: Use long division to convert to a decimal. Answer: 3 4 = 0.75   If the division never ends, then use a bar over the repeating digit (or block of digits) to indicate a repeating decimal.   Example 3: Write as a decimal: 2 5 6 . Solution: Use long division to convert the fractional part to a decimal and then add the whole part. At this point, we can see that the long division will continue to repeat. When this is the case, use a bar over the repeating digit to indicate that it continues forever: Then write Answer: 2 5 6 = 2.8 3 ¯   To add or subtract decimals, align them vertically with the decimal point and add corresponding place values. Recall that sometimes you need to borrow from or carry over to the adjoining column (regrouping).   Example 4: Subtract: 54.328 − 23.25 . Solution: Note that trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point do not change the value of the decimal, 23.25 = 23.250. In this case, you need to borrow from the tenths place (regroup) to subtract the digits in the hundredths place. Answer: 31.078   Multiply decimals the same way you multiply whole numbers. The number of decimal places in the product will be the sum of the decimal places found in each of the factors.   Example 5: Multiply: 5.36 × 7.4 . Solution: The total number of decimal places of the two factors is 2 + 1 = 3. Therefore, the result has 3 decimal places. Answer: 39.664   When dividing decimals, move the decimal points of both the dividend and the divisor so that the divisor is a whole number. Remember to move the decimal the same number of places for both the dividend and divisor.   Example 6: Divide: 33.3216 ÷ 6.24 . Solution: Move the decimal point to turn the divisor into a whole number: 624. Move the decimal points of both the divisor and dividend two places to the right. Next, divide. Answer: 5.34   It is often necessary to round off A means of approximating decimals with a specified number of significant digits. decimals to a specified number of decimal places. Rounding off allows us to approximate decimals with fewer significant digits. To do this, look at the digit to the right of the specified place value. If the digit to the right of the specified place is 4 or less, then leave the specified digit unchanged and drop all subsequent digits. If the digit to the right of the specified place is 5 or greater, then increase the value of the digit in the specified place by 1 and drop all subsequent digits. Recall that decimals with trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point can be dropped. For example, round 5.635457 to the nearest thousandth: Round the same number 5.635457 to the nearest hundredth: After rounding off, be sure to use the appropriate notation ( ≈ ) to indicate that the number is now an approximation. When working with US currency, we typically round off to two decimal places, or the nearest hundredth.   Example 7: Calculate and round off to the nearest hundredth. a. 1/3 of $10.25. b. 1/4 of $10.25. Solution: In this context, the key word “of” indicates that we should multiply. a. Multiplying by 1 3 is equivalent to dividing by 3. b. Multiplying by 1 4 is equivalent to dividing by 4. Answers: a. $3.42; b. $2.56 
book2_chapter1_5_2	no label	Definition of Percent Definition of Percent A percent A representation of a number as part of 100: N % = N 100 . is a representation of a number as a part of one hundred. The word “percent” can be written “per cent” which means “per 100” or “/100.” We use the symbol ( % ) to denote a percentage: For example, Percents are an important part of our everyday life and show up often in our study of algebra. Percents can be visualized using a pie chart A circular graph divided into sectors whose area is proportional to the relative size of the ratio of the part to the total. (or circle graph), where each sector gives a visual representation of a percentage of the whole. For example, the following pie chart shows the percentage of students in certain age categories of all US community colleges. Source: American Association of Community Colleges. Each sector is proportional to the size of the part out of the whole. The sum of the percentages presented in a pie chart must be 100%. To work with percentages effectively, you have to know how to convert percents to decimals or fractions and back again.

Solution: First, convert the decimal to a fraction of 100 and apply the definition. You can achieve the same result by moving the decimal two places to the right and adding a percent sign. Answer: 23%.   Alternatively, you can multiply by 1 in the form of 100%.   Example 11: Convert 2.35 to a percent. Solution: Recall that 1 = 100%. You can achieve the same result by moving the decimal two places to the right and adding a percent sign. Answer: 235%   Example 12: Convert 5 1 5 to a percent. Solution: Answer: 520%   Sometimes we can use the definition of percent and find an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100.   Example 13: Convert 13 25 to a percent. Solution: Notice that the denominator 25 is a factor of 100. Use the definition of percent by finding an equivalent fraction with 100 in the denominator. Answer: 52%   This is a very specialized technique because 100 may not be a multiple of the denominator.   Example 14: Convert 1 3 to a percent. Solution: Notice that the denominator 3 is not a factor of 100. In this case, it is best to multiply by 1 in the form of 100%. Answer: 33 1 3 %   Try this! Convert to a percent: 2 3 .

book2_chapter1_6_1	no label	Exponential Notation and Positive Integer Exponents Exponential Notation and Positive Integer Exponents If a number is repeated as a factor numerous times, then we can write the product in a more compact form using exponential notation The compact notation a x 2 + b x + c = 0. used when a factor is repeated multiple times. . For example, The base The factor a in the exponential notation a n . is the factor, and the positive integer exponent The positive integer n in the exponential notation a n that indicates the number of times the base is used as a factor. indicates the number of times the base is repeated as a factor. In the above example, the base is 5 and the exponent is 4. In general, if a is the base that is repeated as a factor n times, then When the exponent is 2, we call the result a square The result when the exponent of any real number is 2. . For example, The number 3 is the base and the integer 2 is the exponent. The notation 3 2 can be read two ways: “three squared” or “3 raised to the second power.” The base can be any real number. It is important to study the difference between the ways the last two examples are calculated. In the example ( − 7 ) 2 , the base is −7 as indicated by the parentheses. In the example − 5 2 , the base is 5, not −5, so only the 5 is squared and the result remains negative. To illustrate this, write This subtle distinction is very important because it determines the sign of the result. The textual notation for exponents is usually denoted using the caret The symbol ^ that indicates exponents on many calculators, a n = a ^ n . (^) symbol as follows: The square of an integer is called a perfect square The result of squaring an integer. . The ability to recognize perfect squares is useful in our study of algebra. The squares of the integers from 1 to 15 should be memorized. A partial list of perfect squares follows:   Try this! Simplify ( − 12 ) 2 . Answer: 144 When the exponent is 3 we call the result a cube The result when the exponent of any real number is 3. . For example, The notation 3 3 can be read two ways: “three cubed” or “3 raised to the third power.” As before, the base can be any real number. Note that the result of cubing a negative number is negative. The cube of an integer is called a perfect cube The result of cubing an integer. . The ability to recognize perfect cubes is useful in our study of algebra. The cubes of the integers from 1 to 10 should be memorized. A partial list of perfect cubes follows:   Try this! Simplify ( − 2 ) 3 . Answer: −8 If the exponent is greater than 3, then the notation a n is read “a raised to the nth power.” Notice that the result of a negative base with an even exponent is positive. The result of a negative base with an odd exponent is negative. These facts are often confused when negative numbers are involved. Study the following four examples carefully: The base is (−2) The base is 2 ( − 2 ) 4 = ( − 2 ) ⋅ ( − 2 ) ⋅ ( − 2 ) ⋅ ( − 2 ) = + 16 ( − 2 ) 3 = ( − 2 ) ⋅ ( − 2 ) ⋅ ( − 2 ) = − 8 − 2 4 = − 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = − 16 − 2 3 = − 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = − 8 The parentheses indicate that the negative number is to be used as the base.   Example 1: Calculate: a.

book2_chapter1_6_2	no label	Square Root of a Real Number Square Root of a Real Number Think of finding the square root The number that, when multiplied by itself, yields the original number. of a number as the inverse of squaring a number. In other words, to determine the square root of 25 the question is, “What number squared equals 25?” Actually, there are two answers to this question, 5 and −5. When asked for the square root of a number, we implicitly mean the principal (nonnegative) square root The non-negative square root. . Therefore we have, As an example, 25 − − √ = 5 , which is read “square root of 25 equals 5.” The symbol √ is called the radical sign The symbol √ used to denote a square root. and 25 is called the radicand The expression a within a radical sign, a √ n . . The alternative textual notation for square roots follows: It is also worthwhile to note that This is the case because 1 2 = 1 and 0 2 = 0 .   Example 2: Simplify: 10,000 − − − − − √ . Solution: 10,000 is a perfect square because 100 ⋅ 100 = 10,000 . Answer: 100   Example 3: Simplify: 1 9 − − √ . Solution: Here we notice that 1 9 is a square because 1 3 ⋅ 1 3 = 1 9 . Answer: 1 3   Given a and b as positive real numbers, use the following property to simplify square roots whose radicands are not squares: The idea is to identify the largest square factor of the radicand and then apply the property shown above. As an example, to simplify 8 √ notice that 8 is not a perfect square. However, 8 = 4 ⋅ 2 and thus has a perfect square factor other than 1. Apply the property as follows: Here 2 2 √ is a simplified irrational number. You are often asked to find an approximate answer rounded off to a certain decimal place. In that case, use a calculator to find the decimal approximation using either the original problem or the simplified equivalent. On a calculator, try 2.83^2. What do you expect? Why is the answer not what you would expect? It is important to mention that the radicand must be positive. For example, − 9 − − − √ is undefined since there is no real number that when squared is negative. Try taking the square root of a negative number on your calculator. What does it say? Note: taking the square root of a negative number is defined later in the course.   Example 4: Simplify and give an approximate answer rounded to the nearest hundredth: 75 − − √ . Solution: The radicand 75 can be factored as 25 ⋅ 3 where the factor 25 is a perfect square. Answer: 75 − − √ ≈ 8.66   As a check, calculate 75 − − √ and 5 3 √ on a calculator and verify that the both results are approximately 8.66.   Example 5: Simplify: 180 − − − √ .

A right triangle A triangle with an angle that measures 90°. is a triangle where one of the angles measures 90°. The side opposite the right angle is the longest side, called the hypotenuse The longest side of a right triangle, it will always be the side opposite the right angle. , and the other two sides are called legs The sides of a right triangle that are not the hypotenuse. . Numerous real-world applications involve this geometric figure. The Pythagorean theorem Given any right triangle with legs measuring a and b units and hypotenuse measuring c units, then a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . states that given any right triangle with legs measuring a and b units, the square of the measure of the hypotenuse c is equal to the sum of the squares of the measures of the legs: a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . In other words, the hypotenuse of any right triangle is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its legs.   Example 6: If the two legs of a right triangle measure 3 units and 4 units, then find the length of the hypotenuse. Solution: Given the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, use the formula c = a 2 + b 2 − − − − − − √ to find the length of the hypotenuse. Answer: c = 5 units   When finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, the radicand is not always a perfect square.   Example 7: If the two legs of a right triangle measure 2 units and 6 units, find the length of the hypotenuse.

The following are some examples of expressions with one variable, x: Terms Components of an algebraic expression separated by addition operators. in an algebraic expression are separated by addition operators, and factors Any of the numbers or expressions that form a product. are separated by multiplication operators. The numerical factor of a term is called the coefficient The numerical factor of a term. . For example, the algebraic expression 3 x 2 + 2 x − 1 can be thought of as 3 x 2 + 2 x + ( − 1 ) and has three terms. The first term, 3 x 2 , represents the quantity 3 ⋅ x ⋅ x , where 3 is the coefficient and x is the variable. All of the variable factors, with their exponents, form the variable part of a term All the variable factors with their exponents. . If a term is written without a variable factor, then it is called a constant term A term written without a variable factor. . Consider the components of 3 x 2 + 2 x − 1 , Terms Coefficient Variable Part 3 x 2 3 x 2 2 x 2 x −1 −1 The third term in this expression, −1, is a constant term because it is written without a variable factor. While a variable represents an unknown quantity and may change, the constant term does not change.   Example 1: List all coefficients and variable parts of each term: 5 x 2 − 4 x y − y 2 .

The multiplicative identity property states that 1 times anything is itself and occurs so often that it is customary to omit this factor and write Therefore, the coefficient of y 2 is actually 1 and the coefficient of − y 2 is −1. In addition, you will encounter terms that have variable parts composed of algebraic expressions as factors.   Example 2: List all coefficients and variable parts of each term: − 3 ( x + y ) 3 + ( x + y ) 2 .

The area is the product of the length and width of the rectangle. If the length of a rectangle measures 3 meters and the width measures 2 meters, then the area can be calculated using the formula as follows:   Example 9: The cost of a daily truck rental is $48.00 plus an additional $0.45 for every mile driven. This cost in dollars can be modeled by the formula c o s t = 0.45 x + 48 , where x represents the number of miles driven in one day. Use this formula to calculate the cost to rent the truck for a day and drive it 120 miles. Solution: Use the formula to find the cost when the number of miles x = 120 . Substitute 120 into the given formula for x and then simplify. Answer: The rental costs $102.   Uniform motion Described by the formula D = r t , where the distance D is given as the product of the average rate r and the time t traveled at that rate. is modeled by the formula D = r t , which expresses distance D in terms of the average rate r, or speed, and the time t traveled at that rate. This formula, D = r t , is used often and is read “distance equals rate times time.”   Example 10: Jim’s road trip takes 2 1 2 hours at an average speed of 66 miles per hour. How far does he travel? Solution: Substitute the appropriate values into the formula and then simplify. Answer: Jim travels 165 miles.   The volume in cubic units of a rectangular box is given by the formula V = l w h , where l represents the length, w represents the width, and h represents the height.   Example 11: A wooden box is 1 foot in length, 5 inches wide, and 6 inches high. Find the volume of the box in cubic inches. Solution: Take care to ensure that all the units are consistent and use 12 inches for the length instead of 1 foot. Answer: The volume of the box is 360 cubic inches.   Simple interest Modeled by the formula I = p r t , where p represents the principal amount invested at an annual interest rate r for t years. I is given by the formula I = p r t , where p represents the principal amount invested at an annual interest rate r for t years.   Example 12: Calculate the simple interest earned on a 2-year investment of $1,250 at an annual interest rate of 3 3 4 % . Solution: Convert 3 3 4 % to a decimal number before using it in the formula. Use this value for r and the fact that p = $1,250 and t = 2 years to calculate the simple interest. Answer: The simple interest earned is $93.75.   Try this! The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2 l + 2 w , where l represents the length and w represents the width. Use the formula to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 5 feet and a width of 2 1 2 feet. Answer: 15 feet 
book2_chapter2_2_1	no label	Distributive Property Distributive Property The properties of real numbers are important in our study of algebra because a variable is simply a letter that represents a real number. In particular, the distributive property Given any real numbers a, b, and c, a ( b + c ) = a b + a c or ( b + c ) a = b a + c a . states that given any real numbers a, b, and c, This property is applied when simplifying algebraic expressions. To demonstrate how it is used, we simplify 2 ( 5 − 3 ) in two ways, and observe the same correct result. Certainly, if the contents of the parentheses can be simplified, do that first. On the other hand, when the contents of parentheses cannot be simplified, multiply every term within the parentheses by the factor outside of the parentheses using the distributive property. Applying the distributive property allows you to multiply and remove the parentheses.   Example 1: Simplify: 5 ( 7 y + 2 ) . Solution: Multiply 5 times each term inside the parentheses. Answer: 35 y + 10   Example 2: Simplify: − 3 ( 2 x 2 + 5 x + 1 ) . Solution: Multiply −3 times each of the coefficients of the terms inside the parentheses. Answer: − 6 x 2 − 15 x − 3   Example 3: Simplify: 5 ( − 2 a + 5 b ) − 2 c . Solution: Apply the distributive property by multiplying only the terms grouped within the parentheses by 5. Answer: − 10 a + 25 b − 2 c   Because multiplication is commutative, we can also write the distributive property in the following manner: ( b + c ) a = b a + c a .   Example 4: Simplify: ( 3 x − 4 y + 1 ) ⋅ 3 . Solution: Multiply each term within the parentheses by 3. Answer: 9 x − 12 y + 3   Division in algebra is often indicated using the fraction bar rather than with the symbol (÷). And sometimes it is useful to rewrite expressions involving division as products: Rewriting algebraic expressions as products allows us to apply the distributive property.   Example 5: Divide: 25 x 2 − 5 x + 10 5 . Solution: First, treat this as 1 5 times the expression in the numerator and then distribute. Alternate Solution: Think of 5 as a common denominator and divide each of the terms in the numerator by 5: Answer: 5 x 2 − x + 2   We will discuss the division of algebraic expressions in more detail as we progress through the course.   Try this! Simplify: 1 3 ( − 9 x + 27 y − 3 ) . Answer: − 3 x + 9 y − 1 
book2_chapter2_2_2	no label	Combining Like Terms Combining Like Terms Terms with the same variable parts are called like terms Constant terms or terms with the same variable parts. , or similar terms Used when referring to like terms. . Furthermore, constant terms are considered to be like terms. If an algebraic expression contains like terms, apply the distributive property as follows: In other words, if the variable parts of terms are exactly the same, then we may add or subtract the coefficients to obtain the coefficient of a single term with the same variable part. This process is called combining like terms Adding or subtracting like terms within an algebraic expression to obtain a single term with the same variable part. . For example, Notice that the variable factors and their exponents do not change. Combining like terms in this manner, so that the expression contains no other similar terms, is called simplifying the expression The process of combining like terms until the expression contains no more similar terms. . Use this idea to simplify algebraic expressions with multiple like terms.   Example 6: Simplify: 3 a + 2 b − 4 a + 9 b . Solution: Identify the like terms and combine them. Answer: − a + 11 b   In the previous example, rearranging the terms is typically performed mentally and is not shown in the presentation of the solution.   Example 7: Simplify: x 2 + 3 x + 2 + 4 x 2 − 5 x − 7 . Solution: Identify the like terms and add the corresponding coefficients. Answer: 5 x 2 − 2 x − 5   Example 8: Simplify: 5 x 2 y − 3 x y 2 + 4 x 2 y − 2 x y 2 . Solution: Remember to leave the variable factors and their exponents unchanged in the resulting combined term. Answer: 9 x 2 y − 5 x y 2   Example 9: Simplify: 1 2 a − 1 3 b + 3 4 a + b . Solution: To add the fractional coefficients, use equivalent coefficients with common denominators for each like term. Answer: 5 4 a + 2 3 b   Example 10: Simplify: − 12 x ( x + y ) 3 + 26 x ( x + y ) 3 . Solution: Consider the variable part to be x ( x + y ) 3 . Then this expression has two like terms with coefficients −12 and 26. Answer: 14 x ( x + y ) 3   Try this! Simplify: − 7 x + 8 y − 2 x − 3 y . Answer: − 9 x + 5 y 
book2_chapter2_2_3	no label	Distributive Property and Like Terms Distributive Property and Like Terms When simplifying, we will often have to combine like terms after we apply the distributive property. This step is consistent with the order of operations: multiplication before addition.   Example 11: Simplify: 2 ( 3 a − b ) − 7 ( − 2 a + 3 b ) . Solution: Distribute 2 and −7 and then combine like terms. Answer: 20 a − 23 b   In the example above, it is important to point out that you can remove the parentheses and collect like terms because you multiply the second quantity by −7, not just by 7. To correctly apply the distributive property, think of this as adding −7 times the given quantity, 2 ( 3 a − b ) + ( − 7 ) ( − 2 a + 3 b ) .   Try this! Simplify: − 5 ( 2 x − 3 ) + 7 x . Answer: − 3 x + 15 Often we will encounter algebraic expressions like + ( a + b ) or − ( a + b ) . As we have seen, the coefficients are actually implied to be +1 and −1, respectively, and therefore, the distributive property applies using +1 or –1 as the factor. Multiply each term within the parentheses by these factors: This leads to two useful properties,   Example 12: Simplify: 5 x − ( − 2 x 2 + 3 x − 1 ) . Solution: Multiply each term within the parentheses by −1 and then combine like terms. Answer: 2 x 2 + 2 x + 1   When distributing a negative number, all of the signs within the parentheses will change. Note that 5 x in the example above is a separate term; hence the distributive property does not apply to it.   Example 13: Simplify: 5 − 2 ( x 2 − 4 x − 3 ) . Solution: The order of operations requires that we multiply before subtracting. Therefore, distribute −2 and then combine the constant terms. Subtracting 5 − 2 first leads to an incorrect result, as illustrated below: Answer: −2x2 + 8x + 11 Caution It is worth repeating that you must follow the order of operations: multiply and divide before adding and subtracting! Try this! Simplify: 8 − 3 ( − x 2 + 2 x − 7 ) . Answer: 3 x 2 − 6 x + 29   Example 14: Subtract 3 x − 2 from twice the quantity − 4 x 2 + 2 x − 8 . Solution: First, group each expression and treat each as a quantity: Next, identify the key words and translate them into a mathematical expression. Finally, simplify the resulting expression. Answer: − 8 x 2 + x − 14 
book2_chapter2_3_1	no label	Linear Equations with One Variable and Their Solutions Linear Equations with One Variable and Their Solutions Learning how to solve various algebraic equations is one of the main goals in algebra. This section introduces the basic techniques used for solving linear equations with one variable. An equation Statement indicating that two algebraic expressions are equal. is a statement indicating that two algebraic expressions are equal. A linear equation with one variable An equation that can be written in the general form a x + b = 0 , where a and b are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . , x, is an equation that can be written in the general form a x + b = 0 , where a and b are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . Here are some examples of linear equations, all of which are solved in this section: A solution Any value that can replace the variable in an equation to produce a true statement. to a linear equation is any value that can replace the variable to produce a true statement. The variable in the linear equation 2 x + 3 = 13 is x, and the solution is x = 5 . To verify this, substitute the value 5 for x and check that you obtain a true statement. Alternatively, when an equation is equal to a constant, we can verify a solution by substituting the value for the variable and show that the result is equal to that constant. In this sense, we say that solutions satisfy the equation After replacing the variable with a solution and simplifying, it produces a true statement. .   Example 1: Is x = 3 a solution to − 2 x − 3 = − 9 ? Answer: Yes, it is a solution, because x = 3 satisfies the equation.   Example 2: Is a = − 1 2 a solution to − 10 a + 5 = 25 ? Answer: No, it is not a solution, because a = − 1 2 does not satisfy the equation.   Recall that when evaluating expressions, it is a good practice to first replace all variables with parentheses, then substitute the appropriate values. By making use of parentheses we avoid some common errors when working the order of operations.   Example 3: Is y = − 3 a solution to 2 y − 5 = − y − 14 ? Solution: Answer: Yes, it is a solution, because y = − 3 produces a true statement.   Try this! Is x = − 3 a solution to − 2 x + 5 = − 1 ? Answer: No 
book2_chapter2_3_2	no label	Solving Basic Linear Equations Solving Basic Linear Equations We begin by defining equivalent equations Equations with the same solution set. as equations with the same solution set. Consider the following two linear equations and check to see if the solution is x = 7 . Here we can see that the two linear equations 3 x − 5 = 16 and 3 x = 21 are equivalent because they share the same solution set, namely, {7}. The goal is to develop a systematic process to find equivalent equations until the variable is isolated: To do this, use the properties of equality Properties that allow us to obtain equivalent equations by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing both sides of an equation by nonzero real numbers. . Given algebraic expressions A and B, where c is a real number, we have the following: Note Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by 0 is carefully avoided. Dividing by 0 is undefined and multiplying both sides by 0 results in the equation 0 = 0. To summarize, equality is retained and you obtain an equivalent equation if you add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides of an equation by any nonzero real number. The technique for solving linear equations involves applying these properties in order to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. If the linear equation has a constant term, then we add to or subtract it from both sides of the equation to obtain an equivalent equation where the variable term is isolated.   Example 4: Solve: x + 3 = − 5 . Solution: To isolate the variable x on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides. Answer: The solution is x = − 8 . To check that this is true, substitute −8 into the original equation and simplify to see that it is satisfied: x + 3 = − 8 + 3 = − 5 ✓.   In the previous example, after subtracting 3 from both sides, you get x + 0 = − 8 . By the additive identity property of real numbers, this is equivalent to x = − 8 . This step is often left out in the presentation of the solution. If the variable term of the equation (including the coefficient) is isolated, then apply the multiplication or division property of equality to obtain an equivalent equation with the variable isolated. In other words, our goal is to obtain an equivalent equation with x or 1x isolated on one side of the equal sign.   Example 5: Solve: − 5 x = − 35 . Solution: The coefficient of x is –5, so divide both sides by −5. Answer: The solution is x = 7 . Perform the check mentally by substituting 7 for x in the original equation.   In the previous example, after dividing both sides by −5, x is left with a coefficient of 1, because − 5 − 5 = 1 . In fact, when we say “isolate the variable,” we mean to change the coefficient of the variable to 1, because 1 x = 7 is equivalent to x = 7 . This step is often left out of the instructional examples even though its omission is sometimes a source of confusion. Another important property is the symmetric property Allows you to solve for the variable on either side of the equal sign, because 5 = x is equivalent to x = 5 . : for any algebraic expressions A and B, The equation 2 = x is equivalent to x = 2 . It does not matter on which side we choose to isolate the variable.   Example 6: Solve: 2 = 5 + x . Solution: Isolate the variable x by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. Answer: The solution is −3, and checking the solution shows that 2 = 5 − 3.   Try this! Solve: 6 = x − 4 . Answer: x = 10 
book2_chapter2_3_3	no label	Isolating the Variable in Two Steps Isolating the Variable in Two Steps A linear equation of the form a x + b = c takes two steps to solve. First, use the appropriate equality property of addition or subtraction to isolate the variable term. Next, isolate the variable using the equality property of multiplication or division. Checking solutions in the following examples is left to the reader.   Example 7: Solve: 2 x − 5 = 15 . Solution: Answer: The solution is 10.   Example 8: Solve: − 3 x − 2 = 9 . Solution: Answer: The solution is − 11 3 .   Example 9: Solve: 6 − 5 y = − 14 . Solution: When no sign precedes the term, it is understood to be positive. In other words, think of this as + 6 − 5 y = − 14 . Begin by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equal sign. Answer: The solution is 4.   Example 10: Solve: 3 x + 1 2 = 2 3 . Solution: Answer: The solution is 1 18 .   Example 11: Solve: 3 − y = 1 . Solution: Recall that − y is equivalent to − 1 y ; divide both sides of the equation by −1. Alternatively, multiply both sides of − y = − 2 by −1 and achieve the same result: Answer: The solution is 2.   In summary, to retain equivalent equations, we must perform the same operation on both sides of the equation. First, apply the addition or subtraction property of equality to isolate the variable term and then apply the multiplication or division property of equality to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.   Try this! Solve: − 7 x + 6 = 27 . Answer: x = − 3 
book2_chapter2_3_4	no label	Multiplying by the Reciprocal Multiplying by the Reciprocal To solve an equation like 3 4 x = 1 , we can isolate the variable by dividing both sides by the coefficient. For example, On the left side of the equal sign, the fraction cancels. On the right side, we have a complex fraction and multiply by the reciprocal of the coefficient. You can save a step by recognizing this and start by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient. Recall that the product of reciprocals is 1, in this case , leaving the variable isolated.   Example 12: Solve: . Solution: Isolate the variable term using the addition property of equality and then multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient . Answer: The solution is −6.   Example 13: Solve: . Solution: The reciprocal of is because . Therefore, to isolate the variable x, multiply both sides by . Answer: The solution is −25.   Try this!

book2_chapter2_4_1	no label	Combining Like Terms and Simplifying Combining Like Terms and Simplifying Linear equations typically are not given in standard form, so solving them requires additional steps. These additional steps include simplifying expressions on each side of the equal sign using the order of operations. Same-Side Like Terms We will often encounter linear equations where the expressions on each side of the equal sign can be simplified. Typically, this involves combining same-side like terms Like terms of an equation on the same side of the equal sign. . If this is the case, then it is best to simplify each side first before solving.   Example 1: Solve: − 4 a + 2 − a = 3 − 2 . Solution: First, combine the like terms on each side of the equal sign. Answer: The solution is 1 5 . Opposite-Side Like Terms Given a linear equation in the form a x + b = c x + d , we begin by combining like terms on opposite sides of the equal sign. To combine opposite-side like terms Like terms of an equation on opposite sides of the equal sign. , use the addition or subtraction property of equality to effectively “move terms” from one side to the other so that they can be combined.   Example 2: Solve: − 2 y − 3 = 5 y + 11 . Solution: To “move” the term 5 y to the left side, subtract it on both sides. From here, solve using the techniques developed previously. Always check to see that the solution is correct by substituting the solution back into the original equation and simplifying to see if you obtain a true statement. Answer: The solution is −2.

book2_chapter2_4_5	no label	Conditional Equations, Identities, and Contradictions Conditional Equations, Identities, and Contradictions There are three different types of equations. Up to this point, we have been solving conditional equations Equations that are true for particular values. . These are equations that are true for particular values. An identity An equation that is true for all possible values. is an equation that is true for all possible values of the variable. For example, has a solution set consisting of all real numbers, R. A contradiction An equation that is never true and has no solution. is an equation that is never true and thus has no solutions. For example, has no solution. We use the empty set, ∅ , to indicate that there are no solutions. If the end result of solving an equation is a true statement, like 0 = 0, then the equation is an identity and any real number is a solution. If solving results in a false statement, like 0 = 1, then the equation is a contradiction and there is no solution.   Example 5: Solve: 4 ( x + 5 ) + 6 = 2 ( 2 x + 3 ) . Solution: Answer: ∅ . Solving leads to a false statement; therefore, the equation is a contradiction and there is no solution.   Example 6: Solve: 3 ( 3 y + 5 ) + 5 = 10 ( y + 2 ) − y . Solution: Answer: R. Solving leads to a true statement; therefore, the equation is an identity and any real number is a solution.   If it is hard to believe that any real number is a solution to the equation in the previous example, then choose your favorite real number, and substitute it in the equation to see that it leads to a true statement.

book2_chapter2_4_6	no label	Clearing Decimals and Fractions Clearing Decimals and Fractions The coefficients of linear equations may be any real number, even decimals and fractions. When decimals and fractions are used, it is possible to use the multiplication property of equality to clear the coefficients in a single step. If given decimal coefficients, then multiply by an appropriate power of 10 to clear the decimals. If given fractional coefficients, then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators (LCD).   Example 7: Solve: 2.3 x + 2.8 = − 1.2 x + 9.8 . Solution: Notice that all decimal coefficients are expressed with digits in the tenths place; this suggests that we can clear the decimals by multiplying both sides by 10. Take care to distribute 10 to each term on both sides of the equation. Answer: The solution is 2.   Example 8: Solve: 1 3 x + 1 5 = 1 5 x − 1 . Solution: Clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of the given denominators. In this case, the LCM ( 3, 5 ) = 15 . Answer: The solution is −9.   It is important to know that these techniques only work for equations. Do not try to clear fractions when simplifying expressions. As a reminder, Solve equations and simplify expressions. If you multiply an expression by 6, you will change the problem. However, if you multiply both sides of an equation by 6, you obtain an equivalent equation. 
book2_chapter2_4_7	no label	Literal Equations (Linear Formulas) Literal Equations (Linear Formulas) Algebra lets us solve whole classes of applications using literal equations A formula that summarizes whole classes of problems. , or formulas. Formulas often have more than one variable and describe, or model, a particular real-world problem. For example, the familiar formula D = r t describes the distance traveled in terms of the average rate and time; given any two of these quantities, we can determine the third. Using algebra, we can solve the equation for any one of the variables and derive two more formulas. If we divide both sides by r, we obtain the formula t = D r . Use this formula to find the time, given the distance and the rate. If we divide both sides by t, we obtain the formula r = D t . Use this formula to find the rate, given the distance traveled and the time it takes to travel that distance. Using the techniques learned up to this point, we now have three equivalent formulas relating distance, average rate, and time: When given a literal equation, it is often necessary to solve for one of the variables in terms of the others. Use the properties of equality to isolate the indicated variable.   Example 9: Solve for a:    P = 2 a + b . Solution: The goal is to isolate the variable a.

book2_chapter2_5_1	no label	Key Words, Translation, and Strategy Key Words, Translation, and Strategy Algebra simplifies the process of solving real-world problems. This is done by using letters to represent unknowns, restating problems in the form of equations, and offering systematic techniques for solving those equations. To solve problems using algebra, first translate the wording of the problem into mathematical statements that describe the relationships between the given information and the unknowns. Usually, this translation to mathematical statements is the difficult step in the process. The key to the translation is to carefully read the problem and identify certain key words and phrases. Key Words Translation Sum, increased by, more than, plus, added to, total + Difference, decreased by, subtracted from, less, minus − Product, multiplied by, of, times, twice * Quotient, divided by, ratio, per / Is, total, result = Here are some examples of translated key phrases. Key Phrases Translation The sum of a number and 7. x + 7 Seven more than a number. The difference of a number and 7. x − 7 Seven less than a number. Seven subtracted from a number. The product of 2 and a number. 2 x Twice a number. One-half of a number. 1 2 x The quotient of a number and 7. x / 7 When translating sentences into mathematical statements, be sure to read the sentence several times and identify the key words and phrases.   Example 1: Translate: Four less than twice some number is 16. Solution: First, choose a variable for the unknown number and identify the key words and phrases. Let x represent the unknown indicated by “some number.” Remember that subtraction is not commutative. For this reason, take care when setting up differences. In this example, 4 − 2 x = 16 is an incorrect translation. Answer: 2 x − 4 = 16   It is important to first identify the variable—let x represent…—and state in words what the unknown quantity is. This step not only makes your work more readable but also forces you to think about what you are looking for. Usually, if you know what you are asked to find, then the task of finding it is achievable.   Example 2: Translate: When 7 is subtracted from 3 times the sum of a number and 12, the result is 20. Solution: Let n represent the unknown number. Answer: 3 ( n + 12 ) − 7 = 20   To understand why parentheses are needed, study the structures of the following two sentences and their translations: “3 times the sum of a number and 12” 3 ( n + 12 ) “the sum of 3 times a number and 12” 3 n + 12 The key is to focus on the phrase “3 times the sum.” This prompts us to group the sum within parentheses and then multiply by 3. Once an application is translated into an algebraic equation, solve it using the techniques you have learned. Guidelines for Setting Up and Solving Word Problems Step 1: Read the problem several times, identify the key words and phrases, and organize the given information. Step 2: Identify the variables by assigning a letter or expression to the unknown quantities. Step 3: Translate and set up an algebraic equation that models the problem. Step 4: Solve the resulting algebraic equation. Step 5: Finally, answer the question in sentence form and make sure it makes sense (check it). For now, set up all of your equations using only one variable. Avoid two variables by looking for a relationship between the unknowns.

The sum of the two integers is 18. Find the integers. Solution: Identify variables: Begin by assigning a variable to the smaller integer. Use the first sentence to identify the larger integer in terms of the variable x: “A larger integer is 2 less than 3 times a smaller.” Set up an equation: Add the expressions that represent the two integers, and set the resulting expression equal to 18 as indicated in the second sentence: “The sum of the two integers is 18.” Solve: Solve the equation to obtain the smaller integer x. Back substitute: Use the expression 3 x − 2 to find the larger integer—this is called back substituting The process of finding the answers to other unknowns after one has been found. . Answer the question: The two integers are 5 and 13. Check: 5 + 13 = 18. The answer makes sense.   Example 4: The difference between two integers is 2. The larger integer is 6 less than twice the smaller. Find the integers. Solution: Use the relationship between the two integers in the second sentence, “The larger integer is 6 less than twice the smaller,” to identify the unknowns in terms of one variable. Since the difference is positive, subtract the smaller integer from the larger. Solve. Use 2x − 6 to find the larger integer. Answer: The two integers are 8 and 10. These integers clearly solve the problem.   It is worth mentioning again that you can often find solutions to simple problems by guessing and checking. This is so because the numbers are chosen to simplify the process of solving, so that the algebraic steps are not too tedious. You learn how to set up algebraic equations with easier problems, so that you can use these ideas to solve more difficult problems later.   Example 5: The sum of two consecutive even integers is 46. Find the integers. Solution: The key phrase to focus on is “consecutive even integers.” Add the even integers and set them equal to 46. Solve. Use x + 2 to find the next even integer. Answer: The consecutive even integers are 22 and 24.   It should be clear that consecutive even integers are separated by two units. However, it may not be so clear that odd integers are as well.   Example 6: The sum of two consecutive odd integers is 36. Find the integers. Solution: The key phrase to focus on is “consecutive odd integers.” Add the two odd integers and set the expression equal to 36. Solve. Use x + 2 to find the next odd integer. Answer: The consecutive odd integers are 17 and 19.   The algebraic setup for even and odd integer problems is the same. A common mistake is to use x and x + 3 when identifying the variables for consecutive odd integers. This is incorrect because adding 3 to an odd number yields an even number: for example, 5 + 3 = 8. An incorrect setup is very likely to lead to a decimal answer, which may be an indication that the problem was set up incorrectly.   Example 7: The sum of three consecutive integers is 24. Find the integers. Solution: Consecutive integers are separated by one unit. Add the integers and set the sum equal to 24. Solve. Back substitute to find the other two integers. Answer: The three consecutive integers are 7, 8 and 9, where 7 + 8 + 9 = 24.   Try this! The sum of three consecutive odd integers is 87. Find the integers. Answer: The integers are 27, 29, and 31. 
book2_chapter2_5_4	no label	Geometry Problems (Perimeter) Geometry Problems (Perimeter) Recall that the perimeter The sum of the lengths of all the outside edges of a polygon. of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all the outside edges. In addition, it is helpful to review the following perimeter formulas ( π ≈ 3.14159 ). Perimeter of a rectangle P = 2 l + 2 w , where l represents the length and w represents the width. : P = 2 l + 2 w Perimeter of a square P = 4 s , where s represents the length of a side. : P = 4 s Perimeter of a triangle P = a + b + c , where a, b, and c each represents the length of a different side. : P = a + b + c Perimeter of a circle ( circumference The perimeter of a circle given by C = 2 π r , where r represents the radius of the circle and π ≈ 3.14159 . ): C = 2 π r Keep in mind that you are looking for a relationship between the unknowns so that you can set up algebraic equations using only one variable. When working with geometry problems, it is often helpful to draw a picture.   Example 8: A rectangle has a perimeter measuring 64 feet. The length is 4 feet more than 3 times the width. Find the dimensions of the rectangle. Solution: The sentence “The length is 4 feet more than 3 times the width” gives the relationship between the two variables. The sentence “A rectangle has a perimeter measuring 64 feet” suggests an algebraic setup. Substitute 64 for the perimeter and the expression for the length into the appropriate formula as follows: Once you have set up an algebraic equation with one variable, solve for the width, w. Use 3w + 4 to find the length. Answer: The rectangle measures 7 feet by 25 feet. To check, add all of the sides:   Example 9: Two sides of a triangle are 5 and 7 inches longer than the third side. If the perimeter measures 21 inches, find the length of each side. Solution: The first sentence describes the relationships between the unknowns. Substitute these expressions into the appropriate formula and use 21 for the perimeter P. You now have an equation with one variable to solve. Back substitute. Answer: The three sides of the triangle measure 3 inches, 8 inches, and 10 inches. The check is left to the reader.   Try this! The length of a rectangle is 1 foot less than twice its width. If the perimeter is 46 feet, find the dimensions. Answer: Width: 8 feet; length: 15 feet 
book2_chapter2_5_5	no label	Problems Involving Money and Percents Problems Involving Money and Percents Whenever setting up an equation involving a percentage, we usually need to convert the percentage to a decimal or fraction. If the question asks for a percentage, then do not forget to convert your answer to a percent at the end. Also, when money is involved, be sure to round off to two decimal places.   Example 10: If a pair of shoes costs $52.50 including a 7 1 4 % tax, what is the original cost of the item before taxes are added? Solution: Begin by converting 7 1 4 % to a decimal. The amount of tax is this rate times the original cost of the item. The original cost of the item is what you are asked to find. Use this equation to solve for c, the original cost of the item. Answer: The cost of the item before taxes is $48.95. Check this by multiplying $48.95 by 0.0725 to obtain the tax and add it to this cost.   Example 11: Given a 5 1 8 % annual interest rate, how long will it take $1,200 to yield $307.50 in simple interest? Solution: Organize the data needed to use the simple interest formula I = p r t . Given interest for the time period: I = $ 307.50 Given principal: p = $ 1200 Given rate: r = 5 1 8 % = 5.125 % = 0.05125 Next, substitute all of the known quantities into the formula and then solve for the only unknown, t. Answer: It takes 5 years for $1,200 invested at 5 1 8 % to earn $307.50 in simple interest.   Example 12: Mary invested her total savings of $3,400 in two accounts. Her mutual fund account earned 8% last year and her CD earned 5%. If her total interest for the year was $245, how much was in each account? Solution: The relationship between the two unknowns is that they total $3,400. When a total is involved, a common technique used to avoid two variables is to represent the second unknown as the difference of the total and the first unknown. The total interest is the sum of the interest earned from each account. Interest earned in the mutual fund: I = P r t = x ⋅ 0.08 ⋅ 1 = 0.08 x Interest earned in the CD: I = P r t = ( 3,400 − x ) ⋅ 0.05 ⋅ 1 = 0.05 ( 3,400 − x ) This equation models the problem with one variable. Solve for x. Back substitute. Answer: Mary invested $2,500 at 8% in a mutual fund and $900 at 5% in a CD.   Example 13: Joe has a handful of dimes and quarters that values $5.30. He has one fewer than twice as many dimes than quarters. How many of each coin does he have? Solution: Begin by identifying the variables. To determine the total value of a number of coins, multiply the number of coins by the value of each coin. For example, 5 quarters have a value $0.25 ⋅ 5 = $1.25. Solve for the number of quarters, q. Back substitute into 2q − 1 to find the number of dimes. Answer: Joe has 12 quarters and 23 dimes. Check by multiplying $0.25 ⋅ 12 = $3.00 and $0.10 ⋅ 23 = $2.30. Then add to obtain the correct amount: $3.00 + $2.30 = $5.30.   Try this! A total amount of $5,900 is invested in two accounts. One account earns 3.5% interest and another earns 4.5%. If the interest for 1 year is $229.50, then how much is invested in each account? Answer: $3,600 is invested at 3.5% and $2,300 at 4.5%. 
book2_chapter2_5_6	no label	Uniform Motion Problems (Distance Problems) Uniform Motion Problems (Distance Problems) Uniform motion refers to movement at a speed, or rate, that does not change. We can determine the distance traveled by multiplying the average rate by the time traveled at that rate with the formula D = r ⋅ t . Applications involving uniform motion usually have a lot of data, so it helps to first organize the data in a chart and then set up an algebraic equation that models the problem.   Example 14: Two trains leave the station at the same time traveling in opposite directions. One travels at 70 miles per hour and the other at 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the distance between them to reach 390 miles? Solution: First, identify the unknown quantity and organize the data. The given information is filled in on the following chart. The time for each train is equal. To avoid introducing two more variables, use the formula D = r ⋅ t to fill in the unknown distances traveled by each train. We can now completely fill in the chart. The algebraic setup is defined by the distance column. The problem asks for the time it takes for the total distance to reach 390 miles. Solve for t. Answer: It takes 3 hours for the distance between the trains to reach 390 miles.   Example 15: A train traveling nonstop to its destination is able to make the trip at an average speed of 72 miles per hour. On the return trip, the train makes several stops and is only able to average 48 miles per hour. If the return trip takes 2 hours longer than the initial trip to the destination, then what is the travel time each way? Solution: First, identify the unknown quantity and organize the data. The given information is filled in the following chart: Use the formula D = r ⋅ t to fill in the unknown distances. Use these expressions to complete the chart. The algebraic setup is again defined by the distance column. In this case, the distance to the destination and back is the same, and the equation is Solve for t. The return trip takes t + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Answer: It takes 4 hours to arrive at the destination and 6 hours to return.   Try this! Mary departs for school on a bicycle at an average rate of 6 miles per hour. Her sister Kate, running late, leaves 15 minutes later and cycles at twice that speed. How long will it take Kate to catch up to Mary? Be careful! Pay attention to the units given in the problem. Answer: It takes 15 minutes for Kate to catch up. 
book2_chapter2_6_1	no label	Definitions Definitions A ratio Relationship between two numbers or quantities usually expressed as a quotient. is a relationship between two numbers or quantities usually expressed as a quotient. Ratios are typically expressed using the following notation: All of the above are equivalent forms used to express a ratio. However, the most familiar way to express a ratio is in the form of a fraction. When writing ratios, it is important to pay attention to the units. If the units are the same, then the ratio can be written without them.   Example 1: Express the ratio 12 feet to 48 feet in reduced form. Solution: Answer: 1 to 4   If the units are different, then we must be sure to include them because the ratio represents a rate A ratio where the units for the numerator and the denominator are different. .   Example 2: Express the ratio 220 miles to 4 hours in reduced form. Solution: Answer: 55 miles to 1 hour (or 55 miles per hour)   Rates are useful when determining unit cost The price of each unit. , or the price of each unit. We use the unit cost to compare values when the quantities are not the same. To determine the unit cost, divide the cost by the number of units.   Example 3: A local supermarket offers a pack of 12 sodas for $3.48 on sale, and the local discount warehouse offers the soda in a 36-can case for $11.52. Which is the better value? Solution: Divide the cost by the number of cans to obtain the unit price. Supermarket Discount warehouse $ 3.48 12     cans = $ 0.29 / can $ 11.52 36     cans = $ 0.32 / can Answer: The supermarket sale price of $3.48 for a 12-pack is a better value at $0.29 per can.   A proportion A statement of the equality of two ratios. is a statement of equality of two ratios. This proportion is often read “a is to b as c is to d.” Here is an example of a simple proportion, If we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the proportion by the product of the denominators, 8, then we obtain the following true statement: Given any nonzero real numbers a, b, c, and d that satisfy a proportion, multiply both sides by the product of the denominators to obtain the following: This shows that cross products are equal, and is commonly referred to as cross multiplication If a b = c d , then a d = b c . .

book2_chapter2_6_3	no label	Applications Applications When setting up proportions, consistency with the units of each ratio is critical. Units for the numerators should be the same and units for the denominators should also be the same.   Example 7: It is claimed that 2 out of 3 dentists prefer a certain brand of toothpaste. If 600 dentists are surveyed, then how many will say they prefer that brand? Solution: First, identify the unknown and assign it a variable. Since you are looking for the number of dentists who prefer the brand name out of a total of 600 surveyed, construct the ratios with the number of dentists who prefer the brand in the numerator and the total number surveyed in the denominator. Cross multiply and solve for n, Answer: The claim suggests that 400 out of 600 dentists surveyed prefer the brand name.   Example 8: In Tulare County, 3 out of every 7 voters said yes to Proposition 40. If 42,000 people voted, how many said no to Proposition 40? Solution: The problem gives the ratio of voters who said yes, but it asks for the number who said no. If 3 out of 7 said yes, then we can assume 4 out of 7 said no. Set up the ratios with the number of voters who said no in the numerator and the total number of voters in the denominator. Cross multiply and solve for n. Answer: 24,000 voters out of 42,000 said no.   Example 9: The sum of two integers in the ratio of 4 to 5 is 27. Find the integers. Solution: The sum of two integers is 27; use this relationship to avoid two variables. The integers are given to be in the ratio of 4 to 5. Set up the following proportion: Use 27 − n to determine the other integer. Answer: The integers are 12 and 15.   Try this! A recipe calls for 5 tablespoons of sugar for every 8 cups of flour.

book2_chapter2_6_4	no label	Similar Triangles Similar Triangles We will often encounter proportion problems in geometry and trigonometry. One application involves similar triangles Triangles with the same shape but not necessarily the same size. The measures of corresponding angles are equal and the corresponding sides are proportional. , which have the same shape, but not necessarily the same size. The measures of the corresponding angles of similar triangles are equal, and the measures of the corresponding sides are proportional. Given similar triangles ABC and RST, We may write A B C   ~   R S T and conclude that all of the corresponding angles are equal. The notation indicates that angle A corresponds to angle R and that the measures of these angles are equal: A = R. In addition, the measures of other pairs of corresponding angles are equal: B = S and C = T. Use uppercase letters for angles and a lowercase letter to denote the side opposite of the given angle. Denote the proportionality of the sides as follows:   Example 10: If triangle ABC is similar to RST, where a = 3 , b = 4 , c = 5 , and r = 9 , then find the remaining two sides. Solution: Draw a picture and identify the variables pictorially. Represent the remaining unknown sides by s and t. Set up proportions and solve for the missing sides. Answer: The two remaining sides measure 12 units and 15 units.   The reduced ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is called the scale factor The reduced ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles. . In the previous example, the ratio of the two given sides a and r is Therefore, triangle ABC is similar to triangle RST with a scale factor of 1/3. This means that each leg of triangle ABC is 1/3 of the measure of the corresponding legs of triangle RST. Also, another interesting fact is that the perimeters of similar triangles are in the same proportion as their sides and share the same scale factor.   Example 11: If a triangle ABC has a perimeter of 12 units and is similar to RST with a scale factor of 1/3, then find the perimeter of triangle RST. Solution: Scale factor 1/3 implies that the perimeters are in proportion to this ratio. Set up a proportion as follows: Cross multiply and solve for x. Answer: The perimeter of triangle RST is 36 units. 
book2_chapter2_7_1	no label	Unbounded Intervals Unbounded Intervals An algebraic inequality Expressions related with the symbols ≤ , <, ≥ , and >. , such as x ≥ 2 , is read “x is greater than or equal to 2.” This inequality has infinitely many solutions for x. Some of the solutions are 2, 3, 3.5, 5, 20, and 20.001. Since it is impossible to list all of the solutions, a system is needed that allows a clear communication of this infinite set. Two common ways of expressing solutions to an inequality are by graphing them on a number line Solutions to an algebraic inequality expressed by shading the solution on a number line. and using interval notation A textual system of expressing solutions to an algebraic inequality. . To express the solution graphically, draw a number line and shade in all the values that are solutions to the inequality. Interval notation is textual and uses specific notation as follows: Determine the interval notation after graphing the solution set on a number line. The numbers in interval notation should be written in the same order as they appear on the number line, with smaller numbers in the set appearing first. In this example, there is an inclusive inequality An inequality that includes the boundary point indicated by the “or equal” part of the symbols ≤ and ≥ and a closed dot on the number line. , which means that the lower-bound 2 is included in the solution. Denote this with a closed dot on the number line and a square bracket in interval notation. The symbol (∞) is read as infinity The symbol (∞) indicates the interval is unbounded to the right. and indicates that the set is unbounded to the right on a number line. Interval notation requires a parenthesis to enclose infinity. The square bracket indicates the boundary is included in the solution. The parentheses indicate the boundary is not included. Infinity is an upper bound to the real numbers, but is not itself a real number: it cannot be included in the solution set. Now compare the interval notation in the previous example to that of the strict, or noninclusive, inequality that follows: Strict inequalities Express ordering relationships using the symbol < for “less than” and > for “greater than.” imply that solutions may get very close to the boundary point, in this case 2, but not actually include it. Denote this idea with an open dot on the number line and a round parenthesis in interval notation.   Example 1: Graph and give the interval notation equivalent: x < 3 . Solution: Use an open dot at 3 and shade all real numbers strictly less than 3. Use negative infinity The symbol (−∞) indicates the interval is unbounded to the left. (−∞) to indicate that the solution set is unbounded to the left on a number line. Answer: Interval notation: ( − ∞ ,   3 )   Example 2: Graph and give the interval notation equivalent: x ≤ 5 . Solution: Use a closed dot and shade all numbers less than and including 5. Answer: Interval notation: ( − ∞ ,   5 ]   It is important to see that 5 ≥ x is the same as x ≤ 5 . Both require values of x to be smaller than or equal to 5. To avoid confusion, it is good practice to rewrite all inequalities with the variable on the left. Also, when using text, use “inf” as a shortened form of infinity. For example, ( − ∞ ,   5 ] can be expressed textually as (−inf, 5]. A compound inequality Two inequalities in one statement joined by the word “and” or by the word “or.” is actually two or more inequalities in one statement joined by the word “and” or by the word “or.” Compound inequalities with the logical “or” require that either condition must be satisfied. Therefore, the solution set of this type of compound inequality consists of all the elements of the solution sets of each inequality. When we join these individual solution sets it is called the union The set formed by joining the individual solution sets indicated by the logical use of the word “or” and denoted with the symbol ∪ . , denoted ∪ . For example, the solutions to the compound inequality x < 3   o r   x ≥ 6 can be graphed as follows: Sometimes we encounter compound inequalities where the separate solution sets overlap. In the case where the compound inequality contains the word “or,” we combine all the elements of both sets to create one set containing all the elements of each.   Example 3: Graph and give the interval notation equivalent: x ≤ − 1   or   x < 3 . Solution: Combine all solutions of both inequalities. The solutions to each inequality are sketched above the number line as a means to determine the union, which is graphed on the number line below. Answer: Interval notation: ( − ∞ ,   3 )   Any real number less than 3 in the shaded region on the number line will satisfy at least one of the two given inequalities.   Example 4: Graph and give the interval notation equivalent: x < 3   or   x ≥ − 1 . Solution: Both solution sets are graphed above the union, which is graphed below. Answer: Interval notation: R = (−∞, ∞)   When you combine both solution sets and form the union, you can see that all real numbers satisfy the original compound inequality. In summary, and 
book2_chapter2_7_2	no label	Bounded Intervals Bounded Intervals An inequality such as reads “−1 one is less than or equal to x and x is less than three.” This is a compound inequality because it can be decomposed as follows: The logical “and” requires that both conditions must be true. Both inequalities are satisfied by all the elements in the intersection The set formed by the shared values of the individual solution sets that is indicated by the logical use of the word “and,” denoted with the symbol ∩ . , denoted ∩ , of the solution sets of each.   Example 5: Graph and give the interval notation equivalent: x < 3   and   x ≥ − 1 . Solution: Determine the intersection, or overlap, of the two solution sets. The solutions to each inequality are sketched above the number line as a means to determine the intersection, which is graphed on the number line below. Here x = 3 is not a solution because it solves only one of the inequalities. Answer: Interval notation: [ − 1 ,   3 )   Alternatively, we may interpret − 1 ≤ x < 3 as all possible values for x between or bounded by −1 and 3 on a number line. For example, one such solution is x = 1 . Notice that 1 is between −1 and 3 on a number line, or that −1 < 1 < 3. Similarly, we can see that other possible solutions are −1, −0.99, 0, 0.0056, 1.8, and 2.99. Since there are infinitely many real numbers between −1 and 3, we must express the solution graphically and/or with interval notation, in this case [ − 1 ,   3 ) .   Example 6: Graph and give the interval notation equivalent: − 3 2 < x < 2 . Solution: Shade all real numbers bounded by, or strictly between, − 3 2 = − 1 1 2 and 2. Answer: Interval notation: ( − 3 2 ,   2 )   Example 7: Graph and give the interval notation equivalent: − 5 < x ≤ 15 . Solution: Shade all real numbers between −5 and 15, and indicate that the upper bound, 15, is included in the solution set by using a closed dot. Answer: Interval notation: ( − 5 ,   15 ]   In the previous two examples, we did not decompose the inequalities; instead we chose to think of all real numbers between the two given bounds. In summary, 
book2_chapter2_7_3	no label	Set-Builder Notation Set-Builder Notation In this text, we use interval notation. However, other resources that you are likely to encounter use an alternate method for describing sets called set-builder notation A system for describing sets using familiar mathematical notation. . We have used set notation to list the elements such as the integers The braces group the elements of the set and the ellipsis marks indicate that the integers continue forever. In this section, we wish to describe intervals of real numbers—for example, the real numbers greater than or equal to 2. Since the set is too large to list, set-builder notation allows us to describe it using familiar mathematical notation. An example of set-builder notation follows: Here x∈R describes the type of number, where the symbol (∈) is read “element of.” This implies that the variable x represents a real number. The vertical bar (|) is read “such that.” Finally, the statement x ≥ 2 is the condition that describes the set using mathematical notation. At this point in our study of algebra, it is assumed that all variables represent real numbers. For this reason, you can omit the “∈R” and write { x | x ≥ 2 } , which is read “the set of all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to 2.” To describe compound inequalities such as x < 3   or   x ≥ 6 , write { x | x < 3   or   x ≥ 6 } , which is read “the set of all real numbers x such that x is less than 3 or x is greater than or equal to 6.” Write bounded intervals, such as − 1 ≤ x < 3 , as { x | − 1 ≤ x < 3 } , which is read “the set of all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to −1 and less than 3.” 
book2_chapter2_8_1	no label	Definition of a Linear Inequality Definition of a Linear Inequality A linear inequality A mathematical statement relating a linear expression as either less than or greater than another. is a mathematical statement that relates a linear expression as either less than or greater than another. The following are some examples of linear inequalities, all of which are solved in this section: A solution to a linear inequality A real number that produces a true statement when its value is substituted for the variable. is a real number that will produce a true statement when substituted for the variable. Linear inequalities have either infinitely many solutions or no solution. If there are infinitely many solutions, graph the solution set on a number line and/or express the solution using interval notation.   Example 1: Are x = − 2 and x = 4 solutions to 3 x + 7 < 16 ? Solution: Substitute the values for x, simplify, and check to see if we obtain a true statement. Answer: x = − 2 is a solution and x = 4 is not. 
book2_chapter2_8_2	no label	Algebra of Linear Inequalities Algebra of Linear Inequalities All but one of the techniques learned for solving linear equations apply to solving linear inequalities. You may add or subtract any real number to both sides of an inequality, and you may multiply or divide both sides by any positive real number to create equivalent inequalities. For example, Both subtracting 7 from each side and dividing each side by +5 results in an equivalent inequality that is true.   Example 2: Solve and graph the solution set: 3 x + 7 < 16 . Solution: It is helpful to take a minute and choose a few values in and out of the solution set, substitute them into the original inequality, and then verify the results. As indicated, you should expect x = 0 to solve the original inequality, but x = 5 should not. Checking in this manner gives a good indication that the inequality is solved correctly. This can be done mentally. Answer: Interval notation: ( − ∞ ,   3 )   When working with linear inequalities, a different rule applies when multiplying or dividing by a negative number. To illustrate the problem, consider the true statement 10 > − 5 and divide both sides by −5. Dividing by −5 results in a false statement. To retain a true statement, the inequality must be reversed. The same problem occurs when multiplying by a negative number. This leads to the following new rule: when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, reverse the inequality. It is easy to forget to do this so take special care to watch for negative coefficients. In general, given algebraic expressions A and B, where c is a positive nonzero real number, we have the following properties of inequalities Properties used to obtain equivalent inequalities and used as a means to solve them. : We use these properties to obtain an equivalent inequality Inequalities that share the same solution set. , one with the same solution set, where the variable is isolated. The process is similar to solving linear equations.   Example 3: Solve: − 2 x + 1 ≥ 21 . Solution: Answer: Interval notation: ( − ∞ ,   − 10 ]   Example 4: Solve: − 7 ( 2 x + 1 ) < 1 . Solution: Answer: Interval notation: ( − 4 7 ,   ∞ )   Example 5: Solve: 5 x − 3 ( 2 x − 1 ) ≥ 2 ( x − 3 ) . Solution: Answer: Interval notation: ( − ∞ ,   3 ]   Try this! Solve: 3 − 5 ( x − 1 ) ≤ 28 . Answer: [ − 4 ,   ∞ ) 
book2_chapter2_8_3	no label	Compound Inequalities Compound Inequalities Following are some examples of compound linear inequalities: These compound inequalities Two or more inequalities in one statement joined by the word “and” or by the word “or.” are actually two inequalities in one statement joined by the word “and” or by the word “or.” For example, is a compound inequality because it can be decomposed as follows: Solve each inequality individually, and the intersection of the two solution sets solves the original compound inequality. While this method works, there is another method that usually requires fewer steps. Apply the properties of this section to all three parts of the compound inequality with the goal of isolating the variable in the middle of the statement to determine the bounds of the solution set.   Example 6: Solve: − 3 < 2 x + 5 < 17 . Solution: Answer: Interval notation: ( − 4, 6 )   Example 7: Solve: − 1 ≤ 1 2 x − 3 < 1 . Solution: Answer: Interval notation: [ 4, 8 )   It is important to note that when multiplying or dividing all three parts of a compound inequality by a negative number, you must reverse all of the inequalities in the statement. For example, The answer above can be written in an equivalent form, where smaller numbers lie to the left and the larger numbers lie to the right, as they appear on a number line. Using interval notation, write ( − 10 ,   5 ) .   Try this! Solve: − 8 ≤ 2 ( − 3 x + 5 ) < 34 . Answer: ( − 4 ,   3 ] For compound inequalities with the word “or” you must work both inequalities separately and then consider the union of the solution sets. Values in this union solve either inequality.   Example 8: Solve: 3 x + 1 < 10   or   2 x − 1 ≥ 11 Solution: Solve each inequality and form the union by combining the solution sets. Answer: Interval notation: ( − ∞ ,   3 ) ∪ [ 6 ,   ∞ )   Try this! Solve: 4 x − 1 < − 5   or   4 x − 1 > 5 . Answer: ( − ∞ , − 1 ) ∪ ( 3 2 ,   ∞ ) 
book2_chapter2_8_4	no label	Applications of Linear Inequalities Applications of Linear Inequalities Some of the key words and phrases that indicate inequalities are summarized below: Key Phrases Translation A number is at least 5. x ≥ 5 A number is 5 or more inclusive. A number is at most 3. x ≤ 3 A number is 3 or less inclusive. A number is strictly less than 4. x < 4 A number is less than 4, noninclusive. A number is greater than 7. x > 7 A number is more than 7, noninclusive. A number is in between 2 and 10. 2 < x < 10 A number is at least 5 and at most 15. 5 ≤ x ≤ 15 A number may range from 5 to 15. As with all applications, carefully read the problem several times and look for key words and phrases. Identify the unknowns and assign variables. Next, translate the wording into a mathematical inequality. Finally, use the properties you have learned to solve the inequality and express the solution graphically or in interval notation.   Example 9: Translate: Five less than twice a number is at most 25. Solution: First, choose a variable for the unknown number and identify the key words and phrases. Answer: 2 n − 5 ≤ 25 . The key phrase “is at most” indicates that the quantity has a maximum value of 25 or smaller.   Example 10: The temperature in the desert can range from 10°C to 45°C in one 24-hour period. Find the equivalent range in degrees Fahrenheit, F, given that C = 5 9 ( F − 32 ) . Solution: Set up a compound inequality where the temperature in Celsius is inclusively between 10°C and 45°C. Then substitute the expression equivalent to the Celsius temperature in the inequality and solve for F. Answer: The equivalent Fahrenheit range is from 50°F to 113°F.   Example 11: In the first four events of a meet, a gymnast scores 7.5, 8.2, 8.5, and 9.0. What must she score on the fifth event to average at least 8.5? Solution: The average must be at least 8.5; this means that the average must be greater than or equal to 8.5. Answer: She must score at least 9.3 on the fifth event. 
book2_chapter3_1_1	no label	Rectangular Coordinate System Rectangular Coordinate System The rectangular coordinate system A system with two number lines at right angles uniquely specifying points in a plane using ordered pairs (x, y). consists of two real number lines that intersect at a right angle. The horizontal number line is called the x-axis The horizontal number line used as reference in the rectangular coordinate system. , and the vertical number line is called the y-axis The vertical number line used as reference in the rectangular coordinate system. . These two number lines define a flat surface called a plane The flat surface defined by the x- and y-axes. , and each point on this plane is associated with an ordered pair A pair (x, y) that identifies position relative to the origin on a rectangular coordinate plane. of real numbers (x, y). The first number is called the x-coordinate, and the second number is called the y-coordinate. The intersection of the two axes is known as the origin The point where the x- and y-axes cross, denoted by (0, 0). , which corresponds to the point (0, 0). An ordered pair (x, y) represents the position of a point relative to the origin. The x-coordinate represents a position to the right of the origin if it is positive and to the left of the origin if it is negative. The y-coordinate represents a position above the origin if it is positive and below the origin if it is negative. Using this system, every position (point) in the plane is uniquely identified. For example, the pair (2, 3) denotes the position relative to the origin as shown: Portrait of René Descartes (1596–1650) after Frans Hals, from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg. This system is often called the Cartesian coordinate system Used in honor of René Descartes when referring to the rectangular coordinate system. , named after the French mathematician René Descartes (1596–1650). The x- and y-axes break the plane into four regions called quadrants The four regions of a rectangular coordinate plane partly bounded by the x- and y-axes and numbered using the roman numerals I, II, III, and IV. , named using roman numerals I, II, III, and IV, as pictured. In quadrant I, both coordinates are positive. In quadrant II, the x-coordinate is negative and the y-coordinate is positive. In quadrant III, both coordinates are negative. In quadrant IV, the x-coordinate is positive and the y-coordinate is negative.   Example 1: Plot the ordered pair (−3, 5) and determine the quadrant in which it lies. Solution: The coordinates x = − 3 and y = 5 indicate a point 3 units to the left of and 5 units above the origin. Answer: The point is plotted in quadrant II (QII) because the x-coordinate is negative and the y-coordinate is positive.   Ordered pairs with 0 as one of the coordinates do not lie in a quadrant; these points are on one axis or the other (or the point is the origin if both coordinates are 0). Also, the scale indicated on the x-axis may be different from the scale indicated on the y-axis. Choose a scale that is convenient for the given situation.   Example 2: Plot this set of ordered pairs: {(4, 0), (−6, 0), (0, 3), (−2, 6), (−4, −6)}. Solution: Each tick mark on the x-axis represents 2 units and each tick mark on the y-axis represents 3 units.   Example 3: Plot this set of ordered pairs: {(−6, −5), (−3, −3), (0, −1), (3, 1), (6, 3)}. Solution: In this example, the points appear to be collinear Describes points that lie on the same line. , or to lie on the same line. The entire chapter focuses on finding and expressing points with this property.   Try this! Plot the set of points {(5, 3), (−3, 2), (−2, −4), (4, −3)} and indicate in which quadrant they lie.

A line graph A set of related data values graphed on a coordinate plane and connected by line segments. consists of a set of related data values graphed on a coordinate plane and connected by line segments. Typically, the independent quantity, such as time, is displayed on the x-axis and the dependent quantity, such as distance traveled, on the y-axis.   Example 4: The following line graph shows the number of mathematics and statistics bachelor’s degrees awarded in the United States each year since 1970. Source: Digest of Education Statistics. a. How many mathematics and statistics bachelor’s degrees were awarded in 1975? b. In which years were the number of mathematics and statistics degrees awarded at the low of 11,000? Solution: a. The scale on the x-axis represents time since 1970, so to determine the number of degrees awarded in 1975, read the y-value of the graph at x = 5. Source: Digest of Education Statistics. The y-value corresponding to x = 5 is 18. The graph indicates that this is in thousands; there were 18,000 mathematics and statistics degrees awarded in 1975. b. To find the year a particular number of degrees was awarded, first look at the y-axis. In this case, 11,000 degrees is represented by 11 on the y-axis; look to the right to see in which years this occurred. Source: Digest of Education Statistics. The y-value of 11 occurs at two data points, one where x = 10 and the other where x = 30. These values correspond to the years 1980 and 2000, respectively. Answers: a. In the year 1975, 18,000 mathematics and statistics degrees were awarded. b. In the years 1980 and 2000, the lows of 11,000 mathematics and statistics degrees were awarded. 
book2_chapter3_1_2	no label	Distance Formula Distance Formula Frequently you need to calculate the distance between two points in a plane. To do this, form a right triangle using the two points as vertices of the triangle and then apply the Pythagorean theorem. Recall that the Pythagorean theorem Given any right triangle with legs measuring a and b units and hypotenuse measuring c units, then a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . states that if given any right triangle with legs measuring a and b units, then the square of the measure of the hypotenuse c is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs: a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . In other words, the hypotenuse of any right triangle is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its legs.   Example 5: Find the distance between (−1, 2) and (3, 5). Solution: Form a right triangle by drawing horizontal and vertical lines through the two points. This creates a right triangle as shown below: The length of leg b is calculated by finding the distance between the x-values of the given points, and the length of leg a is calculated by finding the distance between the given y-values. Next, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse. Answer: The distance between the two points is 5 units.   Generalize this process to produce a formula that can be used to algebraically calculate the distance between any two given points. Given two points, ( x 1 ,   y 1 )   and ( x 2 ,   y 2 )   , then the distance, d, between them is given by the distance formula Given two points ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) and ( x 2 ,   y 2 ) , calculate the distance d between them using the formula d = ( x 2 − x 1 ) 2 + ( y 2 − y 1 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ . : d = ( x 2 − x 1 ) 2 + ( y 2 − y 1 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √   Example 6: Calculate the distance between (−3, −1) and (−2, 4). Solution: Use the distance formula. It is a good practice to include the formula in its general form as a part of the written solution before substituting values for the variables. This improves readability and reduces the chance for errors. Answer: 26 − − √ units   Try this! Calculate the distance between (−7, 5) and (−1, 13). Answer: 10 units   Example 7: Do the three points (1, −1), (3, −3), and (3, 1) form a right triangle? Solution: The Pythagorean theorem states that having side lengths that satisfy the property a 2 + b 2 = c 2 is a necessary and sufficient condition of right triangles. In other words, if you can show that the sum of the squares of the leg lengths of the triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse, then the figure must be a right triangle. First, calculate the length of each side using the distance formula. Now we check to see if a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . Answer: Yes, the three points form a right triangle. In fact, since two of the legs are equal in length, the points form an isosceles right triangle. 
book2_chapter3_1_3	no label	Midpoint Formula Midpoint Formula The point that bisects the line segment formed by two points, ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) and ( x 2 ,   y 2 ) , is called the midpoint Given two points, ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) and ( x 2 ,   y 2 ) , the midpoint is an ordered pair given by ( x 1 + x 2 2 ,   y 1 + y 2 2 ) . and is given by the following formula: The midpoint is an ordered pair formed by finding the average of the x-values and the average of the y-values of the given points.   Example 8: Calculate the midpoint between (−1, −2) and (7, 4). Solution: First, calculate the average of the x- and y-values of the given points. Next, form the midpoint as an ordered pair using the averaged coordinates. Answer: (3, 1)   To verify that this is indeed the midpoint, calculate the distance between the two given points and verify that the result is equal to the sum of the two equal distances from the endpoints to this midpoint. This verification is left to the reader as an exercise.   Try this! Find the midpoint between (−6, 5) and (6, −11). Answer: (0, −3) 
book2_chapter3_2_1	no label	Solutions to Equations with Two Variables Solutions to Equations with Two Variables A linear equation with two variables An equation with two variables that can be written in the standard form a x + b y = c , where the real numbers a and b are not both zero. has standard form a x + b y = c , where a, b, and c are real numbers and a and b are not both 0. Solutions to equations of this form are ordered pairs (x, y), where the coordinates, when substituted into the equation, produce a true statement.   Example 1: Determine whether (1, −2) and (−4, 1) are solutions to 6 x − 3 y = 12 . Solution: Substitute the x- and y-values into the equation to determine whether the ordered pair produces a true statement. Answer: (1, −2) is a solution, and (−4, 1) is not.   It is often the case that a linear equation is given in a form where one of the variables, usually y, is isolated. If this is the case, then we can check that an ordered pair is a solution by substituting in a value for one of the coordinates and simplifying to see if we obtain the other.   Example 2: Are (   1 2 ,   − 3 ) and ( − 5 ,   14 ) solutions to y = 2 x − 4 ? Solution: Substitute the x-values and simplify to see if the corresponding y-values are obtained. Answer: (   1 2 ,   − 3 ) is a solution, and ( − 5 ,   14 ) is not.   Try this! Is (6, −1) a solution to y = − 2 3 x + 3 ? Answer: Yes When given linear equations with two variables, we can solve for one of the variables, usually y, and obtain an equivalent equation as follows: Written in this form, we can see that y depends on x. Here x is the independent variable The variable that determines the values of other variables. Usually we think of the x-value as the independent variable. and y is the dependent variable The variable whose value is determined by the value of the independent variable. Usually we think of the y-value as the dependent variable. . The linear equation y = 2 x − 4 can be used to find ordered pair solutions. If we substitute any real number for x, then we can simplify to find the corresponding y-value. For example, if x = 3 , then y = 2 ( 3 ) − 4 = 6 − 4 = 2 , and we can form an ordered pair solution, (3, 2). Since there are infinitely many real numbers to choose for x, the linear equation has infinitely many ordered pair solutions (x, y).   Example 3: Find ordered pair solutions to the equation 5 x − y = 14 with the given x-values {−2, −1, 0, 4, 6}. Solution: First, solve for y. Next, substitute the x-values in the equation y = 5 x − 14 to find the corresponding y-values. Answer: {(−2, −24), (−1, −19), (0, −14), (4, 6), (6, 16)}   In the previous example, certain x-values are given, but that is not always going to be the case. When treating x as the independent variable, we can choose any values for x and then substitute them into the equation to find the corresponding y-values. This method produces as many ordered pair solutions as we wish.   Example 4: Find five ordered pair solutions to 6 x + 2 y = 10 . Solution: First, solve for y. Next, choose any set of x-values. Usually we choose some negative values and some positive values. In this case, we will find the corresponding y-values when x is {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2}. Make the substitutions required to fill in the following table (often referred to as a t-chart): Answer: {(−2, 11), (−1, 8), (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, −1)}. Since there are infinitely many ordered pair solutions, answers may vary depending on the choice of values for the independent variable.   Try this! Find five ordered pair solutions to 10 x − 2 y = 2 . Answer: {(−2, −11), (−1, −6), (0, −1), (1, 4), (2, 9)} (answers may vary) 
book2_chapter3_2_2	no label	Graph by Plotting Points Graph by Plotting Points Since the solutions to linear equations are ordered pairs, they can be graphed using the rectangular coordinate system. The set of all solutions to a linear equation can be represented on a rectangular coordinate plane using a straight line connecting at least two points; this line is called its graph A point on the number line associated with a coordinate. . To illustrate this, plot five ordered pair solutions, {(−2, 11), (−1, 8), (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, −1)}, to the linear equation 6 x + 2 y = 10 . Notice that the points are collinear; this will be the case for any linear equation. Draw a line through the points with a straightedge, and add arrows on either end to indicate that the graph extends indefinitely. The resulting line represents all solutions to , of which there are infinitely many. The steps for graphing lines by plotting points are outlined in the following example.   Example 5: Find five ordered pair solutions and graph: . Solution: Step 1: Solve for y. Step2: Choose at least two x-values and find the corresponding y-values. In this section, we will choose five real numbers to use as x-values. It is a good practice to choose 0 and some negative numbers, as well as some positive numbers. Five ordered pair solutions are {(−2, −6), (−1, −4), (0, −2), (1, 0), (2, 2)} Step 3: Choose an appropriate scale, plot the points, and draw a line through them using a straightedge. In this case, choose a scale where each tick mark on the y-axis represents 2 units because all the y-values are multiples of 2. Answer: It will not always be the case that y can be solved in terms of x with integer coefficients. In fact, the coefficients often turn out to be fractions.   Example 6: Find five ordered pair solutions and graph: . Solution: Remember that you can choose any real number for the independent variable x, so choose wisely here. Since the denominator of the coefficient of the variable x is 2, you can avoid fractions by choosing multiples of 2 for the x-values. In this case, choose the set of x-values {−6, −4, −2, 0, 2} and find the corresponding y-values. Five solutions are {(−6, −10), (−4, −5), (−2, 0), (0, 5), (2, 10)}. Here we choose to scale the x-axis with multiples of 2 and the y-axis with multiples of 5. Answer:   Try this! Find five ordered pair solutions and graph: .

book2_chapter3_2_3	no label	Horizontal and Vertical Lines Horizontal and Vertical Lines We need to recognize by inspection linear equations that represent a vertical or horizontal line.   Example 7: Graph by plotting five points: . Solution: Since the given equation does not have a variable x, we can rewrite it with a 0 coefficient for x. Choose any five values for x and see that the corresponding y-value is always −2. We now have five ordered pair solutions to plot {(−2, −2), (−1, −2), (0, −2), (1, −2), (2, −2)}. Answer: When the coefficient for the variable x is 0, the graph is a horizontal line. In general, the equation for a horizontal line Any line whose equation can be written in the form y = k, where k is a real number. can be written in the form , where k represents any real number.   Example 8: Graph by plotting five points: x = 3. Solution: Since the given equation does not have a variable y, rewrite it with a 0 coefficient for y. Choose any five values for y and see that the corresponding x-value is always 3. We now have five ordered pair solutions to plot: {(3, −2), (3, −1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)}. Answer: When the coefficient for the variable y is 0, the graph is a vertical line. In general, the equation for a vertical line Any line whose equation can be written in the form x = k, where k is a real number. can be written as , where k represents any real number.

book2_chapter3_3_1	no label	Definition of x- and y-Intercepts Definition of x- and y-Intercepts The x-intercept The point (or points) where a graph intersects the x-axis, expressed as an ordered pair (x, 0). is the point where the graph of a line intersects the x-axis. The y-intercept The point (or points) where a graph intersects the y-axis, expressed as an ordered pair (0, y). is the point where the graph of a line intersects the y-axis. These points have the form (x, 0) and (0, y), respectively. To find the x- and y-intercepts algebraically, use the fact that all x-intercepts have a y-value of zero and all y-intercepts have an x-value of zero. To find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and determine the corresponding y-value. Similarly, to find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and determine the corresponding x-value.   Example 1: Find the x- and y-intercepts: − 3 x + 2 y = 12 . Solution: To find the x-intercept, set y = 0. Therefore, the x-intercept is (−4, 0). To find the y-intercept, set x = 0. Hence the y-intercept is (0, 6). Note that this linear equation is graphed above. Answer: x-intercept: (−4, 0); y-intercept: (0, 6)   Example 2: Find the x- and y-intercepts: y = − 3 x + 9 . Solution: Begin by finding the x-intercept. The x-intercept is (3, 0). Next, determine the y-intercept. The y-intercept is (0, 9). Answer: x-intercept: (3, 0); y-intercept: (0, 9)   Keep in mind that the intercepts are ordered pairs and not numbers. In other words, the x-intercept is not x = 2 but rather (2, 0). In addition, not all graphs necessarily have both intercepts: for example, The horizontal line graphed above has a y-intercept of (0, −2) and no x-intercept. The vertical line graphed above has an x-intercept (3, 0) and no y-intercept.   Try this! Find the x- and y-intercepts: 4 x − y = 2 . Answer: x-intercept: (1/2, 0); y-intercept: (0, −2)

We have just outlined an easy method for finding intercepts; now we outline the steps for graphing lines using the intercepts.   Example 3: Graph using intercepts: 2 x − 3 y = 12 . Solution: Step 1: Find the x- and y-intercepts. Step 2: Plot the intercepts and draw the line through them. Use a straightedge to create a nice straight line. Add an arrow on either end to indicate that the line continues indefinitely in either direction. Answer:   Example 4: Graph using intercepts: y = − 1 5 x + 3 . Solution: Begin by determining the x- and y-intercepts. Next, graph the two points and draw a line through them with a straightedge. Answer:   Example 5: Graph using intercepts: y = − 2 x . Solution: Here the x- and y-intercepts are actually the same point, the origin. We will need at least one more point so that we can graph the line. Choose any value for x and determine the corresponding value for y. Use the ordered pair solutions (0, 0), (−1, 2), and (1, −2) to graph the line. Answer: To summarize, any linear equation can be graphed by finding two points and connecting them with a line drawn with a straightedge. Two important and useful points are the x- and y-intercepts; find these points by substituting y = 0 and x = 0, respectively. This method for finding intercepts will be used throughout our study of algebra.   Try this! Graph using intercepts: 3 x − 5 y = 15 . Answer: x-intercept: (5, 0); y-intercept: (0, −3) 
book2_chapter3_3_3	no label	Finding Intercepts Given the Graph Finding Intercepts Given the Graph The x- and y-intercepts are important points on any graph. This chapter will focus on the graphs of linear equations. However, at this point, we can use these ideas to determine intercepts of nonlinear graphs. Remember that intercepts are ordered pairs that indicate where the graph intersects the axes.   Example 6: Find the x- and y-intercepts given the following graph: Solution: We see that the graph intersects the x-axis in two places. This graph has two x-intercepts, namely, (−4, 0) and (2, 0). Furthermore, the graph intersects the y-axis in one place. The only y-intercept is (0, −3). Answer: x-intercepts: (−4, 0), (2, 0); y-intercept: (0, −3)   In our study of algebra, we will see that some graphs have many intercepts. Also, we will see that some graphs do not have any.   Example 7: Given the following graph, find the x- and y-intercepts: Solution: This is a graph of a circle; we can see that it does not intersect either axis. Therefore, this graph does not have any intercepts. Answer: None 
book2_chapter3_4_1	no label	Slope Slope The steepness of any incline can be measured as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change. For example, a 5% incline can be written as 5/100, which means that for every 100 feet forward, the height increases 5 feet. In mathematics, we call the incline of a line the slope The incline of a line measured as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change, often referred to as rise over run. and use the letter m to denote it. The vertical change is called the rise The vertical change between any two points on a line. and the horizontal change is called the run The horizontal change between any two points on a line. . The rise and the run can be positive or negative. A positive rise corresponds to a vertical change up and a negative rise corresponds to a vertical change down. A positive run denotes a horizontal change to the right and a negative run corresponds to a horizontal change to the left. Given the graph, we can calculate the slope by determining the vertical and horizontal changes between any two points.   Example 1: Find the slope of the given line: Solution: From the given points on the graph, count 3 units down and 4 units right. Answer: m = − 3 4   Here we have a negative slope, which means that for every 4 units of movement to the right, the vertical change is 3 units downward. There are four geometric cases for the value of the slope. Reading the graph from left to right, we see that lines with an upward incline have positive slopes and lines with a downward incline have negative slopes. If the line is horizontal, then the rise is 0: The slope of a horizontal line is 0. If the line is vertical, then the run is 0: The slope of a vertical line is undefined.   Try this! Find the slope of the given line: Answer: m = 2 3 Calculating the slope can be difficult if the graph does not have points with integer coordinates. Therefore, we next develop a formula that allows us to calculate the slope algebraically. Given any two points ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) and ( x 2 ,   y 2 ) , we can obtain the rise and run by subtracting the corresponding coordinates. This leads us to the slope formula Given two points ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) and ( x 2 ,   y 2 ) , then the slope of the line is given by the formula m = r i s e r u n = y 2 − y 1 x 2 − x 1 . . Given any two points ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) and ( x 2 ,   y 2 ) , the slope is given by   Example 2: Find the slope of the line passing through (−3, −5) and (2, 1). Solution: Given (−3, −5) and (2, 1), calculate the difference of the y-values divided by the difference of the x-values. Since subtraction is not commutative, take care to be consistent when subtracting the coordinates. Answer: m = 6 5   We can graph the line described in the previous example and verify that the slope is 6/5. Certainly the graph is optional; the beauty of the slope formula is that we can obtain the slope, given two points, using only algebra.   Example 3: Find the slope of the line passing through (−4, 3) and (−1, −7). Solution: Answer: m = − 10 3   When using the slope formula, take care to be consistent since order does matter. You must subtract the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point for both the numerator and the denominator in the same order.   Example 4: Find the slope of the line passing through (7, −2) and (−5, −2). Solution: Answer: m = 0 . As an exercise, plot the given two points and verify that they lie on a horizontal line.   Example 5: Find the slope of the line passing through (−4, −3) and (−4, 5). Solution: Answer: The slope m is undefined. As an exercise, plot the given two points and verify that they lie on a vertical line.   Try this! Calculate the slope of the line passing through (−2, 3) and (5, −5). Answer: m = − 8 7 When considering the slope as a rate of change it is important to include the correct units.   Example 6: A Corvette Coupe was purchased new in 1970 for about $5,200 and depreciated in value over time until it was sold in 1985 for $1,300. At this point, the car was beginning to be considered a classic and started to increase in value. In the year 2000, when the car was 30 years old, it sold at auction for $10,450.

book2_chapter3_4_2	no label	Slope-Intercept Form of a Line Slope-Intercept Form of a Line To this point, we have learned how to graph lines by plotting points and by using the x- and y-intercepts. In addition, we have seen that we need only two points to graph a line. In this section, we outline a process to easily determine two points using the y-intercept and the slope. The equation of any nonvertical line can be written in slope-intercept form Any nonvertical line can be written in the form y = m x + b , where m is the slope and (0, b) is the y-intercept. y = m x + b . In this form, we can identify the slope, m, and the y-intercept, (0, b).   Example 7: Determine the slope and y-intercept: y = − 4 5 x + 7 . Solution: In this form, the coefficient of x is the slope, and the constant is the y-value of the y-intercept. Therefore, by inspection, we have Answer: The y-intercept is (0, 7), and the slope is m = − 4 5 .   It is not always the case that the linear equation is given in slope-intercept form. When it is given in standard form, you have to first solve for y to obtain slope-intercept form.   Example 8: Express 3 x + 5 y = 30 in slope-intercept form and then identify the slope and y-intercept. Solution: Begin by solving for y. To do this, apply the properties of equality to first isolate 5y and then divide both sides by 5. Answer: Slope-intercept form: y = − 3 5 x + 6 ; y-intercept: (0, 6); slope: m = − 3 5   Once the equation is in slope-intercept form, we immediately have one point to plot, the y-intercept. From the intercept, you can mark off the slope to plot another point on the line. From the previous example we have Starting from the point (0, 6), use the slope to mark another point 3 units down and 5 units to the right. It is not necessary to check that the second point, (5, 3), solves the original linear equation. However, we do it here for the sake of completeness. Marking off the slope in this fashion produces as many ordered pair solutions as we desire. Notice that if we mark off the slope again, from the point (5, 3), then we obtain the x-intercept, (10, 0).   Example 9: Graph: − x + 2 y = 4 . Solution: In this example, we outline the general steps for graphing a line using slope-intercept form. Step 1: Solve for y to obtain slope-intercept form. Step 2: Identify the y-intercept and slope. Step 3: Plot the y-intercept and use the slope to find another ordered pair solution. Starting from the y-intercept, mark off the slope and identify a second point. In this case, mark a point after a rise of 1 unit and a run of 2 units. Step 4: Draw the line through the two points with a straightedge. Answer: In this example, we notice that we could get the x-intercept by marking off the slope in a different but equivalent manner. Consider the slope as the ratio of two negative numbers as follows: We could obtain another point on the line by marking off the equivalent slope down 1 unit and left 2 units. We do this twice to obtain the x-intercept, (−4, 0). Marking off the slope multiple times is not necessarily always going to give us the x-intercept, but when it does, we obtain a valuable point with little effort. In fact, it is a good practice to mark off the slope multiple times; doing so allows you to obtain more points on the line and produce a more accurate graph.   Example 10: Graph and find the x-intercept: y = 3 4 x − 2 . Solution: The equation is given in slope-intercept form. Therefore, by inspection, we have the y-intercept and slope. We can see that the x-value of the x-intercept is a mixed number between 2 and 3. To algebraically find x-intercepts, recall that we must set y = 0 and solve for x. Answer: The x-intercept is ( 2 2 3 ,   0 ) .   Example 11: Graph: x − y = 0 . Solution: Begin by solving for y. The equation y = x can be written y = 1 x + 0 , and we have Answer:   Try this! Graph − 2 x + 5 y = 20 and label the x-intercept. Answer: 
book2_chapter3_5_1	no label	Finding Equations Using Slope-Intercept Form Finding Equations Using Slope-Intercept Form Given the algebraic equation of a line, we are able to graph it in a number of ways. In this section, we will be given a geometric description of a line and be asked to find the algebraic equation. Finding the equation of a line can be accomplished in a number of ways, the first of which makes use of slope-intercept form, y = m x + b . If we know the slope, m, and the y-intercept, (0, b), we can construct the equation.   Example 1: Find the equation of a line with slope m = − 5 8 and y-intercept (0, 1). Solution: The given y-intercept implies that b = 1 . Substitute the slope m and the y-value of the y-intercept b into the equation y = m x + b . Answer: y = − 5 8 x + 1   Finding a linear equation is very straightforward if the slope and y-intercept are given. This is certainly not always the case; however, the example demonstrates that the algebraic equation of a line depends on these two pieces of information. If the graph is given, then we can often read it to determine the y-intercept and slope.   Example 2: Find the equation of the line given the graph: Solution: By reading the graph, we can see that the y-intercept is (0, 4), and thus Furthermore, from the points (0, 4) to (4, 2), we can see that the rise is −2 units and the run is 4 units. Now substitute m and b into slope-intercept form: Answer: y = − 1 2 x + 4   Often the y-intercept and slope will not be given or are not easily discernible from the graph. For this reason, we will develop some algebraic techniques that allow us to calculate these quantities.   Example 3: Find the equation of the line with slope m = − 2 3 passing through (−6, 3). Solution: Begin by substituting the given slope into slope-intercept form. For the ordered pair (−6, 3) to be a solution, it must solve the equation. Therefore, we can use it to find b. Substitute the appropriate x- and y-values as follows: After substituting the appropriate values, solve for the only remaining variable, b. Once we have b, we can then complete the equation: As a check, verify that (−6, 3) solves this linear equation as follows: Answer: y = − 2 3 x − 1   Example 4: Find the equation of the line given the graph: Solution: Use the graph to determine the slope. From the points (−5, 2) to (−1, 0), we can see that the rise between the points is −2 units and the run is 4 units. Therefore, we calculate the slope as follows: Substitute the slope into slope-intercept form. Now substitute the coordinates of one of the given points to find b. It does not matter which one you choose. Here choose (−1, 0): Next, put it all together. Answer: y = − 1 2 x − 1 2   As an exercise, substitute the coordinates of the point (−5, 2) to see that b will turn out to be the same value. In fact, you can substitute any ordered pair solution of the line to find b. We next outline an algebraic technique for finding the equation of a nonvertical line passing through two given points.   Example 5: Find the equation of the line passing through (−4, −2) and (1, 3). Solution: When finding a linear equation using slope-intercept form y = m x + b , the goal is to find m and then b. Step 1: Find the slope m. In this case, given two points, use the slope formula. Substitute m = 1 into slope-intercept form. Step 2: Find b. To do this, substitute the coordinates of any given ordered pair solution. Use (1, 3): Step 3: Finish building the equation by substituting in the value for b. In this case, we use b = 2 . Answer: y = x + 2   These three steps outline the process for finding the equation of any nonvertical line in slope-intercept form. This is a completely algebraic method, but always keep in mind the geometry behind the technique. Note that the line has a y-intercept at (0, 2), with slope m = 1 .   Example 6: Find the equation of the line passing through (−1, 3) and (5, 1). Solution: First, find m, the slope. Given two points, use the slope formula as follows: Substitute m = − 1 3 into slope-intercept form. Next, find b. Substitute the coordinates of the point (−1, 3). Finally, substitute b = 8 3 into the equation. Answer: y = − 1 3 x + 8 3   Try this! Find the equation of the line passing through (−3, 4) and (6, −2). Answer: y = − 2 3 x + 2 
book2_chapter3_5_2	no label	Finding Equations Using a Point and the Slope Finding Equations Using a Point and the Slope Given any point on a line and its slope, we can find the equation of that line. Begin by applying the slope formula with a given point ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) and a variable point ( x ,   y ) . The equation y − y 1 =   m ( x − x 1 ) is called the point-slope form of a line Any nonvertical line can be written in the form y − y 1 =   m ( x − x 1 ) , where m is the slope and ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) is any point on the line. . Any nonvertical linear equation can be written in this form. It is useful for finding the equation of a line given the slope and any ordered pair solution.   Example 7: Find the equation of the line with slope m = 1 2 passing through (4, −1). Solution: Use point-slope form, where m = 1 2 and ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) = ( 4 , − 1 ) . At this point, we must choose to present the equation of our line in either standard form or slope-intercept form. In this textbook, we will present our lines in slope-intercept form. This facilitates future graphing. Answer: y = 1 2 x − 3   Example 8: Find the equation of the line passing through (−5, 3) with slope m = − 2 5 . Solution: Substitute (−5, 3) and m = − 2 5 into point-slope form. Answer: y = − 2 5 x + 1   It is always important to understand what is occurring geometrically. Compare the answer for the last example to the corresponding graph below. The geometric understanding is important because you will often be given graphs from which you will need to determine a point on the line and the slope.   Example 9: Find an equation of the given graph: Solution: Between the points (1, 1) to (3, 0), we can see that the rise is −1 unit and the run is 2 units. The slope of the line is m = r i s e r u n = − 1 2 = − 1 2 . Use this and the point (3, 0) to find the equation as follows: Answer: y = − 1 2 x + 3 2   Example 10: Find the equation of the line passing through (−1, 1) and (7, −1). Solution: Begin by calculating the slope using the slope formula. Next, substitute into point-slope form using one of the given points; it does not matter which point is used. Use m = − 1 4 and the point (−1, 1). Answer: y = − 1 4 x + 3 4   Try this! Find the equation of the line passing through (4, −5) and (−4, 1). Answer: y = − 3 4 x − 2 
book2_chapter3_6_1	no label	Definition of Parallel and Perpendicular Definition of Parallel and Perpendicular Parallel lines Lines in the same plane that do not intersect; their slopes are the same. are lines in the same plane that never intersect. Two nonvertical lines in the same plane, with slopes m 1 and m 2 , are parallel if their slopes are the same, m 1 = m 2 . Consider the following two lines: Consider their corresponding graphs: Both lines have a slope m = 3 4 and thus are parallel. Perpendicular lines Lines in the same plane that intersect at right angles; their slopes are opposite reciprocals. are lines in the same plane that intersect at right angles (90 degrees). Two nonvertical lines in the same plane, with slopes m 1 and m 2 , are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is −1: m 1 ⋅ m 2 = − 1 . We can solve for m 1 and obtain m 1 = − 1 m 2 . In this form, we see that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals, or opposite reciprocals Two real numbers whose product is −1. Given a real number a b , the opposite reciprocal is − b a . . For example, if given a slope then the slope of a perpendicular line is the opposite reciprocal: The mathematical notation m ⊥ reads “m perpendicular.” We can verify that two slopes produce perpendicular lines if their product is −1. Geometrically, we note that if a line has a positive slope, then any perpendicular line will have a negative slope. Furthermore, the rise and run between two perpendicular lines are interchanged. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals, so remember to find the reciprocal and change the sign. In other words, Determining the slope of a perpendicular line can be performed mentally. Some examples follow. Given slope Slope of perpendicular line m = 1 2 m ⊥ = − 2 m = − 3 4 m ⊥ = 4 3 m = 3 m ⊥ = − 1 3 m = − 4 m ⊥ = 1 4   Example 1: Determine the slope of a line parallel to y = − 5 x + 3 . Solution: Since the given line is in slope-intercept form, we can see that its slope is m = − 5 . Thus the slope of any line parallel to the given line must be the same, m ∥ = − 5 . The mathematical notation m ∥ reads “m parallel.” Answer: m ∥ = − 5   Example 2: Determine the slope of a line perpendicular to 3 x − 7 y = 21 . Solution: First, solve for y and express the line in slope-intercept form. In this form, we can see that the slope of the given line is m = 3 7 , and thus m ⊥ = − 7 3 . Answer: m ⊥ = − 7 3   Try this! Find the slope of the line perpendicular to 15 x + 5 y = 20 . Answer: m ⊥ = 1 3 
book2_chapter3_6_2	no label	Finding Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines Finding Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines We have seen that the graph of a line is completely determined by two points or one point and its slope. Often you will be asked to find the equation of a line given some geometric relationship—for instance, whether the line is parallel or perpendicular to another line.   Example 3: Find the equation of the line passing through (6, −1) and parallel to y = 1 2 x + 2 . Solution: Here the given line has slope m = 1 2 , and the slope of a line parallel is m ∥ = 1 2 . Since you are given a point and the slope, use the point-slope form of a line to determine the equation. Answer: y = 1 2 x − 4   It is important to have a geometric understanding of this question. We were asked to find the equation of a line parallel to another line passing through a certain point. Through the point (6, −1) we found a parallel line, y = 1 2 x − 4 , shown dashed. Notice that the slope is the same as the given line, but the y-intercept is different. If we keep in mind the geometric interpretation, then it will be easier to remember the process needed to solve the problem.   Example 4: Find the equation of the line passing through (−1, −5) and perpendicular to y = − 1 4 x + 2 . Solution: The given line has slope m = − 1 4 , and thus m ⊥ = + 4 1 = 4 . Substitute this slope and the given point into point-slope form. Answer: y = 4 x − 1   Geometrically, we see that the line y = 4 x − 1 , shown dashed below, passes through (−1, −5) and is perpendicular to the given line. It is not always the case that the given line is in slope-intercept form. Often you have to perform additional steps to determine the slope. The general steps for finding the equation of a line are outlined in the following example.   Example 5: Find the equation of the line passing through (8, −2) and perpendicular to 6 x + 3 y = 1 . Solution: Step 1: Find the slope m. First, find the slope of the given line. To do this, solve for y to change standard form to slope-intercept form, y = m x + b . In this form, you can see that the slope is m = − 2 = − 2 1 , and thus m ⊥ = − 1 − 2 = + 1 2 . Step 2: Substitute the slope you found and the given point into the point-slope form of an equation for a line. In this case, the slope is m ⊥ = 1 2 and the given point is (8, −2). Step 3: Solve for y. Answer: y = 1 2 x − 6   Example 6: Find the equation of the line passing through ( 7 2 ,   1 ) and parallel to 2 x + 14 y = 7 . Solution: Find the slope m by solving for y. The given line has the slope m = − 1 7 , and so m ∥ = − 1 7 . We use this and the point ( 7 2 ,   1 ) in point-slope form. Answer: y = − 1 7 x + 3 2   Try this! Find the equation of the line perpendicular to x − 3 y = 9 and passing through ( − 1 2 ,   2 ) . Answer: y = − 3 x + 1 2 When finding an equation of a line perpendicular to a horizontal or vertical line, it is best to consider the geometric interpretation.   Example 7: Find the equation of the line passing through (−3, −2) and perpendicular to y = 4 . Solution: We recognize that y = 4 is a horizontal line and we want to find a perpendicular line passing through (−3, −2). If we draw the line perpendicular to the given horizontal line, the result is a vertical line. Equations of vertical lines look like x = k . Since it must pass through (−3, −2), we conclude that x = − 3 is the equation. All ordered pair solutions of a vertical line must share the same x-coordinate. Answer: x = − 3   We can rewrite the equation of any horizontal line, y = k , in slope-intercept form as follows: Written in this form, we see that the slope is m = 0 = 0 1 . If we try to find the slope of a perpendicular line by finding the opposite reciprocal, we run into a problem: m ⊥ = − 1 0 , which is undefined. This is why we took care to restrict the definition to two nonvertical lines. Remember that horizontal lines are perpendicular to vertical lines. 
book2_chapter3_7_1	no label	Relations, Functions, Domain, and Range Relations, Functions, Domain, and Range Relationships between sets occur often in everyday life. For example, for each month in Cape Canaveral, we can associate an average amount of rainfall. In this case, the amount of precipitation depends on the month of the year, and the data can be written in tabular form or as a set of ordered pairs. Month Precipitation Ordered pairs January 2.4 in (January, 2.4) February 3.3 in (February, 3.3) March 3.1 in (March, 3.1) April 2.0 in (April, 2.0) May 3.8 in (May, 3.8) June 6.8 in (June, 6.8) July 8.1 in (July, 8.1) August 7.6 in (August, 7.6) September 7.3 in (September, 7.3) October 4.1 in (October, 4.1) November 3.3 in (November, 3.3) December 2.4 in (December, 2.4) We define a relation Any set of ordered pairs. as any set of ordered pairs. Usually we write the independent component of the relation in the first column and the dependent component in the second column. In the opening example, notice that it makes sense to relate the average amount of precipitation as dependent on the month of year. The set of all elements in the first column of a relation is called the domain The set of first components of a relation. The x-values define the domain in relations consisting of points (x, y) in the rectangular coordinate plane. . The set of all elements that compose the second column is called the range The set of second components of a relation. The y-values define the range in relations consisting of points (x, y) in the rectangular coordinate plane. . In this example, the domain consists of the set of all months of the year, and the range consists of the values that represent the average rainfall for each month. In the context of algebra, the relations of interest are sets of ordered pairs (x, y) in the rectangular coordinate plane. In this case, the x-values define the domain and the y-values define the range. Of special interest are relations where every x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value; these relations are called functions Relations where every x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value. With the definition comes new notation: f ( x ) = y , which is read “f of x is equal to y.” .   Example 1: Determine the domain and range of the following relation and state whether or not it is a function: {(−1, 4), (0, 7), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, −2)}. Solution: Here we separate the domain and range and depict the correspondence between the values with arrows. Answer: The domain is {−1, 0, 2, 3, 4}, and the range is {−2, 3, 4, 7}. The relation is a function because each x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value.   Example 2: Determine the domain and range of the following relation and state whether or not it is a function: {(−4, −3), (−2, 6), (0, 3), (3, 5), (3, 7)}. Solution: Answer: The domain is {−4, −2, 0, 3}, and the range is {−3, 3, 5, 6, 7}. This relation is not a function because the x-value 3 has two corresponding y-values.   In the previous example, the relation is not a function because it contains ordered pairs with the same x-value, (3, 5) and (3, 7). We can recognize functions as relations where no x-values are repeated. In algebra, equations such as y = 3 4 x − 2 define relations. This linear equation can be graphed as follows: The graph is a relation since it represents the infinite set of ordered pair solutions to y = 3 4 x − 2 . The domain is the set of all x-values, and in this case consists of all real numbers. The range is the set of all possible y-values, and in this case also consists of all real numbers. Furthermore, the graph is a function because for each x-value there is only one corresponding y-value. In fact, any nonvertical or nonhorizontal line is a function with domain and range consisting of all real numbers. Any graph is a set of ordered pairs and thus defines a relation. Consider the following graph of a circle: Here the graph represents a relation where many x-values in the domain correspond to two y-values. If we draw a vertical line, as illustrated, we can see that (3, 2) and (3, −2) are two ordered pairs with the same x-value. Therefore, the x-value 3 corresponds to two y-values; hence the graph does not represent a function. The illustration suggests that if any vertical line intersects a graph more than once, then the graph does not represent a function. This is called the vertical line test If a vertical line intersects a graph more than once, then the graph does not represent a function. .   Example 3: Given the following graph, determine the domain and range and state whether or not it is a function. Solution: The given shape is called a parabola and extends indefinitely to the left and right as indicated by the arrows. This suggests that if we choose any x-value, then we will be able to find a corresponding point on the graph; therefore, the domain consists of all real numbers. Furthermore, the graph shows that −1 is the minimum y-value, and any y-value greater than that is represented in the relation. Hence the range consists of all y-values greater than or equal to −1, or in interval notation, [ − 1 ,   ∞ ) . Lastly, any vertical line will intersect the graph only once; therefore, it is a function. Answer: The domain is all real numbers R = (−∞, ∞), and the range is [ − 1 ,   ∞ ) . The graph represents a function because it passes the vertical line test.   Try this! Given the graph, determine the domain and range and state whether or not it is a function: Answer: Domain: [ − 4 ,   ∞ ) ; range: ( − ∞ ,   ∞ ) ; function: no 
book2_chapter3_7_2	no label	Function Notation and Linear Functions Function Notation and Linear Functions With the definition of a function comes special notation. If we consider each x-value to be the input that produces exactly one output, then we can use the notation The notation f ( x ) reads “f of x” and should not be confused with multiplication. Most of our study of algebra involves functions, so the notation becomes very useful when performing common tasks. Functions can be named with different letters; some common names for functions are g(x), h(x), C(x), and R(x). First, consider nonvertical lines that we know can be expressed using slope-intercept form, y = m x + b . For any real numbers m and b, the equation defines a function, and we can replace y with the new notation f ( x ) as follows: Therefore, a linear function Any function that can be written in the form f(x) = mx + b. is any function that can be written in the form f ( x ) = m x + b . In particular, we can write the following: The notation also shows values to evaluate in the equation. If the value for x is given as 8, then we know that we can find the corresponding y-value by substituting 8 in for x and simplifying. Using function notation, this is denoted f ( 8 ) and can be interpreted as follows: Finally, simplify: We have f ( 8 ) = 4 . This notation tells us that when x = 8 (the input), the function results in 4 (the output).   Example 4: Given the linear function f ( x ) = − 5 x + 7 , find f ( − 2 ) . Solution: In this case, f ( − 2 ) indicates that we should evaluate when x = − 2 . Answer: f ( − 2 ) = 17   Example 5: Given the linear function f ( x ) = − 5 x + 7 , find x when f ( x ) = 10 . Solution: In this case, f ( x ) = 10 indicates that the function should be set equal to 10. Answer: Here x = − 3 5 , and we can write f ( − 3 5 ) = 10 .   Example 6: Given the graph of a linear function g ( x ) , a. Find g ( 2 ) . b. Find x when g ( x ) = 3 . Solution: a. The notation g ( 2 ) implies that x = 2. Use the graph to determine the corresponding y-value. Answer: g ( 2 ) = 1 b. The notation g ( x ) = 3 implies that the y-value is given as 3. Use the graph to determine the corresponding x-value. Answer: x = 4   Example 7: Graph the linear function f ( x ) = − 5 3 x + 6 and state the domain and range. Solution: From the function, we see that b = 6 and thus the y-intercept is (0, 6). Also, we can see that the slope is m = − 5 3 = − 5 3 = r i s e r u n . Starting from the y-intercept, mark a second point down 5 units and right 3 units. Given any coordinate on the x-axis, we can find a corresponding point on the graph; the domain consists of all real numbers. Also, for any coordinate on the y-axis, we can find a point on the graph; the range consists of all real numbers. Answer: Both the domain and range consist of all real numbers R.   Try this! Given the linear function g ( x ) = − x + 5 , a. Find g ( − 1 2 ) . b. Find x when g ( x ) = 18 . Answers: a. g ( − 1 2 ) = 11 2 b. x = − 13 
book2_chapter3_8_1	no label	Solutions to Linear Inequalities Solutions to Linear Inequalities We know that a linear equation with two variables has infinitely many ordered pair solutions that form a line when graphed. A linear inequality with two variables An inequality relating linear expressions with two variables. The solution set is a region defining half of the plane. , on the other hand, has a solution set consisting of a region that defines half of the plane. For the inequality, the line defines one boundary of the region that is shaded. This indicates that any ordered pair that is in the shaded region, including the boundary line, will satisfy the inequality. To see that this is the case, choose a few test points A point not on the boundary of the linear inequality used as a means to determine in which half-plane the solutions lie. and substitute them into the inequality. Also, we can see that ordered pairs outside the shaded region do not solve the linear inequality. The graph of the solution set to a linear inequality is always a region. However, the boundary may not always be included in that set. In the previous example, the line was part of the solution set because of the “or equal to” part of the inclusive inequality ≤ . If we have a strict inequality < , we would then use a dashed line to indicate that those points are not included in the solution set. Consider the point (0, 3) on the boundary; this ordered pair satisfies the linear equation. It is the “or equal to” part of the inclusive inequality that makes it part of the solution set. So far, we have seen examples of inequalities that were “less than.” Now consider the following graphs with the same boundary: Given the graphs above, what might we expect if we use the origin (0, 0) as a test point?   Try this! Which of the ordered pairs (−2, −1), (0, 0), (−2, 8), (2, 1), and (4, 2) solve the inequality y > − 1 2 x + 2 ? Answer: (−2, 8) and (4, 2) 
book2_chapter3_8_2	no label	Graphing Solutions to Linear Inequalities Graphing Solutions to Linear Inequalities Solutions to linear inequalities are a shaded half-plane, bounded by a solid line or a dashed line. This boundary is either included in the solution or not, depending on the given inequality. If we are given a strict inequality, we use a dashed line to indicate that the boundary is not included. If we are given an inclusive inequality, we use a solid line to indicate that it is included. The steps for graphing the solution set for an inequality with two variables are outlined in the following example.   Example 1: Graph the solution set: y > − 3 x + 1 . Solution: Step 1: Graph the boundary line. In this case, graph a dashed line y = − 3 x + 1 because of the strict inequality. By inspection, we see that the slope is m = − 3 = − 3 1 = r i s e r u n and the y-intercept is (0, 1). Step 2: Test a point not on the boundary. A common test point is the origin (0, 0). The test point helps us determine which half of the plane to shade. Step 3: Shade the region containing the solutions. Since the test point (0, 0) was not a solution, it does not lie in the region containing all the ordered pair solutions. Therefore, shade the half of the plane that does not contain this test point. In this case, shade above the boundary line. Answer: Consider the problem of shading above or below the boundary line when the inequality is in slope-intercept form. If y > m x + b , then shade above the line. If y < m x + b , then shade below the line. Use this with caution; sometimes the boundary is given in standard form, in which case these rules do not apply.   Example 2: Graph the solution set: 2 x − 5 y ≥ − 10 . Solution: Here the boundary is defined by the line 2 x − 5 y = − 10 . Since the inequality is inclusive, we graph the boundary using a solid line. In this case, graph the boundary line using intercepts. Next, test a point; this helps decide which region to shade. Since the test point is in the solution set, shade the half of the plane that contains it. Answer: In this example, notice that the solution set consists of all the ordered pairs below the boundary line. This may be counterintuitive because of the original ≥ in the inequality. This illustrates that it is a best practice to actually test a point. Solve for y and you see that the shading is correct. In slope-intercept form, you can see that the region below the boundary line should be shaded. An alternate approach is to first express the boundary in slope-intercept form, graph it, and then shade the appropriate region.   Example 3: Graph the solution set: y < 2 . Solution: First, graph the boundary line y = 2 with a dashed line because of the strict inequality. Next, test a point. In this case, shade the region that contains the test point. Answer:   Try this! Graph the solution set: 5 x − y ≤ 10 . Answer: 
book2_chapter4_1_1	no label	Definition of a Linear System Definition of a Linear System Real-world applications are often modeled using more than one variable and more than one equation. A system of equations A set of two or more equations with the same variables. consists of a set of two or more equations with the same variables. In this section, we will study linear systems In this section, we restrict our study to systems of two linear equations with two variables. consisting of two linear equations each with two variables. For example, A solution to a linear system An ordered pair that satisfies both equations and corresponds to a point of intersection. , or simultaneous solution Used when referring to a solution of a system of equations. , to a linear system is an ordered pair (x, y) that solves both of the equations. In this case, (3, 2) is the only solution. To check that an ordered pair is a solution, substitute the corresponding x- and y-values into each equation and then simplify to see if you obtain a true statement for both equations.   Example 1: Determine whether (1, 0) is a solution to the system { x − y = 1 − 2 x + 3 y = 5 . Solution: Substitute the appropriate values into both equations. Answer: Since (1, 0) does not satisfy both equations, it is not a solution.   Try this! Is (−2, 4) a solution to the system {   x − y = − 6 − 2 x + 3 y = 16 ? Answer: Yes 
book2_chapter4_1_2	no label	Solve by Graphing Solve by Graphing Geometrically, a linear system consists of two lines, where a solution is a point of intersection. To illustrate this, we will graph the following linear system with a solution of (3, 2): First, rewrite the equations in slope-intercept form so that we may easily graph them. Next, replace these forms of the original equations in the system to obtain what is called an equivalent system A system consisting of equivalent equations that share the same solution set. . Equivalent systems share the same solution set. If we graph both of the lines on the same set of axes, then we can see that the point of intersection is indeed (3, 2), the solution to the system. To summarize, linear systems described in this section consist of two linear equations each with two variables. A solution is an ordered pair that corresponds to a point where the two lines in the rectangular coordinate plane intersect. Therefore, we can solve linear systems by graphing both lines on the same set of axes and determining the point where they cross. When graphing the lines, take care to choose a good scale and use a straightedge to draw the line through the points; accuracy is very important here. The steps for solving linear systems using the graphing method A means of solving a system by graphing the equations on the same set of axes and determining where they intersect. are outlined in the following example.   Example 2: Solve by graphing: { x − y = − 4 2 x + y = 1 . Solution: Step 1: Rewrite the linear equations in slope-intercept form. Step 2: Write the equivalent system and graph the lines on the same set of axes. Step 3: Use the graph to estimate the point where the lines intersect and check to see if it solves the original system. In the above graph, the point of intersection appears to be (−1, 3). Answer: (−1, 3)   Example 3: Solve by graphing: { 2 x + y = 2 − 2 x + 3 y = − 18 . Solution: We first solve each equation for y to obtain an equivalent system where the lines are in slope-intercept form. Graph the lines and determine the point of intersection. Answer: (3, −4)   Example 4: Solve by graphing: { 3 x + y = 6 y = − 3 . Solution: Answer: (3, −3)   The graphing method for solving linear systems is not ideal when the solution consists of coordinates that are not integers. There will be more accurate algebraic methods in sections to come, but for now, the goal is to understand the geometry involved when solving systems. It is important to remember that the solutions to a system correspond to the point, or points, where the graphs of the equations intersect.   Try this! Solve by graphing: { − x + y = 6   5 x + 2 y = − 2 . Answer: (−2, 4) 
book2_chapter4_1_3	no label	Dependent and Inconsistent Systems Dependent and Inconsistent Systems Systems with at least one solution are called consistent systems A system with at least one solution. . Up to this point, all of the examples have been of consistent systems with exactly one ordered pair solution. It turns out that this is not always the case. Sometimes systems consist of two linear equations that are equivalent. If this is the case, the two lines are the same and when graphed will coincide. Hence the solution set consists of all the points on the line. This is a dependent system A system that consists of equivalent equations with infinitely many ordered pair solutions, denoted by (x, mx + b). . Given a consistent linear system with two variables, there are two possible results: The solutions to independent systems A system of equations with one ordered pair solution (x, y). are ordered pairs (x, y). We need some way to express the solution sets to dependent systems, since these systems have infinitely many solutions, or points of intersection. Recall that any line can be written in slope-intercept form, y = m x + b . Here, y depends on x. So we may express all the ordered pair solutions ( x ,   y ) in the form ( x ,   m x + b ) , where x is any real number.   Example 5: Solve by graphing: { − 2 x + 3 y = − 9   4 x − 6 y = 18 . Solution: Determine slope-intercept form for each linear equation in the system. In slope-intercept form, we can easily see that the system consists of two lines with the same slope and same y-intercept. They are, in fact, the same line. And the system is dependent. Answer: ( x ,   2 3 x − 3 )   In this example, it is important to notice that the two lines have the same slope and same y-intercept. This tells us that the two equations are equivalent and that the simultaneous solutions are all the points on the line y = 2 3 x − 3 . This is a dependent system, and the infinitely many solutions are expressed using the form ( x ,   m x + b ) . Other resources may express this set using set notation, {(x, y) | y = 2 3 x − 3 }, which reads “the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) such that y equals two-thirds x minus 3.” Sometimes the lines do not cross and there is no point of intersection. Such systems have no solution, Ø, and are called inconsistent systems A system with no simultaneous solution. .   Example 6: Solve by graphing: { − 2 x + 5 y = − 15 − 4 x + 10 y = 10 . Solution: Determine slope-intercept form for each linear equation. In slope-intercept form, we can easily see that the system consists of two lines with the same slope and different y-intercepts. Therefore, they are parallel and will never intersect. Answer: There is no simultaneous solution, Ø.   Try this! Solve by graphing: { x + y = − 1 − 2 x − 2 y = 2 . Answer: ( x ,   − x − 1 ) 
book2_chapter4_2_1	no label	The Substitution Method The Substitution Method In this section, we will define a completely algebraic technique for solving systems. The idea is to solve one equation for one of the variables and substitute the result into the other equation. After performing this substitution step, we will be left with a single equation with one variable, which can be solved using algebra. This is called the substitution method A means of solving a linear system by solving for one of the variables and substituting the result into the other equation. , and the steps are outlined in the following example.   Example 1: Solve by substitution: { 2 x + y = 7 3 x − 2 y = − 7 . Solution: Step 1: Solve for either variable in either equation. If you choose the first equation, you can isolate y in one step. Step 2: Substitute the expression − 2 x + 7 for the y variable in the other equation. This leaves you with an equivalent equation with one variable, which can be solved using the techniques learned up to this point. Step 3: Solve for the remaining variable. To solve for x, first distribute −2: Step 4: Back substitute Once a value is found for a variable, substitute it back into one of the original equations, or their equivalent equations, to determine the corresponding value of the other variable. to find the value of the other coordinate. Substitute x = 1 into either of the original equations or their equivalents. Typically, we use the equivalent equation that we found when isolating a variable in step 1. The solution to the system is (1, 5). Be sure to present the solution as an ordered pair. Step 5: Check. Verify that these coordinates solve both equations of the original system: The graph of this linear system follows: The substitution method for solving systems is a completely algebraic method. Thus graphing the lines is not required. Answer: (1, 5)   Example 2: Solve by substitution: { 2 x − y = 12 x − y = 3 . Solution: In this example, we can see that x has a coefficient of 1 in the second equation. This indicates that it can be isolated in one step as follows: Substitute 3 + y for x in the first equation. Use parentheses and take care to distribute. Use x = 3 + y to find x. Answer: (9, 6). The check is left to the reader.   Example 3: Solve by substitution: { 3 x − 5 y = 17 x = − 1 . Solution: In this example, the variable x is already isolated. Hence we can substitute x = − 1 into the first equation. Answer: (−1, −4). It is a good exercise to graph this particular system to compare the substitution method to the graphing method for solving systems.   Try this! Solve by substitution: { 3 x + y = 4 8 x + 2 y = 10 . Answer: (1, 1) Solving systems algebraically frequently requires work with fractions.   Example 4: Solve by substitution: { 2 x + 8 y = 5 24 x − 4 y = − 15 . Solution: Begin by solving for x in the first equation. Next, substitute into the second equation and solve for y. Back substitute into the equation used in the substitution step: Answer: (−1/2, 3/4)   As we know, not all linear systems have only one ordered pair solution. Recall that some systems have infinitely many ordered pair solutions and some do not have any solutions. Next, we explore what happens when using the substitution method to solve a dependent system.   Example 5: Solve by substitution: { − 5 x + y = − 1 10 x − 2 y = 2 . Solution: Since the first equation has a term with coefficient 1, we choose to solve for that first. Next, substitute this expression in for y in the second equation. This process led to a true statement; hence the equation is an identity and any real number is a solution. This indicates that the system is dependent. The simultaneous solutions take the form (x, mx + b), or in this case, (x, 5x − 1), where x is any real number. Answer: ( x ,   5 x − 1 )   To have a better understanding of the previous example, rewrite both equations in slope-intercept form and graph them on the same set of axes. We can see that both equations represent the same line, and thus the system is dependent. Now explore what happens when solving an inconsistent system using the substitution method.   Example 6: Solve by substitution: { − 7 x + 3 y = 3 14 x − 6 y = − 16 . Solution: Solve for y in the first equation. Substitute into the second equation and solve. Solving leads to a false statement. This indicates that the equation is a contradiction. There is no solution for x and hence no solution to the system. Answer: No solution, Ø   A false statement indicates that the system is inconsistent, or in geometric terms, that the lines are parallel and do not intersect. To illustrate this, determine the slope-intercept form of each line and graph them on the same set of axes. In slope-intercept form, it is easy to see that the two lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts.   Try this! Solve by substitution: { 2 x − 5 y = 3 4 x − 10 y = 6 . Answer: ( x ,   2 5 x − 3 5 ) 
book2_chapter4_3_1	no label	The Elimination Method The Elimination Method In this section, the goal is to develop another completely algebraic method for solving a system of linear equations. We begin by defining what it means to add equations together. In the following example, notice that if we add the expressions on both sides of the equal sign, we obtain another true statement. This is true in general: if A, B, C, and D are algebraic expressions, then we have the following addition property of equations If A, B, C, and D are algebraic expressions, where A = B and C = D, then A + C = B + D. : For the system we add the two equations together: The sum of y and −y is zero and that term is eliminated. This leaves us with a linear equation with one variable that can be easily solved: At this point, we have the x coordinate of the simultaneous solution, so all that is left to do is back substitute to find the corresponding y-value. Hence the solution to the system is (3, 2). This process describes the elimination (or addition) method A means of solving a system by adding equivalent equations in such a way as to eliminate a variable. for solving linear systems. Of course, the variable is not always so easily eliminated. Typically, we have to find an equivalent system by applying the multiplication property of equality to one or both of the equations as a means to line up one of the variables to eliminate. The goal is to arrange that either the x terms or the y terms are opposites, so that when the equations are added, the terms eliminate. The steps for the elimination method are outlined in the following example.   Example 1: Solve by elimination: { 2 x + y = 7 3 x − 2 y = − 7 . Solution: Step 1: Multiply one, or both, of the equations to set up the elimination of one of the variables. In this example, we will eliminate the variable y by multiplying both sides of the first equation by 2. Take care to distribute. This leaves us with an equivalent system where the variable y is lined up to eliminate. Step 2: Add the equations together to eliminate one of the variables. Step 3: Solve for the remaining variable. Step 3: Back substitute into either equation or its equivalent equation. Step 4: Check. Remember that the solution must solve both of the original equations. Answer: (1, 5)   Occasionally, we will have to multiply both equations to line up one of the variables to eliminate. We want the resulting equivalent equations to have terms with opposite coefficients.   Example 2: Solve by elimination: { 5 x − 3 y = − 1 3 x + 2 y = 7 . Solution: We choose to eliminate the terms with variable y because the coefficients have different signs. To do this, we first determine the least common multiple of the coefficients; in this case, the LCM(3, 2) is 6. Therefore, multiply both sides of both equations by the appropriate values to obtain coefficients of −6 and 6. This results in the following equivalent system: The y terms are now lined up to eliminate. Back substitute. Answer: (1, 2)   Sometimes linear systems are not given in standard form. When this is the case, it is best to first rearrange the equations before beginning the steps to solve by elimination.   Example 3: Solve by elimination: { 5 x + 12 y = 11 3 y = 4 x + 1 . Solution: First, rewrite the second equation in standard form. This results in the following equivalent system where like terms are aligned in columns: We can eliminate the term with variable y if we multiply the second equation by −4. Next, we add the equations together, Back substitute. Answer: (1/3, 7/9)   Try this! Solve by elimination: { 2 x + y = − 3 − 3 x − 2 y = 4 . Answer: (−2, 1) At this point, we explore what happens when solving dependent and inconsistent systems using the elimination method.   Example 4: Solve by elimination: { 3 x − y = 7 6 x − 2 y = 14 . Solution: To eliminate the variable x, we could multiply the first equation by −2. Now adding the equations we have A true statement indicates that this is a dependent system. The lines coincide, and we need y in terms of x to present the solution set in the form ( x ,   m x + b ) . Choose one of the original equations and solve for y. Since the equations are equivalent, it does not matter which one we choose. Answer: ( x ,   3 x − 7 )   Example 5: Solve by elimination: { − x + 3 y = 9   2 x − 6 y = 12 . Solution: We can eliminate x by multiplying the first equation by 2. Now adding the equations we have A false statement indicates that the system is inconsistent. The lines are parallel and do not intersect. Answer: No solution, ∅   Try this! Solve by elimination: { 3 x + 15 y = − 15 2 x + 10 y = 30 . Answer: No solution, ∅ 
book2_chapter4_3_2	no label	Clearing Fractions and Decimals Clearing Fractions and Decimals Given a linear system where the equations have fractional coefficients, it is usually best to clear the fractions before beginning the elimination method.   Example 6: Solve: ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ − 1 10 x + 1 2 y = 4 5   1 7 x + 1 3 y = − 2 21 . Solution: Recall that we can clear fractions by multiplying both sides of an equation by the least common denominator (LCD). Take care to distribute and then simplify. This results in an equivalent system where the equations have integer coefficients, Solve using the elimination method. Back substitute. Answer: (−3, 1)   We can use a similar technique to clear decimals before solving.   Example 7: Solve: { 3 x − 0.6 y = − 0.9 − 0.5 x + 0.12 y = 0.16 . Solution: Multiply each equation by the lowest power of 10 necessary to result in integer coefficients. In this case, multiply the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 100. This results in an equivalent system where the equations have integer coefficients: Solve using the elimination method. Back substitute. Answer: (−0.2, 0.5)   Try this! Solve using elimination: ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 1 3 x − 2 3 y = 3 1 3 x − 1 2 y = 8 3 . Answer: (5, −2) 
book2_chapter4_4_1	no label	Problems Involving Relationships between Real Numbers Problems Involving Relationships between Real Numbers We now have the techniques needed to solve linear systems. For this reason, we are no longer limited to using one variable when setting up equations that model applications. If we translate an application to a mathematical setup using two variables, then we need to form a linear system with two equations.   Example 1: The sum of two numbers is 40 and their difference is 8. Find the numbers. Solution: Identify variables. Set up equations: When using two variables, we need to set up two equations. The first key phrase, “the sum of the two numbers is 40,” translates as follows: And the second key phrase, “the difference is 8,” leads us to the second equation: Therefore, our algebraic setup consists of the following system: Solve: We can solve the resulting system using any method of our choosing. Here we choose to solve by elimination. Adding the equations together eliminates the variable y. Once we have x, back substitute to find y. Check: The sum of the two numbers should be 42 and their difference 8. Answer: The two numbers are 24 and 16.   Example 2: The sum of 9 times a larger number and twice a smaller is 6. The difference of 3 times the larger and the smaller is 7. Find the numbers. Solution: Begin by assigning variables to the larger and smaller number. The first sentence describes a sum and the second sentence describes a difference. This leads to the following system: Solve using the elimination method. Multiply the second equation by 2 and add. Back substitute to find y. Answer: The larger number is 4/3 and the smaller number is −3.   Try this! The sum of two numbers is 3. When twice the smaller number is subtracted from 6 times the larger the result is 22. Find the numbers. Answer: The two numbers are −1/2 and 7/2. 
book2_chapter4_4_2	no label	Interest and Money Problems Interest and Money Problems In this section, the interest and money problems Applications involving simple interest and money. should seem familiar. The difference is that we will be making use of two variables when setting up the algebraic equations.   Example 3: A roll of 32 bills contains only $5 bills and $10 bills. If the value of the roll is $220, then how many of each bill are in the roll? Solution: Begin by identifying the variables. When using two variables, we need to set up two equations. The first equation is created from the fact that there are 32 bills. The second equation sums the value of each bill: the total value is $220. Present both equations as a system; this is our algebraic setup. Here we choose to solve by elimination, although substitution would work just as well. Eliminate x by multiplying the first equation by −5. Now add the equations together: Once we have y, the number of $10 bills, back substitute to find x. Answer: There are twenty $5 bills and twelve $10 bills. The check is left to the reader.   Example 4: A total of $6,300 was invested in two accounts. Part was invested in a CD at a 4 1 2 % annual interest rate and part was invested in a money market fund at a 3 3 4 % annual interest rate. If the total simple interest for one year was $267.75, then how much was invested in each account? Solution: The total amount in both accounts can be expressed as To set up a second equation, use the fact that the total interest was $267.75. Recall that the interest for one year is the interest rate times the principal ( I = p r t = p r ⋅ 1 = p r ). Use this to add the interest in both accounts. Be sure to use the decimal equivalents for the interest rates given as percentages. These two equations together form the following linear system: Eliminate y by multiplying the first equation by −0.0375. Next, add the equations together to eliminate the variable y. Back substitute. Answer: $4,200 was invested at 4 1 2 % and $2,100 was invested at 3 3 4 % .   At this point, we should be able to solve these types of problems in two ways: with one variable and now with two variables. Setting up word problems with two variables often simplifies the entire process, particularly when the relationships between the variables are not so clear.   Try this! On the first day of a two-day meeting, 10 coffees and 10 doughnuts were purchased for a total of $20.00. Since nobody drank the coffee and all the doughnuts were eaten, the next day only 2 coffees and 14 doughnuts were purchased for a total of $13.00. How much did each coffee and each doughnut cost? Answer: Coffee: $1.25; doughnut: $0.75 
book2_chapter4_4_3	no label	Mixture Problems Mixture Problems Mixture problems Applications involving a mixture of amounts usually given as a percentage of some total. often include a percentage and some total amount. It is important to make a distinction between these two types of quantities. For example, if a problem states that a 20-ounce container is filled with a 2% saline (salt) solution, then this means that the container is filled with a mixture of salt and water as follows: Percentage Amount Salt 2% = 0.02 0.02(20 ounces) = 0.4 ounces Water 98% = 0.98 0.98(20 ounces) = 19.6 ounces In other words, we multiply the percentage times the total to get the amount of each part of the mixture.   Example 5: A 2% saline solution is to be combined and mixed with a 5% saline solution to produce 72 ounces of a 2.5% saline solution. How much of each is needed? Solution: The total amount of saline solution needed is 72 ounces. This leads to one equation, The second equation adds up the amount of salt in the correct percentages. The amount of salt is obtained by multiplying the percentage times the amount, where the variables x and y represent the amounts of the solutions. The algebraic setup consists of both equations presented as a system: Solve. Back substitute. Answer: We need 60 ounces of the 2% saline solution and 12 ounces of the 5% saline solution.   Example 6: A 50% alcohol solution is to be mixed with a 10% alcohol solution to create an 8-ounce mixture of a 32% alcohol solution. How much of each is needed? Solution: The total amount of the mixture must be 8 ounces. The second equation adds up the amount of alcohol from each solution in the correct percentages. The amount of alcohol in the end result is 32% of 8 ounces, or 0.032(8). Now we can form a system of two linear equations and two variables as follows: In this example, multiply the second equation by 100 to eliminate the decimals. In addition, multiply the first equation by −10 to line up the variable y to eliminate. We obtain the following equivalent system: Add the equations and then solve for x: Back substitute. Answer: To obtain 8 ounces of a 32% alcohol mixture we need to mix 4.4 ounces of the 50% alcohol solution and 3.6 ounces of the 10% solution.   Try this! A 70% antifreeze concentrate is to be mixed with water to produce a 5-gallon mixture containing 28% antifreeze. How much water and antifreeze concentrate is needed? Answer: We need to mix 3 gallons of water with 2 gallons of antifreeze concentrate. 
book2_chapter4_4_4	no label	Uniform Motion Problems (Distance Problems) Uniform Motion Problems (Distance Problems) Recall that the distance traveled is equal to the average rate times the time traveled at that rate, D = r ⋅ t . These uniform motion problems Applications relating distance, average rate, and time. usually have a lot of data, so it helps to first organize that data in a chart and then set up a linear system. In this section, you are encouraged to use two variables.   Example 7: An executive traveled a total of 8 hours and 1,930 miles by car and by plane. Driving to the airport by car, she averaged 60 miles per hour. In the air, the plane averaged 350 miles per hour. How long did it take her to drive to the airport? Solution: We are asked to find the time it takes her to drive to the airport; this indicates that time is the unknown quantity. Use the formula D = r ⋅ t to fill in the unknown distances. The distance column and the time column of the chart help us to set up the following linear system. Solve. Now back substitute to find the time it took to drive to the airport x: Answer: It took her 3 hours to drive to the airport.   It is not always the case that time is the unknown quantity. Read the problem carefully and identify what you are asked to find; this defines your variables.   Example 8: Flying with the wind, an airplane traveled 1,365 miles in 3 hours. The plane then turned against the wind and traveled another 870 miles in 2 hours. Find the speed of the airplane and the speed of the wind. Solution: There is no obvious relationship between the speed of the plane and the speed of the wind. For this reason, use two variables as follows: Use the following chart to organize the data: With the wind, the airplane’s total speed is x + w . Flying against the wind, the total speed is x − w . Use the rows of the chart along with the formula D = r ⋅ t to construct a linear system that models this problem. Take care to group the quantities that represent the rate in parentheses. If we divide both sides of the first equation by 3 and both sides of the second equation by 2, then we obtain the following equivalent system: Back substitute. Answer: The speed of the airplane is 445 miles per hour and the speed of the wind is 10 miles per hour.   Try this! A boat traveled 24 miles downstream in 2 hours. The return trip, which was against the current, took twice as long. What are the speeds of the boat and of the current? Answer: The speed of the boat is 9 miles per hour and the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour. 
book2_chapter4_5_1	no label	Solutions to Systems of Linear Inequalities Solutions to Systems of Linear Inequalities A system of linear inequalities A set of two or more linear inequalities that define the conditions to be considered simultaneously. consists of a set of two or more linear inequalities with the same variables. The inequalities define the conditions that are to be considered simultaneously. For example, We know that each inequality in the set contains infinitely many ordered pair solutions defined by a region in a rectangular coordinate plane. When considering two of these inequalities together, the intersection of these sets defines the set of simultaneous ordered pair solutions. When we graph each of the above inequalities separately, we have When graphed on the same set of axes, the intersection can be determined. The intersection is shaded darker and the final graph of the solution set is presented as follows: The graph suggests that (3, 2) is a solution because it is in the intersection. To verify this, show that it solves both of the original inequalities: Points on the solid boundary are included in the set of simultaneous solutions and points on the dashed boundary are not. Consider the point (−1, 0) on the solid boundary defined by y = 2 x + 2 and verify that it solves the original system: Notice that this point satisfies both inequalities and thus is included in the solution set. Now consider the point (2, 0) on the dashed boundary defined by y = x − 2 and verify that it does not solve the original system: This point does not satisfy both inequalities and thus is not included in the solution set. 
book2_chapter4_5_2	no label	Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities Solutions to a system of linear inequalities are the ordered pairs that solve all the inequalities in the system. Therefore, to solve these systems, graph the solution sets of the inequalities on the same set of axes and determine where they intersect. This intersection, or overlap, defines the region of common ordered pair solutions.   Example 1: Graph the solution set: { − 2 x + y > − 4 3 x − 6 y ≥ 6 . Solution: To facilitate the graphing process, we first solve for y. For the first inequality, we use a dashed boundary defined by y = 2 x − 4 and shade all points above the line. For the second inequality, we use a solid boundary defined by y = 1 2 x − 1 and shade all points below. The intersection is darkened. Now we present the solution with only the intersection shaded. Answer:   Example 2: Graph the solution set: { − 2 x + 3 y > 6 4 x − 6 y > 12 . Solution: Begin by solving both inequalities for y. Use a dashed line for each boundary. For the first inequality, shade all points above the boundary. For the second inequality, shade all points below the boundary. As you can see, there is no intersection of these two shaded regions. Therefore, there are no simultaneous solutions. Answer: No solution, ∅   Example 3: Graph the solution set: ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ y ≥ − 4 y < x + 3 y ≤ − 3 x + 3 .

The positive integer exponent n indicates the number of times the base x is repeated as a factor. For example, Here the base is 5 and the exponent is 4. Exponents are sometimes indicated with the caret (^) symbol found on the keyboard: 5^4 = 5*5*5*5. Next consider the product of 2 3 and 2 5 , Expanding the expression using the definition produces multiple factors of the base, which is quite cumbersome, particularly when n is large. For this reason, we will develop some useful rules to help us simplify expressions with exponents. In this example, notice that we could obtain the same result by adding the exponents. In general, this describes the product rule for exponents x m ⋅ x n = x m + n ; the product of two expressions with the same base can be simplified by adding the exponents. . If m and n are positive integers, then In other words, when multiplying two expressions with the same base, add the exponents.   Example 1: Simplify: 10 5 ⋅ 10 18 . Solution: Answer: 10 23   In the previous example, notice that we did not multiply the base 10 times itself. When applying the product rule, add the exponents and leave the base unchanged.   Example 2: Simplify: x 6 ⋅ x 12 ⋅ x . Solution: Recall that the variable x is assumed to have an exponent of 1: x = x 1 . Answer: x 19   The base could be any algebraic expression.   Example 3: Simplify: ( x + y ) 9   ( x + y ) 13 . Solution: Treat the expression ( x + y ) as the base. Answer: ( x + y ) 22   The commutative property of multiplication allows us to use the product rule for exponents to simplify factors of an algebraic expression.   Example 4: Simplify: 2 x 8 y ⋅ 3 x 4 y 7 . Solution: Multiply the coefficients and add the exponents of variable factors with the same base. Answer: 6 x 12 y 8   Next, we will develop a rule for division by first looking at the quotient of 2 7 and 2 3 . Here we can cancel factors after applying the definition of exponents. Notice that the same result can be obtained by subtracting the exponents. This describes the quotient rule for exponents x m x n = x m − n ; the quotient of two expressions with the same base can be simplified by subtracting the exponents. . If m and n are positive integers and x ≠ 0 , then In other words, when you divide two expressions with the same base, subtract the exponents.   Example 5: Simplify: 12 y 15 4 y 7 . Solution: Divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents of the variable y. Answer: 3 y 8   Example 6: Simplify: 20 x 10 ( x + 5 ) 6 10 x 9 ( x + 5 ) 2 . Solution: Answer: 2 x ( x + 5 ) 4   Now raise 2 3 to the fourth power as follows: After writing the base 2 3 as a factor four times, expand to obtain 12 factors of 2. We can obtain the same result by multiplying the exponents. In general, this describes the power rule for exponents ( x m ) n = x m n ; a power raised to a power can be simplified by multiplying the exponents. . Given positive integers m and n, then In other words, when raising a power to a power, multiply the exponents.   Example 7: Simplify: ( y 6 ) 7 . Solution: Answer: y 42   To summarize, we have developed three very useful rules of exponents that are used extensively in algebra. If given positive integers m and n, then Product rule: x m ⋅ x n = x m + n Quotient rule: x m x n = x m − n   ,   x ≠ 0 Power rule: ( x m ) n = x m ⋅ n   Try this! Simplify: y 5 ⋅ ( y 4 ) 6 .

book2_chapter5_1_2	no label	Power Rules for Products and Quotients Power Rules for Products and Quotients Now we consider raising grouped products to a power. For example, After expanding, we have four factors of the product xy. This is equivalent to raising each of the original factors to the fourth power. In general, this describes the power rule for a product ( x y ) n = x n y n ; if a product is raised to a power, then apply that power to each factor in the product. . If n is a positive integer, then   Example 8: Simplify: ( 2 a b ) 7 . Solution: We must apply the exponent 7 to all the factors, including the coefficient, 2. If a coefficient is raised to a relatively small power, then present the real number equivalent, as we did in this example: 2 7 = 128 . Answer: 128 a 7 b 7   In many cases, the process of simplifying expressions involving exponents requires the use of several rules of exponents.   Example 9: Simplify: ( 3 x y 3 ) 4 . Solution: Answer: 81 x 4 y 12   Example 10: Simplify: ( 4 x 2 y 5 z ) 3 . Solution: Answer: 64 x 6 y 15 z 3   Example 11: Simplify: [ 5 ( x + y ) 3 ] 3 . Solution: Answer: 125 ( x + y ) 9   Next, consider a quotient raised to a power. Here we obtain four factors of the quotient, which is equivalent to the numerator and the denominator both raised to the fourth power. In general, this describes the power rule for a quotient ( x y ) n = x n y n ; if a quotient is raised to a power, then apply that power to the numerator and the denominator. . If n is a positive integer and y ≠ 0 , then In other words, given a fraction raised to a power, we can apply that exponent to the numerator and the denominator. This rule requires that the denominator is nonzero. We will make this assumption for the remainder of the section.   Example 12: Simplify: ( 3 a b ) 3 . Solution: First, apply the power rule for a quotient and then the power rule for a product. Answer: 27 a 3 b 3   In practice, we often combine these two steps by applying the exponent to all factors in the numerator and the denominator.   Example 13: Simplify: ( a b 2 2 c 3 ) 5 . Solution: Apply the exponent 5 to all of the factors in the numerator and the denominator. Answer:   a 5 b 10 32 c 15   Example 14: Simplify: ( 5 x 5 ( 2 x − 1 ) 4 3 y 7 ) 2 . Solution: Answer: 25 x 10 ( 2 x − 1 ) 8 9 y 14   It is a good practice to simplify within parentheses before using the power rules; this is consistent with the order of operations.   Example 15: Simplify: ( − 2 x 3 y 4 z x y 2 ) 4 . Solution: Answer: 16 x 8 y 8 z 4   To summarize, we have developed two new rules that are useful when grouping symbols are used in conjunction with exponents. If given a positive integer n, where y is a nonzero number, then Power rule for a product: ( x y ) n = x n y n Power rule for a quotient: ( x y ) n = x n y n   Try this!

Consider the following calculation: Eight divided by 8 is clearly equal to 1, and when the quotient rule for exponents is applied, we see that a 0 exponent results. This leads us to the definition of zero as an exponent x 0 = 1 ; any nonzero base raised to the 0 power is defined to be 1. , where x ≠ 0 : It is important to note that 0 0 is undefined. If the base is negative, then the result is still +1. In other words, any nonzero base raised to the 0 power is defined to be 1.

book2_chapter5_2_1	no label	Definitions Definitions A polynomial An algebraic expression consisting of terms with real number coefficients and variables with whole number exponents. is a special algebraic expression with terms that consist of real number coefficients and variable factors with whole number exponents. Polynomials do not have variables in the denominator of any term. The degree of a term The exponent of the variable; if there is more than one variable in the term, the degree of the term is the sum their exponents. in a polynomial is defined to be the exponent of the variable, or if there is more than one variable in the term, the degree is the sum of their exponents. Recall that x 0 = 1 ; any constant term can be written as a product of x 0 and itself. Hence the degree of a constant term is 0. Term Degree 3 x 2 2 6 x 2 y 2 + 1 = 3 7 a 2 b 3 2 + 3 = 5 8 0 , since 8 = 8 x 0 2 x 1, since x = x 1 The degree of a polynomial The largest degree of all of its terms. is the largest degree of all of its terms.

(three terms) 2 5 x 3 − 2 x 2 + 3 x − 6 Polynomial An algebraic expression consisting of terms with real number coefficients and variables with whole number exponents. (many terms) 3 In this text, we will call polynomials with four or more terms simply polynomials.   Example 1: Classify and state the degree: 7 x 2 − 4 x 5 − 1 . Solution: Here there are three terms. The highest variable exponent is 5. Therefore, this is a trinomial of degree 5. Answer: Trinomial; degree 5   Example 2: Classify and state the degree: 12 a 5 b c 3 . Solution: Since the expression consists of only multiplication, it is one term, a monomial. The variable part can be written as a 5 b 1 c 3 ; hence its degree is 5 + 1 + 3 = 9 . Answer: Monomial; degree 9   Example 3: Classify and state the degree: 4 x 2 y − 6 x y 4 + 5 x 3 y 3 + 4 . Solution: The term 4 x 2 y has degree 3; − 6 x y 4 has degree 5; 5 x 3 y 3 has degree 6; and the constant term 4 has degree 0. Therefore, the polynomial has 4 terms with degree 6. Answer: Polynomial; degree 6   Of particular interest are polynomials with one variable A polynomial where each term has the form a n x n , where a n is any real number and n is any whole number. , where each term is of the form a n x n . Here a n is any real number and n is any whole number. Such polynomials have the standard form Typically, we arrange terms of polynomials in descending order based on the degree of each term. The leading coefficient The coefficient of the term with the largest degree. is the coefficient of the variable with the highest power, in this case, a n .   Example 4: Write in standard form: 3 x − 4 x 2 + 5 x 3 + 7 − 2 x 4 . Solution: Since terms are separated by addition, write the following: In this form, we can see that the subtraction in the original corresponds to negative coefficients. Because addition is commutative, we can write the terms in descending order based on the degree of each term as follows: Answer: − 2 x 4 + 5 x 3 − 4 x 2 + 3 x + 7   We can further classify polynomials with one variable by their degree as follows: Polynomial Name 5 Constant (degree 0) 2 x + 1 Linear (degree 1) 3 x 2 + 5 x − 3 Quadratic (degree 2) x 3 + x 2 + x + 1 Cubic (degree 3) 7 x 4 + 3 x 3 − 7 x + 8 Fourth-degree polynomial In this text, we call any polynomial of degree n ≥ 4 an nth-degree polynomial. In other words, if the degree is 4, we call the polynomial a fourth-degree polynomial. If the degree is 5, we call it a fifth-degree polynomial, and so on.

book2_chapter5_5_2	no label	Dividing by a Polynomial Dividing by a Polynomial The same technique outlined for dividing by a monomial does not work for polynomials with two or more terms in the denominator. In this section, we will outline a process called polynomial long division The process of dividing two polynomials using the division algorithm. , which is based on the division algorithm for real numbers. For the sake of clarity, we will assume that all expressions in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 5: Divide: x 3 + 3 x 2 − 8 x − 4 x − 2 . Solution: Here x − 2 is the divisor and x 3 + 3 x 2 − 8 x − 4 is the dividend. Step 1: To determine the first term of the quotient, divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. Step 2: Multiply the first term of the quotient by the divisor, remembering to distribute, and line up like terms with the dividend. Step 3: Subtract the resulting quantity from the dividend. Take care to subtract both terms. Step 4: Bring down the remaining terms and repeat the process from step 1. Notice that the leading term is eliminated and that the result has a degree that is one less than the dividend. The complete process is illustrated below: Polynomial long division ends when the degree of the remainder The expression that is left after the division algorithm ends. is less than the degree of the divisor. Here the remainder is 0. Therefore, the binomial divides the polynomial evenly and the answer is the quotient shown above the division line. To check the answer, multiply the divisor by the quotient to see if you obtain the dividend: Answer: x 2 + 5 x + 2   Next, we demonstrate the case where there is a nonzero remainder. Just as with real numbers, the final answer adds the fraction where the remainder is the numerator and the divisor is the denominator to the quotient. In general, when dividing we have If we multiply both sides by the divisor we obtain   Example 6: Divide: 6 x 2 − 5 x + 3 2 x − 1 . Solution: Since the denominator is a binomial, begin by setting up polynomial long division. To start, determine what monomial times 2 x − 1 results in a leading term 6 x 2 . This is the quotient of the given leading terms: ( 6 x 2 ) ÷ ( 2 x ) = 3 x . Multiply 3 x times the divisor 2 x − 1 and line up the result with like terms of the dividend. Subtract the result from the dividend and bring down the constant term +3. Subtracting eliminates the leading term and − 5 x − ( − 3 x ) = − 5 x + 3 x = − 2 x . The quotient of − 2 x and 2 x is −1. Multiply 2 x − 1 by −1 and line up the result. Subtract again and notice that we are left with a remainder. The constant term 2 has degree 0, and thus the division ends. We may write Answer: 3 x − 1 + 2 2 x − 1 . To check that this result is correct, we multiply as follows:   Occasionally, some of the powers of the variables appear to be missing within a polynomial. This can lead to errors when lining up like terms. Therefore, when first learning how to divide polynomials using long division, fill in the missing terms with zero coefficients, called placeholders Terms with zero coefficients used to fill in all missing exponents within a polynomial. .   Example 7: Divide: 27 x 3 + 64 3 x + 4 . Solution: Notice that the binomial in the numerator does not have terms with degree 2 or 1. The division is simplified if we rewrite the expression with placeholders: Set up polynomial long division: We begin with 27 x 3 ÷ 3 x = 9 x 2 and work the rest of the division algorithm. Answer: 9 x 2 − 12 x + 16   Example 8: Divide: 3 x 4 − 2 x 3 + 6 x 2 + 23 x − 7 x 2 − 2 x + 5 . Solution: Begin the process by dividing the leading terms to determine the leading term of the quotient 3 x 4 ÷ x 2 = 3 x 2 . Take care to distribute and line up the like terms. Continue the process until the remainder has a degree less than 2. The remainder is x − 2 . Write the answer with the remainder: Answer: 3 x 2 + 4 x − 1 + x − 2 x 2 − 2 x + 5   Polynomial long division takes time and practice to master. Work lots of problems and remember that you may check your answers by multiplying the quotient by the divisor (and adding the remainder if present) to obtain the dividend.   Try this! Divide: 20 x 4 − 32 x 3 + 7 x 2 + 8 x − 10   5 x − 3 . Answer: 4 x 3 − 4 x 2 − x + 1 − 7 5 x − 3 
book2_chapter5_5_3	no label	Dividing Polynomial Functions Dividing Polynomial Functions We may use function notation to indicate division as follows: Division of functions: ( f / g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) The quotient of two polynomial functions does not necessarily have a domain of all real numbers. The values for x that make the function in the denominator 0 are restricted from the domain. This will be discussed in more detail at a later time. For now, assume all functions in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 9: Calculate: ( f / g ) ( x ) given f ( x ) = 6 x 5 − 36 x 4 + 12 x 3 − 6 x 2 and g ( x ) = − 6 x 2 . Solution: The notation indicates that we should divide: Answer: ( f / g ) ( x ) = − x 3 + 6 x 2 − 2 x + 1   Example 10: Calculate: ( f / g ) ( − 1 ) , given f ( x ) = − 3 x 3 + 7 x 2 − 11 x − 1 and g ( x ) = 3 x − 1 . Solution: First, determine ( f / g ) ( x ) . Therefore, Substitute −1 for the variable x . Answer: ( f / g ) ( − 1 ) = − 4 
book2_chapter5_6_1	no label	Negative Exponents Negative Exponents In this section, we define what it means to have negative integer exponents. We begin with the following equivalent fractions: Notice that 4, 8, and 32 are all powers of 2. Hence we can write 4 = 2 2 , 8 = 2 3 , and 32 = 2 5 . If the exponent of the term in the denominator is larger than the exponent of the term in the numerator, then the application of the quotient rule for exponents results in a negative exponent. In this case, we have the following: We conclude that 2 − 3 = 1 2 3 . This is true in general and leads to the definition of negative exponents x − n = 1 x n , given any integer n, where x is nonzero. . Given any integer n and x ≠ 0 , then Here x ≠ 0 because 1 0 is undefined. For clarity, in this section, assume all variables are nonzero. Simplifying expressions with negative exponents requires that we rewrite the expression with positive exponents.   Example 1: Simplify: 10 − 2 . Solution: Answer: 1 100   Example 2: Simplify: ( − 3 ) − 1 . Solution: Answer: − 1 3   Example 3: Simplify: 1 y − 3 . Solution: Answer: y 3   At this point we highlight two very important examples, If the grouped quantity is raised to a negative exponent, then apply the definition and write the entire grouped quantity in the denominator. If there is no grouping, then apply the definition only to the base preceding the exponent.   Example 4: Simplify: ( 2 a b ) − 3 . Solution: First, apply the definition of −3 as an exponent and then apply the power of a product rule. Answer: 1 8 a 3 b 3   Example 5: Simplify: ( − 3 x y 3 ) − 2 . Solution: Answer: 1 9 x 2 y 6   Example 6: Simplify: x − 3 y − 4 . Solution: Answer: y 4 x 3   The previous example suggests a property of quotients with negative exponents x − n y − m = y m x n , given any integers m and n, where x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0 . . If given any integers m and n, where x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0 , then In other words, negative exponents in the numerator can be written as positive exponents in the denominator, and negative exponents in the denominator can be written as positive exponents in the numerator.   Example 7: Simplify: − 2 x − 5 y 3 z − 2 . Solution: Take care with the coefficient −2; recognize that this is the base and that the exponent is actually +1: − 2 = ( − 2 ) 1 . Hence the rules of negative exponents do not apply to this coefficient; leave it in the numerator. Answer: − 2 y 3 z 2 x 5   Example 8: Simplify: ( − 3 x − 4 ) − 3 y − 2 . Solution: Apply the power of a product rule before applying negative exponents. Answer: − x 12 y 2 27   Example 9: Simplify: ( 3 x 2 ) − 4 ( − 2 y − 1 z 3 ) − 2 . Solution: Answer: 4 z 6 81 x 8 y 2   Example 10: Simplify: ( 5 x 2 y ) 3 x − 5 y − 3 . Solution: First, apply the power of a product rule and then the quotient rule.

book2_chapter5_6_2	no label	Scientific Notation Scientific Notation Real numbers expressed in scientific notation Real numbers expressed in the form a × 10 n , where n is an integer and 1 ≤ a < 10 . have the form where n is an integer and 1 ≤ a < 10 . This form is particularly useful when the numbers are very large or very small. For example, It is cumbersome to write all the zeros in both of these cases. Scientific notation is an alternative, compact representation of these numbers. The factor 10 n indicates the power of 10 to multiply the coefficient by to convert back to decimal form: This is equivalent to moving the decimal in the coefficient fifteen places to the right. A negative exponent indicates that the number is very small: This is equivalent to moving the decimal in the coefficient eleven places to the left. Converting a decimal number to scientific notation involves moving the decimal as well. Consider all of the equivalent forms of 0.00563 with factors of 10 that follow: While all of these are equal, 5.63 × 10 − 3 is the only form considered to be expressed in scientific notation. This is because the coefficient 5.63 is between 1 and 10 as required by the definition. Notice that we can convert 5.63 × 10 − 3 back to decimal form, as a check, by moving the decimal to the left three places.   Example 11: Write 1,075,000,000,000 using scientific notation. Solution: Here we count twelve decimal places to the left of the decimal point to obtain the number 1.075. Answer: 1.075 × 10 12   Example 12: Write 0.000003045 using scientific notation. Solution: Here we count six decimal places to the right to obtain 3.045. Answer: 3.045 × 10 − 6   Often we will need to perform operations when using numbers in scientific notation. All the rules of exponents developed so far also apply to numbers in scientific notation.   Example 13: Multiply: ( 4.36 × 10 − 5 ) ( 5.3 × 10 12 ) . Solution: Use the fact that multiplication is commutative and apply the product rule for exponents. Answer: 2.3108 × 10 8   Example 14: Divide: ( 3.24 × 10 8 ) ÷ ( 9.0 × 10 − 3 ) . Solution: Answer: 3.6 × 10 10   Example 15: The speed of light is approximately 6.7 × 10 8 miles per hour. Express this speed in miles per second. Solution: A unit analysis indicates that we must divide the number by 3,600. Answer: The speed of light is approximately 1.9 × 10 5 miles per second.   Example 16: By what factor is the radius of the sun larger than the radius of earth? Solution: We want to find the number that when multiplied times the radius of earth equals the radius of the sun. Source: NASA and European Space Agency, from http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=188. Therefore, Answer: The radius of the sun is approximately 110 times that of earth.   Try this! Divide: ( 6.75 × 10 − 8 ) ÷ ( 9 × 10 − 17 ) . Answer: 7.5 × 10 8 
book2_chapter6_1_1	no label	GCF of Natural Numbers GCF of Natural Numbers The process of writing a number or expression as a product is called factoring The process of writing a number or expression as a product. . If we write 60 = 5 ⋅ 12, we say that the product 5 ⋅ 12 is a factorization Any combination of factors, multiplied together, resulting in the product. of 60 and that 5 and 12 are factors Any of the numbers or expressions that form a product. . Typically, there are many ways to factor a number. For example, Recall that a prime number is defined as a natural number with exactly two natural number factors, 1 and itself. The first ten prime numbers follow: Any natural number greater than 1 can be uniquely written as a product of prime numbers. This product is called the prime factorization The unique factorization of a natural number written as a product of primes. . The prime factorization of 60 can be determined by continuing to factor until only a product of prime numbers remains. Since the prime factorization is unique, it does not matter how we choose to initially factor the number; the end result will be the same. The prime factorization of 60 follows: Recall that the greatest common factor (GCF) The product of all the common prime factors. of any two natural numbers is the product of all the common prime factors.   Example 1: Find the GCF of 60 and 140. Solution: First, determine the prime factorizations of both integers. The product of the common prime factors is 2 2 ⋅ 5 ; hence the GCF ( 60 ,   140 ) = 2 2 ⋅ 5 = 20 . To see that it is the greatest common factor, we can write the following: Answer: The greatest common factor of 60 and 140 is 20.   Example 2: Find the GCF of 504 and 1,080. Solution: First, determine the prime factorizations of both integers. The product of the common prime factors is 2 3 ⋅ 3 2 . The GCF ( 504 ,   1080 ) = 2 3 ⋅ 3 2 = 72 . Note that we multiplied the common prime factors with the smallest exponent. The numbers 7 and 15 share no common natural number factor other than 1; we say that they are relatively prime Expressions that share no common factors other than 1. . Answer: The greatest common factor of 504 and 1,080 is 72. 
book2_chapter6_1_2	no label	GCF of Monomials GCF of Monomials We next consider factorizations of monomials. For example, 6 x and x 4 are factors of 6 x 5 because 6 x 5 = 6 x ⋅ x 4 . Typically, there are many ways to factor a monomial. Some factorizations of 6 x 5 follow: Given two or more monomials, it will be useful to find the greatest common monomial factor of each. For example, consider 6 x 5 y 3 z and 8 x 2 y 3 z 2 . The variable part of these two monomials look very much like the prime factorization of natural numbers and, in fact, can be treated the same way. Steps for finding the GCF of monomials The product of the GCF of the coefficients and all common variable factors. are outlined in the following example.   Example 3: Find the GCF of 6 x 5 y 3 z and 8 x 2 y 3 z 2 . Solution: Step 1: Find the GCF of the coefficients. In this case, the G C F ( 6 ,   8 ) = 2 . Step 2: Determine the common variable factors with smallest exponents. In this case, the common variables with the smallest exponents are x 2 , y 3 , and z 1 . Step 3: The GCF of the monomials is the product of the common variable factors and the GCF of the coefficients. Therefore, Answer: 2 x 2 y 3 z   It is worth pointing out that the GCF in the previous example divides both expressions evenly: Furthermore, we can write the following: The factors 3 x 3 and 4 z share no common monomial factors other than 1; they are relatively prime.   Example 4: Determine the GCF of the following expressions: 30 x 6 y and 18 x 4 y 2 z . Solution: The prime factorizations of the coefficients are Thus the GCF(30, 18) = 2 ⋅ 3 = 6. Next, consider the variable part: The variable factors in common are x 4 and y. The factor z is not in common and we have Answer: 6 x 4 y   Example 5: Determine the GCF of the following three expressions: 12 a 5 b 2 ( a + b ) 5 , 60 a 4 b 3 c ( a + b ) 3 , and 24 a 2 b 7 c 3 ( a + b ) 2 . Solution: First, determine the GCF of the coefficients. The GCF ( 12, 60, 24 ) = 2 2 ⋅ 3 = 12 . Next, determine the common factors of the variable part: The variable factors in common are a 2 , b 2 , and ( a + b ) 2 . Therefore, Answer: 12 a 2 b 2 ( a + b ) 2 . Note that the variable c is not common to all three expressions and thus is not included in the GCF.   Try this! Determine the GCF of the following: 60 x 4 y 3 ( x + 2 y ) 7 , 45 x 2 y 5 ( x + 2 y ) 4 , and 30 x 7 y 7 ( x + 2 y ) 3 . Answer: 15 x 2 y 3 ( x + 2 y ) 3 
book2_chapter6_1_3	no label	Factoring out the GCF Factoring out the GCF We have seen that application of the distributive property is the key to multiplying polynomials. The process of factoring a polynomial The process of rewriting a polynomial as a product of polynomial factors. involves using the distributive property in reverse to write each polynomial as a product of polynomial factors. To demonstrate this idea, we multiply and factor side by side. Factoring utilizes the GCF of the terms. In the previous example, we see that the distributive property allows us to write the polynomial 6 x 5 + 8 x 2 as a product of the two factors 2 x 2 and ( 3 x 3 + 4 ) . Note that in this case, 2 x 2 is the GCF of the terms of the polynomial: Factoring out the GCF The process of rewriting a polynomial as a product using the GCF of all of its terms. involves rewriting a polynomial as a product where a factor is the GCF of all of its terms: The steps for factoring out the GCF of a polynomial The greatest common factor of all the terms of the polynomial. are outlined in the following example.   Example 6: Factor out the GCF: 7 x 4 + 21 x 3 − 14 x 2 . Solution: Step 1: Identify the GCF of all the terms. In this case, the GCF(7, 21, 14) = 7, and the common variable factor with the smallest exponent is x 2 . The GCF of the polynomial is 7 x 2 . Step 2: Determine the terms of the missing factor by dividing each term of the original expression by the GCF. (This step is usually performed mentally.) Step 3: Apply the distributive property (in reverse) using the terms found in the previous step. Step 4: As a check, multiply using the distributive property to verify that the product equals the original expression. (This step is optional and can be performed mentally.) Answer: 7 x 2 ( x 2 + 3 x − 2 )   Example 7: Factor out the GCF: 48 a − 16 b + 4 c . Solution: There are no variable factors in common and the GCF(48, 16, 4) = 4. Answer: 4 ( 12 a − 4 b + c )   Example 8: Factor out the GCF: 25 x 3 + 15 x 2 + 5 x . Solution: The GCF(25, 15, 5) = 5, and the common variable factor with smallest exponents is x 1 . The GCF of all the terms is 5 x . Answer: 5 x ( 5 x 2 + 3 x + 1 )   If the GCF is the same as one of the terms, then, after the GCF is factored out, a constant term 1 will remain. In the previous example, we can see that 5 x 5 x = 1 . The importance of remembering the constant term becomes clear when performing the check using the distributive property: The constant term 1 allows us to obtain the same original expression after we distribute.   Example 9: Factor out the GCF: 15 x 6 y 4 + 10 x 5 y 3 z 2 − 20 x y 6 z 3 . Solution: The G C F ( 10 ,   15 ,   20 ) = 5 , and the common variables with smallest exponent are x 1 and y 3 . Therefore, the GCF of the terms is 5 x y 3 . The first term does not have a variable factor of z and thus cannot be a part of the greatest common factor. If we divide each term by 5 x y 3 , we obtain and can write Answer: 5 x y 3 ( 3 x 5 y + 2 x 4 z 2 − 4 y 3 z 3 )   Example 10: Factor out the GCF: 24 a 6 b 2 c 5 + 8 a 7 b 5 c . Solution: The GCF(24, 8) = 8, and the variable factors with smallest exponents are a 6 , b 2 , and c . Therefore, the GCF of all the terms is 8 a 6 b 2 c . Answer: 8 a 6 b 2 c ( 3 c 4 + a b 3 )   Of course, not all polynomials with integer coefficients can be factored as a product of polynomials with integer coefficients other than 1 and itself. If this is the case, then we say that it is a prime polynomial A polynomial with integer coefficients that cannot be factored as a product of polynomials with integer coefficients other than 1 and itself. .   Example 11: Factor: 3 x − 5 . Solution: Prime: there are no polynomial factors other than 1 and itself. Answer: Prime   Try this! Factor out the GCF: 16 x 4 y 3 − 8 x 2 y 5 − 4 x 2 y . Answer: 4 x 2 y ( 4 x 2 y 2 − 2 y 4 − 1 ) 
book2_chapter6_1_4	no label	Factor by Grouping Factor by Grouping In this section, we outline a technique for factoring polynomials with four terms. First, review some preliminary examples where the terms have a common binomial factor.   Example 12: Factor: 5 x ( x − 3 ) + 2 ( x − 3 ) . Solution: This expression is a binomial with terms 5 x ( x − 3 ) and 2 ( x − 3 ) . In this case, ( x − 3 ) is a common factor. Begin by factoring this common factor out: To determine the terms of the remaining factor, divide each term by ( x − 3 ) : This step is typically performed mentally. We have Answer: ( x − 3 ) ( 5 x + 2 )   Recall that 1 is always a common factor. If the GCF is the same as a term, then the factor 1 remains after we factor out that GCF.   Example 13: Factor: 3 x ( 4 x + 1 ) − ( 4 x + 1 ) . Solution: Rewrite the second term − ( 4 x + 1 ) as − 1 ( 4 x + 1 ) and then factor out the common binomial factor ( 4 x + 1 ) . Answer: ( 4 x + 1 ) ( 3 x − 1 )   Remember that the goal for this section is to develop a technique that enables us to factor polynomials with four terms into a product of binomials. The intermediate step of this process looks like the previous two examples. For example, we wish to factor Begin by grouping the first two terms and the last two terms. Then factor out the GCF of each grouping: In this form, it is a binomial with a common binomial factor, ( x − 3 ) . The steps that follow outline a technique for factoring four-term polynomials called factor by grouping A technique for factoring polynomials with four terms. .   Example 14: Factor: 2 x 3 + 4 x 2 + 3 x + 6 . Solution: Group terms in such a way as to obtain a binomial with common factors. Step 1: Group the first two and last two terms and then factor out the GCF of each. The GCF of the first two terms is 2 x 2 , and the GCF of the second two terms is 3. Step 2: At this point, the polynomial is a binomial. Factor out any factors common to both terms. Here ( x + 2 ) is a common factor. Step 3: Optional check: multiply to verify that we obtain the original expression. Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( 2 x 2 + 3 )   Example 15: Factor: 2 a 3 − 3 a 2 + 2 a − 3 . Solution: The GCF of the first two terms is a 2 and the GCF of the second two terms is 1. Answer: ( 2 a − 3 ) ( a 2 + 1 ) . The check is left to the reader.   Example 16: Factor: 6 x 4 − 24 x 3 − 5 x + 20 . Solution: The GCF for the first group is 6 x 3 . We have to choose 5 or −5 to factor out of the second group. Factoring out a +5 does not result in a common binomial factor. If we choose to factor out −5, then we obtain a common binomial factor and can proceed. Note that when factoring out a negative number, we change the signs of the factored terms. Answer: ( x − 4 ) ( 6 x 3 − 5 ) . The check is left to the reader. Tip The sign of the leading coefficient in the second grouping usually indicates whether or not to factor out a negative factor. If that coefficient is positive, factor out a positive factor. If it is negative, factor out a negative factor. When all the terms of a polynomial have a GCF other than 1, it is a best practice to factor that out before factoring by grouping.   Example 17: Factor: 3 y 4 + 9 y 2 − 6 y 3 − 18 y . Solution: Here we notice that the greatest common factor of all the terms is 3 y . Begin by factoring out the GCF and then factor the result by grouping. Answer: 3 y ( y 2 + 3 ) ( y − 2 )   Sometimes we must first rearrange the terms in order to obtain a common factor.   Example 18: Factor: a b − 2 a 2 b + a 3 − 2 b 3 . Solution: Simply factoring the GCF out of the first group and last group does not yield a common binomial factor. We must rearrange the terms, searching for a grouping that produces a common factor. In this example, we have a workable grouping if we switch the terms a 3 and a b . Answer: ( a − 2 b ) ( a 2 + b )   Not all factorable four-term polynomials can be factored with this technique. For example, This four-term polynomial cannot be grouped in any way as to produce a common binomial factor. Despite this, the polynomial is not prime and can be written as a product of polynomials. It can be factored as follows: Factoring such polynomials is something that we will learn to do as we move further along in our study of algebra. For now, we will limit our attempt to factor four-term polynomials to using the factor by grouping technique.   Try this! Factor: x 3 − x 2 y − x y + y 2 . Answer: ( x − y ) ( x 2 − y ) 
book2_chapter6_2_1	no label	Factoring Trinomials of the Form x^2 + bx + c Factoring Trinomials of the Form x^2 + bx + c Some trinomials of the form x 2 + b x + c can be factored as a product of binomials. For example, We can verify this factorization by multiplying: Factoring trinomials requires that we work the distributive process in reverse. Notice that the product of the first terms of each binomial is equal to the first term of the trinomial. The middle term of the trinomial, 7x, is the sum of the products of the outer and inner terms of the binomials: And the product of the last terms of each binomial is equal to the last term of the trinomial. This can be visually interpreted as follows: If a trinomial of this type factors, then these relationships will be true: This gives us In short, if the leading coefficient of a factorable trinomial is one, then the factors of the last term must add up to the coefficient of the middle term. This observation is the key to factoring trinomials using the technique known as trial and error Describes the method of factoring a trinomial by systematically checking factors to see if their product is the original trinomial. (or guess and check Used when referring to the trial and error method for factoring trinomials. ). The steps are outlined in the following example.   Example 1: Factor: x 2 + 7 x + 12 . Solution: Note that the polynomial to be factored has three terms; it is a trinomial with a leading coefficient of 1. Use trial and error to factor as follows: Step 1: Write two sets of blank parentheses. If a trinomial of this form factors, then it will factor into two linear binomial factors. Step 2: Write the factors of the first term in the first space of each set of parentheses. In this case, factor x 2 = x ⋅ x . Step 3: Determine the factors of the last term whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term. To do this, list all of the factorizations of 12 and search for factors whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term, 7. Choose 12 = 3 ⋅ 4 because 3 + 4 = 7. Step 4: Write in the last term of each binomial using the factors determined in the previous step. Step 5: Check by multiplying the two binomials. Answer: ( x + 3 ) ( x + 4 )   Since multiplication is commutative, the order of the factors does not matter. If the last term of the trinomial is positive, then either both of the constant factors must be negative or both must be positive. Therefore, when looking at the list of factorizations of the last term, we are searching for sums that are equal to the coefficient of the middle term.   Example 2: Factor: x 2 − 9 x + 20 . Solution: First, factor x 2 = x ⋅ x . Next, determine which factors of 20 add up to −9: In this case, choose −4 and −5 because ( − 4 ) ( − 5 ) = + 20 and − 4 + ( − 5 ) = − 9 . Check. Answer: ( x − 4 ) ( x − 5 )   If the last term of the trinomial is negative, then one of its factors must be negative. In this case, search the list of factorizations of the last term for differences that equal the coefficient of the middle term.   Example 3: Factor: x 2 − 4 x − 12 . Solution: Begin by factoring the first term x 2 = x ⋅ x . The factors of 12 are listed below. In this example, we are looking for factors whose difference is −4. Here choose the factors 2 and −6 because the coefficient of the middle term, −4, is obtained if we add 2 + ( − 6 ) . Multiply to check. Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( x − 6 )   Often our first guess will not produce a correct factorization. This process may require repeated trials. For this reason, the check is very important and is not optional.   Example 4: Factor: x 2 + 5 x − 6 . Solution: The first term of this trinomial x 2 factors as x ⋅ x . Consider the factors of 6: Suppose we choose the factors 2 and 3 because 2 + 3 = 5, the coefficient of the middle term. Then we have the following incorrect factorization: When we multiply to check, we find the error. In this case, the middle term is correct but the last term is not. Since the last term in the original expression is negative, we need to choose factors that are opposite in sign. Therefore, we must try again. This time we choose the factors −1 and 6 because − 1 + 6 = 5 . Now the check shows that this factorization is correct. Answer: ( x − 1 ) ( x + 6 )   If we choose the factors wisely, then we can reduce much of the guesswork in this process. However, if a guess is not correct, do not get discouraged; just try a different set of factors.   Example 5: Factor: x 2 + 3 x + 20 . Solution: Here there are no factors of 20 whose sum is 3. Therefore, the original trinomial cannot be factored as a product of two binomials. This trinomial is prime. Answer: Prime   Try this! Factor: x 2 − 13 x − 30 . Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( x − 15 ) The techniques described can also be used to factor trinomials with more than one variable.   Example 6: Factor: x 2 − 14 x y − 72 y 2 . Solution: The first term x 2 factors as x ⋅ x . Next, look for factors of the coefficient of the last term, 72, whose sum is −14. Therefore, the coefficient of the last term can be factored − 72 = 4 ( − 18 ) , where 4 + ( − 18 ) = − 14 . Because the last term has a variable factor of y 2 , factor 72 y 2 as 4 y ( − 18 y ) and try the following factorization: Multiply to check. Visually, we have the following: Answer: ( x + 4 y ) ( x − 18 y )   Try this! Factor: x 2 y 2 + 9 x y − 10 . Answer: ( x y − 1 ) ( x y + 10 ) 
book2_chapter6_2_2	no label	Factoring Using the AC Method Factoring Using the AC Method An alternate technique for factoring trinomials, called the AC method Method for factoring trinomials by replacing the middle term with two terms that allow us to factor the resulting four-term polynomial by grouping. , makes use of the grouping method for factoring four-term polynomials. If a trinomial in the form a x 2 + b x + c can be factored, then the middle term, bx, can be replaced with two terms with coefficients whose sum is b and product ac. This substitution results in an equivalent expression with four terms that can be factored by grouping. The steps are outlined in the following example.   Example 7: Factor using the AC method: x 2 − x − 30 . Solution: In this example a = 1, b = −1, and c = −30. Step 1: Determine the product ac. Step 2: Find factors of ac whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term, b. We can see that the sum of the factors 5 and −6 is equal to the coefficient of the middle term, −1. Step 3: Use the factors as coefficients for the terms that replace the middle term. Here − x = − 6 x + 5 x . Write Step 4: Factor the equivalent expression by grouping. Answer: ( x − 6 ) ( x + 5 )   Notice that the AC method is consistent with the trial and error method. Both methods require that b = m + n , where c = m n . In the example above, − 30 = ( − 6 ) ( 5 ) and − 1 = ( − 6 ) + 5 . The only difference between the methods, when the leading coefficient is 1, is in the process used to obtain the final factorization.   Example 8: Factor: y 2 − 14 x + 48 . Solution: Here ac = 48 and we search for factors whose sum is −14. Therefore, − 14 x = − 6 x − 8 x . Substitute the new terms and factor by grouping. Answer: ( x − 6 ) ( x − 8 ) . The check is left to the reader.   At this point, it is recommended that the reader stop and factor as many trinomials of the form x 2 + b x + c as time allows before moving on to the next section. Factoring trinomials is one of the more important skills that we learn in this course and should be mastered. 
book2_chapter6_3_1	no label	Factoring Trinomials of the Form ax^2 + bx + c Factoring Trinomials of the Form ax^2 + bx + c Factoring trinomials of the form a x 2 + b x + c can be challenging because the middle term is affected by the factors of both a and c. To illustrate this, consider the following factored trinomial: We can multiply to verify that this is the correct factorization. As we have seen before, the product of the first terms of each binomial is equal to the first term of the trinomial. The middle term of the trinomial is the sum of the products of the outer and inner terms of the binomials. The product of the last terms of each binomial is equal to the last term of the trinomial. Visually, we have the following: In general, This gives us, In short, when the leading coefficient of a trinomial is something other than 1, there will be more to consider when determining the factors using the trial and error method. The key lies in the understanding of how the middle term is obtained. Multiply ( 2 x + 5 ) ( 3 x + 7 ) and carefully follow the formation of the middle term. If we think of the FOIL method for multiplying binomials, then the middle term results from the sum of the inner product and the outer product. In this case, 14 x + 15 x = 29 x , as illustrated below: For this reason, we need to look for products of the factors of the first and last terms whose sum is equal to the coefficient of the middle term. For example, to factor 6 x 2 + 29 x + 35 , look at the factors of 6 and 35. The combination that produces the coefficient of the middle term is 2 ⋅ 7 + 3 ⋅ 5 = 14 + 15 = 29 . Make sure that the outer terms have coefficients 2 and 7, and that the inner terms have coefficients 5 and 3. Use this information to factor the trinomial:   Example 1: Factor: 3 x 2 + 7 x + 2 . Solution: Since the leading coefficient and the last term are both prime, there is only one way to factor each. Begin by writing the factors of the first term, 3 x 2 , as follows: The middle and last term are both positive; therefore, the factors of 2 are chosen as positive numbers. In this case, the only choice is in which grouping to place these factors. Determine which grouping is correct by multiplying each expression. Notice that these products differ only in their middle terms. Also, notice that the middle term is the sum of the inner and outer product, as illustrated below: Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( 3 x + 1 )   Example 2: Factor: 12 x 2 + 38 x + 20 . Solution: First, consider the factors of the first and last terms. We search for products of factors whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term, 38. For brevity, the thought process is illustrated starting with the factors 2 and 6. Factoring begins at this point with the first term. We search for factors of 20 that along with the factors of 12 produce a middle term of 38x. Here the last combination produces a middle term of 38x. Answer: ( 2 x + 5 ) ( 6 x + 4 )   Example 3: Factor: 10 x 2 − 23 x + 6 . Solution: First, consider the factors of the first and last terms. We are searching for products of factors whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term, −23. Factoring begins at this point with two sets of blank parentheses: Since the last term is positive and the middle term is negative, we know that both factors of the last term must be negative. Here we list all possible combinations with the factors of 10 x 2 = 2 x ⋅ 5 x . There is no combination that produces a middle term of − 23 x . We then move on to the factors of 10 x 2 = 10 x ⋅ x and list all possible combinations: And we can write Answer: ( 10 x − 3 ) ( x − 2 ) . The complete check is left to the reader.   We can reduce much of the guesswork involved in factoring trinomials if we consider all of the factors of the first and last terms and their products.   Example 4: Factor: 5 x 2 + 38 x − 16 . Solution: We begin with the factors of 5 and 16. Since the leading coefficient is prime, we can begin with the following: We look for products of the factors of 5 and 16 that could possibly add to 38. Since the last term is negative, we must look for factors with opposite signs. Here we can see that the products 2 and 40 add up to 38 if they have opposite signs: Therefore, use −2 and 8 as the factors of 16, making sure that the inner and outer products are − 2 x and 40 x : Answer: ( x + 8   ) ( 5 x − 2 ) . The complete check is left to the reader.   After lots of practice, the process described in the previous example can be performed mentally.   Try this! Factor: 12 x 2 − 31 x − 30 . Answer: ( 3 x − 10 ) ( 4 x + 3 ) When given trinomials with multiple variables, the process is similar.   Example 5: Factor: 9 x 2 + 30 x y + 25 y 2 . Solution: Search for factors of the first and last terms such that the sum of the inner and outer products equals the middle term. Add the following products to obtain the middle term: 3 x ⋅ 5 y + 3 x ⋅ 5 y = 30 x y . In this example, we have a perfect square trinomial. Check. Answer: ( 3 x + 5 y ) 2   Try this! Factor: 16 x 2 − 24 x y + 9 y 2 . Answer: ( 4 x − 3 y ) 2 
book2_chapter6_3_2	no label	Factoring Trinomials with Common Factors Factoring Trinomials with Common Factors It is a good practice to first factor out the GCF, if there is one. Doing this produces a trinomial factor with smaller coefficients. As we have seen, trinomials with smaller coefficients require much less effort to factor. This commonly overlooked step is worth identifying early.   Example 6: Factor: 12 x 2 − 27 x + 6 . Solution: Begin by factoring out the GCF. After factoring out 3, the coefficients of the resulting trinomial are smaller and have fewer factors. After some thought, we can see that the combination that gives the coefficient of the middle term is 4 ( − 2 ) + 1 ( − 1 ) = − 8 − 1 = − 9 . Check. The factor 3 is part of the factored form of the original expression; be sure to include it in the answer. Answer: 3 ( 4 x − 1 ) ( x − 2 )   It is a good practice to consistently work with trinomials where the leading coefficient is positive.   Example 7: Factor: − x 2 + 2 x + 15 . Solution: In this example, the leading coefficient is −1. Before beginning the factoring process, factor out the −1: At this point, factor the remaining trinomial as usual, remembering to write the −1 as a factor in your final answer. Because 3 + (−5) = −2, use 3 and 5 as the factors of 15. Answer: − 1 ( x + 3 ) ( x − 5 ) . The check is left to the reader.   Example 8: Factor: − 60 a 2 − 5 a + 30 . Solution: The GCF of all the terms is 5. However, in this case factor out −5 because this produces a trinomial factor where the leading coefficient is positive. Focus on the factors of 12 and 6 that combine to give the middle coefficient, 1. After much thought, we find that 3 ⋅ 3 − 4 ⋅ 2 = 9 − 8 = 1 . Factor the remaining trinomial. Answer: − 5 ( 4 a + 3 ) ( 3 a − 2 ) . The check is left to the reader.   Try this! Factor: 24 + 2 x − x 2 . Answer: − 1 ( x − 6 ) ( x + 4 ) 
book2_chapter6_3_3	no label	Factoring Using the AC Method Factoring Using the AC Method In this section, we factor trinomials of the form a x 2 + b x + c using the AC method described previously.   Example 9: Factor using the AC method: 18 x 2 − 21 x + 5 . Solution: Here a = 18, b = −21, and c = 5. Factor 90 and search for factors whose sum is −21. In this case, the sum of the factors −6 and −15 equals the middle coefficient, −21. Therefore, − 21 x = − 6 x − 15 x , and we can write Factor the equivalent expression by grouping. Answer: ( 3 x − 1 ) ( 6 x − 5 )   Example 10: Factor using the AC method: 9 x 2 − 61 x − 14 . Solution: Here a = 9, b = −61, and c = −14. We factor −126 as follows: The sum of factors 2 and −63 equals the middle coefficient, −61. Replace − 61 x with 2 x − 63 x : Answer: ( x − 7 ) ( 9 x + 2 ) . The check is left to the reader. 
book2_chapter6_4_1	no label	Difference of Squares Difference of Squares A binomial is a polynomial with two terms. We begin with our first special binomial called difference of squares a 2 − b 2 = ( a + b ) ( a − b ) , where a and b represent algebraic expressions. : To verify the above formula, multiply: We use this formula to factor certain special binomials.   Example 1: Factor: x 2 − 16 . Solution: Step 1: Identify the binomial as difference of squares and determine the square factors of each term. Here we can write The terms are squares of x and 4. Hence a = x and b = 4 . Step 2: Substitute into the difference of squares formula. Step 3: Multiply to check. This step is optional. Answer: ( x + 4 ) ( x − 4 )   It is worth taking some extra time at this point to review all of the squares of integers from 1 to 12. Recognizing these perfect square integers helps speed the factoring process.   Example 2: Factor: 9 x 2 − 121 . Solution: The subtraction indicates that this is a difference. Furthermore, we recognize that the terms are squares. In this case, a = 3 x and b = 11 . Substitute into the formula for difference of squares. Answer: ( 3 x + 11 ) ( 3 x − 11 )   It may be the case that the terms of the binomial have a common factor. If so, it will be difficult to identify the perfect squares until we first factor out the GCF.   Example 3: Factor: 12 y 2 − 75 . Solution: The terms are not perfect squares. However, notice that they do have a common factor. First, factor out the GCF, 3. The resulting binomial factor is a difference of squares with a = 2 y and b = 5 . Answer: 3 ( 2 y + 5 ) ( 2 y − 5 )   Example 4: Factor: 49 x 2 − 100 y 2 . Solution: Here we have a binomial with two variables and recognize that it is a difference of squares. Therefore, a = 7 x and b = 10 y . Substitute into the formula for difference of squares. Answer: ( 7 x + 10 y ) ( 7 x − 10 y )   Try this! Factor: 36 x 2 − 1 . Answer: ( 6 x + 1 ) ( 6 x − 1 ) Given any real number b, a polynomial of the form x 2 + b 2 is prime. Furthermore, the sum of squares a 2 + b 2 does not have a general factored equivalent. a 2 + b 2 does not have a general factored equivalent. Care should be taken not to confuse this with a perfect square trinomial: Therefore, When the degree of the special binomial is greater than two, we may need to apply the difference of squares formula multiple times. A polynomial is completely factored when none of the factors can be factored any further.   Example 5: Factor completely: x 4 − 16 . Solution: First, identify what is being squared: To do this, recall the power rule for exponents, ( x m ) n = x m n . When exponents are raised to a power, multiply them. With this in mind, determine that ( x 2 ) 2 = x 4 and write Therefore, a = x 2 and b = 4 . Substitute into the formula for difference of squares. At this point, notice that the factor ( x 2 − 4 ) is itself a difference of two squares and thus can be further factored using a = x and b = 2 . The factor ( x 2 + 4 ) is a sum of squares, which cannot be factored using real numbers. Answer: ( x 2 + 4 ) ( x + 2 ) ( x − 2 )   Try this! Factor completely: 81 x 4 − 1 . Answer: ( 9 x 2 + 1 ) ( 3 x + 1 ) ( 3 x − 1 ) 
book2_chapter6_4_2	no label	Sum and Difference of Cubes Sum and Difference of Cubes Two other special binomials of interest are the sum a 3 + b 3 = ( a + b ) ( a 2 − a b + b 2 ) , where a and b represent algebraic expressions. and difference of cubes a 3 − b 3 = ( a − b ) ( a 2 + a b + b 2 ) , where a and b represent algebraic expressions. : We can verify these formulas by multiplying: The process for factoring the sum and difference of cubes is very similar to that for the difference of squares. We first identify a and b and then substitute into the appropriate formula. The separate formulas for sum and difference of cubes allow us to always choose a and b to be positive.   Example 6: Factor: x 3 + 8 . Solution: The plus sign and the fact that the terms are cubes indicate to us that this is a sum of cubes. Next, identify what is being cubed. In this case, a = x and b = 2 . Substitute into the sum of cubes formula. The resulting trinomial is prime and the factoring is complete. We can check this factorization by multiplying. Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( x 2 − 2 x + 4 )   It is helpful to review the perfect cubes of integers from 1 to 12. This will aid you in identifying sums and differences of cubes.   Example 7: Factor: y 3 − 125 . Solution: In this case, we have a difference of cubes. We can write Substitute a = y and b = 5 into the formula for difference of cubes. Answer: ( y − 5 ) ( y 2 + 5 y + 25 )   Always look for common factors when factoring. If the terms of the binomial have a GCF other than 1, then factor that out first.   Example 8: Factor: 54 x 4 + 128 x . Solution: Begin by factoring out the GCF 2 x . The resulting binomial factor is a sum of cubes, where a = 3 x and b = 4 . Answer: 2 x ( 3 x + 4 ) ( 9 x 2 − 12 x + 16 )   Example 9: Factor: x 3 y 3 − 1 . Solution: This binomial is a difference of cubes with two variables. Identify what is being cubed. Here a = x y and b = 1 . Substitute into the appropriate formula and simplify. Answer: ( x y − 1 ) ( x 2 y 2 + x y + 1 )   Try this! Factor: 8 x 3 + 343 . Answer: ( 2 x + 7 ) ( 4 x 2 − 14 x + 49 ) When factoring, always look for resulting factors to factor further.   Example 10: Factor completely: x 6 − 64 . Solution: When confronted with a binomial that is both a difference of squares and cubes, as this is, make it a rule to factor using difference of squares first. Therefore, a = x 3 and b = 8 . Substitute into the difference of squares formula. The resulting two binomial factors are a sum and a difference of cubes. Each can be factored further. Therefore, we have The trinomial factors are prime and the expression is completely factored. Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( x 2 − 2 x + 4 ) ( x − 2 ) ( x 2 + 2 x + 4 )   As an exercise, factor the previous example as a difference of cubes first and then compare the results. Why do you think we make it a rule to factor using difference of squares first?   Try this! Factor: x 6 − y 6 . Answer: ( x + y ) ( x 2 − x y + y 2 ) ( x − y ) ( x 2 + x y + y 2 ) 
book2_chapter6_5_1	no label	General Factoring Strategy General Factoring Strategy We have learned various techniques for factoring polynomials with up to four terms. The challenge is to identify the type of polynomial and then decide which method to apply. The following outlines a general guideline for factoring polynomials: Check for common factors. If the terms have common factors, then factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) and look at the resulting polynomial factors to factor further. Determine the number of terms in the polynomial. a. Factor four-term polynomials by grouping. b. Factor trinomials (three terms) using “trial and error” or the AC method. c. Factor binomials (two terms) using the following special products: Difference of squares: a 2 − b 2 = ( a + b ) ( a − b ) Sum of squares: a 2 + b 2       no general formula Difference of cubes: a 3 − b 3 = ( a − b ) ( a 2 + a b + b 2 ) Sum of cubes: a 3 + b 3 = ( a + b ) ( a 2 − a b + b 2 ) Look for factors that can be factored further. Check by multiplying. Note If a binomial is both a difference of squares and a difference of cubes, then first factor it as difference of squares and then as a sum and difference of cubes to obtain a more complete factorization. Not all polynomials with integer coefficients factor. When this is the case, we say that the polynomial is prime. If an expression has a GCF, then factor this out first. Doing so is often overlooked and typically results in factors that are easier to work with. Also, look for the resulting factors to factor further; many factoring problems require more than one step. A polynomial is completely factored when none of the factors can be factored further.   Example 1: Factor: 6 x 4 − 3 x 3 − 24 x 2 + 12 x . Solution: This four-term polynomial has a GCF of 3 x . Factor this out first. Now factor the resulting four-term polynomial by grouping. The factor ( x 2 − 4 ) is a difference of squares and can be factored further. Answer: 3 x ( 2 x − 1 ) ( x + 2 ) ( x − 2 )   Example 2: Factor: 18 x 3 y − 60 x 2 y + 50 x y . Solution: This trinomial has a GCF of 2 x y . Factor this out first. The trinomial factor can be factored further using the trial and error method. Use the factors 9 = 3 ⋅ 3 and 25 = ( − 5 ) ⋅ ( − 5 ) . These combine to generate the correct coefficient for the middle term: 3 ( − 5 ) + 3 ( − 5 ) = − 15 − 15 = − 30 . Check. Answer: 2 x y ( 3 x − 5 ) 2   Example 3: Factor: 5 a 3 b 4 + 10 a 2 b 3 − 75 a b 2 . Solution: This trinomial has a GCF of 5 a b 2 . Factor this out first. The resulting trinomial factor can be factored as follows: Answer: 5 a b 2 ( a b + 5 ) ( a b − 3 )   Try this! Factor: 3 x 3 y − 12 x 2 y 2 + 12 x y 3 . Answer: 3 x y ( x − 2 y ) 2   Example 4: Factor: 16 y 4 − 1 . Solution: This binomial does not have a GCF. Therefore, begin factoring by identifying it as a difference of squares. Here a = 4 y 2 and b = 1. Substitute into the formula for difference of squares. The factor ( 4 y 2 + 1 ) is a sum of squares and is prime. However, ( 4 y 2 − 1 ) is a difference of squares and can be factored further. Answer: ( 4 y 2 + 1 ) ( 2 y + 1 ) ( 2 y − 1 )   Example 5: Factor: x 6 − 64 y 6 . Solution: This binomial is a difference of squares and a difference of cubes. When this is the case, first factor it as a difference of squares. We can write Each factor can be further factored either as a sum or difference of cubes, respectively. Therefore, Answer: ( x + 2 y ) ( x 2 − 2 x y + 4 y 2 ) ( x − 2 y ) ( x 2 + 2 x y + 4 y 2 )   Example 6: Factor: x 2 − ( 2 x − 1 ) 2 . Solution: First, identify this expression as a difference of squares. Here use a = x and b = 2 x − 1 in the formula for a difference of squares. Answer: ( 3 x − 1 ) ( − x + 1 )   Try this! Factor: x 4 + 2 x 3 + 27 x + 54 . Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( x + 3 ) ( x 2 − 3 x + 9 ) 
book2_chapter6_6_1	no label	Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring Learning how to solve equations is one of our main goals in algebra. Up to this point, we have solved linear equations, which are of degree 1. In this section, we will learn a technique that can be used to solve certain equations of degree 2. A quadratic equation A polynomial equation with one variable of degree 2. is any equation that can be written in the standard form A quadratic equation written in the form a x 2 + b x + c = 0. where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . The following are some examples of quadratic equations, all of which will be solved in this section: A solution of a quadratic equation in standard form is called a root A solution to a quadratic equation in standard form. . Quadratic equations can have two real solutions, one real solution, or no real solution. The quadratic equation x 2 + x − 6 = 0 has two solutions, namely, x = − 3 and x = 2 .   Example 1: Verify that x = − 3 and x = 2 are solutions to x 2 + x − 6 = 0 . Solution: To verify solutions, substitute the values for x and then simplify to see if a true statement results. Answer: Both values produce true statements. Therefore, they are both solutions to the equation.   Our goal is to develop algebraic techniques for finding solutions to quadratic equations. The first technique requires the zero-product property Any product is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. : In other words, if any product is equal to zero, then one or both of the variable factors must be equal to zero.   Example 2: Solve: ( x − 8 ) ( x + 7 ) = 0 . Solution: This equation consists of a product of two quantities equal to zero; therefore, the zero-product property applies. One or both of the quantities must be zero. To verify that these are solutions, substitute them for the variable x. Notice that each solution produces a factor that is equal to zero. Answer: The solutions are 8 and −7.   The quadratic equation may not be given in its factored form.   Example 3: Solve: x 2 + 3 x − 10 = 0 . Solution: The goal is to produce a product that is equal to zero. We can do that by factoring the trinomial on the left side of the equation. Next, apply the zero-product property and set each factor equal to zero. This leaves us with two linear equations, each of which can be solved for x . Check the solutions by substituting into the original equation to verify that we obtain true statements. Answer: The solutions are −5 and 2.   Using the zero-product property after factoring a quadratic equation in standard form is the key to this technique. However, the quadratic equation may not be given in standard form, and so there may be some preliminary steps before factoring. The steps required to solve by factoring The process of solving an equation that is equal to zero by factoring it and then setting each variable factor equal to zero. are outlined in the following example.   Example 4: Solve: 2 x 2 + 10 x + 20 = − 3 x + 5 . Solution: Step 1: Express the quadratic equation in standard form. For the zero-product property to apply, the quadratic expression must be equal to zero. Use the addition and subtraction properties of equality to combine opposite-side like terms and obtain zero on one side of the equation. In this example, add 3 x to and subtract 5 from both sides. Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression. Step 3: Apply the zero-product property and set each variable factor equal to zero. Step 4: Solve the resulting linear equations. Answer: The solutions are −5 and −3/2. The check is optional.   Example 5: Solve: 9 x 2 + 1 = 6 x . Solution: Write this in standard form by subtracting 6 x from both sides. Once the equation is in standard form, equal to zero, factor. This is a perfect square trinomial. Hence setting each factor equal to zero results in a repeated solution. A repeated solution is called a double root A root that is repeated twice. and does not have to be written twice. Answer: The solution is 1/3.   Try this! Solve: x 2 − 3 x = 28 . Answer: x = − 4 or x = 7 Not all quadratic equations in standard form are trinomials. We often encounter binomials.   Example 6: Solve: x 2 − 9 = 0 . Solution: This quadratic equation is given in standard form, where the binomial on the left side is a difference of squares. Factor as follows: Next, set each factor equal to zero and solve. Answer: The solutions are 3 and −3, which can also be written as ± 3 .   Example 7: Solve: 5 x 2 = 15 x . Solution: By inspection, we see that x = 0 is a solution to this quadratic equation. Since dividing by zero is undefined, we want to avoid dividing both sides of this equation by x. In general, we wish to avoid dividing both sides of any equation by a variable or an expression containing a variable. We will discuss this in more detail later. The first step is to rewrite this equation in standard form with zero on one side. Next, factor the expression. Notice that the binomial on the left has a GCF of 5 x . Set each factor to equal to zero. Answer: The solutions are 0 and 3.   Example 8: Solve: ( 2 x + 1 ) ( x + 5 ) = 11 . Solution: This quadratic equation appears to be factored; hence it might be tempting to set each factor equal to 11. However, this would lead to incorrect results. We must rewrite the equation in standard form, equal to zero, so that we can apply the zero-product property. Once it is in standard form, we can factor and then set each factor equal to zero. Answer: The solutions are 1/2 and −6.   Example 9: Solve: 15 x 2 − 25 x + 10 = 0 . Solution: We begin by factoring out the GCF of 5. Then factor the resulting trinomial. Next, we set each variable factor equal to zero and solve for x. Notice that the factor 5 is not a variable factor and thus did not contribute to the solution set. Answer: The solutions are 2/3 and 1.   Example 10: Factor: 5 2 x 2 + 7 6 x − 1 3 = 0 . Solution: Clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the LCD, which is equal to 6. At this point, we have an equivalent equation with integer coefficients and can factor as usual. Begin with the factors of 15 and 2. The coefficient of the middle term is 7 = 3 ( − 1 ) + 5 ( 2 ) . Factor as follows: Set each factor equal to zero and solve. Answer: The solutions are −2/3 and 1/5.   Try this! Solve: 4 x 2 − 9 = 0 . Answer: −3/2 and 3/2 
book2_chapter6_6_2	no label	Finding Equations with Given Solutions Finding Equations with Given Solutions The zero-product property states, And, in fact, the converse is true as well: When this is the case, we can write the following: We use this property to find equations, given the solutions. To do this, the steps for solving by factoring are performed in reverse.   Example 11: Find a quadratic equation with solutions −7 and 2. Solution: Given the solutions, we can determine two linear factors. The product of these linear factors is equal to zero when x = − 7 or x = 2 : Multiply the binomials and present the equation in standard form. Answer: x 2 + 5 x − 14 = 0 . We may check our equation by substituting the given answers to see if we obtain a true statement. Also, the equation found above is not unique and so the check becomes essential when our equation looks different from someone else’s. This is left as an exercise.   Example 12: Find a quadratic equation with integer coefficients, given solutions 1/2 and −3/4. Solution: To avoid fractional coefficients, we first clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the denominator. Apply the zero-product property and multiply. Answer: 8 x 2 + 2 x − 3 = 0   Try this! Find a quadratic equation with integer coefficients, given solutions −1 and 2/3. Answer: 3 x 2 + x − 2 = 0 
book2_chapter6_6_3	no label	Solving Polynomial Equations by Factoring Solving Polynomial Equations by Factoring The zero-product property is true for any number of factors that make up an equation. If an expression is equal to zero and can be factored into linear factors, then we will be able to set each factor equal to zero and solve for each equation.   Example 13: Solve: 3 x ( x − 5 ) ( 3 x − 2 ) = 0 . Solution: Set each variable factor equal to zero and solve. Answer: The solutions are 0, 5, and 2/3.   Of course, we cannot expect the equation to be given in factored form.   Example 14: Solve: x 3 + 2 x 2 − 9 x − 18 = 0 . Solution: Begin by factoring the left side completely. Set each factor equal to zero and solve. Answer: The solutions are −2, −3, and 3.   Notice that the degree of the polynomial is 3 and we obtained three solutions. In general, for any polynomial equation with one variable of degree n, the fundamental theorem of algebra Guarantees that there will be as many (or fewer) real solutions to a polynomial with one variable as its degree. guarantees n real solutions or fewer. We have seen that many polynomials do not factor. This does not imply that equations involving these unfactorable polynomials do not have real solutions. In fact, many polynomial equations that do not factor do have real solutions. We will learn how to solve these types of equations as we continue in our study of algebra.   Try this! Solve: − 10 x 3 − 18 x 2 + 4 x = 0 . Answer: −2, 0, 1/5 
book2_chapter6_7_1	no label	Number Problems Number Problems The algebraic setups of the word problems that we have previously encountered led to linear equations. When we translate the applications to algebraic setups in this section, the setups lead to quadratic equations. Just as before, we want to avoid relying on the “guess and check” method for solving applications. Using algebra to solve problems simplifies the process and is more reliable.   Example 1: One integer is 4 less than twice another integer, and their product is 96. Set up an algebraic equation and solve it to find the two integers. Solution: First, identify the variables. Avoid two variables by using the relationship between the two unknowns. The key phrase, “their product is 96,” indicates that we should multiply and set the product equal to 96. Once we have the problem translated to a mathematical equation, we then solve. In this case, we can solve by factoring. The first step is to write the equation in standard form: Next, factor completely and set each variable factor equal to zero. The problem calls for two integers whose product is +96. The product of two positive numbers is positive and the product of two negative numbers is positive. Hence we can have two sets of solutions. Use 2 n − 4 to determine the other integers. Answer: Two sets of integers solve this problem: {8, 12} and {−6, −16}. Notice that (8)(12) = 96 and (−6)(−16) = 96; our solutions check out.   With quadratic equations, we often obtain two solutions for the identified unknown. Although it may be the case that both are solutions to the equation, they may not be solutions to the problem. If a solution does not solve the original application, then we disregard it. Recall that consecutive odd and even integers both are separated by two units.   Example 2: The product of two consecutive positive odd integers is 99. Find the integers. Solution: The key phase, “product…is 99,” indicates that we should multiply and set the product equal to 99. Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form and solve by factoring. Because the problem asks for positive integers, n = 9 is the only solution. Back substitute to determine the next odd integer. Answer: The consecutive positive odd integers are 9 and 11.   Example 3: Given two consecutive positive odd integers, the product of the larger and twice the smaller is equal to 70. Find the integers. Solution: The key phrase “twice the smaller” can be translated to 2 n . The phrase “product…is 70” indicates that we should multiply this by the larger odd integer and set the product equal to 70. Solve by factoring. Because the problem asks for positive integers, n = 5 is the only solution. Back substitute into n + 2 to determine the next odd integer. Answer: The positive odd integers are 5 and 7.   Try this! The product of two consecutive positive even integers is 168. Find the integers. Answer: The positive even integers are 12 and 14. 
book2_chapter6_7_2	no label	Geometry Problems Geometry Problems When working with geometry problems, it is helpful to draw a picture. Below are some area formulas that you are expected to know. (Recall that π ≈ 3.14 .) Area of a rectangle A = l w , where l represents the length and w represents the width. : A = l ⋅ w Area of a square A = s 2 , where s represents the length of each side. : A = s 2 Area of a triangle A = 1 2 b h , where b represents the length of the base and h represents the height. : A = 1 2 b h Area of a circle A = π r 2 , where r represents the radius and the constant π ≈ 3.14 . : A = π r 2   Example 4: The floor of a rectangular room has a length that is 4 feet more than twice its width. If the total area of the floor is 240 square feet, then find the dimensions of the floor. Solution: Use the formula A = l ⋅ w and the fact that the area is 240 square feet to set up an algebraic equation. Solve by factoring. At this point we have two possibilities for the width of the rectangle. However, since a negative width is not defined, choose the positive solution, w = 10 . Back substitute to find the length. Answer: The width is 10 feet and the length is 24 feet.   It is important to include the correct units in the final presentation of the answer. In the previous example, it would not make much sense to say the width is 10. Make sure to indicate that the width is 10 feet.   Example 5: The height of a triangle is 3 inches less than twice the length of its base. If the total area of the triangle is 7 square inches, then find the lengths of the base and height. Solution: Use the formula A = 1 2 b h and the fact that the area is 7 square inches to set up an algebraic equation. To avoid fractional coefficients, multiply both sides by 2 and then rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form. Factor and then set each factor equal to zero. In this case, disregard the negative answer; the length of the base is 7/2 inches long. Use 2 b − 3 to determine the height of the triangle. Answer: The base measures 7/2 = 3½ inches and the height is 4 inches.   Try this! The base of a triangle is 5 units less than twice the height. If the area is 75 square units, then what is the length of the base and height? Answer: The height is 10 units and the base is 15 units. Recall that a right triangle is a triangle where one of the angles measures 90°. The side opposite of the right angle is the longest side of the triangle and is called the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem Given any right triangle with legs measuring a and b units and hypotenuse measuring c units, then a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . gives us a relationship between the legs and hypotenuse of any right triangle, where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse: Given certain relationships, we use this theorem when determining the lengths of sides of right triangles.   Example 6: The hypotenuse of a right triangle is 10 inches. If the short leg is 2 inches less than the long leg, then find the lengths of the legs. Solution: Given that the hypotenuse measures 10 inches, substitute its value into the Pythagorean theorem and obtain a quadratic equation in terms of x. Multiply and rewrite the equation in standard form. Once it is in standard form, factor and set each variable factor equal to zero. Because lengths cannot be negative, disregard the negative answer. In this case, the long leg measures 8 inches. Use x − 2 to determine the length of the short leg. Answer: The short leg measures 6 inches and the long leg measures 8 inches.   Example 7: One leg of a right triangle measures 3 centimeters. The hypotenuse of the right triangle measures 3 centimeters less than twice the length of the unknown leg. Find the measure of all the sides of the triangle. Solution: To set up an algebraic equation, we use the Pythagorean theorem. Solve by factoring. Disregard 0. The length of the unknown leg is 4 centimeters. Use 2 x − 3 to determine the length of the hypotenuse. Answer: The sides of the triangle measure 3 centimeters, 4 centimeters, and 5 centimeters.   Try this! The hypotenuse of a right triangle measures 13 units. If one leg is 2 units more than twice that of the other, then find the length of each leg. Answer: The two legs measure 5 units and 12 units. 
book2_chapter6_7_3	no label	Projectile Problems Projectile Problems The height of an object launched upward, ignoring the effects of air resistance, can be modeled with the following formula: Using function notation, which is more appropriate, we have With this formula, the height can be calculated at any given time t after the object is launched. The coefficients represent the following: − 1 2 g The letter g represents the acceleration due to gravity. v 0 “v-naught” represents the initial velocity of the object. s 0 “s-naught” represents the initial height from which the object is launched. We consider only problems where the acceleration due to gravity can be expressed as g = 32  ft / sec 2 . Therefore, in this section time will be measured in seconds and the height in feet. Certainly though, the formula is valid using units other than these.   Example 8: The height of a projectile launched upward at a speed of 32 feet/second from a height of 128 feet is given by the function h ( t ) = − 16 t 2 + 32 t + 128 . How long does it take to hit the ground? Solution: An inefficient method for finding the time to hit the ground is to simply start guessing at times and evaluating. To do this, construct a chart. Use the table to sketch the height of the projectile over time. We see that at 4 seconds, the projectile hits the ground. Note that when this occurs, the height is equal to 0. Now we need to solve this problem algebraically. To find the solution algebraically, use the fact that the height is 0 when the object hits the ground. We need to find the time, t, when h ( t ) = 0 . Solve the equation by factoring. Now set each variable factor to zero. As expected, the projectile hits the ground at t = 4 seconds. Disregard −2 as a solution because negative time is not defined. Answer: The projectile hits the ground 4 seconds after it is launched.   Example 9: The height of a certain book dropped from the top of a 144-foot building is given by h ( t ) = − 16 t 2 + 144 . How long does it take to hit the ground? Solution: Find the time t when the height h ( t ) = 0 . Answer: The book takes 3 seconds to hit the ground when dropped from the top of a 144-foot building.   Try this! The height of a projectile, shot straight up into the air from the ground, is given by h ( t ) = − 16 t 2 + 80 t . How long does it take to come back down to the ground? Answer: It will take 5 seconds to come back down to the ground. 
book2_chapter7_1_1	no label	Rational Expressions, Evaluating, and Restrictions Rational Expressions, Evaluating, and Restrictions A rational number, or fraction a b , is a real number defined as a quotient of two integers a and b, where b ≠ 0 . Similarly, we define a rational expression The quotient P Q of two polynomials P and Q, where Q ≠ 0. , or algebraic fraction Term used when referring to a rational expression. P Q , as the quotient of two polynomials P and Q, where Q ≠ 0 . Some examples of rational expressions follow: The example x + 3 x − 5 consists of linear expressions in both the numerator and denominator. Because the denominator contains a variable, this expression is not defined for all values of x.   Example 1: Evaluate x + 3 x − 5 for the set of x-values {−3, 4, 5}. Solution: Substitute the values in for x. Answer: When x = − 3 , the value of the rational expression is 0; when x = 4 , the value of the rational expression is −7; and when x = 5 , the value of the rational expression is undefined.   This example illustrates that variables are restricted to values that do not make the denominator equal to 0. The domain of a rational expression The set of real numbers for which the rational expression is defined. is the set of real numbers for which it is defined, and restrictions The set of real numbers for which a rational expression is not defined. are the real numbers for which the expression is not defined. We often express the domain of a rational expression in terms of its restrictions.   Example 2: Find the domain of the following: x + 7 2 x 2 + x − 6 . Solution: In this example, the numerator x + 7 is a linear expression and the denominator 2 x 2 + x − 6 is a quadratic expression. If we factor the denominator, then we will obtain an equivalent expression. Because rational expressions are undefined when the denominator is 0, we wish to find the values for x that make it 0. To do this, apply the zero-product property. Set each factor in the denominator equal to 0 and solve. We conclude that the original expression is defined for any real number except 3/2 and −2. These two values are the restrictions to the domain. It is important to note that −7 is not a restriction to the domain because the expression is defined as 0 when the numerator is 0. Answer: The domain consists of any real number x, where x ≠ 3 2 and x ≠ − 2 .   We can express the domain of the previous example using notation as follows: The restrictions to the domain of a rational expression are determined by the denominator. Ignore the numerator when finding those restrictions.   Example 3: Determine the domain: x 4 + x 3 − 2 x 2 − x x 2 − 1 . Solution: To find the restrictions to the domain, set the denominator equal to 0 and solve: These two values cause the denominator to be 0. Hence they are restricted from the domain. Answer: The domain consists of any real number x, where x ≠ ± 1 .   Example 4: Determine the domain: x 2 − 25 4 . Solution: There is no variable in the denominator and thus no restriction to the domain. Answer: The domain consists of all real numbers, R. 
book2_chapter7_1_2	no label	Simplifying Rational Expressions Simplifying Rational Expressions When simplifying fractions, look for common factors that cancel. For example, We say that the fraction 12/60 is equivalent to 1/5. Fractions are in simplest form if the numerator and denominator share no common factor other than 1. Similarly, when working with rational expressions, look for factors to cancel. For example, The resulting rational expression is equivalent if it shares the same domain. Therefore, we must make note of the restrictions and write In words, x + 4 ( x − 3 ) ( x + 4 ) is equivalent to 1 x − 3 , if x ≠ 3 and x ≠ − 4 . We can verify this by choosing a few values with which to evaluate both expressions to see if the results are the same. Here we choose x = 7 and evaluate as follows: It is important to state the restrictions before simplifying rational expressions because the simplified expression may be defined for restrictions of the original. In this case, the expressions are not equivalent. Here −4 is defined for the simplified equivalent but not for the original, as illustrated below:   Example 5: Simplify and state the restriction: 25 x 2 15 x 3 . Solution: In this example, the expression is undefined when x is 0. Therefore, the domain consists of all real numbers x, where x ≠ 0 . With this understanding, we can cancel common factors. Answer: 5 3 x , where x ≠ 0   Example 6: State the restrictions and simplify: 3 x ( x − 5 ) ( 2 x + 1 ) ( x − 5 ) . Solution: To determine the restrictions, set the denominator equal to 0 and solve. The domain consists of all real numbers except for −1/2 and 5. Next, we find an equivalent expression by canceling common factors. Answer: 3 x 2 x + 1 , where x ≠ − 1 2 and x ≠ 5   Typically, rational expressions are not given in factored form. If this is the case, factor first and then cancel. The steps are outlined in the following example.   Example 7: State the restrictions and simplify: 3 x + 6 x 2 + x − 2 . Solution: Step 1: Completely factor the numerator and denominator. Step 2: Determine the restrictions to the domain. To do this, set the denominator equal to 0 and solve. The domain consists of all real numbers except −2 and 1. Step 3: Cancel common factors, if any. Answer: 3 x − 1 , where x ≠ 1 and x ≠ − 2   Example 8: State the restrictions and simplify: x 2 + 7 x − 30 x 2 − 7 x + 12 . Solution: First, factor the numerator and denominator. Any value of x that results in a value of 0 in the denominator is a restriction. By inspection, we determine that the domain consists of all real numbers except 4 and 3. Next, cancel common factors. Answer: x + 10 x − 4 , where x ≠ 3 and x ≠ 4   It is important to remember that we can only cancel factors of a product. A common mistake is to cancel terms. For example,   Try this! State the restrictions and simplify: x 2 − 16 5 x 2 − 20 x . Answer: x + 4 5 x , where x ≠ 0 and x ≠ 4 In some examples, we will make a broad assumption that the denominator is nonzero. When we make that assumption, we do not need to determine the restrictions.   Example 9: Simplify: x y + y 2 − 3 x − 3 y x 2 − y 2 . (Assume all denominators are nonzero.) Solution: Factor the numerator by grouping. Factor the denominator using the formula for a difference of squares. Next, cancel common factors. Answer: y − 3 x − y 
book2_chapter7_1_3	no label	Opposite Binomial Factors Opposite Binomial Factors Recall that the opposite of the real number a is −a. Similarly, we can define the opposite of a polynomial P to be −P. We first consider the opposite of the binomial a − b : This leads us to the opposite binomial property If given a binomial a − b , then the opposite is − ( a − b ) = b − a . : This is equivalent to factoring out a –1. If a ≠ b , then we can divide both sides by ( a − b ) and obtain the following:   Example 10: State the restrictions and simplify: 3 − x x − 3 . Solution: By inspection, we can see that the denominator is 0 if x = 3 . Therefore, 3 is the restriction to the domain. Apply the opposite binomial property to the numerator and then cancel. Answer: 3 − x x − 3 = − 1 , where x ≠ 3   Since addition is commutative, we have or Take care not to confuse this with the opposite binomial property. Also, it is important to recall that In other words, show a negative fraction by placing the negative sign in the numerator, in front of the fraction bar, or in the denominator. Generally, negative denominators are avoided.   Example 11: Simplify and state the restrictions: 4 − x 2 x 2 + 3 x − 10 . Solution: Begin by factoring the numerator and denominator. Answer: − x + 2 x + 5 , where x ≠ 2 and x ≠ − 5   Try this! Simplify and state the restrictions: 2 x 2 − 7 x − 15 25 − x 2 . Answer: − 2 x + 3 x + 5 , where x ≠ ± 5

C ( x ) represents the cost of producing x units, then the average cost The total cost divided by the number of units produced, which can be represented by c ( x ) = C ( x ) x , where C ( x ) is a cost function. c ( x ) is the cost divided by the number of units produced.   Example 13: The cost in dollars of producing t-shirts with a company logo is given by C ( x ) = 7 x + 200 , where x represents the number of shirts produced. Determine the average cost of producing a. 40 t-shirts b. 250 t-shirts c. 1,000 t-shirts Solution: Set up a function representing the average cost. Next, calculate c ( 40 ) , c ( 250 ) , and c ( 1000 ) . Answers: a. If 40 t-shirts are produced, then the average cost per t-shirt is $12.00. b. If 250 t-shirts are produced, then the average cost per t-shirt is $7.80. c. If 1,000 t-shirts are produced, then the average cost per t-shirt is $7.20.

Recall that if the denominators are the same, we can add or subtract the numerators and write the result over the common denominator.

book2_chapter7_3_2	no label	Adding and Subtracting with Unlike Denominators Adding and Subtracting with Unlike Denominators To add rational expressions with unlike denominators, first find equivalent expressions with common denominators. Do this just as you have with fractions. If the denominators of fractions are relatively prime, then the least common denominator (LCD) is their product. For example, Multiply each fraction by the appropriate form of 1 to obtain equivalent fractions with a common denominator. The process of adding and subtracting rational expressions is similar. In general, given polynomials P, Q, R, and S, where Q ≠ 0 and S ≠ 0 , we have the following: In this section, assume that all variable factors in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 5: Add: 1 x + 1 y .

Answer: − 3 y ( y − 3 )   It is not always the case that the LCD is the product of the given denominators. Typically, the denominators are not relatively prime; thus determining the LCD requires some thought. Begin by factoring all denominators. The LCD is the product of all factors with the highest power. For example, given there are three base factors in the denominator: x , ( x + 2 ) , and ( x − 3 ) . The highest powers of these factors are x 3 , ( x + 2 ) 2 , and ( x − 3 ) 1 . Therefore, The general steps for adding or subtracting rational expressions are illustrated in the following example.   Example 7: Subtract: x x 2 + 4 x + 3 − 3 x 2 − 4 x − 5 . Solution: Step 1: Factor all denominators to determine the LCD. The LCD   is   ( x + 1 ) ( x + 3 ) ( x − 5 ) . Step 2: Multiply by the appropriate factors to obtain equivalent terms with a common denominator. To do this, multiply the first term by and the second term by . Step 3: Add or subtract the numerators and place the result over the common denominator. Step 4: Simplify the resulting algebraic fraction. Answer:   Example 8: Subtract: . Solution: It is best not to factor the numerator, , because we will most likely need to simplify after we subtract. Answer:   Example 9: Subtract: . Solution: First, factor the denominators and determine the LCD. Notice how the opposite binomial property is applied to obtain a more workable denominator. The LCD is . Multiply the second term by 1 in the form of . Now that we have equivalent terms with a common denominator, add the numerators and write the result over the common denominator.

book2_chapter7_4_1	no label	Definitions Definitions A complex fraction A fraction where the numerator or denominator consists of one or more fractions. is a fraction where the numerator or denominator consists of one or more fractions. For example, Simplifying such a fraction requires us to find an equivalent fraction with integer numerator and denominator. One way to do this is to divide. Recall that dividing fractions involves multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor. An alternative method for simplifying this complex fraction involves multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the LCD of all the given fractions. In this case, the LCD = 4. A complex rational expression A rational expression where the numerator or denominator consists of one or more rational expressions. is defined as a rational expression that contains one or more rational expressions in the numerator or denominator or both. For example, We simplify a complex rational expression by finding an equivalent fraction where the numerator and denominator are polynomials. As illustrated above, there are two methods for simplifying complex rational expressions, and we will outline the steps for both methods. For the sake of clarity, assume that variable expressions used as denominators are nonzero. 
book2_chapter7_4_2	no label	Method 1: Simplify Using Division Method 1: Simplify Using Division We begin our discussion on simplifying complex rational expressions using division. Before we can multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor, we must simplify the numerator and denominator separately. The goal is to first obtain single algebraic fractions in the numerator and the denominator. The steps for simplifying a complex algebraic fraction are illustrated in the following example.   Example 1: Simplify: 1 2 + 1 x 1 4 − 1 x 2 . Solution: Step 1: Simplify the numerator and denominator. The goal is to obtain a single algebraic fraction divided by another single algebraic fraction. In this example, find equivalent terms with a common denominator in both the numerator and denominator before adding and subtracting. At this point we have a single algebraic fraction divided by a single algebraic fraction. Step 2: Multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the divisor. Step 3: Factor all numerators and denominators completely. Step 4: Cancel all common factors. Answer: 2 x x − 2   Example 2: Simplify: 1 x − 1 x − 2 4 x 2 − 2 x . Solution: Answer: − 1 2   Example 3: Simplify   1 − 4 x − 21 x 2   1 − 2 x − 15 x 2 . Solution: The LCD of the rational expressions in both the numerator and denominator is x 2 . Multiply by the appropriate factors to obtain equivalent terms with this as the denominator and then subtract. We now have a single rational expression divided by another single rational expression. Next, multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the divisor and then factor and cancel. Answer: x − 7 x − 5   Example 4: Simplify:     1 − 1 x 2     1 x − 1 . Solution: Answer: − x + 1 x   Try this! Simplify:   1 81 − 1 x 2   1 9 + 1 x . Answer: x − 9 9 x 
book2_chapter7_4_3	no label	Method 2: Simplify Using the LCD Method 2: Simplify Using the LCD An alternative method for simplifying complex rational expressions involves clearing the fractions by multiplying the expression by a special form of 1. In this method, multiply the numerator and denominator by the least common denominator (LCD) of all given fractions.   Example 5: Simplify: 1 2 + 1 x 1 4 − 1 x 2 . Solution: Step 1: Determine the LCD of all the fractions in the numerator and denominator. In this case, the denominators of the given fractions are 2, x , 4, and x 2 . Therefore, the L C D  is  4 x 2 . Step 2: Multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD. This step should clear the fractions in both the numerator and denominator. This leaves us with a single algebraic fraction with a polynomial in the numerator and in the denominator. Step 3: Factor the numerator and denominator completely. Step 4: Cancel all common factors. Answer: 2 x x − 2 Note This was the same problem that we began this section with, and the results here are the same. It is worth taking the time to compare the steps involved using both methods on the same problem.   Example 6: Simplify:   1 − 2 x − 15 x 2     3 − 14 x − 5 x 2 . Solution: Considering all of the denominators, we find that the LCD is  x 2 . Therefore, multiply the numerator and denominator by x 2 : At this point, we have a rational expression that can be simplified by factoring and then canceling the common factors. Answer: x + 3 3 x + 1   It is important to point out that multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero factor is equivalent to multiplying by 1 and does not change the problem. Because x 2 x 2 = 1 , we can multiply the numerator and denominator by x 2 in the previous example and obtain an equivalent expression.   Example 7: Simplify:   1 x + 1 + 3 x − 3   2 x − 3 − 1 x + 1 . Solution: The LCM of all the denominators is ( x + 1 ) ( x − 3 ) . Begin by multiplying the numerator and denominator by these factors. Answer: 4 x x + 5   Try this! Simplify: 1 y − 1 4 1 16 − 1 y 2 . Answer: − 4 y y + 4 
book2_chapter7_5_1	no label	Solving Rational Equations Solving Rational Equations A rational equation An equation containing at least one rational expression. is an equation containing at least one rational expression. Rational expressions typically contain a variable in the denominator. For this reason, we will take care to ensure that the denominator is not 0 by making note of restrictions and checking our solutions. Solve rational equations by clearing the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD).   Example 1: Solve: 5 x − 1 3 = 1 x . Solution: We first make a note that x ≠ 0 and then multiply both sides by the LCD, 3x: Check your answer by substituting 12 for x to see if you obtain a true statement. Answer: The solution is 12.   After multiplying both sides of the previous example by the LCD, we were left with a linear equation to solve. This is not always the case; sometimes we will be left with a quadratic equation.   Example 2: Solve: 2 − 1 x ( x + 1 ) = 3 x + 1 . Solution: In this example, there are two restrictions, x ≠ 0 and x ≠ − 1 . Begin by multiplying both sides by the LCD, x ( x + 1 ) . After distributing and dividing out the common factors, a quadratic equation remains. To solve it, rewrite it in standard form, factor, and then set each factor equal to 0. Check to see if these values solve the original equation. Answer: The solutions are −1/2 and 1.   Up to this point, all of the possible solutions have solved the original equation. However, this may not always be the case. Multiplying both sides of an equation by variable factors may lead to extraneous solutions A solution that does not solve the original equation. , which are solutions that do not solve the original equation. A complete list of steps for solving a rational equation is outlined in the following example.   Example 3: Solve: x x + 2 + 2 x 2 + 5 x + 6 = 5 x + 3 . Solution: Step 1: Factor all denominators and determine the LCD. The LCD is  ( x + 2 ) ( x + 3 ) . Step 2: Identify the restrictions. In this case, they are x ≠ − 2 and x ≠ − 3 . Step 3: Multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD. Distribute carefully and then simplify. Step 4: Solve the resulting equation. Here the result is a quadratic equation. Rewrite it in standard form, factor, and then set each factor equal to 0. Step 5: Check for extraneous solutions. Always substitute into the original equation, or the factored equivalent. In this case, choose the factored equivalent to check: Here −2 is an extraneous solution and is not included in the solution set. It is important to note that −2 is a restriction. Answer: The solution is 4.   If this process produces a solution that happens to be a restriction, then disregard it as an extraneous solution.   Try this! Solve: x x − 5 + 3 x + 2 = 7 x x 2 − 3 x − 10 . Answer: −3 Sometimes all potential solutions are extraneous, in which case we say that there is no solution to the original equation. In the next two examples, we demonstrate two ways in which a rational equation can have no solutions.   Example 4: Solve: 3 x x 2 − 4 − 2 x + 2 = 1 x + 2 . Solution: To identify the LCD, first factor the denominators. Multiply both sides by the least common denonominator (LCD), ( x + 2 ) ( x − 2 ) , distributing carefully. The equation is a contradiction and thus has no solution. Answer: No solution, ∅   Example 5: Solve: x x − 4 − 4 x + 5 = 36 x 2 + x − 20 . Solution: First, factor the denominators. Take note that the restrictions are x ≠ 4 and x ≠ − 5 . To clear the fractions, multiply by the LCD, ( x − 4 ) ( x + 5 ) . Both of these values are restrictions of the original equation; hence both are extraneous. Answer: No solution, ∅   Try this! Solve: 1 x + 1 + x x − 3 = 4 x x 2 − 2 x − 3 . Answer: ∅ It is important to point out that this technique for clearing algebraic fractions only works for equations. Do not try to clear algebraic fractions when simplifying expressions. As a reminder, we have Expressions are to be simplified and equations are to be solved. If we multiply the expression by the LCD, x ( 2 x + 1 ) , we obtain another expression that is not equivalent. 
book2_chapter7_5_2	no label	Literal Equations Literal Equations Literal equations, or formulas, are often rational equations. Hence the techniques described in this section can be used to solve for particular variables. Assume that all variable expressions in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 6: Solve for x:    z = x − 5 y . Solution: The goal is to isolate x. Assuming that y is nonzero, multiply both sides by y and then add 5 to both sides. Answer: x = y z + 5   Example 7: Solve for c:    1 c = 1 a + 1 b . Solution: In this example, the goal is to isolate c. We begin by multiplying both sides by the LCD, a ⋅ b ⋅ c , distributing carefully. On the right side of the equation, factor out c. Next, divide both sides of the equation by the quantity . Answer:   Try this! Solve for y:    . Answer: 
book2_chapter7_6_1	no label	Number Problems Number Problems Recall that the reciprocal The reciprocal of a nonzero number n is 1/n. of a nonzero number n is 1/n. For example, the reciprocal of 5 is 1/5 and 5 ⋅ 1/5 = 1. In this section, the applications will often involve the key word “reciprocal.” When this is the case, we will see that the algebraic setup results in a rational equation.   Example 1: A positive integer is 4 less than another. The sum of the reciprocals of the two positive integers is 10/21. Find the two integers. Solution: Begin by assigning variables to the unknowns. Next, use the reciprocals 1 n and 1 n − 4 to translate the sentences into an algebraic equation. We can solve this rational expression by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD). In this case, the LCD is 21 n ( n − 4 ) . Solve the resulting quadratic equation. The question calls for integers and the only integer solution is n = 7 . Hence disregard 6/5. Use the expression n − 4 to find the smaller integer. Answer: The two positive integers are 3 and 7. The check is left to the reader.   Example 2: A positive integer is 4 less than another. If the reciprocal of the smaller integer is subtracted from twice the reciprocal of the larger, then the result is 1/30. Find the two integers. Solution: Set up an algebraic equation. Solve this rational expression by multiplying both sides by the LCD. The LCD is 30 n ( n − 4 ) . Here we have two viable possibilities for the larger integer. For this reason, we will we have two solutions to this problem. As a check, perform the operations indicated in the problem. Answer: Two sets of positive integers solve this problem: {6, 10} and {20, 24}.   Try this! The difference between the reciprocals of two consecutive positive odd integers is 2/15. Find the integers. Answer: The integers are 3 and 5. 
book2_chapter7_6_2	no label	Uniform Motion Problems Uniform Motion Problems Uniform motion Described by the formula D = r t , where the distance, D, is given as the product of the average rate, r, and the time, t, traveled at that rate. problems, also referred to as distance problems, involve the formula where the distance, D, is given as the product of the average rate, r, and the time, t, traveled at that rate. If we divide both sides by the average rate, r, then we obtain the formula For this reason, when the unknown quantity is time, the algebraic setup for distance problems often results in a rational equation. Similarly, when the unknown quantity is the rate, the setup also may result in a rational equation. We begin any uniform motion problem by first organizing our data with a chart. Use this information to set up an algebraic equation that models the application.   Example 5: Mary spent the first 120 miles of her road trip in traffic. When the traffic cleared, she was able to drive twice as fast for the remaining 300 miles. If the total trip took 9 hours, then how fast was she moving in traffic? Solution: First, identify the unknown quantity and organize the data. To avoid introducing two more variables for the time column, use the formula t = D r . Here the time for each leg of the trip is calculated as follows: Use these expressions to complete the chart. The algebraic setup is defined by the time column. Add the times for each leg of the trip to obtain a total of 9 hours: We begin solving this equation by first multiplying both sides by the LCD, 2x. Answer: Mary averaged 30 miles per hour in traffic.   Example 6: A passenger train can travel, on average, 20 miles per hour faster than a freight train. If the passenger train covers 390 miles in the same time it takes the freight train to cover 270 miles, then how fast is each train? Solution: First, identify the unknown quantities and organize the data. Next, organize the given data in a chart. Use the formula t = D r to fill in the time column for each train. Because the trains travel the same amount of time, finish the algebraic setup by equating the expressions that represent the times: Solve this equation by first multiplying both sides by the LCD, x ( x + 20 ) . Use x + 20 to find the speed of the passenger train. Answer: The speed of the passenger train is 65 miles per hour and the speed of the freight train is 45 miles per hour.   Example 7: Brett lives on the river 8 miles upstream from town. When the current is 2 miles per hour, he can row his boat downstream to town for supplies and back in 3 hours. What is his average rowing speed in still water? Solution: Rowing downstream, the current increases his speed, and his rate is x + 2 miles per hour. Rowing upstream, the current decreases his speed, and his rate is x − 2 miles per hour. Begin by organizing the data in the following chart: Use the formula t = D r to fill in the time column for each leg of the trip. The algebraic setup is defined by the time column. Add the times for each leg of the trip to obtain a total of 3 hours: Solve this equation by first multiplying both sides by the LCD, ( x + 2 ) ( x − 2 ) . Next, solve the resulting quadratic equation. Use only the positive solution, x = 6 miles per hour. Answer: His rowing speed is 6 miles per hour.   Try this! Dwayne drove 18 miles to the airport to pick up his father and then returned home. On the return trip he was able to drive an average of 15 miles per hour faster than he did on the trip there. If the total driving time was 1 hour, then what was his average speed driving to the airport? Answer: His average speed driving to the airport was 30 miles per hour. 
book2_chapter7_6_3	no label	Work-Rate Problems Work-Rate Problems The rate at which a task can be performed is called a work rate The rate at which a task can be performed. . For example, if a painter can paint a room in 8 hours, then the task is to paint the room, and we can write In other words, the painter can complete 1 8 of the task per hour. If he works for less than 8 hours, then he will perform a fraction of the task. For example, Obtain the amount of the task completed by multiplying the work rate by the amount of time the painter works. Typically, work-rate problems involve people working together to complete tasks. When this is the case, we can organize the data in a chart, just as we have done with distance problems. Suppose an apprentice painter can paint the same room by himself in 10 hours. Then we say that he can complete 1 10 of the task per hour. Let t represent the time it takes both of the painters, working together, to paint the room. To complete the chart, multiply the work rate by the time for each person. The portion of the room each can paint adds to a total of 1 task completed. This is represented by the equation obtained from the first column of the chart: This setup results in a rational equation that can be solved for t by multiplying both sides by the LCD, 40. Therefore, the two painters, working together, complete the task in 4 4 9 hours. In general, we have the following work-rate formula 1 t 1 ⋅ t + 1 t 2 ⋅ t = 1 , where 1 t 1 and 1 t 2 are the individual work rates and t is the time it takes to complete the task working together. : Here 1 t 1 and 1 t 2 are the individual work rates and t is the time it takes to complete one task working together. If we factor out the time, t, and then divide both sides by t, we obtain an equivalent work-rate formula: In summary, we have the following equivalent work-rate formulas:   Example 3: Working alone, Billy’s dad can complete the yard work in 3 hours. If Billy helps his dad, then the yard work takes 2 hours. How long would it take Billy working alone to complete the yard work? Solution: The given information tells us that Billy’s dad has an individual work rate of 1 3 task per hour. If we let x represent the time it takes Billy working alone to complete the yard work, then Billy’s individual work rate is 1 x , and we can write Working together, they can complete the task in 2 hours. Multiply the individual work rates by 2 hours to fill in the chart. The amount of the task each completes will total 1 completed task. To solve for x, we first multiply both sides by the LCD, 3x. Answer: It takes Billy 6 hours to complete the yard work alone.   Of course, the unit of time for the work rate need not always be in hours.   Example 4: Working together, two construction crews can build a shed in 5 days. Working separately, the less experienced crew takes twice as long to build a shed than the more experienced crew. Working separately, how long does it take each crew to build a shed? Solution: Working together, the job is completed in 5 days. This gives the following setup: The first column in the chart gives us an algebraic equation that models the problem: Solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 2x. To determine the time it takes the less experienced crew, we use 2x: Answer: Working separately, the experienced crew takes 7½ days to build a shed, and the less experienced crew takes 15 days to build a shed.   Try this! Joe’s garden hose fills the pool in 12 hours. His neighbor has a thinner hose that fills the pool in 15 hours. How long will it take to fill the pool using both hoses? Answer: It will take both hoses 6 2 3 hours to fill the pool. 
book2_chapter7_7_1	no label	Direct Variation Direct Variation Consider a freight train moving at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour. The equation that expresses the distance traveled at that speed in terms of time is given by After 1 hour the train has traveled 30 miles, after 2 hours the train has traveled 60 miles, and so on. We can construct a chart and graph this relation. In this example, we can see that the distance varies over time as the product of the constant rate, 30 miles per hour, and the variable, t. This relationship is described as direct variation Describes two quantities x and y that are constant multiples of each other: y = k x . and 30 is called the variation constant. In addition, if we divide both sides of D = 30 t by t we have In this form, it is reasonable to say that D is proportional to t, where 30 is the constant of proportionality. In general, we have Key words Translation “y varies directly as x” y = k x “y is directly proportional Used when referring to direct variation. to x” “y is proportional to x” Here k is nonzero and is called the constant of variation The nonzero multiple k, when quantities vary directly or inversely. or the constant of proportionality Used when referring to the constant of variation. .   Example 1: The circumference of a circle is directly proportional to its diameter, and the constant of proportionality is π . If the circumference is measured to be 20 inches, then what is the radius of the circle? Solution: Use the fact that “the circumference is directly proportional to the diameter” to write an equation that relates the two variables. We are given that “the constant of proportionality is π ,” or k = π . Therefore, we write Now use this formula to find d when the circumference is 20 inches. The radius of the circle, r, is one-half of its diameter. Answer: The radius is 10 π inches, or approximately 3.18 inches.   Typically, we will not be given the constant of variation. Instead, we will be given information from which it can be determined.   Example 2: An object’s weight on earth varies directly to its weight on the moon. If a man weighs 180 pounds on earth, then he will weigh 30 pounds on the moon. Set up an algebraic equation that expresses the weight on earth in terms of the weight on the moon and use it to determine the weight of a woman on the moon if she weighs 120 pounds on earth. Solution: We are given that the “weight on earth varies directly to the weight on the moon.” To find the constant of variation k, use the given information. A 180-pound man on earth weighs 30 pounds on the moon, or y = 180 when x = 30 . Solve for k. Next, set up a formula that models the given information. This implies that a person’s weight on earth is 6 times her weight on the moon. To answer the question, use the woman’s weight on earth, y = 120   pounds , and solve for x. Answer: The woman weighs 20 pounds on the moon. 
book2_chapter7_7_2	no label	Inverse Variation Inverse Variation Next, consider the relationship between time and rate, If we wish to travel a fixed distance, then we can determine the average speed required to travel that distance in a given amount of time. For example, if we wish to drive 240 miles in 4 hours, we can determine the required average speed as follows: The average speed required to drive 240 miles in 4 hours is 60 miles per hour. If we wish to drive the 240 miles in 5 hours, then determine the required speed using a similar equation: In this case, we would only have to average 48 miles per hour. We can make a chart and view this relationship on a graph. This is an example of an inverse relationship. We say that r is inversely proportional to the time t, where 240 is the constant of proportionality. In general, we have Key words Translation “y varies inversely Describes two quantities x and y, where one variable is directly proportional to the reciprocal of the other: y = k x . as x” y = k x “y is inversely proportional Used when referring to inverse variation. to x” Again, k is nonzero and is called the constant of variation or the constant of proportionality.   Example 3: If y varies inversely as x and y = 5 when x = 2 , then find the constant of proportionality and an equation that relates the two variables. Solution: If we let k represent the constant of proportionality, then the statement “y varies inversely as x” can be written as follows: Use the given information, y = 5 when x = 2 , to find k. Solve for k. Therefore, the formula that models the problem is Answer: The constant of proportionality is 10, and the equation is y = 10 x .   Example 4: The weight of an object varies inversely as the square of its distance from the center of earth. If an object weighs 100 pounds on the surface of earth (approximately 4,000 miles from the center), then how much will it weigh at 1,000 miles above earth’s surface? Solution: Since “w varies inversely as the square of d,” we can write Use the given information to find k. An object weighs 100 pounds on the surface of earth, approximately 4,000 miles from the center. In other words, w = 100 when d = 4,000: Solve for k. Therefore, we can model the problem with the following formula: To use the formula to find the weight, we need the distance from the center of earth. Since the object is 1,000 miles above the surface, find the distance from the center of earth by adding 4,000 miles: To answer the question, use the formula with d = 5,000. Answer: The object will weigh 64 pounds at a distance 1,000 miles above the surface of earth. 
book2_chapter7_7_3	no label	Joint Variation Joint Variation Lastly, we define relationships between multiple variables. In general, we have Vocabulary Translation “y varies jointly Describes a quantity y that varies directly as the product of two other quantities x and z: y = k x z . as x and z” y = k x z “y is jointly proportional Used when referring to joint variation. to x and z” Here k is nonzero and is called the constant of variation or the constant of proportionality.   Example 5: The area of an ellipse varies jointly as a, half of the ellipse’s major axis, and b, half of the ellipse’s minor axis. If the area of an ellipse is 300 π   cm 2 , where a = 10   cm and b = 30   cm , then what is the constant of proportionality? Give a formula for the area of an ellipse. Solution: If we let A represent the area of an ellipse, then we can use the statement “area varies jointly as a and b” to write To find the constant of variation, k, use the fact that the area is 300 π when a = 10 and b = 30 . Therefore, the formula for the area of an ellipse is Answer: The constant of proportionality is π , and the formula for the area is A = a b π .   Try this! Given that y varies directly as the square of x and inversely to z, where y = 2 when x = 3 and z = 27, find y when x = 2 and z = 16. Answer: 3/2 
book2_chapter8_1_1	no label	Square Roots Square Roots The square root The number that, when multiplied by itself, yields the original number. of a number is that number that when multiplied by itself yields the original number. For example, 4 is a square root of 16, because 4 2 = 16 . Since ( − 4 ) 2 = 16 , we can say that −4 is a square root of 16 as well. Every positive real number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. For this reason, we use the radical sign   √ to denote the principal (nonnegative) square root The positive square root of a real number, denoted with the symbol   √ . and a negative sign in front of the radical −   √ to denote the negative square root. Zero is the only real number with one square root. If the radicand The expression a within a radical sign, a √ n . , the number inside the radical sign, is nonnegative and can be factored as the square of another nonnegative number, then the square root of the number is apparent. In this case, we have the following property:   Example 1: Find the square root. a. 36 − − √ b. 144 − − − √ c. 0.04 − − − − √ d. 1 9 − − √ Solution: a. 36 − − √ = 6 2 − − √ = 6 b. 144 − − − √ = 12 2 − − − √ = 12 c. 0.04 − − − − √ = ( 0.2 ) 2 − − − − − √ = 0.2 d. 1 9 − − √ = ( 1 3 ) 2 − − − − √ = 1 3   Example 2: Find the negative square root. a. − 4 √ b. − 1 √ Solution: a. − 4 √ = − 2 2 − − √ = − 2 b. − 1 √ = − 1 2 − − √ = − 1 The radicand may not always be a perfect square. If a positive integer is not a perfect square, then its square root will be irrational. For example, 2 √ is an irrational number and can be approximated on most calculators using the square root button. Next, consider the square root of a negative number. To determine the square root of −9, you must find a number that when squared results in −9: However, any real number squared always results in a positive number: The square root of a negative number is currently left undefined.

Furthermore, we denote a cube root using the symbol   √ 3 , where 3 is called the index The positive integer n in the notation   √ n that is used to indicate an nth root. . For example, The product of three equal factors will be positive if the factor is positive and negative if the factor is negative. For this reason, any real number will have only one real cube root. Hence the technicalities associated with the principal root do not apply. For example, In general, given any real number a, we have the following property: When simplifying cube roots, look for factors that are perfect cubes.   Example 3: Find the cube root. a. 27 − − √ 3 b. 64 − − √ 3 c. 0 √ 3 d. 1 8 − − √ 3 Solution: a. 27 − − √ 3 = 3 3 − − √ 3 = 3 b. 64 − − √ 3 = 4 3 − − √ 3 = 4 c. 0 √ 3 = 0 3 − − √ 3 = 0 d. 1 8 − − √ 3 = ( 1 2 ) 3 − − − − √ 3 = 1 2   Example 4: Find the cube root. a. − 8 − − − √ 3 b. − 1 − − − √ 3 c. − 1 27 − − − − √ 3 Solution: a. − 8 − − − √ 3 = ( − 2 ) 3 − − − − − √ 3 = − 2 b. − 1 − − − √ 3 = ( − 1 ) 3 − − − − − √ 3 = − 1 c. − 1 27 − − − − √ 3 = ( − 1 3 ) 3 − − − − − − √ 3 = − 1 3 It may be the case that the radicand is not a perfect cube. If an integer is not a perfect cube, then its cube root will be irrational. For example, 2 √ 3 is an irrational number which can be approximated on most calculators using the root button. Depending on the calculator, we typically type in the index prior to pushing the button and then the radicand as follows: Therefore, we have 
book2_chapter8_1_3	no label	nth Roots nth Roots For any integer n ≥ 2 , we define the nth root The number that, when raised to the nth power, yields the original number. of a positive real number as that number that when raised to the nth power yields the original number. Given any nonnegative real number a, we have the following property: Here n is called the index and a n is called the radicand. Furthermore, we can refer to the entire expression a √ n as a radical Used when referring to an expression of the form a √ n . . When the index is an integer greater than 3, we say “fourth root”, “fifth root”, and so on. The nth root of any number is apparent if we can write the radicand with an exponent equal to the index.   Example 5: Find the nth root. a. 81 − − √ 4 b. 32 − − √ 5 c. 1 √ 7 d. 1 16 − − √ 4 Solution: a. 81 − − √ 4 = 3 4 − − √ 4 = 3 b. 32 − − √ 5 = 2 5 − − √ 5 = 2 c. 1 √ 7 = 1 7 − − √ 7 = 1 d. 1 16 − − √ 4 = ( 1 2 ) 4 − − − − √ 4 = 1 2 If the index is n = 2 , then the radical indicates a square root and it is customary to write the radical without the index, as illustrated below: We have already taken care to define the principal square root of a number. At this point, we extend this idea to nth roots when n is even. For example, 3 is a fourth root of 81, because 3 4 = 81 . And since ( − 3 ) 4 = 81 , we can say that −3 is a fourth root of 81 as well. Hence we use the radical sign   √ n to denote the principal (nonnegative) nth root The positive nth root when n is even. when n is even. In this case, for any real number a, we use the following property: For example, The negative nth root, when n is even, will be denoted using a negative sign in front of the radical −   √ n . We have seen that the square root of a negative number is not real because any real number, when squared, will result in a positive number. In fact, a similar problem arises for any even index: Here the fourth root of −81 is not a real number because the fourth power of any real number is always positive.   Example 6: Simplify. a. − 16 − − − − √ 4 b. − 16 − − √ 4 Solution: a. The radicand is negative and the index is even. Therefore, there is no real number that when raised to the fourth power is −16. b. Here the radicand is positive. Furthermore, 16 = 2 4 , and we can simplify as follows: When n is odd, the same problems do not occur. The product of an odd number of positive factors is positive and the product of an odd number of negative factors is negative. Hence when the index n is odd, there is only one real nth root for any real number a. And we have the following property:   Example 7: Find the nth root. a. − 32 − − − − √ 5 b. − 1 − − − √ 7 Solution: a. − 32 − − − − √ 5 = ( − 2 ) 5 − − − − − √ 5 = − 2 b. − 1 − − − √ 7 = ( − 1 ) 7 − − − − − √ 7 = − 1   Try this! Find the fourth root: 625 − − − √ 4 . Answer: 5 Summary: When n is odd, the nth root is positive or negative depending on the sign of the radicand. When n is even, the nth root is positive or not real depending on the sign of the radicand.

Answer: 2 y   Example 2: Simplify: 9 x 2 − − − √ . Solution: The square root has index 2; use the fact that a n − − √ n = | a | when n is even. Since x is a variable, it may represent a negative number. Thus we need to ensure that the result is positive by including the absolute value operator. Answer: 3 | x | Important Note Typically, at this point beginning algebra texts note that all variables are assumed to be positive. If this is the case, then x in the previous example is positive and the absolute value operator is not needed. The example can be simplified as follows: In this section, we will assume that all variables are positive. This allows us to focus on calculating nth roots without the technicalities associated with the principal nth root problem. For this reason, we will use the following property for the rest of the section: When simplifying radical expressions, look for factors with powers that match the index.   Example 3: Simplify: .

Answer: Tip To easily simplify an nth root, we can divide the powers by the index. If the index does not divide into the power evenly, then we can use the quotient and remainder to simplify.

For example, the terms 3 5 √ and 4 5 √ contain like radicals and can be added using the distributive property as follows: Typically, we do not show the step involving the distributive property and simply write When adding terms with like radicals, add only the coefficients; the radical part remains the same.   Example 1: Add: 3 2 √ + 2 2 √ . Solution: The terms contain like radicals; therefore, add the coefficients. Answer: 5 2 √   Subtraction is performed in a similar manner.   Example 2: Subtract: 2 7 √ − 3 7 √ . Solution: Answer: − 7 √   If the radicand and the index are not exactly the same, then the radicals are not similar and we cannot combine them.   Example 3: Simplify: 10 5 √ + 6 2 √ − 9 5 √ − 7 2 √ . Solution: We cannot simplify any further because 5 √ and 2 √ are not like radicals; the radicands are not the same. Answer: 5 √ − 2 √ Caution It is important to point out that 5 √ − 2 √ ≠ 5 − 2 − − − − √ . We can verify this by calculating the value of each side with a calculator. In general, note that a √ n ± b √ n ≠ a ± b − − − − √ n . Example 4: Simplify: 3   6 √ 3 + 2 6 √ − 6 √ 3 − 3 6 √ .

Solution: Apply the distributive property and then combine like terms. Answer: −3   It is important to note that when multiplying conjugate radical expressions, we obtain a rational expression.

book2_chapter8_4_2	no label	Dividing Radical Expressions (Rationalizing the Denominator) Dividing Radical Expressions (Rationalizing the Denominator) To divide radical expressions with the same index, we use the quotient rule for radicals. If a and b represent nonnegative numbers, where b ≠ 0 , then we have   Example 10: Divide: 80 √ 10 √ . Solution: In this case, we can see that 10 and 80 have common factors.

Solution: Answer: 3 b ⋅ a √ 3 2   When the divisor of a radical expression contains a radical, it is a common practice to find an equivalent expression where the denominator is a rational number. Finding such an equivalent expression is called rationalizing the denominator The process of determining an equivalent radical expression with a rational denominator. . To do this, multiply the fraction by a special form of 1 so that the radicand in the denominator can be written with a power that matches the index. After doing this, simplify and eliminate the radical in the denominator. For example, Remember, to obtain an equivalent expression, you must multiply the numerator and denominator by the exact same nonzero factor.   Example 13: Rationalize the denominator: 3 √ 2 √ . Solution: The goal is to find an equivalent expression without a radical in the denominator. In this example, multiply by 1 in the form 2 √ 2 √ . Answer: 6 √ 2   Example 14: Rationalize the denominator: 1 2 3 x √ . Solution: The radicand in the denominator determines the factors that you need to use to rationalize it. In this example, multiply by 1 in the form 3 x √ 3 x √ . Answer: 3 x √ 6 x   Typically, we will find the need to reduce, or cancel, after rationalizing the denominator.   Example 15: Rationalize the denominator: 5 2 √ 5 a b √ . Solution: In this example, we will multiply by 1 in the form 5 a b √ 5 a b √ . Notice that a and b do not cancel in this example. Do not cancel factors inside a radical with those that are outside. Answer: 10 a b √ a b   Try this! Rationalize the denominator: 4 a 3 b − − √ . Answer: 2 3 a b √ 3 b Up to this point, we have seen that multiplying a numerator and a denominator by a square root with the exact same radicand results in a rational denominator. In general, this is true only when the denominator contains a square root. However, this is not the case for a cube root. For example, Note that multiplying by the same factor in the denominator does not rationalize it. In this case, if we multiply by 1 in the form of x 2 √ 3 x 2 √ 3 , then we can write the radicand in the denominator as a power of 3. Simplifying the result then yields a rationalized denominator. For example, Therefore, to rationalize the denominator of radical expressions with one radical term in the denominator, begin by factoring the radicand of the denominator. The factors of this radicand and the index determine what we should multiply by. Multiply numerator and denominator by the nth root of factors that produce nth powers of all the factors in the radicand of the denominator.   Example 16: Rationalize the denominator: 1 25 √ 3 . Solution: The radical in the denominator is equivalent to 5 2 − − √ 3 . To rationalize the denominator, it should be 5 3 − − √ 3 . To obtain this, we need one more factor of 5. Therefore, multiply by 1 in the form of 5 √ 3 5 √ 3 . Answer: 5 √ 3 5   Example 17: Rationalize the denominator: 27 a 2 b 2 − − − √ 3 . Solution: In this example, we will multiply by 1 in the form 2 2 b √ 3 2 2 b √ 3 . Answer: 3 4 a b √ 3 2 b   Example 18: Rationalize the denominator: 1   4 x 3 √ 5 . Solution: In this example, we will multiply by 1 in the form 2 3 x 2 √ 5 2 3 x 2 √ 5 . Answer: 8 x 2 √ 5 2 x   When two terms involving square roots appear in the denominator, we can rationalize it using a very special technique. This technique involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the denominator. Recall that multiplying a radical expression by its conjugate produces a rational number.   Example 19: Rationalize the denominator: 1 3 √ − 2 √ . Solution: In this example, the conjugate of the denominator is 3 √ + 2 √ . Therefore, multiply by 1 in the form ( 3 √ + 2 √ ) ( 3 √ + 2 √ ) . Answer: 3 √ + 2 √   Notice that the terms involving the square root in the denominator are eliminated by multiplying by the conjugate. We can use the property ( a √ + b √ ) ( a √ − b √ ) = a − b to expedite the process of multiplying the expressions in the denominator.   Example 20: Rationalize the denominator: 2 √ − 6 √ 2 √ + 6 √ . Solution: Multiply by 1 in the form 2 √ − 6 √ 2 √ − 6 √ . Answer: − 2 + 3 √   Example 21: Rationalize the denominator: x √ + y √ x √ − y √ .

All of the rules for exponents developed up to this point apply. In particular, recall the product rule for exponents. Given any rational numbers m and n, then For example, if we have an exponent of 1 2 , then the product rule for exponents implies the following: Here 5 1 / 2 is one of two equal factors of 5; hence it is a square root of 5, and we can write Furthermore, we can see that 2 1 / 3 is one of three equal factors of 2. Therefore, 2 1 / 3 is the cube root of 2, and we can write This is true in general, given any nonzero real number a, In other words, the denominator of a fractional exponent determines the index of an nth root.   Example 1: Rewrite as a radical. a. 7 1 / 2 b. 7 1 / 3 Solution: a. 7 1 / 2 = 7 √ b. 7 1 / 3 = 7 √ 3   Example 2: Rewrite as a radical and then simplify. a. 81 1 / 2 b. 81 1 / 4 Solution: a. 81 1 / 2 = 81 − − √ = 9 b. 81 1 / 4 = 81 − − √ 4 = 3 4 − − √ 4 = 3   Example 3: Rewrite as a radical and then simplify. a. ( 125 x 3 ) 1 / 3 b. ( − 32 y 10 ) 1 / 5 Solution: a. b. Next, consider fractional exponents where the numerator is an integer other than 1. For example, consider the following: This shows that 5 2 / 3 is one of three equal factors of 5 2 . In other words, 5 2 / 3 is the cube root of 5 2 and we can write: In general, given any real number a, An expression with a rational exponent is equivalent to a radical where the denominator is the index and the numerator is the exponent. Any radical expression can be written with a rational exponent, which we call exponential form An equivalent expression written using a rational exponent. .   Example 4: Rewrite as a radical. a. 7 2 / 5 b. 2 3 / 4 Solution: a. 7 2 / 5 = 7 2 − − √ 5 = 49 − − √ 5 b. 2 3 / 4 = 2 3 − − √ 4 = 8 √ 4   Example 5: Rewrite as a radical and then simplify. a. 8 2 / 3 b. ( 32 ) 3 / 5 Solution: a. b. We can often avoid very large integers by working with their prime factorization. Given a radical expression, we will be asked to find the equivalent in exponential form. Assume all variables are positive.   Example 6: Rewrite using rational exponents: x 2 − − √ 3 . Solution: Here the index is 3 and the power is 2. We can write Answer: x 2 / 3   Example 7: Rewrite using rational exponents: y 3 − − √ 6 . Solution: Here the index is 6 and the power is 3. We can write Answer: y 1 / 2   It is important to note that the following are equivalent. In other words, it does not matter if we apply the power first or the root first. For example, we can apply the power before the root: Or we can apply the nth root before the power: The results are the same.   Example 8: Rewrite as a radical and then simplify: ( − 8 ) 2 / 3 .

book2_chapter8_6_1	no label	Radical Equations Radical Equations A radical equation Any equation that contains one or more radicals with a variable in the radicand. is any equation that contains one or more radicals with a variable in the radicand. Following are some examples of radical equations, all of which will be solved in this section: We begin with the squaring property of equality Given real numbers a and b, where a = b , then a 2 = b 2 . ; given real numbers a and b, we have the following: In other words, equality is retained if we square both sides of an equation. The converse, on the other hand, is not necessarily true: This is important because we will use this property to solve radical equations. Consider a very simple radical equation that can be solved by inspection: Here we can see that x = 9 is a solution. To solve this equation algebraically, make use of the squaring property of equality and the fact that ( a √ ) 2 = a 2 − − √ = a when a is positive. Eliminate the square root by squaring both sides of the equation as follows: As a check, we can see that 9 √ = 3 as expected. Because the converse of the squaring property of equality is not necessarily true, solutions to the squared equation may not be solutions to the original. Hence squaring both sides of an equation introduces the possibility of extraneous solutions A solution that does not solve the original equation. , or solutions that do not solve the original equation. For this reason, we must check the answers that result from squaring both sides of an equation.   Example 1: Solve: x − 1 − − − − − √ = 5 . Solution: We can eliminate the square root by applying the squaring property of equality. Next, we must check. Answer: The solution is 26.   Example 2: Solve: 5 − 4 x − − − − − √ = x . Solution: Begin by squaring both sides of the equation. You are left with a quadratic equation that can be solved by factoring. Since you squared both sides, you must check your solutions. After checking, you can see that x = − 5 was extraneous; it did not solve the original radical equation. Disregard that answer. This leaves x = 1 as the only solution. Answer: The solution is x = 1 .   In the previous two examples, notice that the radical is isolated on one side of the equation. Typically, this is not the case. The steps for solving radical equations involving square roots are outlined in the following example.   Example 3: Solve: 2 x − 5 − − − − − √ + 4 = x . Solution: Step 1: Isolate the square root. Begin by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation. Step 2: Square both sides. Squaring both sides eliminates the square root. Step 3: Solve the resulting equation. Here you are left with a quadratic equation that can be solved by factoring. Step 4: Check the solutions in the original equation. Squaring both sides introduces the possibility of extraneous solutions; hence the check is required. After checking, we can see that x = 3 is an extraneous root; it does not solve the original radical equation. This leaves x = 7 as the only solution. Answer: The solution is x = 7 .   Example 4: Solve: 3 x + 1 − − − − − √ − 2 x = 0 . Solution: Begin by isolating the term with the radical. Despite the fact that the term on the left side has a coefficient, it is still considered isolated. Recall that terms are separated by addition or subtraction operators. Solve the resulting quadratic equation. Since we squared both sides, we must check our solutions. After checking, we can see that x = − 3 4 was extraneous. Answer: The solution is 3.   Sometimes both of the possible solutions are extraneous.   Example 5: Solve: 4 − 11 x − − − − − − √ − x + 2 = 0 . Solution: Begin by isolating the radical. Since we squared both sides, we must check our solutions. Since both possible solutions are extraneous, the equation has no solution. Answer: No solution, Ø   The squaring property of equality extends to any positive integer power n. Given real numbers a and b, we have the following: This is often referred to as the power property of equality Given any positive integer n and real numbers a and b, where a = b , then a n = b n . . Use this property, along with the fact that ( a √ n ) n = a n − − √ n = a , when a is positive, to solve radical equations with indices greater than 2.   Example 6: Solve: x 2 + 4 − − − − − √ 3 − 2 = 0 . Solution: Isolate the radical and then cube both sides of the equation. Check. Answer: The solutions are −2 and 2.   Try this! Solve: 2 x − 1 − − − − − √ + 2 = x . Answer: x = 5 ( x = 1 is extraneous) It may be the case that the equation has two radical expressions.   Example 7: Solve: 3 x − 4 − − − − − √ = 2 x + 9 − − − − − √ . Solution: Both radicals are considered isolated on separate sides of the equation. Check x = 13 . Answer: The solution is 13.   Example 8: Solve: x 2 + x − 14 − − − − − − − − − √ 3 = x + 50 − − − − − √ 3 . Solution: Eliminate the radicals by cubing both sides. Check. Answer: The solutions are −8 and 8.   We will learn how to solve some of the more advanced radical equations in the next course, Intermediate Algebra.   Try this! Solve: 3 x + 1 − − − − − √ = 2 x − 3 − − − − − √ . Answer: 13 
book2_chapter9_1_1	no label	Extracting Square Roots Extracting Square Roots Recall that a quadratic equation is in standard form Any quadratic equation in the form a x 2 + b x + c = 0 , where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . if it is equal to 0: where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . A solution to such an equation is called a root A solution to a quadratic equation in standard form. . Quadratic equations can have two real solutions, one real solution, or no real solution. If the quadratic expression on the left factors, then we can solve it by factoring. A review of the steps used to solve by factoring follow: Step 1: Express the quadratic equation in standard form. Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression. Step 3: Apply the zero-product property and set each variable factor equal to 0. Step 4: Solve the resulting linear equations. For example, we can solve x 2 − 4 = 0 by factoring as follows: The two solutions are −2 and 2. The goal in this section is to develop an alternative method that can be used to easily solve equations where b = 0, giving the form The equation x 2 − 4 = 0 is in this form and can be solved by first isolating x 2 . If we take the square root of both sides of this equation, we obtain the following: Here we see that x = − 2 and x = 2 are solutions to the resulting equation. In general, this describes the square root property For any real number k, if x 2 = k , then x = ± k √ . ; for any real number k, The notation “±” is read “plus or minus” and is used as compact notation that indicates two solutions. Hence the statement x = ± k √ indicates that x = − k √ or x = k √ . Applying the square root property as a means of solving a quadratic equation is called extracting the roots Applying the square root property as a means of solving a quadratic equation. .   Example 1: Solve: x 2 − 25 = 0 . Solution: Begin by isolating the square. Next, apply the square root property. Answer: The solutions are −5 and 5. The check is left to the reader.   Certainly, the previous example could have been solved just as easily by factoring. However, it demonstrates a technique that can be used to solve equations in this form that do not factor.   Example 2: Solve: x 2 − 5 = 0 . Solution: Notice that the quadratic expression on the left does not factor. We can extract the roots if we first isolate the leading term, x 2 . Apply the square root property. For completeness, check that these two real solutions solve the original quadratic equation. Generally, the check is optional. Answer: The solutions are − 5 √ and 5 √ .   Example 3: Solve: 4 x 2 − 45 = 0 . Solution: Begin by isolating x 2 . Apply the square root property and then simplify. Answer: The solutions are − 3 5 √ 2 and 3 5 √ 2 .   Sometimes quadratic equations have no real solution.   Example 4: Solve: x 2 + 9 = 0 . Solution: Begin by isolating x 2 . After applying the square root property, we are left with the square root of a negative number. Therefore, there is no real solution to this equation. Answer: No real solution   Reverse this process to find equations with given solutions of the form ±k.   Example 5: Find an equation with solutions − 2 3 √ and 2 3 √ . Solution: Begin by squaring both sides of the following equation: Lastly, subtract 12 from both sides and present the equation in standard form. Answer: x 2 − 12 = 0   Try this! Solve: 9 x 2 − 8 = 0 . Answer: x = − 2 2 √ 3 or x = 2 2 √ 3 Consider solving the following equation: To solve this equation by factoring, first square x + 2 and then put it in standard form, equal to zero, by subtracting 25 from both sides. Factor and then apply the zero-product property. The two solutions are −7 and 3. When an equation is in this form, we can obtain the solutions in fewer steps by extracting the roots.   Example 6: Solve: ( x + 2 ) 2 = 25 . Solution: Solve by extracting the roots. At this point, separate the “plus or minus” into two equations and simplify each individually. Answer: The solutions are −7 and 3.   In addition to fewer steps, this method allows us to solve equations that do not factor.   Example 7: Solve: ( 3 x + 3 ) 2 − 27 = 0 . Solution: Begin by isolating the square. Next, extract the roots and simplify. Solve for x. Answer: The solutions are − 1 − 3 √ and − 1 + 3 √ .   Example 8: Solve: 9 ( 2 x − 1 ) 2 − 8 = 0 . Solution: Begin by isolating the square factor. Apply the square root property and solve. Answer: The solutions are 3 − 2 2 √ 6 and 3 + 2 2 √ 6 .   Try this! Solve: 3 ( x − 5 ) 2 − 2 = 0 . Answer: 15 ± 6 √ 3   Example 9: The length of a rectangle is twice its width. If the diagonal measures 2 feet, then find the dimensions of the rectangle. Solution: The diagonal of any rectangle forms two right triangles. Thus the Pythagorean theorem applies. The sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse: Solve. Here we obtain two solutions, w = − 2 5 √ and w = 2 5 √ . Since the problem asked for a length of a rectangle, we disregard the negative answer. Furthermore, we will rationalize the denominator and present our solutions without any radicals in the denominator. Back substitute to find the length. Answer: The length of the rectangle is 4 5 √ 5 feet and the width is 2 5 √ 5 feet. 
book2_chapter9_2_1	no label	Completing the Square Completing the Square In this section, we will devise a method for rewriting any quadratic equation of the form in the form This process is called completing the square The process of rewriting a quadratic equation in the form ( x − p ) 2 = q . . As we have seen, quadratic equations in this form can easily be solved by extracting roots. We begin by examining perfect square trinomials: The last term, 9, is the square of one-half of the coefficient of x. In general, this is true for any perfect square trinomial of the form x 2 + b x + c . In other words, any trinomial of the form x 2 + b x + c will be a perfect square trinomial if Note It is important to point out that the leading coefficient must be equal to 1 for this to be true.   Example 1: Complete the square: x 2 + 8 x +       ?     = ( x +     ?   ) 2 . Solution: In this example, the coefficient of the middle term b = 8, so find the value that completes the square as follows: The value that completes the square is 16. Answer: x 2 + 8 x + 16 = ( x + 4 ) 2   Example 2: Complete the square: x 2 + 3 x +       ?     = ( x +     ?   ) 2 . Solution: Here b = 3, so find the value that will complete the square as follows: The value 9/4 completes the square: Answer: x 2 + 3 x + 9 4 = ( x + 3 2 ) 2   We can use this technique to solve quadratic equations. The idea is to take any quadratic equation in standard form and complete the square so that we can solve it by extracting roots. The following are general steps for solving a quadratic equation with a leading coefficient of 1 in standard form by completing the square.   Example 3: Solve by completing the square: x 2 + 14 x + 46 = 0 . Solution: Step 1: Add or subtract the constant term to obtain the equation in the form x 2 + b x       = c . In this example, subtract 46 to move it to the right side of the equation. Step 2: Use ( b 2 ) 2 to determine the value that completes the square. Here b = 14: Step 3: Add ( b 2 ) 2 to both sides of the equation and complete the square. Step 4: Solve by extracting roots. Answer: The solutions are − 7 − 3 √ or − 7 + 3 √ . The check is optional.   Example 4: Solve by completing the square: x 2 − 18 x + 72 = 0 . Solution: Begin by subtracting 72 from both sides. Next, find the value that completes the square using b = −18. To complete the square, add 81 to both sides, complete the square, and then solve by extracting the roots. At this point, separate the “plus or minus” into two equations and solve each. Answer: The solutions are 6 and 12.   Note that in the previous example the solutions are integers. If this is the case, then the original equation will factor. If it factors, we can solve it by factoring. However, not all quadratic equations will factor.   Example 5: Solve by completing the square: x 2 + 10 x + 1 = 0 . Solution: Begin by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation. Here b = 10, and we determine the value that completes the square as follows: To complete the square, add 25 to both sides of the equation. Factor and then solve by extracting roots. Answer: The solutions are − 5 − 2 6 √ and − 5 + 2 6 √ .   Sometimes quadratic equations do not have real solutions.   Example 6: Solve by completing the square: x 2 − 2 x + 3 = 0 . Solution: Begin by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation. Here b = −2, and we have Therefore, At this point we see that extracting the root leads to the square root of a negative number. Answer: No real solution   Try this! Solve by completing the square: x 2 − 2 x − 27 = 0 . Answer: x = 1 ± 2 7 √ The coefficient of x is not always divisible by 2.   Example 7: Solve by completing the square: x 2 + 3 x − 2 = 0 . Solution: Begin by adding 2 to both sides. Use b = 3 to find the value that completes the square: To complete the square, add 9/4 to both sides of the equation. Solve by extracting roots. Answer: The solutions are − 3 ± 17 √ 2 .   So far, all of the examples have had a leading coefficient of 1. The formula ( b 2 ) 2 determines the value that completes the square only if the leading coefficient is 1. If this is not the case, then simply divide both sides by the leading coefficient.   Example 8: Solve by completing the square: 2 x 2 + 5 x − 1 = 0 . Solution: Notice that the leading coefficient is 2. Therefore, divide both sides by 2 before beginning the steps required to solve by completing the square. Begin by adding 1/2 to both sides of the equation. Here b = 5/2, and we can find the value that completes the square as follows: To complete the square, add 25/16 to both sides of the equation. Next, solve by extracting roots. Answer: The solutions are − 5 ± 33 √ 4 .   Try this! Solve: 2 x 2 − 2 x − 3 = 0 . Answer: x = 1 ± 7 √ 2 
book2_chapter9_3_1	no label	The Quadratic Formula The Quadratic Formula In this section, we will develop a formula that gives the solutions to any quadratic equation in standard form. To do this, we begin with a general quadratic equation in standard form and solve for x by completing the square. Here a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 : Determine the constant that completes the square: take the coefficient of x, divide it by 2, and then square it. Add this to both sides of the equation and factor. Solve by extracting roots. This derivation gives us a formula that solves any quadratic equation in standard form. Given a x 2 + b x + c = 0 , where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 , then the solutions can be calculated using the quadratic formula The formula x = − b ± b 2 − 4 a c √ 2 a , which gives the solutions to any quadratic equation in the form a x 2 + b x + c = 0 , where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . : Consider the quadratic equation 2 x 2 − 7 x + 3 = 0 . It can be solved by factoring as follows: The solutions are 1/2 and 3. The following example shows that we can obtain the same results using the quadratic formula.   Example 1: Solve using the quadratic formula: 2 x 2 − 7 x + 3 = 0 . Solution: Begin by identifying a, b, and c as the coefficients of each term. Substitute these values into the quadratic formula and then simplify. Separate the “plus or minus” into two equations and simplify each individually. Answer: The solutions are 1/2 and 3.   Of course, if the quadratic factors, then it is a best practice to solve it by factoring. However, not all quadratic polynomials factor; nevertheless, the quadratic formula provides us with a means to solve such equations.   Example 2: Solve using the quadratic formula: 5 x 2 + 2 x − 1 = 0 . Solution: Begin by identifying a, b, and c. Substitute these values into the quadratic formula. Answer: The solutions are − 1 ± 6 √ 5 .   Often terms are missing. When this is the case, use 0 as the coefficient.   Example 3: Solve using the quadratic formula: x 2 − 18 = 0 . Solution: Think of this equation with the following coefficients: Here Substitute these values into the quadratic formula. Answer: The solutions are ± 3 2 √ .   Since the coefficient of x was 0, we could have solved the equation by extracting the roots. As an exercise, solve the previous example using this method and verify that the results are the same.   Example 4: Solve using the quadratic formula: 9 x 2 − 12 x + 4 = 0 . Solution: In this case, Substitute these values into the quadratic formula and then simplify. In this example, notice that the radicand of the square root is 0. This results in only one solution to this quadratic equation. Normally, we expect two solutions. When we find only one solution, the solution is called a double root. If we solve this equation by factoring, then the solution appears twice. Answer: 2/3, double root   Example 5: Solve using the quadratic formula: x 2 + x + 1 = 0 . Solution: In this case, Substitute these values into the quadratic formula. The solution involves the square root of a negative number; hence the solutions are not real. This quadratic equation has two nonreal solutions and will be discussed in further detail as we continue in our study of algebra. For now, simply state that the equation does not have real solutions. Answer: No real solutions   Try this! Solve: x 2 − 2 x − 2 = 0 . Answer: 1 ± 3 √ It is important to place the quadratic equation in standard form before using the quadratic formula.   Example 6: Solve using the quadratic formula: ( 2 x + 1 ) ( 2 x − 1 ) = 24 x + 8 . Solution: Begin by using the distributive property to expand the left side and combining like terms to obtain an equation in standard form, equal to 0. Once the equation is in standard form, identify a, b, and c. Here Substitute these values into the quadratic formula and then simplify. Answer: The solutions are 6 ± 3 5 √ 2 .   Try this!

book2_chapter9_4_1	no label	Discriminant Discriminant If given a quadratic equation in standard form, a x 2 + b x + c = 0 , where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 , then the solutions can be calculated using the quadratic formula: The solutions are rational, irrational, or not real. We can determine the type and number of solutions by studying the discriminant The expression inside the radical of the quadratic formula, b 2 − 4 a c . , the expression inside the radical, b 2 − 4 a c . If the value of this expression is negative, then the equation has no real solutions. If the discriminant is positive, then we have two real solutions. And if the discriminant is 0, then we have one real solution.   Example 1: Determine the type and number of solutions: x 2 − 10 x + 30 = 0 . Solution: We begin by identifying a, b, and c. Here Substitute these values into the discriminant and simplify. Since the discriminant is negative, we conclude that there are no real solutions. Answer: No real solution   If we use the quadratic formula in the previous example, we find that a negative radicand stops the process of simplification and shows that there is no real solution. Note We will study quadratic equations with no real solutions as we progress in our study of algebra.   Example 2: Determine the type and number of solutions: 7 x 2 − 10 x + 1 = 0 . Solution: Here Substitute these values into the discriminant: Since the discriminant is positive, we can conclude that there are two real solutions. Answer: Two real solutions   If we use the quadratic formula in the previous example, we find that a positive radicand in the quadratic formula leads to two real solutions. The two real solutions are 5 − 3 2 √ 7 and 5 + 3 2 √ 7 . Note that these solutions are irrational; we can approximate the values on a calculator.   Example 3: Determine the type and number of solutions: 2 x 2 − 7 x − 4 = 0 . Solution: In this example, Substitute these values into the discriminant and simplify. Since the discriminant is positive, we conclude that there are two real solutions. Furthermore, since the discriminant is a perfect square, we obtain two rational solutions. Answer: Two real solutions   We could solve the previous quadratic equation using the quadratic formula as follows: Note that if the discriminant is a perfect square, then we could have factored the original equation. Given the special condition where the discriminant is 0, we obtain only one solution, a double root.   Example 4: Determine the type and number of solutions: 9 x 2 − 6 x + 1 = 0 . Solution: Here a = 9 , b = − 6 , and c = 1 , and we have Since the discriminant is 0, we conclude that there is only one real solution, a double root. Answer: One real solution   Since 0 is a perfect square, we can solve the equation above by factoring. Here 1/3 is a solution that occurs twice; it is a double root. In summary, if given any quadratic equation in standard form, a x 2 + b x + c = 0 , where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 , then we have the following: Positive discriminant: b 2 − 4 a c > 0 Two real solutions Zero discriminant: b 2 − 4 a c = 0 One real solution Negative discriminant: b 2 − 4 a c < 0 No real solution As we will see, knowing the number and type of solutions ahead of time helps us determine which method is best for solving a quadratic equation.   Try this!

book2_chapter9_4_3	no label	Applications Involving Quadratic Equations Applications Involving Quadratic Equations In this section, the algebraic setups usually consist of a quadratic equation where the solutions may not be integers.   Example 10: The height of a triangle is 2 inches less than twice the length of its base. If the total area of the triangle is 11 square inches, then find the lengths of the base and height. Round answers to the nearest hundredth. Solution: Use the formula A = 1 2 b h and the fact that the area is 11 square inches to set up an algebraic equation. To rewrite this quadratic equation in standard form, first distribute 1 2 x . Use the coefficients, a = 1, b = −1, and c = −11, to determine the type of solutions. Since the discriminant is positive, expect two real solutions. In this problem, disregard the negative solution and consider only the positive solution. Back substitute to find the height. Answer: The base measures 1 + 3 5 √ 2 ≈ 3.85 inches and the height is − 1 + 3 5 √ ≈ 5.71 inches.   Example 11: The sum of the squares of two consecutive positive integers is 481. Find the integers.

book2_chapter9_5_1	no label	The Graph of a Quadratic Equation The Graph of a Quadratic Equation We know that any linear equation with two variables can be written in the form y = m x + b and that its graph is a line. In this section, we will see that any quadratic equation of the form y = a x 2 + b x + c has a curved graph called a parabola The graph of any quadratic equation y = a x 2 + b x + c , where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . . Two points determine any line. However, since a parabola is curved, we should find more than two points. In this text, we will determine at least five points as a means to produce an acceptable sketch. To begin, we graph our first parabola by plotting points. Given a quadratic equation of the form y = a x 2 + b x + c , x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable. Choose some values for x and then determine the corresponding y-values. Then plot the points and sketch the graph.   Example 1: Graph by plotting points: y = x 2 − 2 x − 3 . Solution: In this example, choose the x-values {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and calculate the corresponding y-values. Plot these points and determine the shape of the graph. Answer: When graphing, we want to include certain special points in the graph. The y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis. The x-intercepts are the points where the graph intersects the x-axis. The vertex The point that defines the minimum or maximum of a parabola. is the point that defines the minimum or maximum of the graph. Lastly, the line of symmetry The vertical line through the vertex, x = − b 2 a , about which the parabola is symmetric. (also called the axis of symmetry A term used when referencing the line of symmetry. ) is the vertical line through the vertex, about which the parabola is symmetric. For any parabola, we will find the vertex and y-intercept. In addition, if the x-intercepts exist, then we will want to determine those as well. Guessing at the x-values of these special points is not practical; therefore, we will develop techniques that will facilitate finding them. Many of these techniques will be used extensively as we progress in our study of algebra. Given a quadratic equation of the form y = a x 2 + b x + c , find the y-intercept by setting x = 0 and solving. In general, y = a ( 0 ) 2 + b ( 0 ) + c = c , and we have Next, recall that the x-intercepts, if they exist, can be found by setting y = 0 . Doing this, we have 0 = a 2 + b x + c , which has general solutions given by the quadratic formula, x = − b ± b 2 − 4 a c √ 2 a . Therefore, the x-intercepts have this general form: Using the fact that a parabola is symmetric, we can determine the vertical line of symmetry using the x-intercepts. To do this, we find the x-value midway between the x-intercepts by taking an average as follows: Therefore, the line of symmetry is the vertical line: We can use the line of symmetry to find the x-value of the vertex. The steps for graphing a parabola are outlined in the following example.   Example 2: Graph: y = − x 2 − 2 x + 3 . Solution: Step 1: Determine the y-intercept. To do this, set x = 0 and solve for y. The y-intercept is (0, 3). Step 2: Determine the x-intercepts. To do this, set y = 0 and solve for x. Here when y = 0, we obtain two solutions. There are two x-intercepts, (−3, 0) and (1, 0). Step 3: Determine the vertex. One way to do this is to use the equation for the line of symmetry, x = − b 2 a , to find the x-value of the vertex. In this example, a = −1 and b = −2: Substitute −1 into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. The vertex is (−1, 4). Step 4: Determine extra points so that we have at least five points to plot. In this example, one other point will suffice. Choose x = −2 and find the corresponding y-value. Our fifth point is (−2, 3). Step 5: Plot the points and sketch the graph. To recap, the points that we have found are y-intercept: (0, 3) x-intercept: (−3, 0) and (1, 0) Vertex: (−1, 4) Extra point: (−2, 3) Answer: The parabola opens downward. In general, use the leading coefficient to determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward. If the leading coefficient is negative, as in the previous example, then the parabola opens downward. If the leading coefficient is positive, then the parabola opens upward. All quadratic equations of the form y = a x 2 + b x + c have parabolic graphs with y-intercept (0, c). However, not all parabolas have x intercepts.   Example 3: Graph: y = 2 x 2 + 4 x + 5 . Solution: Because the leading coefficient 2 is positive, note that the parabola opens upward. Here c = 5 and the y-intercept is (0, 5). To find the x-intercepts, set y = 0. In this case, a = 2, b = 4, and c = 5. Use the discriminant to determine the number and type of solutions. Since the discriminant is negative, we conclude that there are no real solutions. Because there are no real solutions, there are no x-intercepts. Next, we determine the x-value of the vertex. Given that the x-value of the vertex is −1, substitute into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. The vertex is (−1, 3). So far, we have only two points. To determine three more, choose some x-values on either side of the line of symmetry, x = −1. Here we choose x-values −3, −2, and 1. To summarize, we have y-intercept: (0, 5) x-intercepts: None Vertex: (−1, 3) Extra points: (−3, 11), (−2, 5), (1, 11) Plot the points and sketch the graph. Answer:   Example 4: Graph: y = − 2 x 2 + 12 x − 18 . Solution: Note that a = −2: the parabola opens downward. Since c = −18, the y-intercept is (0, −18). To find the x-intercepts, set y = 0. Solve by factoring. Here x = 3 is a double root, so there is only one x-intercept, (3, 0). From the original equation, a = −2, b = 12, and c = −18. The x-value of the vertex can be calculated as follows: Given that the x-value of the vertex is 3, substitute into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. Therefore, the vertex is (3, 0), which happens to be the same point as the x-intercept. So far, we have only two points. To determine three more, choose some x-values on either side of the line of symmetry, x = 3 in this case. Choose x-values 1, 5, and 6. To summarize, we have y-intercept: (0, −18) x-intercept: (3, 0) Vertex: (3, 0) Extra points: (1, −8), (5, −8), (6, −18) Plot the points and sketch the graph. Answer:   Example 5: Graph: y = x 2 − 2 x − 1 . Solution: Since a = 1, the parabola opens upward. Furthermore, c = −1, so the y-intercept is (0, −1). To find the x-intercepts, set y = 0. In this case, solve using the quadratic formula with a = 1, b = −2, and c = −1. Here we obtain two real solutions for x, and thus there are two x-intercepts: Approximate values using a calculator: Use the approximate answers to place the ordered pair on the graph. However, we will present the exact x-intercepts on the graph. Next, find the vertex. Given that the x-value of the vertex is 1, substitute into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. The vertex is (1, −2). We need one more point. To summarize, we have y-intercept: (0, −1) x-intercepts: ( 1 − 2 √ , 0) and ( 1 + 2 √ , 0) Vertex: (1, −2) Extra point: (2, −1) Plot the points and sketch the graph. Answer:   Try this! Graph: y = 9 x 2 − 5 . Answer: 
book2_chapter9_5_2	no label	Finding the Maximum and Minimum Finding the Maximum and Minimum It is often useful to find the maximum and/or minimum values of functions that model real-life applications. To find these important values given a quadratic function, we use the vertex. If the leading coefficient a is positive, then the parabola opens upward and there will be a minimum y-value. If the leading coefficient a is negative, then the parabola opens downward and there will be a maximum y-value.   Example 6: Determine the maximum or minimum: y = − 4 x 2 + 24 x − 35 . Solution: Since a = −4, we know that the parabola opens downward and there will be a maximum y-value. To find it, we first find the x-value of the vertex. The x-value of the vertex is 3. Substitute this value into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. The vertex is (3, 1). Therefore, the maximum y-value is 1, which occurs when x = 3, as illustrated below: Note The graph is not required to answer this question. Answer: The maximum is 1.   Example 7: Determine the maximum or minimum: y = 4 x 2 − 32 x + 62 . Solution: Since a = +4, the parabola opens upward and there is a minimum y-value. Begin by finding the x-value of the vertex. Substitute x = 4 into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. The vertex is (4, −2). Therefore, the minimum y-value of −2 occurs when x = 4, as illustrated below: Answer: The minimum is −2.   Try this! Determine the maximum or minimum: y = ( x − 3 ) 2 − 9 . Answer: The minimum is −9. A parabola, opening upward or downward (as opposed to sideways), defines a function and extends indefinitely to the right and left as indicated by the arrows. Therefore, the domain (the set of x-values) consists of all real numbers. However, the range (the set of y-values) is bounded by the y-value of the vertex.   Example 8: Determine the domain and range: y = x 2 − 4 x + 3 . Solution: First, note that since a = 1 is positive, the parabola opens upward. Hence there will be a minimum y-value. To find that value, find the x-value of the vertex: Then substitute into the equation to find the corresponding y-value. The vertex is (2, −1). The range consists of the set of y-values greater than or equal to the minimum y-value −1. Answer: Domain: R = (−∞, ∞); range: [−1, ∞)   Example 9: The height in feet of a projectile is given by the function h ( t ) = − 16 t 2 + 72 t , where t represents the time in seconds after launch. What is the maximum height reached by the projectile? Solution: Here a = − 16 , and the parabola opens downward. Therefore, the y-value of the vertex determines the maximum height. Begin by finding the x-value of the vertex: The maximum height will occur in 9/4 = 2¼ seconds. Substitute this time into the function to determine the height attained. Answer: The maximum height of the projectile is 81 feet. 
book2_chapter9_5_3	no label	Finding the Vertex by Completing the Square Finding the Vertex by Completing the Square In this section, we demonstrate an alternate approach for finding the vertex. Any quadratic equation y = a x 2 + b x + c can be rewritten in the form In this form, the vertex is (h, k).   Example 10: Determine the vertex: y = − 4 ( x − 3 ) 2 + 1 . Solution: When the equation is in this form, we can read the vertex directly from the equation. Here h = 3 and k = 1. Answer: The vertex is (3, 1).   Example 11: Determine the vertex: y = 2 ( x + 3 ) 2 − 2 . Solution: Rewrite the equation as follows before determining h and k. Here h = −3 and k = −2. Answer: The vertex is (−3, −2).   Often the equation is not given in this form. To obtain this form, complete the square.   Example 12: Rewrite in y = a ( x − h ) 2 + k form and determine the vertex: y = x 2 + 4 x + 9 . Solution: Begin by making room for the constant term that completes the square. The idea is to add and subtract the value that completes the square, ( b 2 ) 2 , and then factor. In this case, add and subtract ( 4 2 ) 2 = ( 2 ) 2 = 4 . Adding and subtracting the same value within an expression does not change it. Doing so is equivalent to adding 0. Once the equation is in this form, we can easily determine the vertex. Here h = −2 and k = 5. Answer: The vertex is (−2, 5).   If there is a leading coefficient other than 1, then we must first factor out the leading coefficient from the first two terms of the trinomial.   Example 13: Rewrite in y = a ( x − h ) 2 + k form and determine the vertex: y = 2 x 2 − 4 x + 8 . Solution: Since a = 2, factor this out of the first two terms in order to complete the square. Leave room inside the parentheses to add a constant term. Now use −2 to determine the value that completes the square. In this case, ( − 2 2 ) 2 = ( − 1 ) 2 = 1 . Add and subtract 1 and factor as follows: In this form, we can easily determine the vertex. Here h = 1 and k = 6. Answer: The vertex is (1, 6).   Try this! Rewrite in y = a ( x − h ) 2 + k form and determine the vertex: y = − 2 x 2 − 12 x + 3 . Answer: y = − 2 ( x + 3 ) 2 + 21 ; vertex: (−3, 21) 
book2_chapter9_6_1	no label	Introduction to Complex Numbers Introduction to Complex Numbers Up to this point, the square root of a negative number has been left undefined. For example, we know that − 9 − − − √ is not a real a number. There is no real number that when squared results in a negative number. We begin the resolution of this issue by defining the imaginary unit Defined as i = − 1 − − − √ and i 2 = − 1 . , i, as the square root of −1. To express a square root of a negative number in terms of the imaginary unit i, we use the following property, where a represents any nonnegative real number: With this we can write If − 9 − − − √ = 3 i , then we would expect that 3i squared equals −9: Therefore, the square root of any negative real number can be written in terms of the imaginary unit. Such numbers are often called imaginary numbers The square roots of any negative real numbers. .   Example 1: Rewrite in terms of the imaginary unit i. a. − 4 − − − √ b. − 5 − − − √ c. − 8 − − − √ Solution: a. − 4 − − − √ = − 1 ⋅ 4 − − − − − √ = − 1 − − − √ ⋅ 4 √ = i ⋅ 2 = 2 i b. − 5 − − − √ = − 1 ⋅ 5 − − − − − √ = − 1 − − − √ ⋅ 5 √ = i 5 √ c. − 8 − − − √ = − 1 ⋅ 4 ⋅ 2 − − − − − − − √ = − 1 − − − √ ⋅ 4 √ ⋅ 2 √ = i ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 √ = 2 i 2 √ Notation Note When an imaginary number involves a radical, place i in front of the radical. Consider the following: 2 i 2 √ = 2 2 √ i Since multiplication is commutative, these numbers are equivalent. However, in the form 2 2 √ i , the imaginary unit i is often misinterpreted to be part of the radicand. To avoid this confusion, it is a best practice to place the i in front of the radical and use 2 i 2 √ . A complex number Numbers of the form a + b i , where a and b are real numbers. is any number of the form where a and b are real numbers. Here a is called the real part The real number a of a complex number a + b i . and b is called the imaginary part The real number b of a complex number a + b i . . For example, 3 − 4 i is a complex number with a real part, 3, and an imaginary part, −4. It is important to note that any real number is also a complex number. For example, the real number 5 is also a complex number because it can be written as 5 + 0 i with a real part of 5 and an imaginary part of 0. Hence the set of real numbers, denoted R, is a subset of the set of complex numbers, denoted C. Adding and subtracting complex numbers is similar to adding and subtracting like terms. Add or subtract the real parts and then the imaginary parts.   Example 2: Add: ( 3 − 4 i ) + ( 2 + 5 i ) . Solution: Add the real parts and then add the imaginary parts. Answer:   To subtract complex numbers, subtract the real parts and subtract the imaginary parts. This is consistent with the use of the distributive property.   Example 3: Subtract: . Solution: Distribute the negative one and then combine like terms. Answer:   The distributive property also applies when multiplying complex numbers. Make use of the fact that to resolve the result into standard form: .   Example 4: Multiply: . Solution: Begin by applying the distributive property. Answer:   Example 5: Multiply: . Solution: Answer:   Given a complex number , its complex conjugate Two complex numbers whose real parts are the same and imaginary parts are opposite. If given , then its complex conjugate is . is . We next explore the product of complex conjugates.   Example 6: Multiply: . Solution: Answer: 25   In general, the product of complex conjugates The real number that results from multiplying complex conjugates: follows: Note that the result does not involve the imaginary unit; hence the result is real. This leads us to the very useful property: To divide complex numbers, we apply the technique used to rationalize the denominator. Multiply the numerator and denominator (dividend and divisor) by the conjugate of the denominator. The result can then be resolved into standard form, .   Example 7: Divide: . Solution: In this example, the conjugate of the denominator is . Multiply by 1 in the form . To express this complex number in standard form, write each term over the common denominator 5.

book7_1	no label	1 The Arithmetic of Numbers 1 The Arithmetic of Numbers 1 The Arithmetic of Numbers In 1960, Belgian Geologist Jean de Heinzelein de Braucourt discovered the Is- hango bone in central Africa. This bone, dated to be more than 20,000 years old, is believed to be the oldest known artifact indicating the use of arith- metic. The first written records indicate the Egyptians and Babylonians used arithmetic as early as 2000 BC. The Mayans used arithmetic to make astro- nomical computations, and developed the concept of zero over 2,000 years ago. The word “arithmetic” is derived from the Greek word arithmos (translated as “number”). It is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics and is used for a variety of tasks ranging from simple counting to advanced science and business calculations. 1 2 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS 
book7_1_1	no label	1.1 An Introduction to the Integers 1.1 An Introduction to the Integers 1.1 An Introduction to the Integers We begin with the set of counting numbers, formally called the set of natural numbers. The Natural Numbers. The set N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of natural numbers. If we add the number zero to the set of natural numbers, then we have a set of numbers that are called the whole numbers. The Whole Numbers. The set W = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of whole numbers. The number 0 is special, in that whenever you add it to another whole number, you get the identical number as an answer. Additive Identity Property. If a is any whole number, then a+ 0 = a. For this reason, the whole number 0 is called the additive identity. Thus, for example, 3 + 0 = 3, 15 + 0 = 15, and 123 + 0 = 123. These are all examples of the additive identity property. Every natural number has an opposite, so that when you add them together, their sum is zero. Additive Inverse Property. If a is any natural number, then define the opposite of a, symbolized by −a, so that a+ (−a) = 0. The number −a is called the “opposite of a,” or more formally, the additive inverse of a. For example, the opposite (additive inverse) of 3 is −3, and 3+ (−3) = 0. The opposite (additive inverse) of 12 is −12, and 12 + (−12) = 0. The opposite of 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 3 254 is −254, and 254+(−254) = 0. These are all examples of additive inverses and the additive inverse property. Because 7+ (−7) = 0, we’ve said that −7 is the opposite (additive inverse) of 7. However, we can also turn that around and say that 7 is the opposite of −7. If we translate the phrase “the opposite of −7 is 7” into mathematical symbols, we get −(−7) = 7. The opposite of the opposite. Because a+ (−a) = 0, we can say that a is the opposite of −a. In symbols, we write: −(−a) = a Thus, for example, −(−11) = 11, −(−103) = 103, and −(−1255) = 1255. 
book7_1_1_1	no label	The Integers The Integers The Integers If we collect all the natural numbers and their additive inverses, then include the number zero, we have a collection of numbers called the integers. The Integers. The set Z = {. . . ,−5,−4,−3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of integers. The integers can be made to correspond to points on a line in a very natural manner. First, draw a line, then locate the number zero anywhere you wish. Secondly, place the number one to the right of zero. This determines the length of one unit. Finally, locate the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . to the right of zero, then their opposites (additive inverses) −1, −2, −3, −4, −5, . . . to the left of zero (see Figure 1.1). −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 1.1: Each integer corresponds to a unique position on the number line.

On the number line, some integers lie to the right of zero and some lie to the left of zero. 4 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS • If a is an integer that lies to the right of zero, then a is called a positive integer. • If a is an integer that lies to the left of zero, then a is called a negative integer. Thus, 4, 25, and 142 are positive integers, while−7, −53, and−435 are negative integers.

In similar fashion: • The integer 5 lies five units away from zero. Hence, |5| = 5. • The integer 0 lies zero units away from zero, Hence, |0| = 0.

If a is any integer, then: 1 · a = a and a · 1 = a For this reason, the integer 1 is called the “multiplicative identity.” Finally, note that (−1)(5) = −5. Thus, multiplying 5 by −1 is identical to taking the “opposite” of 5 or negating 5. The Multiplicative Property of −1. Multiplying by minus one is identical to negating. That is: (−1)a = −a

A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that stands for an unknown value that may vary. Let’s add the definition of an algebraic expression. Algebraic Expression. When we combine numbers and variables in a valid way, using operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, the resulting combination of mathematical symbols is called an algebraic expression. Thus, 2a, x+ 5, and y2, being formed by a combination of numbers, variables, and mathematical oper- ators, are valid algebraic expressions. An algebraic expression must be well-formed. For example, 2 +−5x is not a valid expression because there is no term following the plus sign (it is not valid to write +− with nothing between these operators). Similarly, 2 + 3(2 is not well-formed because parentheses are not balanced. In this section we will evaluate algebraic expressions for given values of the variables contained in the expressions.

The first difficulty with this expression is the fact that the graphing calculator does not have a bracket symbol for the purposes of grouping. The calculator has only parentheses for grouping. So we first convert our expression to the following: −213− 35(−18− 211(15− 223)) Note that brackets and parentheses are completely interchangeable. The next difficulty is determining which of the minus signs are negation symbols and which are subtraction symbols. If the minus sign does not appear between two numbers, it is a negation symbol.

Any number that can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers, q != 0, is called a rational number. The letter Q is used to represent the set of rational numbers. That is: Q = { p q : p and q are integers, q != 0 } Because −2/3, 4/5, and 123/(−12) have the form p/q, where p and q are integers, each is an example of a rational number. If you think you hear the word “fraction” when we say “rational number,” you are correct in your thinking. Any number that can be expressed as a fraction, where the numerator and denominator are integers, is a rational number. Every integer is also a rational number. Take, for example, the integer −12. There are a number of ways we can express −12 as a fraction with integer numerator and denominator, −12/1, 24/(−2), and −36/3 being a few.

The Greatest Common Divisor. Given two integers a and b, the greatest common divisor of a and b is the largest integer that divides evenly (with no remainder) into both a and b. The notation GCD(a, b) is used to represent the greatest common divisor of a and b. For example, GCD(12, 18) = 6, GCD(32, 40) = 8, and GCD(18, 27) = 9. We can now state when a fraction is reduced to lowest terms. Lowest Terms. A fraction a/b is said to be reduced to lowest terms if and only if GCD(a, b) = 1. A common technique used to reduce a fraction to lowest terms is to divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Reduce 8/12 to lowest terms.

Recall the definition of a prime number. Prime Number. A natural number greater than one is prime if and only if its only divisors are one and itself. For example, 7 is prime (its only divisors are 1 and 7), but 14 is not (its divisors are 1, 2, 7, and 14). In like fashion, 2, 3, and 5 are prime, but 6, 15, and 21 are not prime. You Try It!

Alternate solution: Use factor trees to express both numerator and denom- inator as a product of prime factors. 10 2 5 40 4 2 2 10 2 5 Hence, 10 = 2 · 5 and 40 = 2 · 2 · 2 · 5.

When we cancel a 2 from both the numerator and denominator, we’re actually dividing both numerator and denominator by 2. A similar statement can be made about canceling the 5. Canceling both 2 and a 5 is equivalent to dividing both numerator and denominator by 10. This explains the 1 in the numerator when all factors cancel. Answer: 3/4 !

book7_1_3_6	no label	Fractions on the Graphing Calculator Fractions on the Graphing Calculator Fractions on the Graphing Calculator We must always remember that the graphing calculator is an “approximating machine.” In a small number of situations, it is capable of giving an exact answer, but for most calculations, the best we can hope for is an approximate answer. However, the calculator gives accurate results for operations involving frac- tions, as long as we don’t use fractions with denominators that are too large for the calculator to respond with an exact answer. 40 CHAPTER 1.

Thus, the expression 2/3 + 1/2 is equivalent to: 2/3 + 1/2 = 2 3 + 1 2 Divide first. = 4 6 + 3 6 Equivalent fractions with LCD. = 7 6 Add. Enter the expression 2/3+1/2 on your calculator, then press the ENTER key. The result is shown in the first image in Figure 1.12. Next, press the MATH button, then select 1:"Frac (see the second image in Figure 1.12) and press the ENTER key again. Note that the result shown in the third image in Figure 1.12 matches the correct answer of 7/6 found above. Figure 1.12: Calculating 2/3 + 1/2. b) The Rules Guiding Order of Operations tell us that there is no preference for division over multiplication, or vice-versa. We must perform divisions and multiplications as they occur, moving from left to right. Hence: 2/3× 5/7 = 2 3 × 5/7 Divide: 2/3 = 2 3 = 10 3 /7 Multiply: 2 3 × 5 = 10 3 = 10 3 × 1 7 Invert and multiply. = 10 21 Multiply: 10 3 × 1 7 = 10 21 1.3.

Enter the expression 3/5/1/3 on your calculator, then press the ENTER key. Select 1:"Frac from the MATH menu and press the ENTER key again. Note that the result in the first image in Figure 1.14 does not match the correct answer of 9/5 found above. What have we done wrong? If we follow the Rules Guiding Order of Operations exactly, then: 3/5/1/3 = 3 5 /1/3 Divide: 3/5 = 3 5 = 3 5 /3 Divide: 3 5 /1 = 3 5 = 3 5 × 1 3 Invert and multiply. = 1 5 Multiply: 3 5 × 1 3 = 1 5 42 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS This explains the answer found in the first image in Figure 1.14. However, it also show that: 3/5/1/3 is not equivalent to 3 5 ÷ 1 3 We can cure the problem by using grouping symbols. (3/5)/(1/3) = 3 5 / 1 3 Parentheses first. = 3 5 ÷ 1 3 / is equivalent to ÷.

book7_1_4	no label	1.4 Decimal Notation 1.4 Decimal Notation 1.4 Decimal Notation Every rational number can be expressed using decimal notation. To change a fraction into its decimal equivalent, divide the numerator of the fraction by its denominator. In some cases the process will terminate, leaving a zero remain- der. However, in other cases, the remainders will begin to repeat, providing a decimal representation that repeats itself in blocks. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Change each of the following fractions into decimals.Change 24/7 to a decimal. (a) 39 80 (b) 4 11 Solution: We perform two divisions, the one on the left to change 39/80 to a decimal, the one on the right to find a decimal representation for 4/11. 0.4875 80)39.0000 32 0 7 00 6 40 600 560 400 400 0 0.3636 11)4.0000 3 3 70 66 40 33 70 66 4 On the left, the division process terminates with a zero remainder. Hence, 39/80 = 0.4875 is called a terminating decimal. On the right, the remainders repeat in a pattern and the quotient also repeats in blocks of two. Hence, 4/11 = 0.3636 . . . is called a repeating decimal. We can also use a repeating bar to write 4/11 = 0.36. The block under the repeating bar repeats itself indefinitely.Answer: 3.428571 ! Vice-versa, any terminating decimal can be expressed as a fraction. You need only count the number of digits after the decimal point and use the same number of zeros in your denominator. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Express each of the following decimals as fractions. ReduceChange 0.45 to a fraction. Reduce to lowest terms. your answers to lowest terms. (a) 0.055 (b) 3.36 Solution: In each case, count the number of digits after the decimal point and include an equal number of zeros in the denominator. 1.4. DECIMAL NOTATION 49 In example (a), there are three dig- its after the decimal point, so we place the number over 1000, which has three zeros after the one. 0.055 = 55 1000 = 11 200 In example (b), there are two digits after the decimal point, so we place the number over 100, which has two zeros after the one. 3.36 = 336 100 = 84 25 Answer: 9/20 ! As we saw in Example 1, the repeating decimal 0.36 is equivalent to the fraction 4/11. Indeed, any repeating decimal can be written as a fraction. For example, 0.3 = 1/3 and 0.142857 = 1/7. In future courses you will learn a technique for changing any repeating decimal into an equivalent fraction. However, not all decimals terminate or repeat. For example, consider the decimal 0.42422422242222..., which neither terminates nor repeats. This number cannot be expressed using repeating bar notation because each iteration generates one additional 2. Be- cause this number neither repeats nor terminates, it cannot be expressed as a fraction. Hence, 0.42422422242222... is an example of an irrational number. Irrational numbers. If a number cannot be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers, q != 0, then the number is called an irrational number. Real numbers. By including all of the rational and irrational numbers in one set, we form what is known as the set of real numbers. The set of real numbers includes every single number we will use in this text- book and course.

THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS • To add two decimals with unlike signs, subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, then prefix the sign of the decimal number having the larger magnitude. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: (a) −2.3 + (−0.015) and (b) −8.4 + 6.95Simplify: −22.6 + 18.47 Solution: In part (a), note that we have like signs.

Sign Rules for multiplication and division. When multiplying or dividing two decimal numbers, use the following rules: • Like signs give a positive result. • Unlike signs give a negative result. Multiplication of decimal numbers is fairly straightforward. First multiply the magnitudes of the numbers, ignoring the decimal points, then count the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in each factor. Place the decimal point in the product so that the number of digits to the right of the decimal points equals the sum of number of digits to the right of the decimal point in each factor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: (−1.96)(2.8) Simplify: (−12.5)(−23.4) Solution: Multiply the magnitudes. The first decimal number has two digits to the right of the decimal point, the second has one digit to the right of the decimal point. Thus, we must place a total of three digits to the right of the decimal point in the product. (−1.96)(2.8) = −5.488 1.96 ×2.8 1 568 3 92 5.488 Note that unlike signs yield a negative product.

Thus, 2/5 = 0.4. = −3.2(0.4) + 5 Replace 2/5 with 0.4. = −1.28 + 5 Multiply: −3.2(0.4) = −1.28. = 3.72 Add: −1.28 + 5 = 3.72. Thus, if x = 2/5, then −3.2x+ 5 = 3.72.Answer: 8.725 ! As we saw in Example 2, we can easily change a terminating decimal into a fraction by placing the number (without the decimal point) over the proper power of ten. The choice of the power of ten should match the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

Rules for rounding. To round a number to a particular place, follow these steps: 1. Mark the place you wish to round to. The digit in this place is called the rounding digit. 2. Mark the digit in the place to the immediate right of the rounding digit. This is called the test digit. a) If the test digit is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to the rounding digit, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point may be deleted. b) If the test digit is less than 5, keep the rounding digit the same, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point may be deleted. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use your graphing calculator to evaluate 125x3−17.5x+44.8 at x = −3.13.

The Rules Guiding Order of Operations require that we first simplify the expression inside the parentheses. 2 · (3 + 5) = 2 · 8 Add: 3 + 5 = 8 = 16 Multiply: 2 · 8 = 16 Alternatively, we can instead distribute the 2 times each term in the parenthe- ses. That is, we will first multiply the 3 by 2, then multiply the 5 by 2. Then we add the results. 2 · (3 + 5) = 2 · 3 + 2 · 5 Distribute the 2. = 6 + 10 Multiply: 2 · 3 = 6 and 2 · 5 = 10 = 16 Add: 6 + 10 = 16 Note that both methods produce the same result, namely 16.

However, if you understand that subtraction is really the same as adding the opposite, and if you are willing to do a few steps in your head, you should be able to simply write down the answer immediately following the given problem. If you look at the expression −2(5y − 6) from Example 4 again, only this time think “multiply −2 times 5y, then multiply −2 times −6, then the result is immediate. −2(5y − 6) = −10y + 12 Let’s try this “speeding it up” technique in a couple more examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Use the distributive property to expand −3(−2x+ 5y − 12).Expand: −3(−2a+ 3b− 7) Solution: To distribute the −3, we simply think as follows: “−3(−2x) = 6x, −3(5y) = −15y, and −3(−12) = 36.” This sort of thinking allows us to write down the answer immediately without any additional steps. −3(−2x+ 5y − 12) = 6x− 15y + 36 Answer: 6a− 9b+ 21 !

Multiplicative Property of Minus One. If a is any number, then: (−1)a = −a This means that if we negate an expression, it is equivalent to multiplying the expression by −1. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Expand −(7x− 8y − 10). Expand: −(−a− 2b+ 11) Solution: First, negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. Then we can change subtraction to addition by “adding the opposite” and use the distribu- tive property to finish the expansion. −(7x− 8y − 10) = −1(7x− 8y − 10) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1 = −1(7x+ (−8y) + (−10)) Add the opposite. = −1(7x) + (−1)(−8y) + (−1)(−10) Distribute the −1. = −7x+ 8y + 10 Multiply. Thus, −(7x− 8y − 10) = −7x+ 8y + 10. Answer: a+ 2b− 11 ! While being mathematically precise, the technique of Example 7 can be simpli- fied by noting that negating an expression surrounded by parentheses simply changes the sign of each term inside the parentheses to the opposite sign. Once we understand this, we can simply “distribute the minus sign” and write: −(7x− 8y − 10) = −7x+ 8y + 10 In similar fashion, −(−3a+ 5b− c) = 3a− 5b+ c and −(−3x− 8y + 11) = 3x+ 8y − 11. 64 CHAPTER 1.

book7_1_5_4	no label	Combining Like Terms Combining Like Terms Combining Like Terms We can use the distributive property to distribute a number times a sum. a(b+ c) = ab+ ac However, the distributive property can also be used in reverse, to “unmultiply” or factor an expression. Thus, we can start with the expression ab + ac and “factor out” the common factor a as follows: ab+ ac = a(b+ c) You can also factor out the common factor on the right. ac+ bc = (a+ b)c We can use this latter technique to combine like terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify: 7x+ 5xSimplify: 3y + 8y Solution: Use the distributive property to factor out the common factor x from each term, then simplify the result. 7x+ 5x = (7 + 5)x Factor out an x using the distributive property. = 12x Simplify: 7 + 5 = 12 Thus, 7x+ 5x = 12x.Answer: 11y !

Examples 8 and 9 combine what are known as “like terms.” Examples 8 and 9 also suggest a possible shortcut for combining like terms. 1.5. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 65 Like Terms. Two terms are called like terms if they have identical variable parts, which means that the terms must contain the same variables raised to the same exponents. For example, 2x2y and 11x2y are like terms because they contain identical variables raised to the same exponents. On the other hand, −3st2 and 4s2t are not like terms. They contain the same variables, but the variables are not raised to the same exponents. Consider the like terms 2x2y and 11x2y. The numbers 2 and 11 are called the coefficients of the like terms. We can use the distributive property to combine these like terms as we did in Examples 8 and 9, factoring out the common factor x2y. 2x2y + 11x2y = (2 + 11)x2y = 13x2y However, a much quicker approach is simply to add the coefficients of the like terms, keeping the same variable part. That is, 2 + 11 = 13, so: 2x2y + 11x2y = 13x2y This is the procedure we will follow from now on. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Simplify: −8w2 + 17w2 Simplify: 4ab− 15ab Solution: These are like terms. If we add the coefficients −8 and 17, we get 9. Thus: −8w2 + 17w2 = 9w2 Add the coefficients and repeat the variable part. Answer: −11ab ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Simplify: −4uv − 9uv Simplify: −3xy − 8xy Solution: These are like terms. If we add −4 and −9, we get −13. Thus: −4uv − 9uv = −13uv Add the coefficients and repeat the variable part. Answer: −11xy ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Simplify: −3x2y + 2xy2 Simplify: 5ab+ 11bc 66 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: These are not like terms. They do not have the same variable parts. They do have the same variables, but the variables are not raised to the same exponents. Consequently, this expression is already simplified as much as possible. −3x2y + 2xy2 Unlike terms. Already simplified. Answer: 5ab+ 11bc ! Sometimes we have more than just a single pair of like terms. In that case, we want to group together the like terms and combine them. You Try It! EXAMPLE 13. Simplify: −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9vSimplify: −3z2 + 4z − 8z2 − 9z Solution: Use the associative and commutative property of addition to change the order and regroup, then combine line terms. −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9v = (−8u− 12u) + (−4v + 9v) Reorder and regroup. = −20u+ 5v Combine like terms. Note that −8u− 12u = −20u and −4v + 9v = 5v. Alternate solution. You may skip the reordering and regrouping step if you wish, simply combining like terms mentally. That is, it is entirely possible to order your work as follows: −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9v = −20u+ 5v Combine like terms. Answer: −11z2 − 5z ! In Example 13, the “Alternate solution” allows us to move more quickly and will be the technique we follow from here on, grouping and combining terms mentally.

book7_2	no label	2 Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities 2 Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities 2 Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities In this chapter, we will begin solving linear equations by using inverse opera- tions to solve for the unknown variable. Humans have been solving problems of this type for thousands of years. The earliest records indicate that the problems were written entirely in words with no symbols (such as +, −, ×, ÷, and =) or numbers. For example, a problem might read “Sixteen added to an unknown number is fifty-two.” Diophantes of Alexandria wrote a series of books Arithmetica demonstrat- ing solutions to equations in which he used some abbreviations for shortcuts. In 9th century AD, al-Khwarizmi wrote the book Al-Kitab al-mukhtasar ti Hisab al-jabr w’al-muqabala, translated as The Compendious Book on Calcu- lation by Restoration and Reduction. In fact, the word “algebra” is based on the word al-Jabr from the text title. His book described the rules of “Comple- tion and Reduction” to make it easier to do arithmetic computations needed in human business interactions. In the 1600-1700’s, mathematicians began writing out equations symboli- cally as we do today using the symbols +, −, ×, and ÷ for operations and = for equals. We will be solving equations which can be solved in logical steps by using inverse operations which “undo” each other. For example, one pair of inverse operations is addition and subtraction. Another pair of inverse operations is multiplication and division. We will also be solving inequalities which may have an infinite set of answers that can be expressed in three ways: by graphing on a number line, by using set-builder notation, or by using interval notation. 73 74 CHAPTER 2.

book7_2_1	no label	2.1 Solving Equations: One Step 2.1 Solving Equations: One Step 2.1 Solving Equations: One Step Let’s start with the definition of an equation. Equation. An equation is a mathematical statement that equates two alge- braic expressions. The key difference between a algebraic expression and an equation is the pres- ence of an an equals sign. So, for example, 2x+ 3, x− (3− 2x), and 2(y + 3)− 3(1− y) are algebraic expressions, while 2x+ 3 = 0, x− (3− 2x) = 4, and 2(y + 3)− 3(1− y) = −11 are equations. Note that each of the equations contain an equals sign, but the algebraic expressions do not. Next we have the definition of a solution of an equation. What it Means to be a Solution of an Equation. A solution of an equation is a numerical value that satisfies the equation. That is, when the variable in the equation is replaced by the solution, a true statement results. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Show that 8 is a solution of the equation x− 12 = −4.Which of the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is a solution of the equation 2y + 3 = 7. Solution. Substitute 8 for x in the given equation and simplify. x− 12 = −4 The given equation. 8− 12 = −4 Substitute 8 for x. −4 = −4 Simplify both sides. Since the left- and right-hand sides of the last line are equal, this shows that when 8 is substituted for x in the equation a true statement results. Therefore, 8 is a solution of the equation.Answer: 2 !

SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 75 Equivalent Equations. Two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution set. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Are the equations x− 3 = 6 and x = 9 equivalent? Are the equations x = 5 and x− 7 = 10 equivalent? Solution. The number 9 is the only solution of the equation x − 3 = 6. Similarly, 9 is the only solution of the equation x = 9. Therefore x− 3 = 6 and x = 9 have the same solution sets and are equivalent. Answer: No. ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Are the equations x2 = 1 and x = 1 equivalent? Are the equations x = 1 and x2 = x equivalent? Solution. By inspection, the equation x2 = 1 has two solutions, −1 and 1. (−1)2 = 1 and (1)2 = 1 On the other hand, the equation x = 1 has a single solution, namely 1. Hence, the equations x2 = 1 and x = 1 do not have the same solution sets and are not equivalent. Answer: No. ! As we shall soon see, equivalent equations play an important role in finding the solution of an equation. 
book7_2_1_2	no label	Wrap and Unwrap, Do and Undo Wrap and Unwrap, Do and Undo Wrap and Unwrap, Do and Undo Suppose that you are wrapping a gift for your cousin. You perform the following steps in order. 1. Put the gift paper on. 2. Put the tape on. 3. Put the decorative bow on. When we give the wrapped gift to our cousin, he politely unwraps the present, “undoing” each of our three steps in inverse order. 1. Take off the decorative bow. 2. Take off the tape. 3. Take off the gift paper. 76 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES This seemingly frivolous wrapping and unwrapping of a gift contains some deeply powerful mathematical ideas. Consider the mathematical expression x + 4. To evaluate this expression at a particular value of x, we would start with the given value of x, then add 4. • Let’s set x equal to the number 7. If we add 4, we arrive at the following result: 11 Now, how would we “unwrap” this result to return to our original number? We would start with our result, namely 11, then subtract 4. • Take our result from above, 11. If we subtract 4, we return to our original value of x: 7 The above discussion leads us to two extremely important observations. The inverse of addition is subtraction. If we start with a number x and add a number a, then subtracting a from the result will return us to the original number x. In symbols, x+ a− a = x. That is, subtracting a “undoes” the effect of adding a and returns us to the original number x. The inverse of subtraction is addition. If we start with a number x and subtract a number a, then adding a to the result will return us to the original number x. In symbols, x− a+ a = x. That is, adding a “undoes” the effect of subtracting a and returns us to the original number x. 
book7_2_1_3	no label	Operations that Produce Equivalent Equations Operations that Produce Equivalent Equations Operations that Produce Equivalent Equations In Example 1, we saw that x = 8 was a solution of the equation x − 12 = −4. Indeed, the equations x = 8 and x− 12 = −4 are equivalent equations because both have the same solution sets. In the case of the equation x − 12 = −4, it’s fairly easy to “guess” that the solution is x = 8, but as the equations become more complicated, we will want to know just what operations we can perform on the equation that will not change the solution set. The goal is to start with an equation such as x− 12 = −4, then through a series of steps that do not change the solution, arrive at the solution x = 8. 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 77 With these thoughts in mind, there are a number of operations that will pro- duce equivalent equations (equations with the same solution set). The first two that we will employ are adding or subtracting the same amount from both sides of an equation. Adding the Same Quantity to Both Sides of an Equation. Adding the same quantity to both sides of an equation does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, then adding c to both sides of the equation produces the equivalent equation a+ c = b+ c. Subtracting the Same Quantity from Both Sides of an Equation. Subtracting the same quantity to both sides of an equation does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, then subtracting c from both sides of the equation produces the equivalent equation a− c = b− c. Let’s look at an example where adding the same amount to both sides of the equation produces an equivalent equation that is the solution to the original equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve x− 7 = 12 for x. Solve for x: x− 6 = 4Solution: To undo the effect of subtracting 7, we add 7 to both sides of the equation. x− 7 = 12 Original equation. x− 7 + 7 = 12 + 7 Adding 7 to both sides of the equation produces an equivalent equation. x = 19 On the left, adding 7 “undoes” the effect of subtracting 7 and returns x. On the right, 12 + 7 = 19. Therefore, the solution of the equation is 19. 78 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Check: To check, substitute the solution 19 into the original equation. x− 7 = 12 Original equation. 19− 7 = 12 Substitute 19 for x. 12 = 12 Simplify both sides. The fact that the last line of the check is a true statement guarantees that 19 is a solution of x− 7 = 12.Answer: 10 ! In the solution of Example 4, we use the concept of the “inverse.” If we start with x, subtract 7, then add 7, we are returned to the number x. In symbols, x− 7 + 7 = x. We are returned to x because “subtracting 7” and “adding 7” are inverse operations of one another. That is, whatever one does, the other “undoes.” Next, let’s look at an example where subtracting the same amount from both sides of the equation produces an equivalent equation that is the solution to the original equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve x+ 2 3 = 1 2 for x.Solve for x: x+ 1 2 = 3 5 Solution: To undo the effect of adding 2/3, we subtract 2/3 from both sides of the equation. x+ 2 3 = 1 2 Original equation. x+ 2 3 − 2 3 = 1 2 − 2 3 Subtracting 2/3 from both sides produces an equivalent equation. x = 3 6 − 4 6 On the left, subtracting 2/3 “undoes” the effect of adding 2/3 and returns x. On the right, make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. x = −1 6 Subtract: 3 6 − 4 6 = −1 6 Therefore, the solution of the equation is −1/6. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 graphing calculator to check this solution. 1. Store the value −1/6 in the variable X using the following keystrokes. The result is shown in Figure 2.1. (-) 1 ÷ 6 STO!

Multiplying Both Sides of an Equation by a Nonzero Quantity. Mul- tiplying both sides of an equation by a nonzero quantity does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, and c != 0, then multiplying both sides of the equation by c produces the equivalent equation ac = bc. 80 CHAPTER 2.

That is, if a = b, and c != 0, then dividing both sides of the equation by c produces the equivalent equation a c = b c . Like addition and subtraction, multiplication and division are inverse opera- tions. The inverse of multiplication is division. If we start with a number x and multiply by a number a, then dividing the result by the same number a returns us to the original number x. In symbols, a · x a = x. That is, dividing by a “undoes” the effect of multiplying by a and returns us to the original number x. The inverse of division is multiplication. If we start with a number x and divide by a number a, then multiplying the result by the same number a returns us to the original number x. In symbols, a · x a = x.

On the right, divide: 0.42/(−2.1) = −2. Therefore, the solution of the equation is −2. Check: To check, substitute the solution −2 into the original equation. −2.1x = 0.42 Original equation. −2.1(−2) = 0.42 Substitute −2 for x. 0.42 = 0.42 On the left, multiply: −2.1(−2) = 0.42 The fact that the last line of the check is a true statement guarantees that −2 is a solution of −2.1x = 0.42.

To wrap a present we put the gift paper on, put the tape on, and put the decorative bow on. To unwrap the gift, we must “undo” each of these steps in inverse order. Hence, to unwrap the gift we take off the decorative bow, take off the tape, and take off the gift paper. Now, imagine a machine that multiplies its input by 3, then adds 5 to the result.

The “unwrapping” machine is pictured on the right in Figure 2.4. It will first sub- tract 5 from its input, then divide the result by 3. Note that each of these operations “undoes” the corresponding operation of the first machine, but in inverse order. The following argument shows that the second machine “undoes” the op- eration of the first machine. 1. Drop the integer 4 into the machine on the left in Figure 2.4.

SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES the equation, then divide both sides by 3. 3x+ 5 = 14 Original equation. 3x+ 5− 5 = 14− 5 To “undo” adding 5, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. 3x = 9 Simplify both sides. 3x 3 = 9 3 To “undo” multiplying by 3, divide both sides of the equation by 3. x = 3 Simplify both sides. Check: To check the solution, substitute 3 for x in the original equation and simplify. 3x+ 5 = 14 Original equation. 3(3) + 5 = 14 Substitute 3 for x. 9 + 5 = 14 Multiply first: 3(3) = 9. 14 = 14 Add: 9 + 5 = 14. Because the last line of the check is a true statement, this guarantees that 3 is a solution of the original equation.Answer: x = 2 ! Let’s try an equation with fractions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2.

To solve this equation for x, we must “undo” each of these operations in inverse order. Thus, we will first add 2/3 to both sides of the equation, then multiply both sides of the resulting equation by 5. x 5 − 2 3 = 1 2 Original equation. x 5 − 2 3 + 2 3 = 1 2 + 2 3 To “undo” subtracting 2/3, add 2/3 to both sides of the equation. On the left, we simplify. On the right, we make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. x 5 = 3 6 + 4 6 Make equivalent fractions x 5 = 7 6 Add: 3 6 + 4 6 = 7 6 . 2.2.

Solve for x: 5.2x+ 2.3 = −3.94Solve for x: 3.25− 1.2x = 0.37 Solution: On the left, order of operations demands that we first multiply x by 5.2, then add 2.3. To solve this equation for x, we must “undo” each of these operations in inverse order. Thus, we will first subtract 2.3 from both sides of the equation, then divide both sides by 5.2. 5.2x+ 2.3 = −3.94 Original equation. 5.2x+ 2.3− 2.3 = −3.94− 2.3 To “undo” adding 2.3, subtract 2.3 from both sides. 5.2x = −6.24 On the left, simplify. On the right, add: −3.94− 2.3 = −6.24. 5.2x 5.2 = −6.24 5.2 To “undo” multiplying by 5.2, divide both sides by 5.2. x = −1.2 On the left, simplify. On the right, divide: −6.24/5.2 = −1.2. Check: To check the solution, substitute −1.2 for x in the original equation and simplify. 5.2x+ 2.3 = −3.94 Original equation. 5.2(−1.2) + 2.3 = −3.94 Substitute −1.2 for x. −6.24 + 2.3 = −3.94 Multiply: 5.2(−1.2) = −6.24. −3.94 = −3.94 Add: −6.24 + 2.3 = −3.94.

Consider, for example, the equation 2x+3 = 5−7x. In cases like this, it is helpful to have a general understanding of what it means to “solve for x.” Solve for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, the goal is to manipulate the equation into the final form x = “Stuff”, 2.2. SOLVING EQUATIONS: MULTIPLE STEPS 91 where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other vari- ables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it must not contain any occurrence of the variable x. In this section, “Stuff” will always be a single number, but in Section 2.4, Formulae, “Stuff” will take on added complexity, including variables other than x. Strategy for solving for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, a common strategy is to isolate all terms containing the variable x on one side of the equation and move all terms not containing the variable x to the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 for x. Solve for x: 4x+ 7 = 5− 8xSolution: We need to isolate all terms containing x on one side of the equation. We can eliminate 5x from the right-hand side of 3−2x = 5x+9 by subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation. 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 Original equation. 3− 2x− 5x = 5x+ 9− 5x Subtract 5x from both sides. 3− 7x = 9 Simplify both sides. Next, eliminate 3 from the left-hand side of the last equation by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation. 3− 7x− 3 = 9− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. −7x = 6 Simplify both sides. Note how we have isolated all terms containing x on one side of the equation. −7x −7 = 6 −7 Divide both sides by −7. x = −6 7 Simplify both sides. 92 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Check: To check the solution, substitute −6/7 for x in the original equation. 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 Original equation. 3− 2 ( −6 7 ) = 5 ( −6 7 ) + 9 Substitute −6/7 for x. 3 + 12 7 = −30 7 + 9 Multiply: −2(−6/7) = 12/7 and 5(−6/7) = −30/7. 21 7 + 12 7 = −30 7 + 63 7 Make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. 33 7 = 33 7 Add.

Multiply: −3(4− 2x) = −12 + 6x. 12x− 10 = −34 Add: 6x+ 6x = 12x. Add: 2− 12 = −10. To “undo” subtracting 10, we add 10 to both sides of the equation. 12x− 10 + 10 = −34 + 10 Add 10 to both sides. 12x = −24 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 12, we divide both sides by 12. 12x 12 = −24 12 Divide both sides by 12. x = −2 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check this solution. 2.2.

On the right, distribute the 4. 12x− 15 = 4x− 4 On the left, add: 2x+ 10x = 12x 94 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Next, we need to isolate terms containing the variable x on one side of the equation. To remove the term 4x from the right-hand side, we subtract 4x from both sides of the equation. 12x− 15− 4x = 4x− 4− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 8x− 15 = −4 Simplify both sides. To remove the term −15 from the left-hand side, we add 15 to both sides of the equation. 8x− 15 + 15 = −4 + 15 Add 15 to both sides. 8x = 11 Simplify both sides. Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 8, we divide both sides by 8. 8x 8 = 11 8 Divide both sides by 8. x = 11 8 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check this solution. 1.

When clearing fractions from an equation, you will need to simplify products like the ones posed in the following examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify: 12 ( 2 3 x ) . Simplify: 15 ( 3 5 x )Solution: When we multiply three numbers, such as 12, 2/3, and x, the associative property of multiplication tells us that it does not matter which two numbers we multiply first. We use the associative property to regroup, then multiply numerators and denominators and simplify the result. 12 ( 2 3 x ) = ( 12 · 2 3 ) x Associative property of multiplication. = 24 3 x Multiply: 12 · 2 = 24. = 8x Divide: 24/3 = 8. Answer: 9x ! Example 1 shows all of the steps involved in arriving at the answer. How- ever, the goal in this section is to perform this calculation mentally. So we just “Multiply 12 and 2 to get 24, then divide 24 by 3 to get 8.” This approach allows us to write down the answer without doing any work. 12 ( 2 3 x ) = 8x You should practice this mental calculation until you can write down the answer without writing down any steps. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify: 18 ( 2 9 x ) Simplify: 14 ( 3 7 x )Solution: This time we perform the calculations mentally. Multiply 18 and 2 to get 36, then divide 36 by 9 to get 4. 18 ( 2 9 x ) = 4x Answer: 6x ! 100 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES When the numbers get larger, the mental calculations become harder. For example, consider 72 ( 8 9 x ) In this case, the work “multiply 72 and 8 to get 576, then divide 576 by 9 to get 64” is a bit difficult to carry in your head. However, this is when the calculator comes to the rescue. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Use your calculator to help simplify 72 ( 8 9 x ) . Use your calculator to simplify: 81 ( 5 9 x ) Solution: Use your calculator to multiply 72 and 8, then divide by 9. Enter 72*8/9 and press the ENTER key. Thus, 72 ( 8 9 x ) = 64x. Answer: 45x ! 
book7_2_3_1	no label	Canceling is More Efficient Canceling is More Efficient Canceling is More Efficient In Examples 1, 2, and 3, we multiplied numerators, then divided by the sole denominator. We also saw that it is a bit difficult to carry the work in our head as the numbers grow larger. In Chapter 1, Section 3, we saw that canceling reduces the size of the numbers and simplifies the work. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: 72 ( 8 9 x ) . Simplify: 64 ( 5 8 x ) Solution: In Example 3, we used our calculator to multiply 72 and 8 to get 576, then divided 576 by 9 to get 64. In this solution, we divide 9 into 72 to get 8, then multiply 8 by 8 to get 64. We get the same answer, but because the intermediate numbers are much smaller, the calculations are much easier to do mentally. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 101 72 ( 8 9 x ) = ( 72 · 8 9 ) x Associative property of multiplication. = (8 · 8)x Divide: 72/9 = 8. = 64x Multiply: 8 · 8 = 64. Answer: 40x ! Example 4 shows all of the steps involved in arriving at the answer. Again, the goal in this section is to perform this calculation mentally, so we just “Divide 9 into 72 to get 8, then multiply 8 by 8 to get 644.” 72 ( 8 9 x ) = 64x Not only does this approach allow us to write down the answer without doing any work, the numerical calculations involve smaller numbers. You should practice this mental calculation until you can write down the answer without writing down any steps. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: 27 ( 5 9 x ) . Simplify: 18 ( 3 2 x )Solution: Divide 9 into 27 to get 3, then multiply 3 by 5 to get 15. 27 ( 5 9 x ) = 15x Answer: 27x ! Note: The technique shown in Examples 4 and 5 is the technique we’ll use in the remainder of this section. Dividing (canceling) first is far more efficient, the smaller numbers allowing us to perform the calculation mentally.

To clear fractions from an equation, multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator. 102 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: x+ 2 3 = 1 2 .Solve for x: x− 3 4 = 1 2 Solution: The common denominator for 2/3 and 1/2 is 6. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6. x+ 2 3 = 1 2 Original equation. 6 ( x+ 2 3 ) = 6 ( 1 2 ) Multiply both sides by 6. 6x+ 6 ( 2 3 ) = 6 ( 1 2 ) On the left, distribute the 6. To simplify 6(2/3), divide 6 by 3 to get 2, then multiply 2 by 2 to get 4. Thus, 6(2/3) = 4. Similarly, 6(1/2) = 3. 6x+ 4 = 3 Multiply: 6 ( 2 3 ) = 4, 6 ( 1 2 ) = 3. Note that the fractions are now cleared from the equation. To isolate terms containing x on one side of the equation, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation. 6x+ 4− 4 = 3− 4 Subtract 4 from both sides. 6x = −1 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 6, divide both sides by 6. 6x 6 = −1 6 Divide both sides by 6. x = −1 6 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check the solution. 1.

We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15. 4 5 x = −4 3 Original equation. 15 ( 4 5 x ) = 15 ( −4 3 ) Multiply both sides by 15. To simplify 15(4/5), divide 5 into 15 to get 3, then multiply 3 by 4 to get 12. Thus, 15(4/5) = 12. Similarly, 15(−4/3) = −20 12x = −20 Multiply. To “undo” multiplying by 12, we divide both sides by 12. 12x 12 = −20 12 Divide both sides by 12. x = −5 3 Reduce to lowest terms. 104 CHAPTER 2.

Solve for x: 2x 3 − 3 4 = 1 2 − 3x 4 .Solve for x: 5x 9 − 2 3 = 5 9 − 3x 2 Solution: The common denominator for 2x/3, −3/4, 1/2, and −3x/4 is 12. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 12. 2x 3 − 3 4 = 1 2 − 3x 4 Original equation. 12 ( 2x 3 − 3 4 ) = 12 ( 1 2 − 3x 4 ) Multiply both sides by 12. 12 ( 2x 3 ) − 12 ( 3 4 ) = 12 ( 1 2 ) − 12 ( 3x 4 ) Distribute the 12 on each side. To simplify 12(2x/3), divide 3 into 12 to get 4, then multiply 4 by 2x to get 8x. Thus, 12(2x/3) = 8x. Similarly, 12(3/4) = 9, 12(1/2) = 6, and 12(3x/4) = 9x. 8x− 9 = 6− 9x Multiply. Note that the fractions are now cleared from the equation. We now need to isolate terms containing x on one side of the equation. To remove the term −9x from the right-hand side, add 9x to both sides of the equation. 8x− 9 + 9x = 6− 9x+ 9x Add 9x to both sides. 17x− 9 = 6 Simplify both sides. To remove the term −9 from the left-hand side, add 9 to both sides of the equation. 17x− 9 + 9 = 6 + 9 Add 9 to both sides. 17x = 15 Simplify both sides. 2.3.

book7_2_3_3	no label	Clearing Decimals from an Equation Clearing Decimals from an Equation Clearing Decimals from an Equation Multiplying by the appropriate power of ten will clear the decimals from an equation, making the resulting equivalent equation far easier to solve. Before we begin, first recall the following facts about multiplying by powers of ten. • 10(1.2345) = 12.345. Multiplying by 10 moves the decimal point one place to the right. • 100(1.2345) = 123.45. Multiplying by 100 moves the decimal point two places to the right. • 1000(1.2345) = 1234.5. Multiplying by 1000 moves the decimal point three places to the right. Note the pattern: The number of zeros in the power of ten determines the number of places to move the decimal point. So, for example, if we multiply by 1,000,000, which has six zeros, this will move the decimal point six places to the right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Solve for x: 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x.Solve for x: 1.34− 4.5x = 2.2 Solution: The first term of 2.3x − 1.25 = 0.04x has one decimal place, the second term has two decimal places, and the third and final term has two decimal places. At a minimum, we need to move each decimal point two places to the right in order to clear the decimals from the equation. Consequently, we multiply both sides of the equation by 100. 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x Original equation. 100(2.3x− 1.25) = 100(0.04x) Multiply both sides by 100. 100(2.3x)− 100(1.25) = 100(0.04x) Distribute the 100. 230x− 125 = 4x Multiplying by 100 moves all decimal points two places to the right. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 107 Note that the decimals are now cleared from the equation. We must now isolate all terms containing x on one side of the equation. To remove the term 4x from the right-hand side, subtract 4x from both sides of the equation. 230x− 125− 4x = 4x− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 226x− 125 = 0 Simplify. To remove −125 from the left-hand side, add 125 to both sides of the equation. 226x− 125 + 125 = 0 + 125 Add 125 to both sides. 226x = 125 Simplify both sides. Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 226, divide both sides by 226. 226x 226 = 125 226 Divide both sides by 226. x = 125 226 Simplify. Check: Let’s check the answer with the TI-84. 1.

Indeed, formulae in science typically use several letters. For example, Isaac Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation says that the magnitude of the force of attraction between two celestial bodies is given by the formula F = GMm r2 , where m usually denotes the mass of the smaller body, M the mass of the larger body, and r is the distance between the two bodies. The letter G represents the universal gravitational constant, having value 6.67428× 10−11 N(m/kg)2. Variable case. Note the use of upper and lower case letter M’s in Newton’s Law of Gravitation. When working with scientific formulae, you must maintain the case of the given letters. You are not allowed to substitute lower for upper case, or upper for lower case in your work. In Section 2.2, we described the goal that must be met when we are asked to “solve an equation for x.” Solve for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, the goal is to manipulate the equation into the final form x = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other vari- ables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it must not contain any occurrence of the variable x. Thus, to solve an equation for x, we need to isolate the terms containing x on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: x+ a = b. Solve for x: x− c = dSolution: To undo the effects of adding a, subtract a from both sides of the equation. x+ a = b Original equation. x+ a− a = b − a Subtract a from both sides. x = b − a Simplify. Answer: x = c+ d. ! 112 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES In Example 1, note that the answer x = b − a has the required form, x = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that contains other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it does not contain any occurrence of the variable x. Now, what if we were asked to solve the same equation for a, instead of x? You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve for a: x+ a = b.Solve for x: x− c = d Solution: We are instructed to solve the equation x+a = b for a. This means that our final answer must have the form a = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that contains other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it does not contain any occurrence of the variable a. This means that we must isolate all terms containing the variable a on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. Now, to undo the effect of adding x, subtract x from both sides of the equation. x+ a = b Original equation. x+ a− x = b− x Subtract x from both sides. a = b− x Simplify. Note that we have a = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” contains no occurrence of a, the variable we are solving for.Answer: c = x− d. ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. The formula F = kx, known as “Hooke’s Law”, predicts theSolve for m: E = mc2 force F required to stretch a spring x units. Solve the equation for k. Solution: We are instructed to solve the equation F = kx for k. This means that our final answer must have the form k = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it may not contain any occurrence of the variable k. This means that we must isolate all terms containing the variable k on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. However, note that all terms containing the variable k are already isolated on one side of the equation. Terms not containing the variable k are isolated on the other side of the equation. Now, to “undo” the effect of multiplying by x, divide both sides of the equation by x. F = kx Original equation. F x = kx x Divide both sides by x. F x = k Simplify. 2.4. FORMULAE 113 Saying that F/x = k is equivalent to saying that k = F/x. We can leave our answer in the form shown in the last step, but some instructors insist that we write the answer as follows: k = F x F/x = k is equivalent to k = F/x.

Solution: We are instructed to solve the equation V = RI for R. This means that our final answer must have the form R = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it may not contain any occurrence of the variable R. This means that we must isolate all terms containing the variable R on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. However, note that all terms containing the variable R are already isolated on one side of the equation. Terms not containing the variable R are isolated on the other side of the equation. Now, to “undo” the effect of multiplying by I, divide both sides of the equation by I. V = RI Original equation. V I = RI I Divide both sides by I. V I = R Simplify. This can also be written in the following form: R = V I V/I = R is equivalent to R = V/I. Note that we have R = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” contains no occurrence of R, the variable we are solving for.

L W L W The perimeter (distance around) of the rectangle is found by summing its four sides, then combining like terms. P = L+W + L+W Summing the four sides. P = 2W + 2L Combine like terms. Problem: Solve P = 2W + 2L for L. Then, given that the perimeter is 300 feet and the width is 50 feet, use your result to calculate the length. Solution: We’re first asked to solve P = 2W + 2L for L. First, isolate all 116 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES terms containing the variable L on one side of the equation. P = 2W + 2L Original equation. P − 2W = 2W + 2L− 2W Subtract 2W from both sides. P − 2W = 2L Simplify. P − 2W 2 = 2L 2 Divide both sides by 2. P − 2W 2 = L Simplify. Note that the final result has L = “Stuff’, where “Stuff” contains no occurrence of the variable L. The second part of this example requests that we find the length of the rectangle, given that the perimeter is P = 300 feet and the width is W = 50 feet. To calculate the length, substitute P = 300 and W = 50 in L = (P − 2W )/2. L = P − 2W 2 Perimeter formula solved for L. L = 300− 2(50) 2 Substitute 300 for P , 50 for W .

Secondly, given that the area is A = 90 in2 (90 square inches) and the length of the base is 15 in (15 inches), find the height of the triangle. Solution: We’re first asked to solve A = (1/2)bh for h. Because the equation has fractions, the first step is to clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator. A = 1 2 bh Area of a triangle formula. 2(A) = 2 ( 1 2 bh ) Multiply both sides by 2. 2A = bh Simplify. Now, we already have all terms containing the variable h on one side of the equation, so we can solve for h by dividing both sides of the equation by b. 2A b = bh b Divide both sides by b. 2A b = h Simplify. Note that the final result has h = “Stuff’, where “Stuff” contains no occurrence of the variable h. The second part of this example requests that we find the height of the triangle, given that the area is A = 90 in2 and the length of the base is b = 15 in.

Set up a Variable Dictionary. You must let your readers know what each variable in your problem represents. This can be accomplished in a number of ways: • Statements such as “Let P represent the perimeter of the rectangle.” • Labeling unknown values with variables in a table. • Labeling unknown quantities in a sketch or diagram. 2. Set up an Equation. Every solution to a word problem must include a carefully crafted equation that accurately describes the constraints in the problem statement. 3. Solve the Equation. You must always solve the equation set up in the previous step. 4. Answer the Question. This step is easily overlooked. For example, the problem might ask for Jane’s age, but your equation’s solution gives the age of Jane’s sister Liz. Make sure you answer the original question asked in the problem. Your solution should be written in a sentence with appropriate units. 5. Look Back. It is important to note that this step does not imply that you should simply check your solution in your equation. After all, it’s possible that your equation incorrectly models the problem’s situation, so you could have a valid solution to an incorrect equation.

An example of three consecutive even integers is 18, 20, and 22. These are not the integers we seek, but they do give us some sense of the meaning of three consecutive even integers. Note that each consecutive even integer is two larger than the preceding integer. Thus, if k is the length of the first side of the triangle, then the next two sides are k+2 and k+4. In this example, our variable dictionary will take the form of a well-labeled figure. k + 2 kk + 4 2. Set up an Equation. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the three sides. If the perimeter is 156 centimeters, then: k + (k + 2) + (k + 4) = 156 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for k, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. k + (k + 2) + (k + 4) = 156 Original equation. 3k + 6 = 156 Combine like terms. 3k + 6− 6 = 156− 6 Subtract 6 from both sides. 3k = 150 Simplify. 3k 3 = 150 3 Divide both sides by 3. k = 50 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. Thus, the first side has length 50 centimeters. Because the next two consecutive even integers are k+2 = 52 and k+4 = 54, the three sides of the triangle measure 50, 52, and 54 centimeters, respectively. 5. Look Back.

The Greek alphabet starts out with the letters α, β, γ, δ, (, . . . , in much the same way that the English alphabet start out with the letters a, b, c, d, e, . . . . Mathematicians love to use Greek letters, especially in the study of trigonometry. The greek letter θ (pronounced “theta”) is particularly favored in representing an angle of a triangle. So, we’ll let θ represent the degree measure of the first angle of the triangle. The second angle is 10 degrees larger than twice the first angle, so the second angle is 2θ+10. The third angle is 50 degrees larger than the first angle, so the third angle is θ + 50. Again, we’ll set up a well-labeled figure for our variable dictionary. θ + 50θ 2θ + 10 2.5. APPLICATIONS 127 2. Set up an Equation. The sum of the angles is 180◦, so: θ + (2θ + 10) + (θ + 50) = 180 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for θ, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. θ + (2θ + 10) + (θ + 50) = 180 Original equation. 4θ + 60 = 180 Combine like terms. 4θ + 60− 60 = 180− 60 Subtract 60 from both sides. 4θ = 120 Simplify. 4θ 4 = 120 4 Divide both sides by 4. θ = 30 Simplify. 4.

If we calculate 15% of 40, we get: 0.15(40) = 6 Thus, there were 6 students absent, so 40−6, or 34 students were present. Thus, we have the correct solution. Answer: 45 ! 132 CHAPTER 2.

Later in the chapter, we introduced the rational numbers, numbers of the form p/q, where p and q are integers. We noted that both terminating and repeating decimals are rational numbers. Each of these numbers has a unique position on the number line (see Figure 2.13). −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 −2 1.5−3.125 0.3 329− 78 Figure 2.13: Positioning numbers on the number line. The natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers are also rational num- bers, because each can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers. For example, 0=0/12, 4 = 4/1, and −3 = −12/4. Indeed, the rational numbers contain all of the numbers we’ve studied up to this point in the course. However, not all numbers are rational numbers. For example, consider the Two other irrational numbers you may encounter in your mathematical studies are e (Euler’s constant), which is approximately equal to e ≈ 2.71828182845904 . . ., and φ (pronounced “phi”), called the golden ratio, which equals φ = (1 + √ 5)/2.

Figure 2.14: Positioning numbers on the number line. The Real Numbers. If we combine all of the rational and irrational numbers into one collection, then we have a set of numbers that is called the set of real numbers. The set of real numbers is denoted by the symbol R. Every point on the number line is associated with a unique real number. Con- versely, every real number is associated with a unique position on the number line. In lieu of this correspondence, the number line is usually called the real line. 136 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES

Order on the Real Line. Suppose that a and b are real numbers positioned on the real line as shown below. a b • Because a lies to the “left of” b, we say that a is “less than” b, or in mathematical symbols, a < b. The inequality symbol < is read “less than.” • Alternately, b lies to the “right of” a, so we can also say that b is “greater than” a, or in mathematical symbols, b > a. The inequality symbol > is read “greater than.” Here are two more inequality symbols that we will use in this section. Less than or equal to. If we want to say that a lies to the “left of” b, or shares the same position as b, then we say that a is “less than or equal to” b and write a ≤ b. The inequality symbol ≤ is pronounced “less than or equal to.” Greater than or equal to. If we want to say that b lise to the “right of” a, or shares the same position as a, then we say that b is “greater than ore equal to a and write b ≥ a. The inequality symbol ≥ is pronounced “greater than or equal to.” 
book7_2_6_2	no label	Set-Builder Notation Set-Builder Notation Set-Builder Notation Mathematicians use a construct called set-builder notation to describe sets or collections of numbers. The general form of set-builder notation looks as follows: {x : some statement about x} For example, suppose that we want to describe the set of “all real numbers that are less than 2.” We could use the following notation: A = {x : x < 2} 2.6. INEQUALITIES 137 This is read aloud as follows: “A equals the set of all x such that x is less than 2.” Some prefer to use a vertical bar instead of a colon. A = {x|x < 2} In this text we use the colon in set-builder notation, but feel free to use the vertical bar instead. They mean the same thing. One might still object that the notation {x : x < 2} is a bit vague. One objection could be “What type of numbers x are you referring to? Do you want the integers that are less than two or do you want the real numbers that are less than two?” As you can see, this is a valid objection. One way of addressing this objection is to write: A = {x ∈ R : x < 2} or A = {x ∈ N : x < 2} The first is read “A is the set of all x in R that are less than two,” while the second is read “A is the set of all x in N that are less than two.” Set-builder Assumption. In this text, unless there is a specific refernce to the set of numbers desired, we will assume that the notation {x : x < 2} is asking for the set of all real numbers less than 2. In Figure 2.15, we’ve shaded the set of real numbers {x : x < 2}. Because −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 2.15: Shading the numbers less than 2. “less than” is the same as saying “left of,” we’ve shaded (in red) all points on the real line that lie to the left of the number two. Note that there is an “empty circle” at the number two. The point representing the number two is not shaded because we were only asked to shade the numbers that are strictly less than two. While the shading in Figure 2.15 is perfectly valid, much of the information provided in Figure 2.15 is unnecessary (and perhaps distracting). We only need to label the endpoint and shade the real numbers to the left of two, as we’ve done in constructing Figure 2.16. 2 Figure 2.16: You only need to label the endpoint. For contrast, suppose instead that we’re asked to shade the set of real numbers {x : x ≤ 2}. This means that we must shade all the real numbers 138 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 2 Figure 2.17: You only need to label the endpoint. that are “less than or equal to 2” or “left of and including 2.” The resulting set is shaded in Figure 2.17. Note the difference between Figures 2.16 and 2.17. In Figures 2.16 we’re shading the set {x : x < 2}, so the number 2 is left unshaded (an empty dot). In Figures 2.17, we’re shading the set {x : x ≤ 2}, so the number 2 is shaded (a filled-in dot). You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Shade the set {x : x ≥ −3} on the real line.Shade {x : x ≤ 4} on the real line. Solution: The notation {x : x ≥ −3} is pronounced “the set of all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to −3.” Thus, we need to shade the number −3 and all real numbers to the right of −3. −34 Answer: ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Use set-builder notation to describe the set of real numbersUse set-builder notation to describe the following set of real numbers: −10 that are shaded on the number line below. −1 Solution: The number −1 is not shaded. Only the numbers to the left of −1 are shaded. This is the set of all real numbers x such that x is “less than” −1. Thus, we describe this set with the following set-builder notation: {x : x < −1} . Answer: {x : x > −10} ! 
book7_2_6_3	no label	Interval Notation Interval Notation Interval Notation In Examples 1 and 2, we used set-builder notation to describe the set of real numbers greater than or equal to −3 and a second set of real numbers less than −1. There is another mathematical symbolism, called interval notation, that can be used to describe these sets of real numbers. Consider the first set of numbers from Example 1, {x : x ≥ −3}. 2.6. INEQUALITIES 139 −3 Sweeping our eyes “from left to right”, we use [−3,∞) to describe this set of real numbers. Some comments are in order: 1. The bracket at the left end means that −3 is included in the set. 2. As you move toward the right end of the real line, the numbers grow without bound. Hence, the ∞ symbol (positive infinity) is used to indi- cate that we are including all real numbers to the right of −3. However, ∞ is not really a number, so we use a parentheses to indicate we are “not including” this fictional point. The set of numbers from Example 2 is {x : x < −1}. −1 Sweeping our eyes “from left to right”, this set of real numbers is described with (−∞,−1). Again, comments are in order: 1. The number −1 is not included in this set. To indicate that it is not included, we use a parenthesis. 2. As you move toward the left end of the real line, the numbers decrease without bound. Hence, the −∞ symbol (negative infinity) is used to indicate that we are including all real numbers to the left of −1. Again, −∞ is not an actual number, so we use a parenthesis to indicate that we are not including this “fictional” point. Sweep your eyes from “left to right”. If you would like to insure that you correctly use interval notation, place the numbers in your interval notation in the same order as they are encountered as you sweep your eyes from “left to right” on the real line. A nice summary of set-builder and interval notation is presented in Table 2.1 at the end of the section.

Let a and b be real numbers with a < b, If c is any real number, then a+ c < b+ c and a− c < b− c.

book7_2_6_5	no label	Reversing the Inequality Sign Reversing the Inequality Sign Reversing the Inequality Sign Up to this point, it seems that the technique for solving inequalities is pretty much identical to the technique used to solve equations. However, in this section we are going to encounter one exception. Suppose we start with the valid inequality −2 < 5, then we multiply both sides by 2, 3, and 4. −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2 < 5 2(−2) < 2(5) 3(−2) < 3(5) 4(−2) < 4(5) −4 < 10 −6 < 15 −8 < 20 Note that in each case, the resulting inequality is still valid.

When you multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you mustSome readers might prefer a more formal reason as to why we reverse the inequality when we multiply both sides by a negative number. Suppose that a < b. Then, subtracting b from both sides gives the result a− b < 0. This means that a− b is a negative number. Now, if c is a negative number, then the product (a− b)c is positive. Then: (a− b)c > 0 ac− bc > 0 ac− bc+ bc > 0 + bc ac > bc Thus, if you start with a < b and c < 0, then ac > bc. reverse the inequality sign. Starting with −2 < 5, multiply both sides by −2, −3, and −4, but reverse the inequality symbol. −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2(−2) > −2(5) −3(−2) > −3(5) −4(−2) > −4(5) 4 > −10 6 > −15 8 > −20 Note that each of the resulting inequalities is now a valid inquality. Multiplying or Dividing by a Negative Number. Let a and b be real numbers with a < b. If c is a real negative number, then ac > bc and a c > b c .

Solution: We need to isolate terms containing x on one side of the inequality.

We continue to isolate terms containing x on one side of the inequality. Subtract 3 from both sides. 3− 7x− 3 ≤ 17− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. −7x ≤ 14 Simplify both sides. 144 CHAPTER 2.

To “undo” adding 9, subtract 9 from both sides. 9− x− 9 > 4− 9 Subtract 9 from both sides. −x > −5 Simplify both sides. We could divide both sides by −1, but multiplying both sides by −1 will also do the job. Because we are multiplying both sides by a negative number, we reverse the inequality sign.

book7_3	no label	3 Introduction to Graphing 3 Introduction to Graphing 3 Introduction to Graphing In thinking about solving algebra and geometry problems in the 1600’s, Rene Descartes came up with the idea of using algebraic procedures to help solve geometric problems and to also demonstrate algebraic operations by using ge- ometry. One of the easy ways to do this was to use the 2-dimensional geometric plane. He decided to use the letters near the end of the alphabet to name the axes: “x-axis” for the horizontal axis and “y-axis” for the vertical axis. Then ordered pairs (x, y) would be used to graph specific points on the plane and/or algebraic expressions and equations. Thus, the graphs on the following pages are done on a graph named a “Cartesian Coordinate” graph in Rene Descartes’ honor. The equation of a particular line can be written in several algebraic forms which you will learn to interpret. The geometric aspect of a line will be noted in its position and slope. We will also be focusing on geometric aspects such as parallel and perpendicular lines. Ultimately, these tasks will be used to help solve application problems involving speed and distance. In modern times, we use the graphing calculator to speed up the process of providing tables of data, graphing lines quickly, and finding solutions of equations. 151 152 CHAPTER 3.

The construct (x, y), where x and y are any real numbers, is called an ordered pair of real numbers. (4, 3), (−3, 4), (−2,−3), and (3,−1) are examples of ordered pairs. Order Matters. Pay particular attention to the phrase “ordered pairs.” Or- der matters. Consequently, the ordered pair (x, y) is not the same as the ordered pair (y, x), because the numbers are presented in a different order.

On a grid, we’veRene Descartes (1596-1650) was a French philosopher and mathematician who is well known for the famous phrase“cogito ergo sum” (I think, therefore I am), which appears in his Discours de la methode pour bien conduire sa raison, et chercher la verite dans les sciences (Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking Truth in the Sciences). In that same treatise, Descartes introduces his coordinate system, a method for representing points in the plane via pairs of real numbers. Indeed, the Cartesian plane of modern day is so named in honor of Rene Descartes, who some call the “Father of Modern Mathematics” created two real lines, one horizontal labeled x (we’ll refer to this one as the x-axis), and the other vertical labeled y (we’ll refer to this one as the y-axis). −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 x y Figure 3.1: The Cartesian Coordinate System. Two Important Points: Here are two important points to be made about the horizontal and vertical axes in Figure 3.1. 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 153 1. As you move from left to right along the horizontal axis (the x-axis in Figure 3.1), the numbers grow larger. The positive direction is to the right, the negative direction is to the left. 2. As you move from bottom to top along the vertical axis (the y-axis in Figure 3.1), the numbers grow larger. The positive direction is upward, the negative direction is downward. Additional Comments: Two additional comments are in order: 3. The point where the horizontal and vertical axes intersect in Figure 3.2 is called the origin of the coordinate system. The origin has coordinates (0, 0). 4. The horizontal and vertical axes divide the plane into four quadrants, numbered I, II, III, and IV (roman numerals for one, two, three, and four), as shown in Figure 3.2. Note that the quadrants are numbered in a counter-clockwise order. −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 x y III III IV Origin: (0, 0) Figure 3.2: Numbering the quadrants and indicating the coordinates of the origin. 154 CHAPTER 3.

Indicate the scale on each axis. 3. Label at least one vertical gridline with its numerical value. 4. Label at least one horizontal gridline with its numerical value. An example is shown in Figure 3.4. Note that the scale indicated on the x-axisThe scales on the horizontal and vertical axes may differ. However, on each axis, the scale must remain consistent. That is, as you count to the right from the origin on the x-axis, if each gridline represents one unit, then as you count to the left from the origin on the x-axis, each gridline must also represent one unit. Similar comments are in order for the y-axis, where the scale must also be consistent, whether you are counting up or down. indicates that each gridline counts as 1-unit as we count from left-to-right.

Vice-versa, each point in the Cartesian point is associated with a unique ordered pair of real numbers. Because of this association, we begin to use the words “point” and “ordered pair” as equivalent expressions, sometimes referring to the “point” (x, y) and other times to the “ordered pair” (x, y).

Because the last line is a true statement, we say that (2, 3) is a solution of the equation y = x + 1. Alternately, we say that (2, 3) satisfies the equation y = x+ 1. On the other hand, consider the point (x, y) = (−3, 1). If we substitute −3 for x and 1 for y in the equation y = x+ 1, we get the following result. y = x+ 1 Original equation. 1 = −3 + 1 Substitute: −3 for x, 1 for y. 1 = −2 Simplify both sides. Because the last line is a false statement, the point (−3, 1) is not a solution of the equation y = x+1; that is, the point (−3, 1) does not satisfy the equation y = x+ 1. 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 157 Solutions of an equation in two variables. Given an equation in the variables x and y and a point (x, y) = (a, b), if upon subsituting a for x and b for y a true statement results, then the point (x, y) = (a, b) is said to be a solution of the given equation. Alternately, we say that the point (x, y) = (a, b) satisfies the given equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Which of the ordered pairs (0,−3) and (1, 1) satisfy the Which of the ordered pairs (−1, 3) and (2, 1) satisfy the equation y = 2x+ 5? equation y = 3x− 2? Solution: Substituting the ordered pairs (0,−3) and (1, 1) into the equation y = 3x− 2 lead to the following results: Consider (x, y) = (0,−3). Substitute 0 for x and −3 for y: y = 3x− 2 −3 = 3(0)− 2 −3 = −2 The resulting statement is false. Consider (x, y) = (1, 1). Substitute 1 for x and 1 for y: y = 3x− 2 1 = 3(1)− 2 1 = 1 The resulting statement is true. Thus, the ordered pair (0,−3) does not satisfy the equation y = 3x− 2, but the ordered pair (1, 1) does satisfy the equation y = 3x− 2. Answer: (−1, 3) !

The graph of an equation. The graph of an equation is the set of all points that satisfy the given equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Sketch the graph of the equation y = x+ 1. Sketch the graph of the equation y = −x+ 2. Solution: The definition requires that we plot all points in the Cartesian Coordinate System that satisfy the equation y = x + 1. Let’s first create a table of points that satisfy the equation. Start by creating three columns with headers x, y, and (x, y), then select some values for x and put them in the first column. 158 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Take the first value of x, namely x = −3, and substitute it into the equation y = x+ 1. y = x+ 1 y = −3 + 1 y = −2 Thus, when x = −3, we have y = −2. Enter this value into the table. x y = x+ 1 (x, y) −3 −2 (−3,−2) −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Continue substituting each tabular value of x into the equation y = x+ 1 and use each result to complete the corresponding entries in the table. x y = x+ 1 (x, y) y = −3 + 1 = −2 −3 −2 (−3,−2) y = −2 + 1 = −1 −2 −1 (−2,−1) y = −1 + 1 = 0 −1 0 (−1, 0) y = 0 + 1 = 1 0 1 (0, 1) y = 1 + 1 = 2 1 2 (1, 2) y = 2 + 1 = 3 2 3 (2, 3) y = 3 + 1 = 4 3 4 (3, 4) The last column of the table now contains seven points that satisfy the equation y = x+1.

In Figure 3.7, we have plotted seven points that satisfy the given equation y = x+ 1. However, the definition requires that we plot all points that satisfy the equation. It appears that a pattern is developing in Figure 3.7, but let’s calculate and plot a few more points in order to be sure. Add the x-values 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 159 −2.5, −1.5, −0.5, 05, 1.5, and 2.5 to the x-column of the table, then use the equation y = x+ 1 to evaluate y at each one of these x-values. x y = x+ 1 (x, y) y = −2.5 + 1 = −1.5 −2.5 −1.5 (−2.5,−1.5) y = −1.5 + 1 = −0.5 −1.5 −0.5 (−1.5,−0.5) y = −0.5 + 1 = 0.5 −0.5 0.5 (−0.5, 0.5) y = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 0.5 1.5 (0.5, 1.5) y = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 1.5 2.5 (1.5, 2.5) y = 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 2.5 3.5 (2.5, 3.5) Add these additional points to the graph in Figure 3.7 to produce the image shown in Figure 3.8. There are an infinite number of points that satisfy the equation y = x+ 1. In Figure 3.8, we’ve plotted only 13 points that satisfy the equation. However, the collection of points plotted in Figure 3.8 suggest that if we were to plot the remainder of the points that satisfy the equation y = x + 1, we would get the graph of the line shown in Figure 3.9. −5 5 −5 5 x y y = x+ 1 Figure 3.9: The graph of y = x+ 1 is a line.

book7_3_1_5	no label	Guidelines and Requirements Guidelines and Requirements Guidelines and Requirements Example 3 suggests that we should use the following guidelines when sketching the graph of an equation. 160 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Guidelines for drawing the graph of an equation. When asked to draw the graph of an equation, perform each of the following steps: 1. Set up and calculate a table of points that satisfy the given equation. 2. Set up a Cartesian Coordinate System on graph paper and plot the points in your table on the system. Label each axis (usually x and y) and indicate the scale on each axis. 3. If the number of points plotted are enough to envision what the shape of the final curve will be, then draw the remaining points that satisfy the equation as imagined. Use a ruler if you believe the graph is a line. If the graph appears to be a curve, freehand the graph without the use of a ruler. 4. If the number of plotted points do not provide enough evidence to en- vision the final shape of the graph, add more points to your table, plot them, and try again to envision the final shape of the graph. If you still cannot predict the eventual shape of the graph, keep adding points to your table and plotting them until you are convinced of the final shape of the graph. Here are some additional requirements that must be followed when sketch- ing the graph of an equation. Graph paper, lines, curves, and rulers. The following are requirements for this class: 5. All graphs are to be drawn on graph paper. 6. All lines are to be drawn with a ruler. This includes the horizontal and vertical axes. 7. If the graph of an equation is a curve instead of a line, then the graph should be drawn freehand, without the aid of a ruler.

EXAMPLE 4. Use the graphing calculator to help create a table of points that satisfy the equation y = x2−7. Plot the points in your table.

We will use the TI-84 graphing calculator in this section, but the skills we introduce will work equally well on the ancient TI-82 and the less ancient TI-83 graphing calculators. In this introduction to the graphing calculator, you will need to use several keys on the upper half of the graphing calculator (see Figure 3.21). The up- and-down and left-and-right arrow keys are located in the upper right corner of Figure 3.21. These are used for moving the cursor on the calculator view screen and various menus. Immediately below these arrow keys is the CLEAR button, used to clear the view screen and equations in the Y= menu. Figure 3.21: Top half of calculator.

Each time you select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOMmenu, Xmin is set to −10, Xmax to 10, and Xscl to 1 (distance between the tick marks on the x-axis). Similarly, Ymin is set to −10, Ymax to 10, and Yscl to 1 (distance between the tick marks on the y-axis). You can, however, override these settings as we shall see in the next example. You Try It!

Solution: We must first decide on the proper syntax to use when entering the equations. In the case of the first equation, note that y = 5 4 x− 3 is pronounced “y equals five-fourths x minus three,” and means “y equals five- fourths times x minus three.” Enter this equation into Y1 in the Y= menu as 5/4*X−3 (see Figure 3.33), using the button keystrokes: 5 ÷ 4 × X,T, θ, n − 3 The division and times buttons are located in the rightmost column of the calculuator. Similarly, enter the second equation into Y2 as 2/3*X+4 using the button keystrokes: 2 ÷ 3 × X,T, θ, n + 4 Select 6:ZStandard in the ZOOM menu to produce the lines in Figure 3.34. When we examine the resulting graphs in Figure 3.34, it appears that their point of intersection will occur off the screen above and to the right of the upper right-corner of the current viewing window. With this thought in mind, let’s extend the x-axis to the right by increasing the value of Xmax to 20. Further, let’s extend the y-axis upward by increasing the value of Ymin to 20. Press the WINDOW button on the top row of the calculator, then make the adjustments shown in Figure 3.35. 3.2. THE GRAPHING CALCULATOR 177 Figure 3.33: Enter equations. Figure 3.34: The graphs.

If we select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu, our changes to the WIN- DOW parameters will be discarded and the viewing window will be returned to the “standard viewing window.” If we want to keep our changes to the WIN- DOW parameters, the correct approach at this point is to push the GRAPH button on the top row of the calculator. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 3.36. Note that the point of intersection of the two lines is now visible in the viewing window. The image in Figure 3.36 is ready for recording onto your homework. How- ever, we think we would have a better picture if we made a couple more changes: 1.

book7_3_3	no label	3.3 Rates and Slope 3.3 Rates and Slope 3.3 Rates and Slope Let’s open this section with an application of the concept of rate. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. An object is dropped from rest, then begins to pick up speed Starting from rest, an automobile picks up speed at a constant rate of 5 miles per hour every second (5 (mi/hr)/s). Sketch the graph of the speed of the object versus time. at a constant rate of 10 meters per second every second (10 (m/s)/s or 10m/s2). Sketch the graph of the speed of the object versus time. Solution: In this example, the speed of the object depends on the time. This makes the speed the dependent variable and time the independent variable. Independent versus dependent. It is traditional to place the independent variable on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable on the vertical axis. Following this guideline, we place the time on the horizontal axis and the speed on the vertical axis. In Figure 3.41, note that we’ve labeled each axis with the dependent and independent variables (v and t), and we’ve included the units (m/s and s) in our labels. Next, we need to scale each axis. In determining a scale for each axis, keep two thoughts in mind: 1. Pick a scale that makes it convenient to plot the given data. 2. Pick a scale that allows all of the given data to fit on the graph. In this example, we want a scale that makes it convenient to show that the speed is increasing at a rate of 10 meters per second (10 m/s) every second (s). One possible approach is to make each tick mark on the horizontal axis equal to 1 s and each tick mark on the vertical axis equal to 10 m/s. t(s) v(m/s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Figure 3.41: Label and scale each axis.

INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Next, at time t = 0 s, the speed is v = 0 m/s. This is the point (t, v) = (0, 0) plotted in Figure 3.42. Secondly, the rate at which the speed is increasing is 10 m/s per second. This means that every time you move 1 second to the right, the speed increases by 10 m/s. In Figure 3.42, start at (0, 0), then move 1 s to the right and 10 m/s up. This places you at the point (1, 10), which says that after 1 second, the speed of the particle is 10 m/s. Continue in this manner, continuously moving 1 s to the right and 10 m/s upward. This produces the sequence of points shown in Figure 3.42. Note that this constant rate of 10 (m/s)/s forces the graph of the speed versus time to be a line, as depicted in Figure 3.43. t(s) v(m/s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Figure 3.43: The constant rate forces the graph to be a line.

book7_3_3_1	no label	Measuring the Change in a Variable Measuring the Change in a Variable Measuring the Change in a Variable To calculate the change in some quantity, we take a difference. For example, suppose that the temperature in the morning is 40◦ F, then in the afternoon the temperature measures 60◦ F (F stands for Fahrenheit temperature). Then the change in temperature is found by taking a difference. Change in temperature = Afternoon temperature−Morning temperature = 60◦ F− 40◦ F = 20◦ F Therefore, there was a twenty degree increase in temperature from morning to afternoon. 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 185 Now, suppose that the evening temperature measures 50◦ F. To calculate the change in temperature from the afternoon to the evening, we again subtract. Change in temperature = Evening temperature−Afternoon temperature = 50◦ F− 60◦ F = −10◦F There was a ten degree decrease in temperature from afternoon to evening. Calculating the Change in a Quantity. To calculate the change in a quantity, subtract the earlier measurement from the later measurement. Let T represent the temperature. Mathematicians like to use the symbolism ∆T to represent the change in temperature. For the change in temperature from morning to afternoon, we would write ∆T = 20◦ F. For the afternoon to evening change, we would write ∆T = −10◦ F. Mathematicians and scientists make frequent use of the Greek alphabet, the first few letters of which are: α,β, γ, δ, . . . (Greek alphabet, lower case) A,B,Γ,∆, . . . (Greek alphabet, upper case) a, b, c, d, . . . (English alphabet) Thus, the Greek letter ∆, the upper case form of δ, correlates with the letter ‘d’ in the English alphabet. Why did mathematicians make this choice of letter to represent the change in a quantity? Because to find the change in a quantity, we take a difference, and the word “difference” starts with the letter ‘d.’ Thus, ∆T is also pronounced “the difference in T .” Important Pronunciations. Two ways to pronounce the symbolism ∆T . 1. ∆T is pronounced “the change in T .” 2. ∆T is also pronounced “the difference in T .”

The slope of a line is the rate at which the dependent variable is chang- ing with respect to the independent variable. For example, if the dependent 186 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING variable is y and the independent variable is x, then the slope of the line is: Slope = ∆y ∆x You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. In Example 1, an object released from rest saw that its speedStarting from rest, an automobile picks up speed at a constant rate of 5 miles per hour every second (5 (mi/hr)/s). The constant rate forces the graph of the speed of the object versus time to be a line. Calculate the slope of this line. increased at a constant rate of 10 meters per second per second (10 (m/s)/s or 10m/s2). This constant rate forced the graph of the speed versus time to be a line, shown in Figure 3.43. Calculate the slope of this line. Solution: Start by selecting two points P (2, 20) and Q(8, 80) on the line, as shown in Figure 3.44. To find the slope of this line, the definition requires that we find the rate at which the dependent variable v changes with respect to the independent variable t. That is, the slope is the change in v divided by the change in t. In symbols: Slope = ∆v ∆t t(s) v(m/s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 P (2, 20) Q(8, 80) Figure 3.44: Pick two points to compute the slope. t(s) v(m/s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 P (3, 30) Q(7, 70) Figure 3.45: The slope does not de- pend on the points we select on the line. Now, as we move from point P (2, 20) to point Q(8, 80), the speed changes from 20 m/s to 80 m/s. Thus, the change in the speed is: ∆v = 80m/s− 20m/s = 60m/s 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 187 Similarly, as we move from point P (2, 20) to point Q(8, 80), the time changes from 2 seconds to 8 seconds. Thus, the change in time is: ∆t = 8 s− 2 s = 6 s Now that we have both the change in the dependent and independent variables, we can calculate the slope. Slope = ∆v ∆t = 60m/s 6 s = 10 m/s s Therefore, the slope of the line is 10 meters per second per second (10 (m/s)/s or 10m/s2). The slope of a line does not depend upon the points you select. Let’s try the slope calculation again, using two different points and a more compact presentation of the required calculations. Pick points P (3, 30) and Q(7, 70) as shown in Figure 3.45. Using these two new points, the slope is the rate at which the dependent variable v changes with respect to the independent variable t. Slope = ∆v ∆t = 70m/s− 30m/s 7 s− 3 s = 40m/s 4 s = 10 m/s s Again, the slope of the line is 10 (m/s)/s. Answer: 5 (mi/hr)/s ! Example 2 points out the following fact. Slope is independent of the selected points. It does not matter which two points you pick on the line to calculate its slope. The next example demonstrates that the slope is also independent of the order of subtraction. 188 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING You Try It! EXAMPLE 3.

To calculate the slope of the line through the points P (−1,−2) and Q(3, 3), we must calculate the change in both the independent and dependent variables. We’ll do this in two different ways. Warning! If you are not consistent in the direction you subtract, you will not get the correct answer for the slope. For example: 3− (−2) −1− 3 = − 5 4 In this case, we subtracted the y-coordinate of point P (−1,−2) from the y-coordinate of point Q(3, 3), but then we changed horses in midstream, subtracting the x-coordinate of point Q(3, 3) from the x-coordinate of point P (−1,−2). Note that we get the negative of the correct answer. Subtract the coordinates of point P (−1,−2) from the coordinates of point Q(3, 3). Slope = ∆y ∆x = 3− (−2) 3− (−1) = 5 4 Subtract the coordinates of point Q(3, 3) from the coordinates of point P (−1,−2).

The direction of subtraction does not matter. When calculating the slope of a line through two points P and Q, it does not matter which way you subtract, provided you remain consistent in your choice of direction.

Slope of second line = ∆y ∆x = 3− (−3) 1− (−1) = 6 2 = 3 Note that both lines go uphill and both have positive slopes. Also, note that the slope of the second line is greater than the slope of the first line. This is consistent with the fact that the second line is steeper than the first. Answer: The first line has slope 2, and the second line has slope 4/7. The first line is steeper. ! In Example 4, both lines slanted uphill and both had positive slopes, the steeper of the two lines having the larger slope. Let’s now look at two lines that slant downhill. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5.

Solution: The graphs of the two lines through the given points are shown, the first in Figure 3.49 and the second in Figure 3.50. Note that the line in Figure 3.49 goes downhill less quickly than the line in Figure 3.50.

Note that both lines go downhill and both have negative slopes. Also, note that the magnitude (absolute value) of the slope of the second line is greater than the magnitude of the slope of the first line.

INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING The slopes of the horizontal and vertical lines are calculated as follows. Subtract the coordinates of the point P (−2, 3) from the coordi- nates of the point Q(2, 3). Slope of horizontal line = ∆y ∆x = 3− 3 2− (−2) = 0 4 = 0 Thus, the slope of the horizontal line is zero, which makes sense be- cause a horizontal line neither goes uphill nor downhill. Subtract the coordinates of the point (2,−3) from the coordinates of the point S(2, 3). Slope of vertical line = ∆y ∆x = 3− (−3) 2− 2 = 6 0 = undefined Division by zero is undefined. Hence, the slope of a vertical line is undefined. Again, this makes sense because as uphill lines get steeper and steeper, their slopes increase without bound. Answer: The slope of the vertical line is undefined. The slope of the second line is 0. ! 
book7_3_3_4	no label	The Geometry of the Slope of a Line The Geometry of the Slope of a Line The Geometry of the Slope of a Line We begin our geometrical discussion of the slope of a line with an example, calculating the slope of a line passing through the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8). Before we begin we’ll first calculate the change in y and the change in x by sub- tracting the coordinates of point P (2, 3) from the coordinates of point Q(8, 8). Slope = ∆y ∆x = 8− 3 8− 2 = 5 6 Thus, the slope of the line through the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8) is 5/6. To use a geometric approach to finding the slope of the line, first draw the line through the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8) (see Figure 3.53). Next, draw a right triangle with sides parallel to the horizontal and vertical axes, using the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8) as vertices. As you move from point P to point R in Figure 3.53, note that the change in x is ∆x = 6 (count the tick marks1). 1When counting tick marks, make sure you know the amount each tick mark represents. For example, if each tick mark represents two units, and you count six tick marks when evaluating the change in x, then ∆x = 12. 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 193 As you then move from point R to point Q, the change in y is ∆y = 5 (count the tick marks). Thus, the slope is ∆y/∆x = 5/6, precisely what we got in the previous computation. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆x = 6 ∆y = 5 P (2, 3) Q(8, 8) R(8, 3) Figure 3.53: Determining the slope of the line from the graph. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆y = 5 ∆x = 6 P (2, 3) Q(8, 8) R(3, 8) Figure 3.54: Determining the slope of the line from the graph. For contrast, in Figure 3.54, we started at the point P (2, 3), then moved upward Rise over run. In Figure 3.54, we start at the point P (2, 3), then “rise” 5 units, then “run” 6 units to the right. For this reason, some like to think of the slope as “rise over run.” 5 units and right 6 units. However, the change in y is still ∆y = 5 and the change in x is still ∆x = 6 as we move from point P (2, 3) to point Q(8, 8). Hence, the slope is still ∆y/∆x = 5/6. Consider a second example shown in Figure 3.55. Note that the line slants downhill, so we expect the slope to be a negative number. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆y = −4 ∆x = 6 P (2, 7) Q(8, 3) R(2, 3) Figure 3.55: Determining the slope of the line from the graph. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆x = 6 ∆y = −4 P (2, 7) Q(8, 3) R(8, 7) Figure 3.56: Determining the slope of the line from the graph.

As you move from point P to point R in Figure 3.55, the change in y is ∆y = −4 194 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING (count the tick marks and note that your values of y are decreasing as you move from P to R). As you move from point R to point Q, the change is x is ∆x = 6 (count the tick marks and note that your values of x are increasing as you move from R to Q). Thus, the slope is ∆y/∆x = −4/6, or −2/3. Note that the slope is negative, as anticipated. In Figure 3.56, we’ve drawn our triangle on the opposite side of the line. In this case, as you move from point P to point R in Figure 3.56, the change in x is ∆x = 6 (count the tick marks and note that your values of x are increasing as you move from P to R). As you move from point R to point Q, the change is y is ∆y = −4 (count the tick marks and note that your values of y are decreasing as you move from R to Q). Thus, the slope is still ∆y/∆x = −4/6, or −2/3. We can verify our geometrical calculations of the slope by subtracting the coordinates of the point P (2, 7) from the point Q(8, 3). Slope = ∆y ∆x = 3− 7 8− 2 = −4 6 = −2 3 This agrees with the calculations made in Figures 3.55 and 3.56. Let’s look at a final example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Sketch the line passing through the point (−2, 3) with slopeSketch the line passing through the point (−4, 2) with slope −1/4. −2/3. Solution: The slope is −2/3, so the line must go downhill. In Figure 3.57, we start at the point P (−2, 3), move right 3 units to the point R(1, 3), then move down 2 units to the point Q(1, 1). Draw the line through the points P and Q and you are done. In Figure 3.58, we take a different approach that results in the same line. Start at the point P ′(−2, 3), move downward 4 units to the point R′(−2,−1), then right 6 units to the point Q′(4,−1). Draw a line through the points P ′ and Q′ and you are done. The triangle &PQR in Figure 3.57 is similar to the triangle &P ′Q′R′ in Figure 3.58, so their sides are proportional.

The slope of a line is the rate at which the dependent variable is changing with respect to the independent variable. If y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable, then the slope is Slope = ∆y ∆x , where ∆y is the change in y (difference in y) and ∆x is the change in x (difference in x). 2. If a line has positive slope, then the line slants uphill as you “sweep your eyes from left to right.” If two lines have positive slope, then the line with the larger slope rises more quickly. 3. If a line has negative slope, then the line slants downhill as you “sweep your eyes from left to right.” If two lines have negative slope, then the line having the slope with the larger magnitude falls more quickly. 4. Horizontal lines have slope zero. 5. Vertical lines have undefined slope. 196 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING ! ! !

However, suppose that the y-intercept is unknown? Instead, suppose that we are given a point (x0, y0) on the line and we’re also told that the slope of the line is m (see Figure 3.71). x y (x0, y0) (x, y) Slope = m Figure 3.71: A line through the point (x0, y0) with slope m. Let (x, y) be an arbitrary point on the line, then use the points (x0, y0) and (x, y) to calculate the slope of the line. Slope = ∆y ∆x The slope formula. m = y − y0 x− x0 Substitute m for the slope. Use (x, y)and (x0, y0) to calculate the difference in y and the difference in x. Clear the fractions from the equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. m(x− x0) = [ y − y0 x− x0 ] (x− x0) Multiply both sides by x− x0. m(x− x0) = y − y0 Cancel. Thus, the equation of the line is y − y0 = m(x− x0). 214 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING The Point-Slope form of a line. The equation of the line with slope m that passes through the point (x0, y0) is: y − y0 = m(x− x0) You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Draw the line passing through the point (−3,−1) that hasDraw the line passing through the point (1,−2) that has slope 3/2, then label it with its equation. slope 3/5, then label it with its equation. Solution: Plot the point (−3,−1), then move 3 units up and 5 units to the right (see Figure 3.72). To find the equation, substitute (−3,−1) for (x0, y0) and 3/5 for m in the point-slope form of the line. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − (−1) = 3 5 (x− (−3)) Substitute: 3/5 for m, −3 for x0, and −1 for y0. Simplifying, the equation of the line is y + 1 = 35 (x+ 3). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 5 (−3,−1) y + 1 = 3 5 (x+ 3) Figure 3.72: The line passing through (−3,−1) with slope 3/5. Answer: −5 5 −5 5 x y (1,−2) y + 2 = 3 2 (x− 1) ! At this point, you may be asking the question “When should I use the slop- intercept form and when should I use the point-slope form?” Here is a good tip. Tip. Which form should I use? The form you should select depends upon the information given. 3.5. POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 215 1. If you are given the y-intercept and the slope, use y = mx+ b. 2. If you are given a point and the slope, use y − y0 = m(x− x0). You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Find the equation of the line passing through the points Find the equation of the line passing through the points P (−2, 1) and Q(4,−1). P (−1, 2) and Q(3,−4). Solution: First, plot the points P (−1, 2) andQ(3,−4) and draw a line through them (see Figure 3.73). −5 5 −5 5 x y P (−1, 2) Q(3,−4) Figure 3.73: The line passing through P (−1, 2) and Q(3,−4). Next, let’s calculate the slope of the line by subtracting the coordinates of the point P (−1, 2) from the coordinates of point Q(3,−4). Slope = ∆y ∆x = −4− 2 3− (−1) = −6 4 = −3 2 Thus, the slope is −3/2. Next, use the point-slope form y−y0 = m(x−x0) to determine the equation of the line. It’s clear that we should substitute −3/2 for m. But which of the two points should we use? If we use the point P (−1, 2) for (x0, y0), we get the answer on the left, but if we use the point Q(3,−4) for (x0, y0), we get the 216 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING answer on the right. y − 2 = −3 2 (x− (−1)) or y − (−4) = −3 2 (x− 3) At first glance, these answers do not look the same, but let’s examine them a bit more closely, solving for y to put each in slope-intercept form. Let’s start with the equation on the left. y − 2 = −3 2 (x− (−1)) Using m = −3/2 and (x0, y0) = (−1, 2). y − 2 = −3 2 (x+ 1) Simplify. y − 2 = −3 2 x− 3 2 Distribute −3/2. y − 2 + 2 = −3 2 x− 3 2 + 2 Add 2 to both sides. y = −3 2 x− 3 2 + 4 2 On the left, simplify. On the right, make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. y = −3 2 x+ 1 2 Simplify. Let’s put the second equation in slope-intercept form.Note that the form y = − 32x+ 12 , when compared with the general slope-intercept form y = mx+ b, indicates that the y-intercept is (0, 1/2). Examine Figure 3.73. Does it appear that the y-intercept is (0, 1/2)? y − (−4) = −3 2 (x− 3) Using m = −3/2 and (x0, y0) = (3,−4). y + 4 = −3 2 (x− 3) Simplify. y + 4 = −3 2 x+ 9 2 Distribute −3/2. y + 4− 4 = −3 2 x+ 9 2 − 4 Subtract 4 from both sides. y = −3 2 x+ 9 2 − 8 2 On the left, simplify. On the right, make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. y = −3 2 x+ 1 2 Simplify. Thus, both equations simplify to the same answer, y = − 32x+ 12 . This means that the equations y − 2 = − 32 (x − (−1)) and y − (−4) = − 32 (x − 3), though they look different, are the same.Answer: y = −1 3 x+ 1 3 ! 3.5. POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 217 Example 2 gives rise to the following tip. Tip. When finding the equation of a line through two points P and Q, you may substitute either point P or Q for (x0, y0) in the point-slope form y−y0 = m(x− x0). The results look different, but they are both equations of the same line.

Find the equation of this parallel line. Solution: Note that y = 34x− 2 is in slope-intercept form y = mx+ b. Hence, its slope is 3/4 and its y-intercept is (0,−2). Plot the y-intercept (0,−2), move up 3 units, right 4 units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.74). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (0,−2) Figure 3.74: The line y = 34x− 2. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (−1, 1) Figure 3.75: Adding a line parallel to y = 34x− 2. The second line must be parallel to the first, so it must have the same slope 3/4. Plot the point (−1, 1), move up 3 units, right 4 units, then draw the line (see the red line in Figure 3.75). 218 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING To find the equation of the parallel red line in Figure 3.75, use the point- slope form, substitute 3/4 for m, then (−1, 1) for (x0, y0). That is, substitute −1 for x0 and 1 for y0. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − 1 = 3 4 ( x− (−1)) Substitute: 3/4 for m, −1 for x0, and 1 for y0. y − 1 = 3 4 (x+ 1) Simplify. Check: In this example, we were not required to solve for y, so we can save ourselves some checking work by writing the equation y − 1 = 3 4 (x+ 1) in the form y = 3 4 (x+ 1) + 1 by adding 1 to both sides of the first equation.

For example, the lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.80 are perpendicular, but the lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.81 are not perpendicular. x y L1 L2 Figure 3.80: The lines L1 and L2 are perpendicular. They meet and form a right angle (90 degrees). x y L1 L2 Figure 3.81: The lines L1 and L2 are not perpendicular. They do not form a right angle (90 degrees).

So, consider the perpendicular lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.82. x y L1 L2 1 m11 −m1 Figure 3.82: Perpendicular lines L1 and L2. Things to note: 1. If we were to rotate line L1 ninety degrees counter-clockwise, then L1 would align with the line L2, as would the right triangles revealing their slopes. 2. L1 has slope ∆y ∆x = m1 1 = m1. 220 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING 3. L2 has slope ∆y ∆x = 1 −m1 = − 1 m1 . Slopes of perpendicular lines. If L1 and L2 are perpendicular lines and L1 has slope m1, the L2 has slope −1/m1. That is, the slope of L2 is the negative reciprocal of the slope of L1. Examples: To find the slope of a perpendicular line, invert the slope of the first line and negate. • If the slope of L1 is 2, then the slope of the perpendicular line L2 is −1/2. • If the slope of L1 is −3/4, then the slope of the perpendicular line L2 is 4/3. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Sketch the line y = − 23x − 3, then sketch the line throughFind the equation of the line that passes through the point (−3, 1) and is perpendicular to the line y = − 12x+ 1. (2, 1) that is perpendicular to the line y = − 23x− 3. Find the equation of this perpendicular line. Solution: Note that y = − 23x−3 is in slope-intercept form y = mx+b. Hence, its slope is −2/3 and its y-intercept is (0,−3). Plot the y-intercept (0,−3), move right 3 units, down two units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.83). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆x = 3 ∆y = −2(0,−3) Figure 3.83: The line y = − 23x− 3. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 2 (2, 1) Figure 3.84: Adding a line perpen- dicular to y = − 23x− 3. Because the line y = − 23x−3 has slope −2/3, the slope of the line perpendicular to this line will be the negative reciprocal of −2/3, namely 3/2. Thus, to draw the perpendicular line, start at the given point (2, 1), move up 3 units, right 2 units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.84). 3.5. POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 221 To find the equation of the perpendicular line in Figure 3.84, use the point- slope form, substitute 3/2 for m, then (2, 1) for (x0, y0).

Check: In this example, we were not required to solve for y, so we can save ourselves some checking work by writing the equation y − 1 = 3 2 (x − 2) in the form y = 3 2 (x− 2) + 1 by adding 1 to both sides of the first equation.

book7_3_6	no label	3.6 Standard Form of a Line 3.6 Standard Form of a Line 3.6 Standard Form of a Line In this section we will investigate the standard form of a line. Let’s begin with a simple example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the equation 2x+ 3y = 6 for y and plot the result.Solve x− 2y = 6 for y and plot the result. Solution: First we solve the equation 2x + 3y = 6 for y. Begin by isolating all terms containing y on one side of the equation, moving or keeping all the remaining terms on the other side of the equation. 2x+ 3y = 6 Original equation. 2x+ 3y − 2x = 6− 2x Subtract 2x from both sides. 3y = 6− 2x Simplify. 3y 3 = 6− 2x 3 Divide both sides by 3. When dividing a sum or a difference by a number, we use the distributiveJust as multiplication is dis- tributive with respect to ad- dition a(b+ c) = ab+ ac, so too is division distributive with respect to addition. a+ b c = a c + b c property and divide both terms by that number. y = 6 3 − 2x 3 On the left, simplify. On the right, divide both terms by 3. y = 2− 2x 3 Simplify. Finally, use the commutative property to switch the order of the terms on the right-hand side of the last result. y = 2 + ( −2x 3 ) Add the opposite. y = −2 3 x+ 2 Use the commutative property to switch the order. Because the equation 2x+ 3y = 6 is equivalent to the equation y = − 23x + 2, the graph of 2x + 3y = 6 is a line, having slope m = −2/3 and y-intercept (0, 2). Therefore, to draw the graph of 2x+ 3y = 6, plot the y-intercept (0, 2), move down 2 and 3 to the right, then draw the line (see Figure 3.90). Answer: −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 1 ∆x = 2 (0,−3) ! In general, unless B = 0, we can always solve the equation Ax + By = CThe form Ax + By = C, where either A = 0 or B = 0, will be handled at the end of this section. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 229 −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = −2 ∆x = 3 (0, 2) Figure 3.90: The graph of 2x+ 3y = 6, or equivalently, y = − 23x+ 2. for y: Ax+By = C Original equation. Ax +By −Ax = C −Ax Subtract Ax from both sides. By = C −Ax Simplify. By B = C −Ax B Divide both sides by B, possible if B != 0. y = C B − Ax B On the left, simplify. On the right distribute the B. y = −A B x+ C B Commutative property. Note that the last result is in slope-intercept form y = mx+ b, whose graph is a line. We have established the following result. Fact. The graph of the equation Ax +By = C, is a line. Important points. A couple of important comments are in order. 1. The form Ax + By = C requires that the coefficients A, B, and C are integers. So, for example, we would clear the fractions from the form 1 2 x+ 2 3 y = 1 4 230 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator. 12 ( 1 2 x+ 2 3 y ) = ( 1 4 ) 12 6x+ 8y = 3 Note that the coefficients are now integers. 2. The form Ax + By = C also requires that the first coefficient A is non- negative; i.e., A ≥ 0. Thus, if we have −5x+ 2y = 6, then we would multiply both sides by −1, arriving at: −1(−5x+ 2y) = (6)(−1) 5x− 2y = −6 Note that A = 5 is now greater than or equal to zero. 3. If A, B, and C have a common divisor greater than 1, it is recommended that we divide both sides by the common divisor, thus “reducing” the coefficients. For example, if we have 3x+ 12y = −24, then dividing both side by 3 “reduces” the size of the coefficients. 3x+ 12y 3 = −24 3 x+ 4y = −8 Standard form. The form Ax + By = C, where A, B, and C are integers, and A ≥ 0, is called the standard form of a line. 
book7_3_6_1	no label	Slope-Intercept to Standard Form Slope-Intercept to Standard Form Slope-Intercept to Standard Form We’ve already transformed a couple of equations in standard form into slope- intercept form. Let’s reverse the process and place an equation in slope- intercept form into standard form. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 231 You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Given the graph of the line in Figure 3.91, find the equation Given the graph of the line below, find the equation of the line in standard form. −5 5 −5 5 x y of the line in standard form. −5 5 −5 5 x y Figure 3.91: Determine the equa- tion of the line. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 5 ∆x = −2 (0,−3) Figure 3.92: The line has y- intercept (0,−3) and slope −5/2. Solution: The line intercepts the y-axis at (0,−3). From (0,−3), move up 5 units, then left 2 units. Thus, the line has slope ∆y/∆x = −5/2 (see Figure 3.92). Substitute −5/2 for m and −3 for b in the slope-intercept form of the line. y = mx+ b Slope-intercept form. y = −5 2 x− 3 Substitute: −5/2 for m, −3 for b. To put this result in standard form Ax + By = C, first clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. 2y = 2 [ −5 2 x− 3 ] Multiply both sides by 2. 2y = 2 [ −5 2 x ] − 2 [3] Distribute the 2. 2y = −5x− 6 Multiply. That clears the fractions. To put this last result in the form Ax+By = C, we need to move the term −5x to the other side of the equation. 5x+ 2y = −5x− 6 + 5x Add 5x to both sides. 5x+ 2y = −6 Simplify. 232 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Thus, the standard form of the line is 5x + 2y = −6. Note that all the coeffi- cients are integers and the terms are arranged in the order Ax+By = C, with A ≥ 0.Answer: 3x− 4y = −2 ! 
book7_3_6_2	no label	Point-Slope to Standard Form Point-Slope to Standard Form Point-Slope to Standard Form Let’s do an example where we have to put the point-slope form of a line in standard form.

STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 233 Let’s substitute (x0, y0) = (1, 2) and m = 3/2 in the point-slope form of the line. (Note: Substituting (x0, y0) = (−3,−4) and m = 3/2 would yield the same answer.) y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − 2 = 3 2 (x− 1) Substitute: 3/2 for m, 1 for x0, and 2 for y0. The question requests that our final answer be presented in standard form. First we clear the fractions. If we fail to reduce the slope to lowest terms, then the equation of the line would be: y − 2 = 6 4 (x− 1) Multiplying both sides by 4 would give us the result 4y − 8 = 6x− 6, or equivalently: −6x+ 4y = 2 This doesn’t look like the same answer, but if we divide both sides by −2, we do get the same result. 3x− 2y = −1 This shows the importance of requiring A ≥ 0 and “re- ducing” the coefficients A, B, and C. It allows us to com- pare our answer with our col- leagues or the answers pre- sented in this textbook. y − 2 = 3 2 x− 3 2 Distribute the 3/2. 2 [y − 2] = 2 [ 3 2 x− 3 2 ] Multiply both sides by 2. 2y − 2[2] = 2 [ 3 2 x ] − 2 [ 3 2 ] Distribute the 2. 2y − 4 = 3x− 3 Multiply. Now that we’ve cleared the fractions, we must order the terms in the form Ax+By = C. We need to move the term 3x to the other side of the equation. 2y − 4− 3x = 3x− 3− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides. −3x+ 2y − 4 = −3 Simplify, changing the order on the left-hand side. To put this in the form Ax + By = C, we need to move the term −4 to the other side of the equation. −3x+ 2y − 4 + 4 = −3 + 4 Add 4 to both sides. −3x+ 2y = 1 Simplify. It appears that −3x+ 2y = 1 is in the form Ax+By = C. However, standard form requires that A ≥ 0. We have A = −3. To fix this, we multiply both sides by −1. −1 [−3x+ 2y] = −1 [1] Multiply both sides by −1. 3x− 2y = −1 Distribute the −1. Thus, the equation of the line in standard form is 3x− 2y = −1.

Plot the intercepts and draw the line. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 235 Solution: We know that the graph of 2x − 3y = 6 is a line. Furthermore, two points completely determine a line. This means that we need only plot the x- and y-intercepts, then draw a line through them. To find the x-intercept of 2x−3y = 6, substitute 0 for y and solve for x. 2x− 3y = 6 2x− 3(0) = 6 2x = 6 2x 2 = 6 2 x = 3 Thus, the x-intercept of the line is (3, 0). To find the y-intercept of 2x−3y = 6, substitute 0 for x and solve for y. 2x− 3y = 6 2(0)− 3y = 6 −3y = 6 −3y −3 = 6 −3 y = −2 Thus, the y-intercept of the line is (0,−2).

Find the equation of this perpendicular line. Solution: Let’s first find the x- and y-intercepts of the line 4x+ 3y = 12. 236 CHAPTER 3.

To find the y-intercept of the line 4x+3y = 12, substitute 0 for x and solve for y. 4x+ 3y = 12 4(0) + 3y = 12 3y = 12 3y 3 = 12 3 y = 4 Thus, the y-intercept of the line is (0, 4). Plot the intercepts and draw a line through them. Note that it is clear fromYou could also solve for y to put 3x + 4y = 12 in slope- intercept form in order to de- termine the slope. the graph that the slope of the line 3x+ 4y = 12 is −4/3 (see Figure 3.97). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = −4 ∆x = 3 (3, 0) (0, 4) Figure 3.97: The graph of 4x+3y = 12 has intercepts (3, 0) and (0, 4) and slope −4/3. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (−2,−2) Figure 3.98: The slope of the per- pendicular line is the negative re- ciprocal of −4/3, namely 3/4. Because the slope of 3x+4y = 12 is −4/3, the slope of a line perpendicular to 3x + 4y = 12 will be the negative reciprocal of −4/3, namely 3/4. Our perpendicular line has to pass through the point (−2,−2). Start at (−2,−2), move 3 units upward, then 4 units to the right, then draw the line. It should appear to be perpendicular to the line 3x+ 4y = 12 (see Figure 3.98). Finally, use the point-slope form, m = 3/4, and (x0, y0) = (−2,−2) to 3.6.

Let’s place our answer in standard form. Clear the fractions. y + 2 = 3 4 x+ 6 4 Distribute 3/4. 4 [y + 2] = 4 [ 3 4 x+ 6 4 ] Multiply both sides by 4. 4y + 4[2] = 4 [ 3 4 x ] + 4 [ 6 4 ] Distribute the 4. 4y + 8 = 3x+ 6 Multiply. Rearrange the terms to put them in the order Ax+By = C. 4y + 8− 3x = 3x+ 6− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides. −3x+ 4y + 8 = 6 Simplify. Rearrange on the left. −3x+ 4y + 8− 8 = 6− 8 Subtract 8 from both sides. −3x+ 4y = −2 Simplify. −1(−3x+ 4y) = −1(−2) Multiply both sides by −1. 3x− 4y = 2 Distribute the −1. Hence, the equation of the perpendicular line is 3x− 4y = 2. Answer: 5x+ 6y = 27 ! 
book7_3_6_4	no label	Horizontal and Vertical Lines Horizontal and Vertical Lines Horizontal and Vertical Lines Here we keep an earlier promise to address what happens to the standard form Ax + By = C when either A = 0 or B = 0. For example, the form 3x = 6, when compared with the standard form Ax + By = C, has B = 0. Similarly, the form 2y = −12, when compared with the standard form Ax + By = C, has A = 0. Of course, 3x = 6 can be simplified to x = 2 and 2y = −12 can be simplified to y = −6. Thus, if either A = 0 or B = 0, the standard form Ax+By = C takes the form x = a and y = b, respectively. As we will see in the next example, the form x = a produces a vertical line, while the form y = b produces a horizontal line. 238 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Sketch the graphs of x = 3 and y = −3.Sketch the graphs of x = −2 and y = 2. Solution: To sketch the graph of x = 3, recall that the graph of an equation is the set of all points that satisfy the equation. Hence, to draw the graph of x = 3, we must plot all of the points that satisfy the equation x = 3; that is, we must plot all of the points that have an x-coordinate equal to 3. The result is shown in Figure 3.99. Secondly, to sketch the graph of y = −3, we plot all points having a y- coordinate equal to −3. The result is shown in Figure 3.100. −5 5 −5 5 x y x = 3 Figure 3.99: The graph of x = 3 is a vertical line. −5 5 −5 5 x y y = −3 Figure 3.100: The graph of y = −3 is a horizontal line. Things to note: A couple of comments are in order regarding the lines in Figures 3.99 and 3.100. 1. The graph of x = 3 in Figure 3.99, being a vertical line, has undefined slope. Therefore, we cannot use either of the formulae y = mx + b or y − y0 = m(x− x0) to obtain the equation of the line. The only way we can obtain the equation is to note that the line is the set of all points (x, y) whose x-coordinate equals 3. 2. However, the graph of y = −3, being a horizontal line, has slope zero, so we can use the slope-intercept form to find the equation of the line. Note that the y-intercept of this graph is (0,−3). If we substitute these numbers into y = mx+ b, we get: y = mx+ b Slope-intercept form. y = 0x+ (−3) Substitute: 0 for m, −3 for b. y = −3 Simplify. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 239 However, it is far easier to just look at the line in Figures 3.100 and note that it is the collection of all points (x, y) with y = 3.

He invented a method (called Gaussian elimination) that is still used today. Solving systems of equations has been a subject of study in many other cultures. The ancient Chinese text Jiuzhang Suanshu (translated as Nine Chapters of Mathematical Art) written during the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) describes 246 problems related to practical situations such as land measurement, construction, and commerce. Here is one of the problems described in the text: “One pint of good wine costs 50 gold pieces, while one pint of poor wine costs 10. Two pints of wine are bought for 30 gold pieces. How much of each kind of wine was bought?” This problem can be solved by using a system of equations. In this chapter, we will learn how to solve systems of linear equations by using a variety of methods, including Gaussian elimination. 245 246 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS 
book7_4_1	no label	4.1 Solving Systems by Graphing 4.1 Solving Systems by Graphing 4.1 Solving Systems by Graphing In this section we introduce a graphical technique for solving systems of two linear equations in two unknowns. As we saw in the previous chapter, if a point satisfies an equation, then that point lies on the graph of the equation. If we are looking for a point that satisfies two equations, then we are looking for a point that lies on the graphs of both equations; that is, we are looking for a point of intersection. For example, consider the the two equations x− 3y = −9 2x+ 3y = 18, −2 8 −2 8 x y (3, 4) x− 3y = −9 2x+ 3y = 18 Figure 4.1: The point of in- tersection is a solution of the system of linear equations. which is called a system of linear equations. The equations are linear equations because their graphs are lines, as shown in Figure 4.1. Note that the two lines in Figure 4.1 intersect at the point (3, 4). Therefore, the point (3, 4) should satisfy both equations. Let’s check. Substitute 3 for x and 4 for y. x− 3y = −9 3− 3(4) = −9 3− 12 = −9 −9 = −9 Substitute 3 for x and 4 for y. 2x+ 3y = 18 2(3) + 3(4) = 18 6 + 12 = 18 18 = 18 Hence, the point (3, 4) satisfies both equations and is called a solution of the system. Solution of a linear system. A point (x, y) is called a solution of a system of two linear equations if and only if it satisfied both equations. Furthermore, because a point satisfies an equation if and only if it lies on the graph of the equation, to solve a system of linear equations graphically, we need to determine the point of intersection of the two lines having the given equations. Let’s try an example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: 2x− 5y = −10 y = x− 1 3x+ 2y = 12 y = x+ 1 (4.1) Solution: We are looking for the point (x, y) that satisfies both equations; that is, we are looking for the point that lies on the graph of both equations. Therefore, the logical approach is to plot the graphs of both lines, then identify the point of intersection. First, let’s determine the x- and y-intercepts of 3x+ 2y = 12. 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 247 To find the x-intercept, let y = 0. 3x+ 2y = 12 3x+ 2(0) = 12 3x = 12 x = 4 To find the y-intercept, let x = 0. 3x+ 2y = 12 3(0) + 2y = 12 2y = 12 y = 6 Hence, the x-intercept is (4, 0) and the y-intercept is (0, 6). These intercepts are plotted in Figure 4.2 and the line 3x+ 2y = 12 is drawn through them. Comparing the second equation y = x + 1 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, we see that the slope is m = 1 and the y-intercept is (0, 1). Plot the intercept (0, 1), then go up 1 unit and right 1 unit, then draw the line (see Figure 4.3). −2 8 −2 8 x y (4, 0) (0, 6) 3x+ 2y = 12 Figure 4.2: Drawing the graph of 3x+ 2y = 12. −2 8 −2 8 x y 1 1 (0, 1) y = x+ 1 Figure 4.3: Drawing the graph of y = x+ 1. We are trying to find the point that lies on both lines, so we plot both lines on the same coordinate system, labeling each with its equation (see Figure 4.4). It appears that the lines intersect at the point (2, 3), making (x, y) = (2, 3) the solution of System 4.1 (see Figure 4.4). Check: To show that (x, y) = (2, 3) is a solution of System 4.1, we must show that we get true statements when we substitute 2 for x and 3 for y in both equations of System 4.1. 248 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS −2 8 −2 8 x y (2, 3) y = x+ 1 3x+ 2y = 12 Figure 4.4: The coordinates of the point of intersection is the solution of System 4.1. Substituting 2 for x and 3 for y in 3x+ 2y = 12, we get: 3x+ 2y = 12 3(2) + 2(3) = 12 6 + 6 = 12 12 = 12 Hence, (2, 3) satisfies the equation 3x+ 2y = 12. Substituting 2 for x and 3 for y in y = x+ 1, we get: y = x+ 1 3 = 2 + 1 3 = 3 Hence, (2, 3) satisfies the equation y = x+ 1. Because (2, 3) satisfies both equations, this makes (2, 3) a solution of System 4.1. Answer: (5, 4) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: −4x− 3y = 12 x− 2y = −2 3x− 5y = −15 2x+ y = −4 (4.2) Solution: Once again, we are looking for the point that satisfies both equations of the System 4.2. Thus, we need to find the point that lies on the graphs of both lines represented by the equations of System 4.2. The approach will be to graph both lines, then approximate the coordinates of the point of intersection. First, let’s determine the x- and y-intercepts of 3x− 5y = −15. 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 249 To find the x-intercept, let y = 0. 3x− 5y = −15 3x− 5(0) = −15 3x = −15 x = −5 To find the y-intercept, let x = 0. 3x− 5y = −15 3(0)− 5y = −15 −5y = −15 y = 3 Hence, the x-intercept is (−5, 0) and the y-intercept is (0, 3). These intercepts are plotted in Figure 4.5 and the line 3x− 5y = −15 is drawn through them. Next, let’s determine the intercepts of the second equation 2x+ y = −4. To find the x-intercept, let y = 0. 2x+ y = −4 2x+ 0 = −4 2x = −4 x = −2 To find the y-intercept, let x = 0. 2x+ y = −4 2(0) + y = −4 y = −4 Hence, the x-intercept is (−2, 0) and the y-intercept is (0,−4). These intercepts Later in this section we will learn how to use the intersect utility on the graphing calculator to obtain a much more accurate approximation of the actual solution. Then, in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, we’ll show how to find the exact solution. are plotted in Figure 4.6 and the line 2x+ y = −4 is drawn through them. −10 10 −10 10 x y (−5, 0) (0, 3) 3x− 5y = −15 Figure 4.5: Drawing the graph of the line 3x− 5y = −15. −10 10 −10 10 x y (−2, 0) (0,−4) 2x+ y = −4 Figure 4.6: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ y = −4. To find the solution of System 4.2, we need to plot both lines on the same coordinate system and determine the coordinates of the point of intersection. Unlike Example 1, in this case we’ll have to be content with an approximation of these coordinates. It appears that the coordinates of the point of intersection are approximately (−2.6, 1.4) (see Figure 4.7). Check: Because we only have an approximation of the solution of the system, we cannot expect the solution to check exactly in each equation. However, we do hope that the solution checks approximately. 250 CHAPTER 4.

Substitute (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) into the first equation of System 4.2. 3x− 5y = −15 3(−2.6)− 5(1.4) = −15 −7.8− 7 = −15 −14.8 = −15 Note that (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) does not check exactly, but it is pretty close to being a true statement. Substitute (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) into the second equation of System 4.2. 2x+ y = −4 2(−2.6) + 1.4 = −4 −5.2 + 1.4 = −4 −3.8 = −4 Again, note that (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) does not check ex- actly, but it is pretty close to being a true statement. Because (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) very nearly makes both equations a true state- ment, it seems that (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) is a reasonable approximation for the solution of System 4.2.Approximate answer: (−2.7,−0.4) !

SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 251 Solution: Let’s place each equation in slope-intercept form by solving each equation for y. Solve 2x+ 3y = 6 for y: 2x+ 3y = 6 2x+ 3y − 2x = 6− 2x 3y = 6− 2x 3y 3 = 6− 2x 3 y = −2 3 x+ 2 Solve 2x+ 3y = −6 for y: 2x+ 3y = −6 2x+ 3y − 2x = −6− 2x 3y = −6− 2x 3y 3 = −6− 2x 3 y = −2 3 x− 2 Comparing y = (−2/3)x+2 with the slope-intercept form y = mx+ b tells us that the slope is m = −2/3 and the y-intercept is (0, 2). Plot the intercept (0, 2), then go down 2 units and right 3 units and draw the line (see Figure 4.8). Comparing y = (−2/3)x − 2 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b tells us that the slope is m = −2/3 and the y-intercept is (0,−2). Plot the intercept (0,−2), then go down 2 units and right 3 units and draw the line (see Figure 4.9). −5 5 −5 5 x y −2 3 (0, 2) 2x+ 3y = 6 Figure 4.8: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ 3y = 6. −5 5 −5 5 x y −2 3 (0,−2) 2x+ 3y = −6 Figure 4.9: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ 3y = −6. To find the solution of System 4.3, draw both lines on the same coordinate system (see Figure 4.10). Note how the lines appear to be parallel (they don’t intersect). The fact that both lines have the same slope −2/3 confirms our suspicion that the lines are parallel. However, note that the lines have differ- ent y-intercepts. Hence, we are looking at two parallel but distinct lines (see Figure 4.10) that do not intersect. Hence, System 4.3 has no solution. 252 CHAPTER 4.

Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: −6x+ 3y = −12 2x− y = 4 x− y = 3 −2x+ 2y = −6 (4.4) Solution: Let’s solve both equations for y. Solve x− y = 3 for y: x− y = 3 x− y − x = 3− x −y = −x+ 3 −1(−y) = −1(−x+ 3) y = x− 3 Solve −2x+ 2y = −6 for y: −2x+ 2y = −6 −2x+ 2y + 2x = −6 + 2x 2y = 2x− 6 2y 2 = 2x− 6 2 y = x− 3 Both lines have slope m = 1, and both have the same y-intercept (0,−3). Hence, the two lines are identical (see Figure 4.11). Hence, System 4.4 has an infinite number of points of intersection. Any point on either line is a solution of the system. Examples of points of intersection (solutions satisfying both equations) are (0,−3), (1,−2), and (3, 0). −5 5 −5 5 x y x− y = 3 −2x + 2y = −6 (0,−3) (1,−2) (3, 0) Figure 4.11: x − y = 3 and −2x+ 2y = −6 are the same line. 4.1.

Hence, we must first solve 3x+ 2y = 12 for y. 3x+ 2y = 12 Original equation. 2y = 12− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides of the equation. 2y 2 = 12− 3x 2 Divide both sides by 2. y = 12 2 − 3x 2 On the left, simplify.

Press the 2ND key, then the TRACE button, which will open the CALCULATE menu shown in Figure 4.14. Select 5:intersect. The result is shown in Figure 4.15.

Having the calculator ask “First curve,” “Second curve,” when there are only two curves on the screen may seem annoying. However, imagine the situation when there are three or more curves on the screen. Then these questions make good sense. You can change your selection of “First curve” or “Second curve” by using the up-and-down arrow keys to move the cursor to a different curve. The calculator responds as shown Figure 4.16.

book7_4_2	no label	4.2 Solving Systems by Substitution 4.2 Solving Systems by Substitution 4.2 Solving Systems by Substitution In this section we introduce an algebraic technique for solving systems of two equations in two unknowns called the substitution method. The substitution method is fairly straightforward to use. First, you solve either equation for either variable, then substitute the result into the other equation. The result is an equation in a single variable. Solve that equation, then substitute the result into any of the other equations to find the remaining unknown variable. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: 9x+ 2y = −19 y = 13 + 3x 2x− 5y = −8 (4.7) y = 3x− 1 (4.8) Solution: Equation (4.8) is already solved for y. Substitute equation (4.8) into equation (4.7). This means we will substitute 3x−1 for y in equation (4.7). 2x− 5y = −8 Equation (4.7). 2x− 5(3x− 1) = −8 Substitute 3x− 1 for y in (4.7). Now solve for x. 2x− 15x+ 5 = −8 Distribute −5. −13x+ 5 = −8 Simplify. −13x = −13 Subtract 5 from both sides. x = 1 Divide both sides by −13. As we saw in Solving Systems by Graphing, the solution to the system is the point of intersection of the two lines represented by the equations in the system. This means that we can substitute the answer x = 1 into either equation to find the corresponding value of y. We choose to substitute 1 for x in equation (4.8), then solve for y, but you will get exactly the same result if you substitute 1 for x in equation (4.7). −5 5 −5 5 x y 2x− 5y = −8 y = 3x− 1 (1, 2) Figure 4.27: 2x − 5y = −8 and y = x − 3 intersect at (1, 2). y = 3x− 1 Equation (4.8). y = 3(1)− 1 Substitute 1 for x. y = 2 Simplify. Hence, (x, y) = (1, 2) is the solution of the system. Check: To show that the solution (x, y) = (1, 2) is a solution of the system, we need to show that (x, y) = (1, 2) satisfies both equations (4.7) and (4.8). 4.2. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY SUBSTITUTION 263 Substitute (x, y) = (1, 2) in equa- tion (4.7): 2x− 5y = −8 2(1)− 5(2) = −8 2− 10 = −8 −8 = −8 Thus, (1, 2) satisfies equation (4.7). Substitute (x, y) = (1, 2) in equa- tion (4.8): y = 3x− 1 2 = 3(1)− 1 2 = 3− 1 2 = 2 Thus, (1, 2) satisfies equation (4.8). Because (x, y) = (1, 2) satisfies both equations, it is a solution of the system. Answer: (−3, 4) ! Substitution method. The substitution method involves these steps: 1. Solve either equation for either variable. 2. Substitute the result from step one into the other equation. Solve the resulting equation. 3. Substitute the result from step two into either of the original system equa- tions or the resulting equation from step one (whichever seems easiest), then solve to find the remaining unknown variable. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve the following system of equations: Solve the following system of equations: x− 2y = 13 4x− 3y = 26 5x− 2y = 12 (4.9) 4x+ y = 6 (4.10) Solution: The first step is to solve either equation for either variable. This means that we can solve the first equation for x or y, but it also means that we could first solve the second equation for x or y. Of these four possible choices, solving the second equation (4.10) for y seems the easiest way to start. 4x+ y = 6 Equation (4.10). y = 6− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 264 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Next, substitute 6− 4x for y in equation (4.9). 5x− 2y = 12 Equation (4.9). 5x− 2(6− 4x) = 12 Substitute 6− 4x for y in (4.9). 5x− 12 + 8x = 12 Distribute −2. 13x− 12 = 12 Simplify. 13x = 24 Add 12 to both sides. x = 24 13 Divide both sides by 13. Finally, to find the y-value, substitute 24/13 for x in the equation y = 6 − 4x (you can also substitute 24/13 for x in equations (4.9) or (4.10)). y = 6− 4x y = 6− 4 ( 24 13 ) Substitute 24/13 for x in y = 6− 4x. y = 78 13 − 96 13 Multiply, then make equivalent fractions. y = −18 13 Simplify. Hence, (x, y) = (24/13,−18/13) is the solution of the system. −5 5 −5 5 x y 5x− 2y = 12 4x + y = 6 (24/13,−18/13) Figure 4.28: 5x − 2y = 12 and 4x + y = 6 intersect at (24/13,−18/13).

Note that each left-hand side produces the number on the right-hand sides of equations (4.9) and (4.10). Thus, the solution (x, y) = (24/13,−18/13) checks. 4.2.

Solve the following system of equations: Solve the following system of equations: 3x− 5y = 3 5x− 6y = 2 3x− 2y = 6 (4.11) 4x+ 5y = 20 (4.12) Solution: Dividing by −2 gives easier fractions to deal with than dividing by 3, 4, or 5, so let’s start by solving equation (4.11) for y. 3x− 2y = 6 Equation (4.11). −2y = 6− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides. y = 6− 3x −2 Divide both sides by −2. y = −3 + 3 2 x Divide both 6 and −3x by −2 using distributive property. 266 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Substitute −3 + 32x for y in equation (4.12). 4x+ 5y = 20 Equation (4.12). 4x+ 5 ( −3 + 3 2 x ) = 20 Substitute −3 + 3 2 x for y. 4x− 15 + 15 2 x = 20 Distribute the 5. 8x− 30 + 15x = 40 Clear fractions by multiplying both sides by 2. 23x = 70 Simplify. Add 30 to both sides. x = 70 23 Divide both sides by 23. To find y, substitute 70/23 for x into equation y = −3 + 32x. You could also substitute 70/23 for x in equations (4.11) or (4.12) and get the same result. −5 5 −5 5 x y 3x− 2y = 6 4x + 5y = 20 (70/23, 36/23) Figure 4.31: 3x − 2y = 6 and 4x+ 5y = 20 intersect at (70/23, 36/23). y = −3 + 3 2 x y = −3 + 3 2 ( 70 23 ) Substitute 70/23 for x. y = −69 23 + 105 23 Multiply. Make equivalent fractions. y = 36 23 Simplify. Hence, (x, y) = (70/23, 36/23) is the solution of the system. Check: To check this solution, let’s use the graphing calculator to find the solution of the system. We already know that 3x − 2y = 6 is equivalent to y = −3 + 32x. Let’s also solve equation (4.12) for y. 4x+ 5y = 20 Equation (4.12). 5y = 20− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. y = 20− 4x 5 Divide both sides by 5. y = 4− 4 5 x Divide both 20 and −4x by 5 using the distributive property.

book7_4_2_1	no label	Exceptional Cases Revisited Exceptional Cases Revisited Exceptional Cases Revisited It is entirely possible that you might apply the substitution method to a system of equations that either have an infinite number of solutions or no solutions at all. Let’s see what happens should you do that. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: x = 4 3 y − 7 6x− 8y = −3 2x+ 3y = 6 (4.13) y = −2 3 x+ 4 (4.14) Solution: Equation (4.14) is already solved for y, so let’s substitute − 23x+ 4 for y in equation (4.13). 2x+ 3y = 6 Equation (4.13). 2x+ 3 ( −2 3 x+ 4 ) = 6 Substitute −2 3 x+ 4 for y. 2x− 2x+ 12 = 6 Distribute the 3. 12 = 6 Simplify. Goodness! What happened to the x? How are we supposed to solve for x in this situation? However, note that the resulting statement, 12 = 6, is false, no matter what we use for x and y. This should give us a clue that there are no solutions. Perhaps we are dealing with parallel lines? Let’s solve equation (4.13) for y, putting the equation into slope-intercept form, to help determine the situation. 2x+ 3y = 6 Equation (4.13). 3y = −2x+ 6 Subtract 2x from both sides. y = −2 3 x+ 2 Divide both sides by 3. Thus, our system is equivalent to the following two equations. −5 5 −5 5 x y 2x + 3y = 6 y = − 2 3 x + 4 Figure 4.36: 2x+ 3y = 6 and y = − 23x+ 4 are parallel. No solution. y = − 2 3 x+ 2 (4.15) y = −2 3 x+ 4 (4.16) These lines have the same slope −2/3, but different y-intercepts (one has y- intercept (0, 2), the other has y-intercept (0, 4)). Hence, these are two distinct parallel lines and the system has no solution.Answer: no solution ! 4.2. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY SUBSTITUTION 269 You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve the following system of equations: Solve the following system of equations: −28x+ 14y = −126 y = 2x− 9 2x− 6y = −8 (4.17) x = 3y − 4 (4.18) Solution: Equation (4.18) is already solved for x, so let’s substitute 3y−4 for x in equation (4.17). 2x− 6y = −8 Equation (4.17). 2(3y − 4)− 6y = −8 Substitute 3y − 4 for x. 6y − 8− 6y = −8 Distribute the 2. −8 = −8 Simplify. Goodness! What happened to the x? How are we supposed to solve for x in this situation? However, note that the resulting statement, −8 = −8, is a true statement this time. Perhaps this is an indication that we are dealing with the same line? Let’s put both equations (4.17) and (4.18) into slope-intercept form so that we can compare them. −5 5 −5 5 x y x = 3y − 4 2x− 6y = −8 (−4, 0) (−1, 1) (2, 2) Figure 4.37: 2x − 6y = −8 and x = 3y − 4 are the same line. Infinite number of solu- tions. Solve equation (4.17) for y: 2x− 6y = −8 −6y = −2x− 8 y = −2x− 8 −6 y = 1 3 x+ 4 3 Solve equation (4.18) for y: x = 3y − 4 x+ 4 = 3y x+ 4 3 = y y = 1 3 x+ 4 3 Hence, the lines have the same slope and the same y-intercept and they are exactly the same lines. Thus, there are an infinite number of solutions. Indeed, any point on either line is a solution. Examples of solution points are (−4, 0), (−1, 1), and (2, 2). Answer: There are an infinite number of solutions. Examples of solution points are (0,−9), (5, 1), and (−3,−15). ! Tip. When you substitute one equation into another and the variable disap- pears, consider: 1. If the resulting statement is false, then you have two distinct parallel lines and there is no solution. 2. If the resulting statement is true, then you have the same lines and there are an infinite number of solutions. 270 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS ! ! ! 
book7_4_3	no label	4.3 Solving Systems by Elimination 4.3 Solving Systems by Elimination 4.3 Solving Systems by Elimination When both equations of a system are in standard form Ax + By = C, then a process called elimination is usually the best procedure to use to find the solution of the system. Elimination is based on two simple ideas, the first of which should be familiar. 1. Multiplying both sides of an equation by a non-zero number does not change its solutions. Thus, the equation x+ 3y = 7 (4.19) will have the same solutions (it’s the same line) as the equation obtained by multiplying equation (4.19) by 2. 2x+ 6y = 14 (4.20) 2. Adding two true equations produces another true equation. For example, consider what happens when you add 4 = 4 to 5 = 5. 4 = 4 5 = 5 9 = 9 Even more importantly, consider what happens when you add two equa- tions that have (2, 1) as a solution. The result is a third equation whose graph also passes through the solution. x + y = 3 x − y = 1 2x = 4 x = 2 −5 5 −5 5 x y x = 2x− y = 1 x+ y = 3 Fact. Adding a multiple of an equation to a second equation produces an equation that passes through the same solution as the first two equations. 274 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS One more important thing to notice is the fact that when we added the equations x + y = 3 x − y = 1 2x = 4 the variable y was eliminated. This is where the elimination method gets its name. The strategy is to somehow add the equations of a system with the intent of eliminating one of the unknown variables. However, sometimes you need to do a little bit more than simply add the equations. Let’s look at an example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the following system of equations.Solve the following system of equations: x+ 3y = 14 −8x− 3y = −28 x+ 2y = −5 (4.21) 2x− y = −5 (4.22) Solution: Our focus will be on eliminating the variable x. Note that if we multiply equation (4.21) by −2, then add the result to equation (4.22), the x terms will be eliminated. −2x − 4y = 10 Multiply equation (4.21) by −2. 2x − y = −5 Equation (4.22). − 5y = 5 Add the equations. Divide both sides of −5y = 5 by −5 to get y = −1. To find the corresponding value of x, substitute −1 for y in equation (4.21) (or equation (4.22)) and solve for x. x+ 2y = −5 Equation (4.21) x+ 2(−1) = −5 Substitute −1 for y. x = −3 Solve for x. −5 5 −5 5 x y x + 2y = −5 2x− y = −5 (−3,−1) Figure 4.38: x + 2y = −5 and 2x − y = −5 intersect at (−3,−1). Check: To check, we need to show that the point (x, y) = (−3, 1) satisfies both equations. Substitute (x, y) = (−3,−1) into equation (4.21). x+ 2y = −5 −3 + 2(−1) = −5 −5 = −5 Substitute (x, y) = (−3,−1) into equation (4.22). 2x− y = −5 2(−3)− (−1) = −5 −5 = −5 Thus, the point (x, y) = (−3,−1) satisfies both equations and is therefore the solution of the system.Answer: (2, 4). ! 4.3. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY ELIMINATION 275 To show that you have the option of which variable you choose to eliminate, let’s try Example 1 a second time, this time eliminating y instead of x. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve the following system of equations. x+ 2y = −5 (4.23) 2x− y = −5 (4.24) Solution: This time we focus on eliminating the variable y. We note that if we multiply equation (4.24) by 2, then add the result to equation (4.23), the y terms will be eliminated. −5 5 −5 5 x y x + 2y = −5 2x− y = −5 (−3,−1) Figure 4.39: x + 2y = −5 and 2x− y = −5 intersect at (−3,−1). x + 2y = −5 Equation (4.23). 4x − 2y = −10 Multiply equation (4.24) by 2. 5x = −15 Add the equations. Divide both sides of 5x = −15 by 5 to get x = −3. To find the corresponding value of y, substitute −3 for x in equation (4.23) (or equation (4.24)) and solve for y. x+ 2y = −5 Equation (4.23) −3 + 2y = −5 Substitute −3 for x. 2y = −2 Add 3 to both sides. y = −1 Divide both sides by 2. Hence, (x, y) = (−3,−1), just as in Example 1, is the solution of the system. ! Sometimes elimination requires a thought process similar to that of finding a common denominator. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Solve the following system of equations. Solve the following system of equations: −14x+ 9y = 94 7x+ 3y = −62 3x+ 4y = 12 (4.25) 2x− 5y = 10 (4.26) Solution: Let’s focus on eliminating the x-terms. Note that if we multiply equation (4.25) by 2, then multiply equation (4.26) by −3, the x-terms will be eliminated when we add the resulting equations. 6x + 8y = 24 Multiply equation (4.25) by 2. −6x + 15y = −30 Multiply equation (4.26) by −3. 23y = −6 Add the equations. 276 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Hence, y = −6/23. At this point, we could substitute y = −6/23 in either equation, then solve the result for x. However, working with y = −6/23 is a bit daunting, partic- ularly in the light of elimination being easier. So let’s use elimination again, this time focusing on eliminating y. Note that if we multiply equation (4.25) by 5, then multiply equation (4.26) by 4, when we add the results, the y-terms will be eliminated. 15x + 20y = 60 Multiply equation (4.25) by 5. 8x − 20y = 40 Multiply equation (4.26) by 4. 23x = 100 Add the equations. Thus, x = 100/23, and the system of the system is (x, y) = (100/23,−6/23). −2 8 −5 5 x y 3x + 4y = 122x− 5y = 10 (100/23,−6/23) Figure 4.40: 3x + 4y = 12 and 2x− 5y = 10 intersect at (100/23,−6/23). Check: Let’s use the graphing calculator to check the solution. First, store 100/23 in X, then −6/23 in Y (see Figure 4.41). Next, enter the left-hand sides of equations (4.25) and (4.26). Figure 4.41: Enter 100/23 in X, −6/23 in Y. Figure 4.42: Enter the left-hand sides of equations (4.25) and (4.26). Note that both calculations in Figure 4.42 provide the correct right-hand sides for equations (4.25) and (4.26). Thus, the solution (x, y) = (100/23,−6/23) checks.Answer: (−8,−2). !

Because of our experience with this solving this exceptional case with substi- tution, the fact that both variables have disappeared should not be completely surprising. Note that this last statement is false, regardless of the values of x and y. Hence, the system has no solution. Indeed, if we find the intercepts of each equation and plot them, then we can easily see that the lines of this system are parallel (see Figure 4.43).

SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Solution: If we are not on automatic pilot late at night doing our homework, we might recognize that the equations 4.29 and (4.30) are identical. But it’s also conceivable that we don’t see that right away and begin the elimination method. Let’s multiply the first equation by 3, then add. This will eliminate the x-terms. 3x − 21y = 12 Multiply equation (4.29) by 3. −3x + 21y = −12 Equation (4.30). 0 = 0 Add the equations. Again, all of the variables have disappeared!

If the second of two complementary angles is 30 degrees larger than twice the first angle, find the degree measure of both angles. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Our variable dictionary will take the form of a diagram, naming the two complementary angles α and β. α β 2. Set up a Systems of Equations. The “second angle is 30 degrees larger than twice the first angle” becomes β = 30 + 2α (4.31) Secondly, the angles are complementary, meaning that the sum of the angles is 90◦. α + β = 90 (4.32) Thus, we have a system of two equations in two unknowns α and β. 3. Solve the System. As equation (4.31) is already solved for β, let use the substitution method and substitute 30 + 2α for β in equation (4.32). α + β = 90 Equation (4.32). α + (30 + 2α) = 90 Substitute 30 + 2α for β. 3α + 30 = 90 Combine like terms. 3α = 60 Subtract 30 from both sides. α = 20 Divide both sides by 3. 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 283 4. Answer the Question. The first angle is α = 20 degrees. The second angle is: β = 30 + 2α Equation (4.31). β = 30 + 2(20) Substitute 20 for α. β = 70 Simplify. 5. Look Back. Certainly 70◦ is 30◦ larger than twice 20◦. Also, note that 20◦ + 70◦ = 90◦, so the angles are complementary. We have the correct solution. Answer: 21 and 69 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2.

Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Our variable dictionary will take the form of a diagram, naming the width and length W and L, respectively. L W L W 2. Set up a System of Equations. The perimeter is found by summing the four sides of the rectangle. P = L+W + L+W P = 2L+ 2W We’re told the perimeter is 280 feet, so we can substitute 280 for P in the last equation. 280 = 2L+ 2W 284 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2, giving the following result: L+W = 140 Secondly, we’re told that the “length is 10 feet less than twice the width.” This translates to: L = 2W − 10 Thus, the system we need to solve is: L+W = 140 (4.33) L = 2W − 10 (4.34) 3. Solve the System. As equation (4.34) is already solved for L, let use the substitution method and substitute 2W − 10 for L in equation (4.33). W + L = 140 Equation (4.33). W + (2W − 10) = 140 Substitute 2W − 10 for L. 3W − 10 = 140 Combine like terms. 3W = 150 Add 10 to both sides. W = 50 Divide both sides by 3. 4. Answer the Question. The width is W = 50 feet. The length is: L = 2W − 10 Equation (4.34). L = 2(50)− 10 Substitute 50 for W . L = 90 Simplify. Thus, the length is L = 90 feet. 5. Look Back. Perhaps a picture, labeled with our answers might best demonstrate that we have the correct solution. Remember, we found that the width was 50 feet and the length was 90 feet. 90 50 90 50 Note that the perimeter is P = 90 + 50 + 90 + 50 = 280 feet. Secondly, note that the length 90 feet is 10 feet less than twice the width. So we have the correct solution. Answer: length = 134, width = 50 ! 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 285 You Try It!

How many quarters does she have? quarters. He has 22 coins in all. How many dimes does he have? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let D represent the number of dimes and let Q represent the number of quarters. 2. Set up a System of Equations. Using a table to summarize information is a good strategy. In the first column, we list the type of coin. The second column gives the number of each type of coin, and the third column contains the value (in cents) of the number of coins in Pascal’s pocket. Number of Coins Value (in cents) Dimes D 10D Quarters Q 25Q Totals 22 325 Note that D times, valued at 10 cents apiece, are worth 10D cents. Sim- ilarly, Q quarters, valued at 25 cents apiece, are worth 25Q cents. Note also how we’ve change $3.25 to 325 cents. The second column of the table gives us our first equation. D +Q = 22 (4.35) The third column of the table gives us our second equation. 10D + 25Q = 325 (4.36) 3. Solve the System. Because equations (4.35) and (4.36) are both in stan- dard form Ax + By = C, we’ll use the elimination method to find a solution. Because the question asks us to find the number of dimes in Pascal’s pocket, we’ll focus on eliminating the Q-terms and keeping the D-terms. −25D − 25Q = −550 Multiply equation (4.35) by −25. 10D + 25Q = 325 Equation (4.36). −15D = −225 Add the equations. Dividing both sides of the last equation by −15 gives us D = 15. 4. Answer the Question. The previous solution tells us that Pascal has 15 dimes in his pocket. 286 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS 5. Look Back. Again, summarizing results in a table might help us see if we have the correct solution. First, because we’re told that Pascal has 22 coins in all, and we found that he had 15 dimes, this means that he must have 7 quarters. Number of Coins Value (in cents) Dimes 15 150 Quarters 7 175 Totals 22 325 Fifteen dimes are worth 150 cents, and 7 quarters are worth 175 cents. That’s a total of 22 coins and 325 cents, or $3.25.

Find the amount invested in each account. two accounts, one portion in a certificate of deposit that pays 4% interest per year, and the rest in a mutual fund that pays 5% per year. At the end of the first year, Rosa’s investments earn a total of $420 in interest. Find the amount invested in each account. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let C represent the amount invested in the certificate of deposit and M represent the amount invested in the mutual fund. 2. Set up a System of Equations. We’ll again use a table to summarize information. Rate Amount invested Interest Certificate of Deposit 4% C 0.04C Mutual Fund 5% M 0.05M Totals 10,000 420 At 4%, the interest earned on a C dollars investment is found by taking 4% of C (i.e., 0.04C). Similarly, the interest earned on the mutual fund is 0.05M . 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 287 The third column of the table gives us our first equation. The total investment is $10,000. C +M = 10000 The fourth column of the table gives us our second equation. The total interest earned is the sum of the interest earned in each account. 0.04C + 0.05M = 420 Let’s clear the decimals from the last equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100. 4C + 5M = 42000 Thus, the system we need to solve is: C +M = 10000 (4.37) 4C + 5M = 42000 (4.38) 3. Solve the System. Because equations (4.37) and (4.38) are both in stan- dard form Ax + By = C, we’ll use the elimination method to find a solution. We’ll focus on eliminating the C-terms. −4C − 4M = −40000 Multiply equation (4.37) by −4. 4C + 5M = 42000 Equation (4.38). M = 2000 Add the equations. Thus, the amount invested in the mutual fund in M = $2, 000. 4. Answer the Question. The question asks us to find the amount invested in each account. So, substitute M = 2000 in equation (4.37) and solve for C. C +M = 10000 Equation (4.37). C + 2000 = 10000 Substitute 2000 for M . C = 8000 Subtract 2000 from both sides. Thus C = $8, 000 was invested in the certificate of deposit. 5. Look Back. First, note that the investments in the certificate of deposit and the mutual fund, $8,000 and $2,000 respectively, total $10,000. Let’s calculate the interest on each investment: 4% of $8,000 is $320 and 5% of $2,000 is $100.

If you were a shop owner, how many pounds of peanuts and cashews should you mix to make 50 pounds of a peanut-cashew mixture costing $0.95 per pound? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let P be the number of pounds of peanuts used and let C be the number of pounds of cashews used. 2. Set up a System of Equations. We’ll again use a table to summarize information. Cost per pound Amount (pounds) Cost Peanuts $0.50 P 0.50P Cashews $1.25 C 1.25C Totals $0.95 50 0.95(50)=47.50 At $0.50 per pound, P pounds of peanuts cost 0.50P . At $1.25 per pound, C pounds of cashews cost 1.25C. Finally, at $0.95 per pound, 50 pounds of a mixture of peanuts and cashews will cost 0.95(50), or $47.50. The third column of the table gives us our first equation. The total number of pounds of mixture is given by the following equation: P + C = 50 The fourth column of the table gives us our second equation. The total cost is the sum of the costs for purchasing the peanuts and cashews. 0.50P + 1.25C = 47.50 Let’s clear the decimals from the last equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100. 50P + 125C = 4750 Thus, the system we need to solve is: P + C = 50 (4.39) 50P + 125C = 4750 (4.40) 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 289 3. Solve the System. Because equations (4.39) and (4.40) are both in stan- dard form Ax + By = C, we’ll use the elimination method to find a solution. We’ll focus on eliminating the P -terms. −50P − 50C = −2500 Multiply equation (4.39) by −50. 50P + 125C = 4750 Equation (4.40). 75C = 2250 Add the equations. Divide both sides by 75 to get C = 30 pounds of cashews are in the mix. 4. Answer the Question. The question asks for both amounts, peanuts and cashews. Substitute C = 30 in equation (4.39) to determine P . P + C = 50 Equation (4.39). P + 30 = 50 Substitute 30 for C. P = 20 Subtract 30 from both sides. Thus, there are P = 20 pounds of peanuts in the mix. 5. Look Back. First, note that the amount of peanuts and cashews in the mix is 20 and 30 pounds respectively, so the total mixture weighs 50 pounds as required. Let’s calculate the costs: for the peanuts, 0.50(20), or $10, for the cashews, 1.25(30) = 37.50. Cost per pound Amount (pounds) Cost Peanuts $0.50 20 $10.00 Cashews $1.25 30 $37.50 Totals $0.95 50 47.50 Note that the total cost is $47.50, as required in the problem statement.

Solving algebraic equations containing polynomials is among the oldest problems in mathematics. The Babylonians solved quadratic equations as early as 2000 BC. Euclid of Alexandria used geometry to solve quadratic equations in 300 BC. Arab mathematicians solved quadratic equations in 1000 AD. The current method of solving equations using more modern notation started in 1557 when Robert Recorde used the equal sign in The Whetstone of Witte.

The collection of ordered pairs R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)} is an example of a relation. If we collect the first element of each ordered pair in a set, we have what is called the domain of the relation. Domain. The domain of a relation is the set of all first elements of the ordered pairs. For example, in the relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)}, if we collect the first element of each ordered pair in R, we get the domain: Domain of R = {0, 1, 2} Although the number zero appears twice as a first element in the ordered pairs of R, note that we list it only once when listing the elements in the domain of R. In similar fashion, if we collect the second elements of each ordered pair in a set, we have what is called the range of a relation. Range. The range of a relation is the set of all second elements of the ordered pairs. For example, in the relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)}, if we collect the second element of each ordered pair in R, we get the range: Range of R = {3, 4, 5, 6} You Try It! EXAMPLE 1.

S = {(3, 2), (−2, 3), (−4,−3), (1,−3)} If we collect each element in the first position of each ordered pair, we have the domain. Domain of S = {−4,−2, 1, 3} Note that it is traditional to list the domain elements in order (smallest to largest). Next, if we collect each element in the second position of each ordered pair, we have the range. Range of S = {−3, 2, 3} 296 CHAPTER 5.

Consider the earlier relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)}, which had domain D = {0, 1, 2} and range R = {3, 4, 5, 6}.

book7_5_1_2	no label	Function Definition Function Definition Function Definition A function is a very special type of relation. Function A relation is a function if and only if each object in the domain is paired with exactly one object in the range. As a first example, consider the relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)} whose mapping diagram is pictured in Figure 5.2. Note that 0 in the domain is paired with two objects, 3 and 4, in the range. Hence, relation R is is not a function. As a second example, consider the relation T = {(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 4)}, whose mapping diagram is pictured in Figure 5.3. In this example, each domain object is paired with exactly one range object: 5 only gets sent to 3, 6 only gets sent to 3, and 7 only gets sent to 4. Hence, the relation T is a function. The fact that the range object 3 is used twice does not matter. It’s the fact that each domain object gets sent to exactly one range object that matters. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4.

book7_5_1_3	no label	Mapping Diagram Notation Mapping Diagram Notation Mapping Diagram Notation The goal of this section is to introduce function notation. Let’s begin with the mapping diagram in Figure 5.8. f 1 2 2 4 3 6 4 8 Figure 5.8: Mapping diagram . The mapping diagram in Figure 5.8 reveals the following facts: • f maps 1 to 2 or f : 1→ 2. • f maps 2 to 4 or f : 2→ 4. 300 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS • f maps 3 to 6 or f : 3→ 6. • f maps 4 to 8 or f : 4→ 8. Note how the notation f : 4 → 8 correlates nicely with the mapping diagram in Figure 5.8. The notation f : 4 → 8 is read “f maps 4 to 8” or “f sends 4 to 8.” A closer look at the mapping diagram in Figure 5.8 reveals an interesting pattern. The “rule” seems to be that the relation f doubles each entry in its domain: twice 1 is 2, twice 2 is 4, twice 3 is 6, etc. It’s possible to give a general description of this “rule” by writing: f : x→ 2x (5.1) That is, f sends x to twice x, or equivalently, 2x. For example, we might ask “where does f send 15?” To answer this question, we would replace x with 15 in the rule (5.1) to get f : 15→ 2(15), or equivalently, f : 15→ 30. We could also ask “where does f send −7?” To answer this question, we would replace x with −7 in the rule (5.1) to get f : −7→ 2(−7), or equivalently, f : −7 → −14. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Given the rule f : x → 2x + 3, answer the question “whereGiven the rule f : x→ 3x− 5, answer the question “where does f send −2?” does f send 8?” Solution: To find where “f sends 8,” substitute 8 for x in the rule f : x → 2x+ 3 to get f : 8 → 2(8) + 3, or equivalently, f : 8 → 19. Answer: f : −2 → −11 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Given the rule f : x→ x/(x+3), answer the question “whereGiven the rule f : x→ 2x2 + 5x, answer the question “where does f send 3?” does f send −1?” 5.1. FUNCTIONS 301 Solution: To find where “f sends −1,” substitute −1 for x in the rule f : x→ x/(x+ 3) to get f : −1→ −1−1 + 3 or equivalently, f : −1→ −1 2 . Answer: f : 3 → 33 ! In Examples 7 and 8, note that each time you substitute a value for x in the given rule, you get a unique answer. This means that each object in the domain of f is sent to a unique object in the range of f , making the rules in Examples 7 and 8 functions. This leads us to an itemized description of a function. Rule of Three. A function consists of three parts: • a set of objects which mathematicians call the domain, • a second set of objects which mathematicians call the range, • and a rule that describes how to assign each object in the domain to exactly one object in the range. 
book7_5_1_4	no label	Function Notation Function Notation Function Notation Although the mapping diagram notation f : x→ 3− 4x is quite easy to understand, the standard function notation used is f(x) = 3− 4x. With mapping diagram notation, if we want to answer the question “where does f send 12?”, we write: f : x→ 3− 4x f : 12→ 3− 4(12) f : 12→ 3− 48 f : 12→ −45 Hence, f : 12 → −45; i.e., f sends 12 to −45. Function notation uses exactly the same concept; i.e, substitute 12 for x. 302 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Tips for Using Function Notation. 1. Replace all occurrences of variables in the notation with open parentheses. Leave room between the parentheses to substitute the given value of the variable. 2. Substitute the given values of variables in the open parentheses prepared in the first step. 3. Evaluate the resulting expression according to the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. Given f(x) = 3−4x, to evaluate f(12), first restate the function notation, then replace each occurrence of the variable with open parentheses. f(x) = 3− 4x Original function notation. f( ) = 3− 4( ) Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Now substitute 12 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. f(12) = 3− 4(12) Substitute 12 for x in the open parentheses positions. f(12) = 3− 48 Multiply. f(12) = −45 Subtract. Hence, f(12) = −45; i.e., f sends 12 to −45. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Given f(x) = 4− 5x− x2, evaluate f(−3). Solution: Start by replacing each occurrence of the variable x with open parentheses. f(x) = 4− 5x− x2 Original function notation. f( ) = 4− 5( )− ( )2 Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Figure 5.9: Calculator check. Now substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. f(−3) = 4− 5(−3)− (−3)2 Substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses positions. f(−3) = 4− 5(−3)− 9 Evaluate exponent: (−3)2 = 9. f(−3) = 4 + 15− 9 Multiply: −5(−3) = 15. f(−3) = 10 Simplify. Thus, f(−3) = 10. Check this on your calculator (see Figure 5.9). ! 5.1. FUNCTIONS 303 The next example demonstrates one of the advantages of function notation. For example, it is easy to refer to the function in which you want to substitute the given x-value. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10.

Solution: We’re given two function definitions, f and g, but we’re first asked to find f(−1). This means that we must replace each occurrence of x with −1 in the function f(x) = 5− x. f(x) = 5− x Original function notation. f( ) = 5− ( ) Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Now substitute −1 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. f(−1) = 5− (−1) Substitute −1 for x in the open parentheses position. = 5 + 1 Add the opposite. = 6 Simplify. Thus, f(−1) = 6. We’re next asked to find g(−2). This means that we must replace each occurrence of x with −2 in the function g(x) = x2 − 9. g(x) = x2 − 9 Original function notation. g( ) = ( )2 − 9 Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Now substitute −2 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. g(−2) = (−2)2 − 9 Substitute −2 for x in the open parentheses position. = 4− 9 Exponent first: (−2)2 = 4. = −5 Simplify. Thus, g(−2) = −5. Answer: f(−3) = 7 and g(2) = 10 !

For example, com- pare and contrast the following two examples. 304 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Question: Given y = 3x + 7, find y when x equals 5. Solution: Replace x with 5. y = 3x+ 7 y = 3(5) + 7 y = 15 + 7 y = 22 Question: Given f(x) = 3x + 7, evaluate f(5). Solution: Replace x with 5. f(x) = 3x+ 7 f(5) = 3(5) + 7 f(5) = 15 + 7 f(5) = 22 In each case, the answer is 22. However, in the first case, the answer y = 22 disguises the fact that an x-value of 5 was used to arrive at the result. On the other hand, when we use function notation, the final answer f(5) = 22 indicates that we used an x-value of 5 to determine that the y-value is 22. This is another advantage of function notation. Let’s look at one final application demonstrating that y and f(x) are inter- changeable. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Sketch the graph of f(x) = 2x− 3.Sketch the graph of f(x) = −2 3 x− 2. Solution: Because y and f(x) are interchangeable, the instruction is identical to “sketch the graph of y = 2x − 3.” The graph is a line, with slope 2 and y-intercept at (0,−3). Plot the y-intercept at (0,−3), then move up 2 and right 1 to create a line with slope 2 (see Figure 5.10).

book7_5_2	no label	5.2 Polynomials 5.2 Polynomials 5.2 Polynomials We begin with the definition of a term. Term. A term is either a single number (called a constant term) or the product of a number and one or more variables. For example, each of the following is a term. −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 Note how the first term is a single number, while the remaining terms are products of a number and one or more variables. For example, −3x2 is the product of −3, x, and x. Coefficient. When a term is a product of a number and one or more variables, the number is called the coefficient of the term. In the case of a term that is a single number, the number itself is called the coefficient. Thus, for example, the coefficients of the terms −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 are −5, −3, 12, and 13, respectively. Degree. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents on each variable of the term. A constant term (single number with no variables) has degree zero. Thus, for example, the degrees of the terms −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 are 0, 2, 5, and 6, respectively. In the last example, note that 13a2bc3 is equivalent to 13a2b1c3, so adding exponents, we get: Degree of 13a2bc3 = Degree of 13a2b1c3 = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 Monomial. The words monomial and term are equivalent. Thus, −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 are monomials. 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 309 Binomial. A binomial is a mathematical expression containing exactly two terms, separated by plus or minus signs. For example, each of the mathematical expressions 2x+ 3y − 3a2 − 3b2 xy + 7 − 3x2y + 5xy2 is a binomial. Each expression has exactly two terms. Trinomial. A trinomial is a mathematical expression containing exactly three terms, separated by plus or minus signs. For example, each of the mathematical expressions 2x2 + 3x+ 7 a2 + 2ab+ b2 x4 − 2x2y2 + 3y4 is a trinomial. Each expression has exactly three terms. A bicycle has two wheels, a binomial has two terms. A tricycle has three wheels, a trinomial has three terms. But once we get past three terms, the assignment of special names ceases and we use the generic word polynomial, which means “many terms.” Polynomial. A polynomial is a many-termed mathematical expression, with terms separated by plus or minus signs. The coefficients of a polynomial are the coefficients of its terms. Each of the previous expressions, 12y2z3 − 3a2 − 3b2 x4 − 2x2y2 + 3y4 though assigned the particular names monomial, binomial, and trinomial, re- spectively, are also “many-termed” expressions and can also be called polyno- mials. However, because the word polynomial means “many terms,” we can also use the word polynomial to describe mathematical expressions with more than three terms, such as: x4 − 4x3y + 6x2y2 − 4xy3 + y4 The coefficients of x4 − 4x3y + 6x2y2 − 4xy3 + y4 are 1, −4, 6, −4, and 1.

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify the following polynomial expression, arranging yourSimplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in ascending powers of x: 3x2−5x3+8x+9x2−7x+2x3 answer in descending powers of x. Once you’ve completed that task, make a second arrangement, ordering your terms in ascending powers of x. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x Solution: In order to arrange our answer in descending powers of x, we want to place the term with the highest power of x first and the term with the lowest power of x last. We use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup, then we combine like terms. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x = 2x3 + (−3x2 + 8x2) + (7x+ 11x+ 15x) + 11 = 2x3 + 5x2 + 33x+ 11 Note how the powers of x start at 3, then go down in order. To arrange our final answer in ascending powers of x, we put the lowest power of x first, then the highest power of x last, regrouping and combining like terms. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x = 11 + (7x+ 11x+ 15x) + (−3x2 + 8x2) + 2x3 = 11 + 33x+ 5x2 + 2x3 Note how we start with the constant term, then the powers of x increase in order.Answer: x+ 12x2 − 3x3 ! When we have a polynomial in a single variable, such as the polynomial in Example 1, arranging the terms in ascending or descending order is fairly straightforward. However, a polynomial in two or more variables is a bit more difficult, and sometimes impossible, to arrange in a decent order. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify the following polynomial expression, then arrangeSimplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in descending powers of x: −4x2y2 + 3xy3+ 6x3y − xy3 + 2x2y2 your answer in descending powers of x. x3 + 2xy2 − 6x2y + y3 − 3xy2 + 4x2y Solution: We’ll again use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup, putting the terms with the highest powers of x 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 311 first, then follow with terms containing lower powers of x in order. x3 + 2xy2 − 6x2y + y3 − 3xy2 + 4x2y = x3 + (−6x2y + 4x2y) + (2xy2 − 3xy2) + y3 = x3 − 2x2y − xy2 + y3 Note that this is a very natural order, the powers of x decrease while simulta- neously the powers of y increase. Answer: 6x3y − 2x2y2 + 2xy3 ! Not all examples will have nice ordering presented in Example 2, with the powers of one variable descending while the powers of the other variable simul- taneously ascends. Sometimes we have to make some very subjective choices on the ordering of terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify the following polynomial expression, then arrange Simplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in ascending powers of b: 5a3b2 + 4ab3 − 2a2b+ 3a3b2 − ab3 your answer in some sort of reasonable order. a3b3 + 2a2b− 3a2b3 + 4a3b3 + 5a4 + 3a2b+ b5 Solution: Let’s try to arrange the terms so that the powers of a descend. Again, we use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. a3b3 + 2a2b− 3a2b3 + 4a3b3 + 5a4 + 3a2b+ b5 = 5a4 + (a3b3 + 4a3b3) + (2a2b + 3a2b)− 3a2b3 + b5 = 5a4 + 5a3b3 + 5a2b− 3a2b3 + b5 Note that in our final arrangement, the powers of a descend, but the powers of b bounce up and down, but at least we have the powers of a descending. That should help us spot if we’ve missed a term while simplifying the given problem. Answer: −2a2b+ 8a3b2 + 3ab3 !

Solution: First, let’s arrange the polynomial in descending powers of x. 2x7 + x3 − 4x2 − 6x+ 5 Arranging the polynomial in descending powers of x makes it easier to see that the term of the polynomial with the highest degree is 2x7. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 7.Answer: 4 ! Finding the degree of a polynomial of more than one variable is a little bit trickier. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. What is the degree of the polynomial x4 − 2x3y7 + y5?What is the degree of the polynomial x2y4− 6x2y2 +5x2y5− 2xy? Solution: Note that the polynomial is already arranged in descending powers of x, an arrangement that is probably as good as we are going to get. In the following table, we list the degree of each term. Remember, the degree of any term is found by summing the exponents on its variables. Term Degree x4 4 −2x3y7 10 y5 5 Hence, the term with the highest degree is −2x3y7, making 10 the degree of the polynomial.Answer: 7 !

Figure 5.11: Calculator check. Next, substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. p(−3) = (−3)3 − 8(−3)− 11 Substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses positions. p(−3) = −27− 8(−3)− 11 Exponent first: (−3)3 = −27. p(−3) = −27 + 24− 11 Multiply: −8(−3) = 24. p(−3) = −14 Add.

In Figure 5.13, the leading term of the parabola p(x) = −2x2− 8x− 6 has negative two as its coefficient, so it opens downward. The sign of the leading term of p(x) = ax2 + bx+ c determines whether the parabola opens up or down. • If a > 0, the parabola opens upward. • If a < 0, the parabola opens downward. The turning point of a parabola has a special name. The vertex of a parabola. The graph of the second degree polynomial p(x) = ax2+bx+c has a single turning point, called the vertex of the parabola.

Solution: The degree of the polynomial p(x) = −3x2 + 12x + 25 is two, so it is a quadratic polynomial and its graph is a parabola.

We’re looking for the value of x that makes y = 0 or f(x) = 0. So, we’ll start with f(x) = 0, then replace f(x) with 1.5x+ 5.25. f(x) = 0 We want the value of x that makes the function equal to zero. 1.5x+ 5.25 = 0 Replace f(x) with 1.5x+ 5.25. Now we solve for x. 1.5x = −5.25 Subtract 5.25 from both sides. x = −5.25 1.5 Divide both sides by 1.5. x = −3.5 Divide: −5.25/1.5 = −3.5 Check.

Solution: In Example 2, the height of the projectile above the ground as a function of time is given by the equation y = 8 + 100t− 4.9t2. When the projectile returns to the ground, its height above ground will be zero meters.

Solution: First, replace f(x) and g(x) with their definitions. Be sure to surround each polynomial with parentheses, because we are asked to add all of f(x) to all of g(x). f(x) + g(x) = (3x2 − 4x− 8) + (x2 − 11x+ 15) Now use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. Combine like terms. = (3x2 + x2) + (−4x− 11x) + (−8 + 15) = 4x2 − 15x+ 7 Hence, f(x) + g(x) = 4x2 − 15x+ 7.Answer: x2 + 5x− 2 !

(x3 − 2x2y + 3xy2 + y3) + (2x3 − 4x2y − 8xy2 + 5y3) = (x3 + 2x3) + (−2x2y − 4x2y) + (3xy2 − 8xy2) + (y3 + 5y3) = 3x3 − 6x2y − 5xy2 + 6y3 However, if we can combine like terms mentally, eliminating the middle step, it is much more efficient to write: (x3 − 2x2y + 3xy2 + y3) + (2x3 − 4x2y − 8xy2 + 5y3) = 3x3 − 6x2y − 5xy2 + 6y3 Answer: −3a2b+ 11ab− 4ab2d !

First recall that negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. Negating. If a is any number, then −a = (−1)a. That is, negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. We can use this property to simplify −(a + b). First, negating is identical to multiplying by −1. Then we can distribute the −1. −(a+ b) = (−1)(a+ b) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. = (−1)a+ (−1)b Distribute the −1. = −a+ (−b) Simplify: (−1)a = −a and (−1)b = −b. = −a− b Subtraction means add the opposite. 336 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Thus, −(a + b) = −a − b. However, it is probably simpler to note that the minus sign in front of the parentheses simply changed the sign of each term inside the parentheses. Negating a sum. When negating a sum of terms, the effect of the minus sign is to change each term in the parentheses to the opposite sign. −(a+ b) = −a− b Let’s look at this principle in the next example.

Then distribute the −1. − (−3x2 + 4x− 8) = (−1)(−3x2 + 4x− 8) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. = (−1)(−3x2) + (−1)(4x)− (−1)(8) Distribute the −1. = 3x2 + (−4x)− (−8) Simplify: (−1)(−3x2) = 3x2, (−1)(4x) = −4x, and and (−1)(8) = −8. = 3x2 − 4x+ 8 Subtraction means add the opposite. Alternate solution: As we saw above, a negative sign in front of a parentheses simply changes the sign of each term inside the parentheses. So it is much more efficient to write −(−3x2 + 4x− 8) = 3x2 − 4x+ 8, simply changing the sign of each term inside the parentheses.Answer: −2x2 + 3x− 9 !

(y3 − 3y2z + 4yz2 + z3)− (2y3 − 8y2z + 2yz2 − 8z3) = y3 − 3y2z + 4yz2 + z3 − 2y3 + 8y2z − 2yz2 + 8z3 Regroup, combining like terms.

Solution: First, replace p(x) and q(x) with their definitions. Because we are asked to subtract all of q(x) from all of p(x), it is critical to surround each polynomial with parentheses. p(x) − q(x) = (−5x3 + 6x− 9)− (6x2 − 7x− 11) Distribute the minus sign, changing the sign of each term in the second poly- nomial, then regroup and combine like terms. = −5x3 + 6x− 9− 6x2 + 7x+ 11 = −5x3 − 6x2 + (6x+ 7x) + (−9 + 11) = −5x3 − 6x2 + 13x+ 2 However, after distributing the minus sign, if we can combine like terms men- tally, eliminating the middle step, it is much more efficient to write: p(x)− q(x) = (−5x3 + 6x− 9)− (6x2 − 7x− 11) = −5x3 + 6x− 9− 6x2 + 7x+ 11 = −5x3 − 6x2 + 13x+ 2 Answer: 8x2 + 5x+ 2 ! 338 CHAPTER 5.

Use your formula to determine Ginger’s profit if she sells 123 wicker baskets. Solution: The profit made from selling x wicker baskets is found by subtract- ing the costs incurred from the revenue received. In symbols: P (x) = R(x)− C(x) Next, replace R(x) and C(x) with their definitions. Because we are supposed to subtract all of the cost from the revenue, be sure to surround the cost polynomial with parentheses. P (x) = 2.75x− (100 + 3x− 0.02x2) Distribute the minus sign and combine like terms. = 2.75x− 100− 3x+ 0.02x2 = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100 Thus, the profit function is P (x) = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100. Next, to determine the profit if 123 wicker baskets are sold, substitute 123 for x in the profit function P (x).

Frequently, we’ll be required to multiply two exponential expressions with like bases, such as x3 · x4.

First, we have three x’s, then four x’s, for a total of seven x’s.

book7_5_6_3	no label	Multiplying Polynomials Multiplying Polynomials Multiplying Polynomials Now that we’ve learned how to take the product of two monomials or the product of a monomial and a polynomial, we can apply what we’ve learned to multiply two arbitrary polynomials. Before we begin with the examples, let’s revisit the distributive property. We know that 2 · (3 + 4) = 2 · 3 + 2 · 4. Both sides are equal to 14. We’re used to having the monomial factor on the left, but it can also appear on the right. (3 + 4) · 2 = 3 · 2 + 4 · 2 Again, both sides equal 14. So, whether the monomial appears on the left or right makes no difference; that is, a(b + c) = ab + ac and (b + c)a = ba + ca give the same result. In each case, you multiply a times both terms of b+ c. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Multiply: (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) Multiply: (3x+ 4)(5x+ 1) Solution: Note that (2x + 5)(3x + 2) has the form (b + c)a, where a is the binomial 3x+2. Because (b+ c)a = ba+ ca, we will multiply 3x+2 times both terms of 2x+ 5 in the following manner. (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) = 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) Now we distribute monomials times polynomials, then combine like terms. = 6x2 + 4x+ 15x+ 10 = 6x2 + 19x+ 10 Thus, (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) = 6x2 + 19x+ 10.

Because (b+ c)a = ba+ ca, we will multiply x2 +2x+7 times both terms of x+ 5 in the following manner. (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x(x2 + 2x+ 7) + 5(x2 + 2x+ 7) Now we distribute monomials times polynomials, then combine like terms. = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 = x3 + 7x2 + 17x+ 35 Thus, (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 7x2 + 17x+ 35.Answer: z3 +7z2 +21z+36 !

Note the first step of Example 9. (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x(x2 + 2x+ 7) + 5(x2 + 2x+ 7) Note that the first product on the right is the result of taking the product of the first term of x + 5 and x2 + 2x + 7. Similarly, the second product on the right is the result of taking the product of the second term of x + 5 and x2 + 2x+ 7. Next, let’s examine the result of the second step. (x + 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 The first three terms on the right are the result of multiplying x times x2+2x+7. (x + 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ · · · The second set of three terms on the right are the result of multiplying 5 times x2 + 2x+ 7. (x + 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = · · ·+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 These notes suggest an efficient shortcut.

Use the graphing calculator to determine the unit price a retailer should charge for gadgets so that her revenue from sales equals $12,000. where the demand is the number of widgets the public will buy and the unit price is the amount charged for a single widget. Suppose that the demand is given by the function x = 270− 0.75p, where x is the demand and p is the unit price. Note how the demand decreases as the unit price goes up (makes sense). Use the graphing calculator to determine the unit price a retailer should charge for widgets so that his revenue from sales equals $20,000. Solution: To determine the revenue (R), you multiply the number of widgets sold (x) by the unit price (p). R = xp (5.5) However, we know that the number of units sold is the demand, given by the formula x = 270− 0.75p (5.6) Substitute equation 5.6 into equation 5.5 to obtain the revenue as a function of the unit price.

book7_5_7_1	no label	The FOIL Method The FOIL Method The FOIL Method Consider the product of two binomials (x + 3)(x + 6). We already know how to find the product of these two binomials; we multiply x times both terms of x+ 6, then we multiply 3 times both terms of x+ 6. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) = x2 + 6x+ 3x+ 18 Normally we combine like terms, but we halt the process at this point so as to introduce the pattern called the FOIL method. The letters in the word FOIL stand for “First,” “Outer,” “Inner,” and “Last.” Let’s see how we can connect these terms to the product (x+3)(x+6). • The arrows indicate the terms in the “First” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “First” position, you get x2. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) F • The arrows indicate the terms in the “Outer” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “Outer” positions, you get 6x. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) O • The arrows indicate the terms in the “Inner” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “Inner” positions, you get 3x. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) I • The arrows indicate the terms in the “Last” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “Last” positions, you get 18. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) L 5.7.

Multiply the “Last” posi- tions: 28. F O I L (2x− 7)(x− 4) = 2x2 − 8x − 7x + 28 Combining like terms, (2x− 7)(x− 4) = 2x2 − 15x+ 28. Answer: 4x2 + x− 5 ! At first glance, the FOIL method doesn’t look like much of a shortcut. After all, if we simply use the distributive property on the product of Example 2, we get the same quick result. (2x− 7)(x− 4) = 2x(x− 4)− 7(x− 4) = 2x2 − 8x− 7x+ 28 = 2x2 − 15x+ 28 The FOIL method becomes a true shortcut when we add the “Outer” and “Inner” results in our head. 372 CHAPTER 5.

book7_5_7_2	no label	The Difference of Squares The Difference of Squares The Difference of Squares We can use the FOIL shortcut to multiply (a+ b)(a− b). 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: a2 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and add the results mentally: ab− ab = 0 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −b2 Thus, (a + b)(a − b) = a2 − b2. Note how the right-hand side a2 − b2 is the difference of two squares. This leads to the following shortcut. The difference of squares. If you have identical terms in the “First” po- sitions and identical terms in the “Last” positions, but one set is separated with a plus sign while the other is separated by a minus sign, then proceed as follows: 1. Square the “First” term. 2. Square the “Last” term. 3.

For example, (x+3)(x− 3) is an example of the difference of squares pattern, but (2y + 3)(2y − 5) is not. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5.

book7_5_7_3	no label	Squaring a Binomial Squaring a Binomial Squaring a Binomial Before demonstrating the correct procedure for squaring a binomial, we will first share one of the most common mistakes made in algebra. Warning! This is incorrect! One of the most common mistakes made in algebra is the assumption that: (a+ b)2 = a2 + b2 The fact that this is incorrect is easily checked. Substitute 3 for a and 4 for b. (3 + 4)2 = 32 + 42 72 = 32 + 42 49 = 9 + 16 Clearly this is incorrect! So what is the correct answer? First, (a+ b)2 = (a+ b)(a+ b). We can now use the FOIL shortcut. 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: a2 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and add the results mentally: ab+ ab = 2ab 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: b2 Hence, the correct answer is (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2. This leads us to the following shortcut for squaring a binomial. 376 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Squaring a binomial. To square a binomial, such as (a + b)2, perform the following steps: 1. Square the “First” term: a2 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2ab 3. Square the “Last” term: b2 That is: (a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2 You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (x+ 5)2Simplify: (x + 3)2 Solution: Follow these steps: 1. Square the first term: x2 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2(x)(5) = 10x 3. Square the “Last” term: 52 = 25 Thus: (x+ 5)2 = x2 + 2(x)(5) + (5)2 = x2 + 10x+ 25 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (x+ 5)2 = x2 + 10x+ 25.Answer: x2 + 6x+ 9 ! Comment. Students often refuse to learn the “squaring a binomial” shortcut, noting that they can just as easily use the FOIL technique or a simple appli- cation of the distributive property to arrive at the same result. Unfortunately, failure to learn the “squaring a binomial” shortcut will severely handicap stu- dents, as this pattern is an important component of many procedures in future mathematics courses. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (3x+ 7y)2Simplify: (2y + 3z)2 Solution: Follow these steps: 5.7. SPECIAL PRODUCTS 377 1. Square the first term: (3x)2 = 9x2 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2(3x)(7y) = 42xy 3. Square the “Last” term: (7y)2 = 49y2 Thus: (3x+ 7y)2 = (3x)2 + 2(3x)(7y) + (7y)2 = 9x2 + 42xy + 49y2 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (3x+ 7y)2 = 9x2 + 42xy + 49y2. Answer: 4y2 + 12yz + 9z2 ! In the next example, when squaring a binomial with a minus sign, we take care of the minus sign by “adding the opposite.” You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (4a2−5b3)2 Simplify: (3x4 − 5z2)2 Solution: Add the opposite: (4a2−5b3)2 = (4a2+(−5b3))2. Now follow these steps: 1. Square the first term: (4a2)2 = 16a4 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2(4a2)(−5b3) = −40a2b3 3. Square the “Last” term: (−5b3)2 = 25b6 Thus: (4a2 − 5b3)2 = (4a2 + (−5b3))2 = (4a2)2 + 2(4a2)(−5b3) + (−5b3)2 = 16a4 − 40a2b3 + 25b6 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (4a2 − 5b3)2 = 16a4 − 40a2b3 + 25b6. Answer: 9x8 − 30x4z2 + 25z4 ! Example 10 shows us that if we are squaring a difference, the middle term will be minus. That is, the only difference between (a+ b)2 and (a− b)2 is the sign of the middle term. 378 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Squaring a binomial. The shortcuts for squaring a binomial are: (a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2 (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2 You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (x3− y3)2Simplify: (a2 − 3b5)2 Solution: Use the pattern (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2. Square the “First” term, multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result, then square the “Last” term. Because of the minus sign, the middle term will be minus, but all other terms are plus. (x3 − y3)2 = (x3)2 − 2(x3)(y3) + (y3)2 = x6 − 2x3y3 + y6 Answer: a4 − 6a2b5 + 9b10 !

book7_6	no label	6 Factoring 6 Factoring 6 Factoring The ancient Babylonians left the earliest evidence of the use of quadratic equa- tions on clay tablets dating back to 1800 BC. They understood how the area of a square changes with the length of its side. For example, they knew it was possible to store nine times more bales of hay in a square loft if the side of the loft was tripled in length. However, they did not know how to calculate the length of the side of a square starting from a given area. The word “quadratic” comes from “quadratus,” the Latin word for “square.” In this chapter, we will learn how to solve certain quadratic equations by factoring polynomials. 385 386 CHAPTER 6.

book7_6_1	no label	6.1 The Greatest Common Factor 6.1 The Greatest Common Factor 6.1 The Greatest Common Factor We begin this section with definitions of factors and divisors. Because 24 = 2 · 12, both 2 and 12 are factors of 24. However, note that 2 is also a divisor of 24, because when you divide 24 by 2 you get 12, with a remainder of zero. Similarly, 12 is also a divisor of 24, because when you divide 24 by 12 you get 2, with a remainder of zero. Factors and divisors. Suppose m and n are integers. Then m is a divisor (factor) of n if and only if there exists another integer k so that n = m · k. The words divisor and factor are equivalent. They have the same meaning. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. List the positive divisors (factors) of 24.List the positive divisors of 18. Solution: First, list all possible ways that we can express 24 as a product of two positive integers: 24 = 1 · 24 or 24 = 2 · 12 or 24 = 3 · 8 or 24 = 4 · 6 Therefore, the positive divisors (factors) of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24.Answer: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18 !

Divisors of 36 are: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9, 12 , 18, 36 Divisors of 48 are: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8, 12 , 16, 24, 48 Therefore, the common positive divisors (factors) of 36 and 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.Answer: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20 ! 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 387 Greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor (factor) of a and b is the largest positive number that divides evenly (no remainder) both a and b. The greatest common divisor of a and b is denoted by the symbolism GCD(a, b). We will also use the abbreviation GCF(a, b) to represents the greatest common factor of a and b. Remember, greatest common divisor and greatest common factor have the same meaning. In Example 2, we listed the common positive divisors of 36 and 48. The largest of these common divisors was 12. Hence, the greatest common divisor (factor) of 36 and 48 is 12, written GCD(36, 48) = 12. With smaller numbers, it is usually easy to identify the greatest common divisor (factor). You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. State the greatest common divisor (factor) of each of the State the greatest common divisor of 36 and 60.following pairs of numbers: (a) 18 and 24, (b) 30 and 40, and (c) 16 and 24. Solution: In each case, we must find the largest possible positive integer that divides evenly into both the given numbers. a) The largest positive integer that divides evenly into both 18 and 24 is 6. Thus, GCD(18, 24) = 6. b) The largest positive integer that divides evenly into both 30 and 40 is 10. Thus, GCD(30, 40) = 10. c) The largest positive integer that divides evenly into both 16 and 24 is 8. Thus, GCD(16, 24) = 8. Answer: 12 ! With larger numbers, it is harder to identify the greatest common divisor (factor). However, prime factorization will save the day! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Find the greatest common divisor (factor) of 360 and 756. Find the greatest common divisor of 120 and 450. Solution: Prime factor 360 and 756, writing your answer in exponential form. 388 CHAPTER 6.

In this case, the factors 2 and 3 appear in common, with 22 being the high- est power of 2 and 32 being the highest power of 3 that appear in common. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 360 and 756 is: GCD(360, 756) = 22 · 32 = 4 · 9 = 36 Therefore, the greatest common divisor (factor) is GCD(360, 756) = 36. Note what happens when we write each of the given numbers as a product of the greatest common factor and a second factor: 360 = 36 · 10 756 = 36 · 21 In each case, note how the second second factors (10 and 21) contain no addi- tional common factors.Answer: 30 !

Find the greatest common factor (divisor) of the coefficients of the given monomials. Use prime factorization if necessary. 2. List each variable that appears in common in the given monomials. 3. Raise each variable that appears in common to the highest power that appears in common among the given monomials. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Find the greatest common factor of 6x3y3 and 9x2y5. Find the greatest common factor of 16xy3 and 12x4y2. Solution: To find the GCF of 6x3y3 and 9x2y5, we note that: 1. The greatest common factor (divisor) of 6 and 9 is 3. 2. The monomials 6x3y3 and 9x2y5 have the variables x and y in common. 3. The highest power of x in common is x2. The highest power of y in common is y3. Thus, the greatest common factor is GCF(6x3y3, 9x2y5) = 3x2y3. Note what happens when we write each of the given monomials as a product of the greatest common factor and a second monomial: 6x3y3 = 3x2y3 · 2x 9x2y5 = 3x2y3 · 3y Observe that the set of second monomial factors (2x and 3y) contain no addi- tional common factors.

book7_6_1_2	no label	Factor Out the GCF Factor Out the GCF Factor Out the GCF In Chapter 5, we multiplied a monomial and polynomial by distributing the monomial times each term in the polynomial. 2x(3x2 + 4x− 7) = 2x · 3x2 + 2x · 4x− 2x · 7 = 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x In this section we reverse that multiplication process. We present you with the final product and ask you to bring back the original multiplication problem. In the case 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x, the greatest common factor of 6x3, 8x2, and 14x is 2x. We then use the distributive property to factor out 2x from each term of the polynomial. 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x = 2x · 3x2 + 2x · 4x− 2x · 7 = 2x(3x2 + 4x− 7) Factoring. Factoring is “unmultiplying.” You are given the product, then asked to find the original multiplication problem. First rule of factoring. If the terms of the given polynomial have a greatest common factor (GCF), then factor out the GCF. Let’s look at a few examples that factor out the GCF. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7.

Distribute the 2. 2(3x2 + 5x+ 7) = 2 · 3x2 + 2 · 5x+ 2 · 7 = 6x2 + 10x+ 14 That’s the original polynomial, so we factored correctly. Answer: 3(3y2 − 5y + 4) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8.

You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Factor each of the following polynomials: (a) 24x+ 32,Factor: 18p5q4 − 30p4q5 + 42p3q6 (b) 5x3 − 10x2 − 10x, and (c) 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3. Solution: In each case, factor out the greatest common factor (GCF): a) The GCF of 24x and 32 is 8. Thus, 24x+ 32 = 8(3x+ 4) b) The GCF of 5x3, 10x2, and 10x is 5x. Thus: 5x3 − 10x2 − 10x = 5x(x2 − 2x− 2) c) The GCF of 2x4y, 2x3y2, and 6x2y3 is 2x2y. Thus: 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3 = 2x2y(x2 + xy − 3y2) As you speed things up by mentally factoring out the GCF, it is even more important that you check your results. The check can also be done mentally. For example, in checking the third result, mentally distribute 2x2y times each term of x2 +xy− 3y2. Multiplying 2x2y times the first term x2 produces 2x4y, the first term in the original polynomial. 2x2y (x2 + xy − 3y2) = 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3 Continue in this manner, mentally checking the product of 2x2y with each term of x2 + xy − 3y2, making sure that each result agrees with the corresponding term of the original polynomial.Answer: 6p3q4(3p2 − 5pq + 7q2) ! Remember that the distributive property allows us to pull the GCF out in front of the expression or to pull it out in back. In symbols: ab+ ac = a(b + c) or ba+ ca = (b+ c)a 6.1.

Then we “group” the third and fourth terms, noting that we can factor 3 out of both of these terms. x2 + 8x+ 3x+ 24 = x (x + 8) + 3 (x+ 8) Now we can factor x+ 8 out of both of these terms. = (x + 3)(x+ 8) Answer: (x+ 2)(x− 6) !

Then we “group” the third and fourth terms, then try to factor a 7 out of both these terms. x2 + 4x− 7x− 28 = x (x + 4) + 7 (−x− 4) This does not lead to a common factor. Let’s try again, this time factoring a −7 out of the third and fourth terms. x2 + 4x− 7x− 28 = x (x + 4)− 7 (x+ 4) That worked!

Factor by grouping: 6x2 − 8x+ 9x− 12 Factor by grouping: 15x2 + 9x+ 10x+ 6 Solution: Note that we can factor 2x out of the first two terms and 3 out of the second two terms. 6x2 − 8x+ 9x− 12 = 2x (3x− 4) + 3 (3x− 4) Now we have a common factor 3x− 4 which we can factor out. = (2x+ 3)(3x− 4) Answer: (3x+ 2)(5x+ 3) ! As the numbers get larger and larger, you need to factor out the GCF from each grouping. If not, you won’t get a common factor to finish the factoring. You Try It! EXAMPLE 16. Factor by grouping: 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 Factor by grouping: 36x2 − 84x+ 15x− 35 Solution: Suppose that we factor 8x out of the first two terms and −5 out of the second two terms. 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 = 8x (3x− 4)− 5 (9x− 12) That did not work, as we don’t have a common factor to complete the factoring process. However, note that we can still factor out a 3 from 9x− 12. As we’ve already factored out a 5, and now we see can factor out an additional 3, this means that we should have factored out 3 times 5, or 15, to begin with. Let’s start again, only this time we’ll factor 15 out of the second two terms. 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 = 8x (3x− 4)− 15 (3x− 4) Beautiful! We can now factor out 3x− 4. = (8x− 15)(3x− 4) Answer: (12x+ 5)(3x− 7) ! 396 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING ! ! ! 
book7_6_2	no label	6.2 Solving Nonlinear Equations 6.2 Solving Nonlinear Equations 6.2 Solving Nonlinear Equations We begin by introducing a property that will be used extensively in this and future sections. The zero product property. If the product of two or more numbers equals zero, then at least one of the numbers must equal zero. That is, if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0. Let’s use the zero product property to solve a few equations. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: (x + 3)(x− 5) = 0 Solve for x: (x − 7)(x− 2) = 0 Solution: The product of two factors equals zero. (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0 Hence, at least one of the factors must equal zero. Using the zero product property, set each factor equal to zero, then solve the resulting equations for x. x+ 3 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 x = −3 x = 5 Hence, the solutions are x = −3 and x = 5 Check: Check that each solution satisfies the original equation. Substitute −3 for x: (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0 (−3 + 3)(−3− 5) = 0 (0)(−8) = 0 0 = 0 Substitute 5 for x: (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0 (5 + 3)(5− 5) = 0 (8)(0) = 0 0 = 0 Because each check produces a true statement, both x = −3 and x = 5 are solutions of (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0. Answer: 7, 2 ! The zero product property also works equally well if more than two factors are present. For example, if abc = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0 or c = 0. Let’s use this idea in the next example. 400 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve for x: x(2x+ 9)(3x− 5) = 0Solve for x: 6x(x+ 4)(5x+ 1) = 0 Solution: The product of three factors equals zero. x(2x+ 9)(3x− 5) = 0 Using the zero product property, set each factor equal to zero, then solve the resulting equations for x. x = 0 or 2x+ 9 = 0 or 3x− 5 = 0 2x = −9 3x = 5 x = −9 2 x = 5 3 Hence, the solutions are x = 0, x = −9/2, and x = 5/3. We encourage the reader to check the solution.Answer: 0, −4, −1/5 ! 
book7_6_2_1	no label	Linear versus Nonlinear Linear versus Nonlinear Linear versus Nonlinear All of the equations solved in previous chapters were examples of what are called linear equations. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is one, then the graphs involved are lines. Hence the term, linear equation. However, if the power on the variable we are solving for exceeds one, then the graphs involved are curves. Hence the term, nonlinear equation. In this chapter we will learn how to solve nonlinear equations involving polynomials. However, let’s first make sure we can recognize the difference between a linear and a nonlinear equation. Linear versus Nonlinear. Use the following conditions to determine if an equation is linear or nonlinear. 1. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is one, then the equation is linear. 2. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is larger than one, then the equation is nonlinear. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. If the instruction is “solve for x,” classify each of the followingClassify the following equation as linear or nonlinear: 2x = x3 − 4 equations as linear or nonlinear. 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 401 a) 3x− 5 = 4− 7x b) x2 = 8x Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x,” to determine whether the equation is linear or nonlinear, we identify the largest power of x present in the equation. a) The highest power of x present in the equation 3x − 5 = 4 − 7x is one. Hence, this equation is linear. b) The equation x2 = 8x contains a power of x higher than one (it contains an x2). Hence, this equation is nonlinear. Answer: nonlinear ! Now that we can classify equations as either linear or nonlinear, let’s in- troduce strategies for solving each type, the first of which should already be familiar. Strategy for solving a linear equation. If an equation is linear, start the solution process by moving all terms containing the variable you are solving for to one side of the equation, then move all terms that do not contain the variable you are solving for to the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve for x: 3x− 5 = 4− 7x Solve for x: 2x+ 4 = 6x+ 3 Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x” and we note that the largest power of x present is one, the equation 3x − 5 = 4 − 7x is linear. Hence, the strategy is to move all terms containing x to one side of the equation, then move all the remaining terms to the other side of the equation. 3x− 5 = 4− 7x Original equation. 3x− 5 + 7x = 4 Add 7x to both sides. 3x+ 7x = 4 + 5 Add 5 to both sides. Note how we have succeeded in moving all terms containing x to one side of the equation and all terms that do not contain x to the other side of the equation. 10x = 9 Simplify both sides. x = 9 10 Divide both sides by 10. Hence, the solution of 3x− 5 = 4− 7x is x = 9/10. Readers are encouraged to check this solution. Answer: 1/4 ! 402 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING The situation is much different when the equation is nonlinear. Strategy for solving a nonlinear equation. If an equation is nonlinear, first move everything to one side of the equation, making one side of the equa- tion equal to zero. Continue the solution process by factoring and applying the zero product property. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve for x: x2 = 8xSolve for x: x2 = −5x Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x,” and the highest power of x is larger than one, the equation x2 = 8x is nonlinear. Hence, the strategy requires that we move all terms to one side of the equation, making one side zero. x2 = 8x Original equation. x2 − 8x = 0 Subtract 8x from both sides. Note how we have succeeded in moving all terms to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. To finish the solution, we factor out the GCF on the left-hand side. x(x − 8) = 0 Factor out the GCF. Note that we now have a product of two factors that equals zero. By the zero product property, either the first factor is zero or the second factor is zero. x = 0 or x− 8 = 0 x = 8 Hence, the solutions are x = 0 and x = 8. Check: Check that each solution satisfies the original equation. Substitute 0 for x: x2 = 8x (0)2 = 8(0) 0 = 0 Subtitute 8 for x: x2 = 8x (8)2 = 8(8) 64 = 64 Note that both results are true statements, guaranteeing that both x = 0 and x = 8 are solutions of x2 = 8x.Answer: 0, −5 ! 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 403 Warning! The following is incorrect! Consider what would happen if we divided both sides of the equation x2 = 8x in Example 5 by x: x2 = 8x x2 x = 8x x x = 8 Note that we have lost the second answer found in Example 5, x = 0. This example demonstrates that you should never divide by the variable you are solving for! If you do, and cancellation occurs, you will lose answers. Let’s try solving a nonlinear equation that requires factoring by grouping. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 = 0 Solve for x: 5x2 − 20x− 4x+ 16 = 0Solution: Because we are solving for x and there is a power of x larger than one, this equation is nonlinear. Hence, the first step is to move everything to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. Well that’s already done, so let’s factor the left-hand side by grouping. Note that we can factor 3x out of the first two terms and −4 out of the second two terms. 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 = 0 3x (2x+ 3)− 4 (2x+ 3) = 0 Factor out the common factor 2x+ 3. (3x− 4)(2x+ 3) = 0 We now have a product of two factors that equals zero. Use the zero product property to write: 3x− 4 = 0 or 2x+ 3 = 0 3x = 4 2x = −3 x = 4 3 x = −3 2 Hence, the solutions are x = 4/3 and x = −3/2. Check. Let’s use the graphing calculator to check the solution x = 4/3. First, store the solution 4/3 in the variable X using the following keystrokes (see the first image in Figure 6.1. 404 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 4 ÷ 3 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER Next, enter the left-hand side of the equation 6x2 +9x− 8x− 12 = 0 using the following keystrokes. Note that the result in the second image in Figure 6.1 indicates that the expression 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 equals zero when x = 4/3. 6 × X,T,θ,n ∧ 2 + 9 × X,T,θ,n − 8 × X,T,θ,n − 1 2 ENTER Figure 6.1: Checking the solution x = 4/3. Therefore, the solution x = 4/3 checks. Readers are encouraged to use their graphing calculators to check the second solution, x = −3/2.Answer: 4/5, 4 ! 
book7_6_2_2	no label	Using the Graphing Calculator Using the Graphing Calculator Using the Graphing Calculator In this section we will employ two different calculator routines to find the solution of a nonlinear equation. Before picking up the calculator, let’s first use an algebraic method to solve the equation x2 = −5x. The equation is nonlinear, so the first step is to move everything to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. x2 = −5x Nonlinear. Make one side zero. x2 + 5x = 0 Add 5x to both sides. x(x+ 5) = 0 Factor out the GCF. Use the zero product property, setting each factor equal to zero, then solving the resulting equations for x. x = 0 or x+ 5 = 0 x = −5 Hence, the solutions are x = 0 and x = −5. 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 405 We’ll now use the calculator to find the solutions of x2 = −5x. The first technique employs the 5:intersect routine on the calculator’s CALC menu. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Use the 5:intersect utility on the graphing calculator to Use the 5:intersect utility on the graphing calculator to solve the equation x2 = 4x for x. solve the equation x2 = −5x for x. Solution: Load the left-hand side of x2 = −5x in Y1 and the right-hand side in Y2 (see Figure 6.2). Selecting 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu produces the graphs shown in the image on the right in Figure 6.2. Figure 6.2: Sketch the graphs of each side of the equation x2 = −5x. Note that the graph of y = x2 is a parabola that opens upward, with vertex (turning point) at the origin. This graph reveals why the equation x2 = −5x is called a nonlinear equation (not all the graphs involved are lines). Next, the graph of y = −5x is a line with slope −5 and y-intercept at the origin. The two graphs obviously intersect at the origin, but it also appears that there may be another point of intersection that is off the screen. Let’s increase Ymax in an attempt to reveal the second point of intersection. After some experimentation, the settings shown in the first image in Figure 6.3 reveal both points of intersection. Pushing the GRAPH button produces the image on the right in Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Adjust the WINDOW parameters to reveal both points of inter- section. To find the solutions of the equation x2 = −5x, we must find the coordinates of the points where the graphs of y = x2 and y = −5x intersect. The x- coordinate of each point of intersection will be a solution of the equation x2 = −5x. 406 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING • Start by selecting 5:intersect from the CALC menu. When prompted for the “First curve?”, press ENTER. When prompted for the “Second curve?”, press ENTER. When prompted for a “Guess,” press ENTER.

When prompted for the “First curve?”, press ENTER. When prompted for the “Second curve?”, press ENTER. When prompted for a “Guess,” use the left-arrow key to move the cursor closer to the leftmost point of intersection, then press ENTER. The result is the point (−5, 25) shown in the image on the right in Figure 6.4. Figure 6.4: Use the 5:intersect utility to find the points of intersection.

Shade and label the x-values of the points where the dashed vertical line crosses the x-axis. These are the solutions of the equation x2 = −5x (see Figure 6.5). Hence, the solutions of x2 = −5x are x = −5 and x = 0. Note now these match the solutions found using the algebraic technique. Answer: ! Before demonstrating a second graphing calculator technique for solving nonlinear equations, let’s take a moment to recall the definition of a zero of a function, which was first presented in Chapter 5, Section 3. Zeros and x-intercepts. The points where the graph of f crosses the x-axis are called the x-intercepts of the graph of f . The x-value of each x-intercept is called a zero of the function f . 6.2.

Use the 2:zero utility on the graphing calculator to solve Use the 2:zero utility on the graphing calculator to solve the equation x2 = 4x for x. the equation x2 = −5x for x. Solution: First, make one side of the equation equal to zero. x2 = −5x Make one side zero. x2 + 5x = 0 Add 5x to both sides. To determine the values of x that make x2 +5x = 0, we must locate the points where the graph of f(x) = x2 + 5x crosses the x-axis. These points are the x-intercepts of the graph of f and the x-values of these points are the zeros of the function f . Load the function f(x) = x2 + 5x in Y1, then select 6:ZStandard to It’s often easier to find the so- lutions of a nonlinear equa- tion by making one side zero and identifying where the graph of the resulting func- tion crosses the x-axis. produce the image in Figure 6.6.

Figure 6.7: Setting the left and right bounds when using the 2:zero utility to find the x-intercepts of the graph of f(x) = x2 + 5x. • The calculator responds by asking for a “Guess?” Note the two triangular marks near the top of the viewing window in the first image in Figure 6.8 that mark the left- and right-bounds. As long as you place the cursor so that the x-value of the cursor location lies between these two marks, you’ve made a valid guess. Because the cursor already lies between these two marks, we usually leave it where it is and press the ENTER key. Figure 6.8: Setting the right bound and making a guess. After making your guess and pressing the ENTER key, the calculator pro- ceeds to find an approximation of the x-intercept that lies between the left- and right-bounds previously marked (see the second image in Figure 6.8). Hence, this x-intercept is (−5, 0), making −5 a zero of f(x) = x2 + 5x and a solution of the equation x2 + 5x = 0. We’ll leave it to our readers to repeat the 2:zero process to find the second zero at the origin.

FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A = 1 413 6.3 Factoring ax2 + bx + c when a = 1 In this section we concentrate on learning how to factor trinomials having the form ax2 + bx+ c when a = 1. The first task is to make sure that everyone can properly identify the coefficients a, b, and c. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Compare x2− 8x− 9 with the form ax2 + bx+ c and identify Compare 2x2 + 5x− 3 with the form ax2 + bx+ c and identify the coefficients a, b, and c. the coefficients a, b, and c. Solution: Align the trinomial x2−8x−9 with the standard form ax2+bx+c, then compare coefficients. Note that the understood coefficient of x2 is 1. ax2 + bx+c 1x2 − 8x−9 We see that a = 1, b = −8, and c = −9. Because the leading coefficient is 1, this is the type of trinomial that we will learn how to factor in this section. Answer: a = 2, b = 5, c = −3 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Compare −40 + 6x2 − x with the form ax2 + bx + c and Compare 3x+ 9− 7x2 with the form ax2 + bx+ c and identify the coefficients a, b, and c. identify the coefficients a, b, and c. Solution: First, arrange −40 + 6x2 − x in descending powers of x, then align it with the standard form ax2 + bx+ c and compare coefficients. Note that the understood coefficient of x is −1. ax2 + bx + c 6x2 − 1x− 40 We see that a = 6, b = −1, and c = −40. Because the leading coefficient is 6, we will have to wait until Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427 before learning how to factor this trinomial. Answer: a = −7, b = 3, c = 9 ! In this section, the leading coefficient must equal 1. Our work in this section will focus only on trinomials of the form x2 + bx+ c, that is, the form ax2 + bx+ c where a = 1. 
book7_6_3_1	no label	The ac-Method The ac-Method The ac-Method We are now going to introduce a technique called the ac-method (or ac-test) for factoring trinomials of the form ax2 + bx+ c when a = 1. In the upcoming 414 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING section Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427, we will see that this method can also be employed when a != 1, with one minor exception. But for the remainder of this section, we focus strictly on trinomials whose leading coefficient is 1. Let’s begin by finding the following product: (x+ 12)(x− 4) = x(x− 4) + 12(x− 4) Apply the distributive property. = x2 − 4x+ 12x− 48 Distribute again. = x2 + 8x− 48 Simplify. Now, can we reverse the process? That is, can we start with x2 + 8x− 48 and place it in its original factored form (x+ 12)(x− 4) ? The answer is yes, if we apply the following procedure. The ac-method. Compare the given polynomial with the standard form ax2 + bx+ c, determine the coefficients a, b, and c, then proceed as follows: 1. Multiply the coefficients a and c and determine their product ac. List all the integer pairs whose product equals ac. 2. Circle the pair in the list produced in step 1 whose sum equals b, the coef- ficient of the middle term of ax2 + bx+ c. 3. Replace the middle term bx with a sum of like terms using the circled pair from step 2. 4. Factor by grouping. 5. Check the result using the FOIL shortcut. Let’s follow the steps of the ac-method to factor x2 + 8x− 48. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor: x2 + 8x− 48.Factor: x2 + 11x+ 28 Solution: Compare x2+8x−48 with ax2+bx+c and identify a = 1, b = 8, and c = −48. Note that the leading coefficient is a = 1. Calculate ac. Note that ac = (1)(−48), so ac = −48. List all integer pairs whose product is ac = −48. 1,−48 −1, 48 2,−24 −2, 24 3,−16 −3, 16 4,−12 −4, 12 6,−8 −6, 8 6.3. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A = 1 415 Circle the ordered pair whose sum is b = 8. 1,−48 −1, 48 2,−24 −2, 24 3,−16 −3, 16 4,−12 −4, 12 6,−8 −6, 8 Replace the middle term 8x with a sum of like terms using the circled pair whose sum is 8. x2+8x− 48 = x2−4x+ 12x− 48 Factor by grouping. x2 + 8x− 48 = x(x − 4) + 12(x− 4) = (x+ 12)(x− 4) Use the FOIL shortcut to mentally check your answer. To determine the prod- uct (x+ 12)(x− 4), use these steps: • Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: x2. • Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and combine the results mentally: −4x+ 12x = 8x. • Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −48. That is: F O I L (x+ 12)(x− 4) = x2 − 4x + 12x − 48 Combining like terms, (x + 12)(x − 4) = x2 + 8x − 48, which is the original trinomial, so our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x + 4)(x+ 7) ! Some readers might ask “Is it a coincidence that the circled pair −4, 12 seemed to ‘drop in place’ in the resulting factoriztion (x+12)(x− 4)?” Before we answer that question, let’s try another example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor: x2 − 9x− 36. Factor: x2 + 10x− 24 Solution: Compare x2−9x−36 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −9, and c = −36. Calculate ac = (1)(−36), so ac = −36. At this point, some readers might ask “What if I start listing the ordered pairs and I see the pair I need? Do I need to continue listing the remaining pairs? 416 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING The answer is “No.” In this case, we start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = −36, but are mindful that we need an integer pair whose sum is b = −9. The integer pair 3 and −12 has a product equaling ac = −36 and a sum equaling b = −9. 1,−36 2,−18 3,−12 Note how we ceased listing ordered pairs the moment we found the pair we needed. Next, replace the middle term −9x with a sum of like terms using the circled pair. x2−9x− 36 = x2+3x− 12x− 36 Factor by grouping. x2−9x− 36 = x(x+ 3)− 12(x+ 3) = (x− 12)(x+ 3) Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x + 3)(x− 12) = x2 − 12x + 3x − 36 Combining like terms, (x + 3)(x − 12) = x2 − 9x − 36, the original trinomial. Our solution checks.Answer: (x+ 12)(x− 2) !

Provided the leading coefficient of the trinomial ax2 + bx+ c is a = 1, you can always “drop in place” the circled pair in order to arrive at the final factorization, skipping the factoring by grouping. Some readers might also be asking “Do I really have to list any of those ordered pairs if I already recognize the pair I need?” The answer is “No!” If you see the pair you need, drop it in place. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Factor: x2 − 5x− 24.Factor: x2 − 12x+ 35 Solution: Compare x2−5x−24 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −5, and c = −24. Calculate ac = (1)(−24), so ac = −24. Now can you think of an integer pair whose product is ac = −24 and whose sum is b = −5? For some, the required pair just pops into their head: −8 and 3. The product of these 6.3.

F O I L (x− 8)(x+ 3) = x2 + 3x − 8x − 24 Combining like terms, (x − 8)(x + 3) = x2 − 5x − 24, the original trinomial. Our solution checks. Answer: (x − 7)(x− 5) ! The “Drop in Place” technique of Example 5 allows us to revise the ac- method a bit. Revised ac-method. Compare the given polynomial with the standard form ax2 + bx + c, determine the coefficients a, b, and c, then determine a pair of integers whose product equals ac and whose sum equals b. You then have two options: 1. Write the middle term as a product of like terms using the ordered pair whose product is ac and whose sum is b. Complete the factorization process by factoring by grouping. 2. (Only works if a = 1.) Simply “drop in place” the ordered pair whose product is ac and whose sum is b to complete the factorization process. Note: We’ll see in Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427 why this “drop in place” choice does not work when a != 1. Readers are strongly encouraged to check their factorization by determining the product using the FOIL method. If this produces the original trinomial, the factorization is correct.

FACTORING Solution: Because there is a power of x larger than one, the equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. x2 = 2x+ 3 Original equation. x2 − 2x = 3 Subtract 2x from both sides. x2 − 2x− 3 = 0 Subtract 3 from both sides. Compare x2−2x−3 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −2 and c = −3. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −3 and whose sum is b = −2. The integer pair 1 and −3 comes to mind. “Drop” these in place to factor. (x+ 1)(x− 3) = 0 Factor. We have a product that equals zero. Use the zero product property to complete the solution. x+ 1 = 0 or x− 3 = 0 x = −1 x = 3 Thus, the solutions of x2 = 2x+ 3 are x = −1 and x = 3. Graphical solution.

Let’s extend the top of the screen a bit. Press the WINDOW button and make adjustments to Ymin and Ymax (see Figure 6.11), then press the GRAPH button to adopt the changes.

Solution: Because there is a power of x larger than one, the equation x2 − 4x−96 = 0 is nonlinear. We already have one side zero, so we can proceed with the factoring.

FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 427 6.4 Factoring ax2 + bx + c when a != 1 In this section we continue to factor trinomials of the form ax2 + bx + c. In the last section, all of our examples had a = 1, and we were able to “Drop in place” our circled integer pair. However, in this section, a != 1, and we’ll soon see that we will not be able to use the “Drop in place” technique. However, readers will be pleased to learn that the ac-method will still apply. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Factor: 2x2 − 7x− 15. Factor: 3x2 + 13x+ 14 Solution: We proceed as follows: 1. Compare 2x2 − 7x − 15 with ax2 + bx + c and identify a = 2, b = −7, and c = −15. Note that the leading coefficient is a = 2, so this case is different from all of the cases discussed in Section 6.3. 2. Calculate ac. Note that ac = (2)(−15), so ac = −30. 3. List all integer pairs whose product is ac = −30. 1,−30 −1, 30 2,−15 −2, 15 3,−10 −3, 10 5,−6 −5, 6 4. Circle the ordered pair whose sum is b = −7. 1,−30 −1, 30 2,−15 −2, 15 3,−10 −3, 10 5,−6 −5, 6 5. Note that if we “drop in place” our circled ordered pair, (x+3)(x−10) != 2x2 − 7x− 15. Right off the bat, the product of the terms in the “First” position does not equal 2x2. Instead, we break up the middle term of 2x2 − 7x − 15 into a sum of like terms using our circled pair of integers 3 and −10. 2x2−7x− 15 = 2x2+3x− 10x− 15 Now we factor by grouping. Factor x out of the first two terms and −5 out of the second two terms. = x (2x+ 3)− 5 (2x+ 3) Now we can factor out (2x+ 3). = (x − 5)(2x+ 3) 428 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 6. Use the FOIL shortcut to mentally check your answer. To multiply (x− 5)(2x+ 3), use these steps: • Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: 2x2. • Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and com- bine the results mentally: 3x− 10x = −7x. • Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −15. That is: F O I L (x − 5)(2x+ 3) = 2x2 + 3x − 10x − 15 Combining like terms, (x − 5)(2x + 3) = 2x2 − 7x − 15, which is the original trinomial, so our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x+ 2)(3x+ 7) ! 
book7_6_4_1	no label	Speeding Things Up a Bit Speeding Things Up a Bit Speeding Things Up a Bit Some readers might already be asking “Do I really have to list all of those ordered pairs if I already see the pair I need?” The answer is “No!” If you see the pair you need, use it to break up the middle term of the trinomial as a sum of like terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Factor: 3x2 − 7x− 6.Factor: 2x2 − 9x+ 10 Solution: Compare 3x2−7x−6 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 3, b = −7, and c = −6. Calculate ac = (3)(−6), so ac = −18. Now can you think of an integer pair whose product is ac = −18 and whose sum is b = −7? For some, the pair just pops into their head: 2 and −9. Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using the pair 2 and −9. 3x2−7x− 6 = 3x2+2x− 9x− 6 −7x = 2x− 9x. = x (3x+ 2)− 3 (3x+ 2) Factor by grouping. = (x − 3)(3x+ 2) Factor out (3x+ 2). Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x− 3)(3x+ 2) = 3x2 + 2x − 9x − 6 6.4. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 429 Combining like terms, (x−3)(3x+2) = 3x2−7x−6, the original trinomial. Our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x − 2)(2x− 5) ! On the other hand, some readers might be saying “Well, the needed ordered pair is not popping into my head. Do I have a way of cutting down the work?” The answer is “Yes!” As you are listing the ordered pairs whose product equals ac, be mindful that you need the ordered pair whose sum is b. If you stumble across the needed pair, stop the listing process and “drop” your ordered pair in place. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor: 3x2 − 33x+ 54. Factor: 5x2 − 35x− 40 Solution: Compare 3x2 − 33x + 54 with ax2 + bx + c and note that a = 3, b = −33, and c = 54. Calculate ac = (3)(54), so ac = 162. Ouch! That’s a big number! However, start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = 162, but be mindful that you need an integer pair whose sum is b = −33. 1, 162 2, 81 3, 54 6, 27 −6,−27 As soon as we wrote down the pair 6 and 27, our mind said “the sum of 6 and 7 is 33.” However, we need the sum to equal b = −33, so we boxed −6 and −27 instead. Next, we break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using our circled pair. 3x2−33x− 54 = 3x2−6x− 27x− 54 −33x = −6x− 27x. = 3x (x− 2)− 27(x− 2) Factor by grouping. = (3x− 27)(x− 2) Factor out (x− 2). Oh-oh! Now we realize we can factor 3 out of each term in the first factor! = 3(x− 9)(x− 2) We missed taking out the GCF! Let’s try again, only this time let’s do what we are always supposed to do in the first step: Factor out the GCF. 3x2 − 33x+ 54 = 3(x2 − 11x+ 18) 430 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Comparing x2 − 11x + 18 with ax2 + bx + c, we see that a = 1, b = −11, and c = 18. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = 18 and whose sum is b = −11. Note that these numbers are considerably smaller than the numbers we had to deal with when we forgot to first factor out the GCF. Because the numbers are smaller, the integer pair −9 and −2 easily comes to mind. Furthermore, because a = 1, we can factor x2 − 11x + 18 by simply dropping the integer pair −9 and −2 in place. 3(x2 − 11x+ 18) = 3(x− 9)(x− 2) A far simpler solution!Answer: 5(x− 8)(x+ 1) ! In Example 3, we saw how much more difficult we made the problem by forgetting to first factor out the greatest common factor (GCF). Let’s try not to make that mistake again. First rule of factoring. The first step in factoring any polynomial is to factor out the greatest common factor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor: 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x.Factor: 12x4 + 2x3 − 30x2 Solution: Note that the GCF of 30x3, 21x2, and 18x is 3x. Factor out this GCF. 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x = 3x · 10x2 − 3x · 7x− 3x · 6 = 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) Next, compare 10x2 − 7x− 6 with ax2 + bx+ c and note that a = 10, b = −7, and c = −6. Start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = −60, but be mindful that you need an integer pair whose sum is b = −7. 1,−60 2,−30 3,−20 4,−15 5,−12 Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using our circled pair. 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) = 3x(10x2 + 5x− 12x− 18) −7x = 5x− 12x. = 3x [ 5x(2x+ 1)− 6(2x+ 1)] Factor by grouping. = 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1) Factor out a 2x+ 1. Hence, 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x = 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1). 6.4. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 431 Check: First, use the FOIL shortcut to multiply the two binomial factors, then distribute the monomial factor. 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1) = 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) Apply the FOIL shortcut. = 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x Distribute the 3x. Because this is the original polynomial, the solution checks. Answer: 2x2(3x+5)(2x− 3) !

Write the middle term as a sum of like terms using this pair. 2x2 − 5x− 8x+ 20 = 0 −13x = −5x− 8x. x(2x− 5)− 4(2x− 5) = 0 Factor by grouping. (x− 4)(2x− 5) = 0 Factor out 2x− 5.

Squaring a binomial. Here are two earlier rules for squaring a binomial. 1. (a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2 2. (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2 
book7_6_5_1	no label	Perfect Square Trinomials Perfect Square Trinomials Perfect Square Trinomials To square a binomial such as (a+ b)2, proceed as follows: 1. Square the first term: a2 2. Multiply the first and second term, then double: 2ab 3. Square the last term: b2 You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Expand: (2x+ 3y)2Expand: (5a+ 2b)2 Solution: Using the pattern (a+b)2 = a2+2ab+b2, we can expand (2x+3y)2 as follows: (2x+ 3y)2 = (2x)2 + 2(2x)(3y) + (3y)2 = 4x2 + 6xy + 9y2 Note how we square the first and second terms, then produce the middle term of our answer by multiplying the first and second terms and doubling.Answer: 25a2 + 20ab+ 4b2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Expand: (3u2 − 5v2)2Expand: (2s3 − 7t)2 Solution: Using the pattern (a−b)2 = a2−2ab+b2, we can expand (3u2−5v2)2 as follows: (3u2 − 5v2)2 = (3u2)2 − 2(3u2)(5v2) + (5v2)2 = 9u4 − 30u2v2 + 25v4 6.5. FACTORING SPECIAL FORMS 441 Note that the sign of the middle term is negative this time. The first and last terms are still positive because we are squaring. Answer: 4s6 − 28s3t+ 49t2 ! Once you’ve squared a few binomials, it’s time to do all of the work in your head. (i) Square the first term; (ii) multiply the first and second term and double the result; and (iii) square the second term. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Expand each of the following: Expand: (5x4 − 3)2 a) (2y − 3)2 b) (4a− 3b)2 c) (x3 + 5)2 Solution: Using the pattern (a ± b)2 = a2 ± 2ab + b2, we expand each binomially mentally, writing down the answer without any intermediate steps. a) (2y − 3)2 = 4y2 − 12y + 9 b) (4a− 3b)2 = 16a2 − 24ab+ 9b2 c) (x3 + 5)2 = x6 + 10x3 + 25 Answer: 25x8 − 30x4 + 9 ! Now, because factoring is “unmultiplying,” it should be a simple matter to reverse the process of Example 3. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor each of the following trinomials: Factor: 25x8 − 30x4 + 9 a) 4y2 − 12y + 9 b) 16a2 − 24ab+ 9b2 c) x6 + 10x3 + 25 Solution: Because of the work already done in Example 3, it is a simple task to factor each of these trinomials. a) 4y2 − 12y + 9 = (2y − 3)2 b) 16a2 − 24ab+ 9b2 = (4a− 3b)2 c) x6 + 10x3 + 25 = (x3 + 5)2 Answer: (5x4 − 3)2 ! 442 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Each of the trinomials in Example 4 is an example of a perfect square trinomial. Perfect square trinomial. If a trinomial a2 + 2ab + b2 is the square of a binomial, as in (a+ b)2, then the trinomial is called a perfect square trinomial. So, how does one recognize a perfect square trinomial? If the first and last terms of a trinomial are perfect squares, then you should suspect that you may be dealing with a perfect square trinomial. However, you also have to have the correct middle term in order to have a perfect square trinomial. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Factor each of the following trinomials:Factor: 16x2 + 72x+ 81 a) 9x2 − 42x+ 49 b) 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 c) 4x2 − 37x+ 9 Solution: Note that the first and last terms of each trinomial are perfect squares. a) In the trinomial 9x2−42x+49, note that (3x)2 = 9x2 and 72 = 49. Hence, the first and last terms are perfect squares. Taking the square roots, we suspect that 9x2 − 42x+ 49 factors as follows: 9x2 − 42x+ 49 ?= (3x− 7)2 However, we must check to see if the middle term is correct. Multiply 3x and 7, then double: 2(3x)(7) = 42x. Thus, the middle term is correct and therefore 9x2 − 42x+ 49 = (3x− 7)2. b) In the trinomial 49a2+70ab+25b2, note that (7a)2 = 49a2 and (5b)2 = 25b2. Hence, the first and last terms are perfect squares. Taking the square roots, we suspect that 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 factors as follows: 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 ? = (7a+ 5b)2 However, we must check to see if the middle term is correct. Multiply 7a and 5b, then double: 2(7a)(5b) = 70ab. Thus, the middle term is correct and therefore 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 = (7a+ 5b)2. List of Squares n n2 0 0 1 1 2 4 3 9 4 16 5 25 6 36 7 49 8 64 9 81 10 100 11 121 12 144 13 169 14 196 15 225 16 256 17 289 18 324 19 361 20 400 21 441 22 484 23 529 24 576 25 625 c) In the trinomial 4x2− 37x+9, note that (2x)2 = 4x2 and (3)2 = 9. Hence, the first and last terms are perfect squares. Taking the square roots, we suspect that 4x2 − 37x+ 9 factors as follows: 4x2 − 37x+ 9 ?= (2x− 3)2 6.5. FACTORING SPECIAL FORMS 443 However, we must check to see if the middle term is correct. Multiply 2x and 3, then double: 2(2x)(3) = 12x. However, this is not the middle term of 4x2 − 37x + 9, so this factorization is incorrect! We must find another way to factor this trinomial. Comparing 4x2 − 37x+ 9 with ax2 + bx+ c, we need a pair of integers whose product is ac = 36 and whose sum is b = −37. The integer pair −1 and −36 comes to mind. Replace the middle term as a sum of like terms using this ordered pair. 4x2 − 37x+ 9 = 4x2 − x− 36x+ 9 −37x = −x− 36x. = x(4x− 1)− 9(4x− 1) Factor by grouping. = (x− 9)(4x− 1) Factor out 4x− 1. This example clearly demonstrates how important it is to check the middle term. Answer: (4x+ 9)2 ! Remember the first rule of factoring! The first rule of factoring. The first step to perform in any factoring problem is factor out the GCF. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Factor each of the following trinomials: Factor: −4x3 − 24x2 − 36x a) 2x3y + 12x2y2 + 18xy3 b) −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3 Solution: Remember, first factor out the GCF. a) In the trinomial 2x3y + 12x2y2 + 18xy3, we note that the GCF of 2x3y, 12x2y2, and 18xy3 is 2xy. We first factor out 2xy. 2x3y + 12x2y2 + 18xy3 = 2xy(x2 + 6xy + 9y2) We now note that the first and last terms of the resulting trinomial factor are perfect squares, so we take their square roots and factors as follows. = 2xy(x+ 3y)2 Of course, the last factorization is correct only if the middle term is correct. Because 2(x)(3y) = 6xy matches the middle term of x2 +6xy+9y2, we do have a perfect square trinomial and our result is correct. 444 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING b) In the trinomial −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3, we note that the GCF of 4x5, 32x4, and 64x3 is 4x3. We first factor out 4x3. −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3 = 4x3(−x2 + 8x− 16) However, the first and third terms of −x2 +8x− 16 are negative, and thus are not perfect squares. Let’s begin again, this time factoring out −4x3. −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3 = −4x3(x2 − 8x+ 16) This time the first and third terms of x2− 8x+16 are perfect squares. We take their square roots and write: = −4x3(x− 4)2 Again, this last factorization is correct only if the middle term is correct. Because 2(x)(4) = 8x, we do have a perfect square trinomial and our result is correct. Answer: −4x(x+ 3)2 ! 
book7_6_5_2	no label	The Difference of Squares The Difference of Squares The Difference of Squares The second special product form we learned in Chapter 5 was the difference of squares. The difference of squares. Here is the difference of squares rule. (a+ b)(a− b) = a2 − b2 If you are multiplying two binomials which have the exact same terms in the “First” positions and the exact same terms in the “Last” positions, but one set is separated by a plus sign while the other set is separated by a minus sign, then multiply as follows: 1. Square the first term: a2 2. Square the second term: b2 3. Place a minus sign between the two squares. 6.5. FACTORING SPECIAL FORMS 445 You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Expand each of the following: Expand: (4x− 3y)(4x+ 3y) a) (3x+ 5)(3x− 5) b) (a3 − 2b3)(a3 + 2b3) Solution: We apply the difference of squares pattern to expand each of the given problems. a) In (3x + 5)(3x − 5), we have the exact same terms in the “First” and “Last” positions, with the first set separated by a plus sign and the second set separated by a minus sign. a) Square the first term: (3x)2 = 9x2 b) Square the second term: 52 = 25 c) Place a minus sign between the two squares. Hence: (3x+ 5)(3x− 5) = 9x2 − 25 b) In (a3 − 2b3)(a3 + 2b3), we have the exact same terms in the “First” and “Last” positions, with the first set separated by a minus sign and the second set separated by a plus sign. a) Square the first term: (a3)2 = a6 b) Square the second term: (2b3)2 = 4b6 c) Place a minus sign between the two squares. Hence: (a3 − 2b3)(a3 + 2b3) = a6 − 4b6 Answer: 16x2 − 9y2 ! Because factoring is “unmultiplying,” is should be a simple matter to reverse the process of Example 7. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Factor each of the following: Factor: 81x2 − 49 a) 9x2 − 25 b) a6 − 4b6 Solution: Because of the work already done in Example 7, it is a simple matter to factor (or “unmultiply”) each of these problems. a) 9x2 − 25 = (3x+ 5)(3x− 5) b) a6 − 4b6 = (a3 − 2b3)(a3 + 2b3) 446 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING In each case, note how we took the square roots of each term, then separated one set with a plus sign and the other with a minus sign. Because of the commutative property of multiplication, it does not matter which one you make plus and which one you make minus.Answer: (9x+ 7)(9x− 7) ! Always remember the first rule of factoring. The first rule of factoring. The first step to perform in any factoring problem is factor out the GCF. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Factor: x3 − 9xFactor: 4x4 − 16x2 Solution: In x3 − 9x, the GCF of x3 and 9x is x. Factor out x. x3 − 9x = x(x2 − 9) Note that x2 − 9 is now the difference of two perfect squares. Take the square roots of x2 and 9, which are x and 3, then separate one set with a plus sign and the other set with a minus sign. = x(x + 3)(x− 3) Answer: 4x2(x+ 2)(x− 2) ! 
book7_6_5_3	no label	Factoring Completely Factoring Completely Factoring Completely Sometimes after one pass at factoring, factors remain that can be factored further. You must continue to factor in this case. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Factor: x4 − 16Factor: x4 − 81 Solution: In x4 − 16, we have the difference of two squares: (x2)2 = x4 and 42 = 16. First, we take the square roots, then separate one set with a plus sign and the other set with a minus sign. x4 − 16 = (x2 + 4)(x2 − 4) 6.5. FACTORING SPECIAL FORMS 447 Note that x2+4 is the sum of two squares and does not factor further. However, x2 − 4 is the difference of two squares. Take the square roots, x and 2, then separate one set with a plus sign and the other set with a minus sign. = (x2 + 4)(x+ 2)(x− 2) Done. We cannot factor further. Answer: (x2 + 9)(x+ 3)(x− 3) ! 
book7_6_5_4	no label	Nonlinear Equations Revisited Nonlinear Equations Revisited Nonlinear Equations Revisited Remember, if an equation is nonlinear, the first step is to make one side equal to zero by moving all terms to one side of the equation. Once you’ve completed this important first step, factor and apply the zero product property to find the solutions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Solve for x: 25x2 = 169 Solve for x: 16x2 = 121 Solution: Make one side equal to zero, factor, then apply the zero product property. 25x2 = 169 Original equation. 25x2 − 169 = 0 Subtract 169 from both sides. Note that we have two perfect squares separated by a minus sign. This is the difference of squares pattern. Take the square roots, making one term plus and one term minus. (5x+ 13)(5x− 13) = 0 Use difference of squares to factor. Use the zero product property to complete the solution, setting each factor equal to zero and solving the resulting equations. 5x+ 13 = 0 or 5x− 13 = 0 x = −13 5 x = 13 5 Hence, the solutions of 25x2 = 169 are x = −13/5 and x = 13/5. We encourage readers to check each of these solutions. Answer: −11/4, 11/4 ! 448 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Solve for x: 49x2 + 81 = 126xSolve for x: 25x2 = 80x− 64 Solution: Make one side equal to zero, factor, then apply the zero product property. One can also argue that the only number whose square is zero is the number zero. Hence, one can go directly from (7x− 9)2 = 0 to 7x− 9 = 0. Hence, the only solution of 49x2 + 81 = 126x is x = 9/7. 49x2 + 81 = 126x Original equation. 49x2 − 126x+ 81 = 0 Subtract 126x from both sides. Note that the first and last terms of the trinomial are perfect squares. Hence, it make sense to try and factor as a perfect square trinomial, taking the square roots of the first and last terms. (7x− 9)2 = 0 Factor as a perfect square trinomial. Of course, be sure to check the middle term. Because −2(7x)(9) = −126x, the middle term is correct. Because (7x − 9)2 = (7x − 9)(7x− 9), we can use the zero product property to set each factor equal to zero and solve the resulting equations. 7x− 9 = 0 or 7x− 9 = 0 x = 9 7 x = 9 7 Hence, the only solution of 49x2+81 = 126x is x = 9/7. We encourage readers to check this solution.Answer: 8/5 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 13. Solve for x: 2x3 + 3x2 = 50x+ 75Solve for x: 5x3 + 36 = x2 + 180x Solution: Make one side equal to zero, factor, then apply the zero product property. 2x3 + 3x2 = 50x+ 75 Original equation. 2x3 + 3x2 − 50x− 75 = 0 Make one side zero. This is a four-term expression, so we try factoring by grouping. Factor x2 out of the first two terms, and −25 out of the second two terms. x2(2x+ 3)− 25(2x+ 3) = 0 Factor by grouping. (x2 − 25)(2x+ 3) = 0 Factor out 2x+ 3. 6.5. FACTORING SPECIAL FORMS 449 Complete the factorization by using the difference of squares to factor x2− 25. (x+ 5)(x− 5)(2x+ 3) = 0 Use difference of squares to factor. Finally, use the zero product property. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x. x+ 5 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 or 2x+ 3 = 0 x = −5 x = 5 x = −3 2 Hence, the solutions of 2x3+3x2 = 50x+75 are x = −5, x = 5, and x = −3/2. We encourage readers to check each of these solutions. Answer: −6, 6, 1/5 ! Let’s solve another nonlinear equation, matching the algebraic and graphi- cal solutions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 14.

Solution: Note that we have a power of x larger than one, so the equation x3 = 4x is nonlinear. Make one side zero and factor. x3 = 4x Original equation. x3 − 4x = 0 Nonlinear. Make one side zero. x(x2 − 4) = 0 Factor out GCF. x(x + 2)(x− 2) = 0 Apply difference of squares. Note that we now have a product of three factors that equals zero. The zero product property says that at least one of these factors must equal zero. x = 0 or x+ 2 = 0 or x− 2 = 0 x = −2 x = 2 Hence, the solutions of x3 = 4x are x = 0, x = −2, and x = 2.

book7_6_6	no label	6.6 Factoring Strategy 6.6 Factoring Strategy 6.6 Factoring Strategy When you are concentrating on factoring problems of a single type, after doing a few you tend to get into a rhythm, and the remainder of the exercises, because they are similar, seem to flow. However, when you encounter a mixture of factoring problems of different types, progress is harder. The goal of this section is to set up a strategy to follow when attacking a general factoring problem. If it hasn’t already been done, it is helpful to arrange the terms of the given polynomial in some sort of order (descending or ascending). Then you want to apply the following guidelines. Factoring Strategy. These steps should be followed in the order that they appear. 1. Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF). 2. Look for a special form. a) If you have two perfect squares separated by a minus sign, use the difference of squares pattern to factor: a2 − b2 = (a+ b)(a− b) b) If you have a trinomial whose first and last terms are perfect squares, you should suspect that you have a perfect square trinomial. Take the square roots of the first and last terms and factor as follows. a2 + 2ab+ b2 = (a+ b)2 Be sure to check that the middle term is correct. 3. If you have a trinomial of the form ax2 + bx + c, use the ac-method to factor. 4. If you have a four-term expression, try to factor by grouping. Once you’ve applied the above strategy to the given polynomial, it is quite possible that one of your resulting factors will factor further. Thus, we have the following rule. Factor completely. The factoring process is not complete until none of your remaining factors can be factored further. This is the meaning of the phrase, “factor completely.” 6.6. FACTORING STRATEGY 457 Finally, a very good word of advice. Check your factoring by multiplying. Once you’ve factored the given polynomial completely, it is a very good practice to check your result. If you multiply to find the product of your factors, and get the original given polyno- mial as a result, then you know your factorization is correct. It’s a bit more work to check your factorization, but it’s worth the effort. It helps to eliminate errors and also helps to build a better understanding of the factoring process. Remember, factoring is “unmultiplying,” so the more you multiply, the better you get at factoring. Let’s see what can happen when you don’t check your factorization! Warning! The following solution is incorrect! Factor: 2x4 + 8x2. Solution: Factor out the GCF. 2x4 + 8x2 = 2x2(x2 + 4) = 2x2(x+ 2)2 Note that this student did not bother to check his factorization. Let’s do that for him now. Check: Multiply to check. Remember, when squaring a binomial, there is a middle term. 2x2(x+ 2)2 = 2x2(x2 + 4x+ 4) = 2x4 + 8x3 + 8x2 This is not the same as the original polynomial 2x4 + 8x2, so the student’s factorization is incorrect. Had the student performed this check, he might have caught his error, provided of course, that he multiplies correctly during the check. The correct factorization follows. 2x4 + 8x2 = 2x2(x2 + 4) The sum of squares does not factor, so we are finished. Check: Multiply to check. 2x2(x2 + 4) = 2x4 + 8x2 This is the same as the original polynomial 2x4 + 8x2, so this factorization is correct. 458 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Factor completely: −3x6 + 3x2Factor completely: −4x7 + 64x3 Solution: The first rule of factoring is “Factor out the GCF.” The GCF of −3x6 and 3x2 is 3x2, so we could factor out 3x2. −3x6 + 3x2 = 3x2(−x4 + 1) This is perfectly valid, but we don’t like the fact that the second factor starts with −x4. Let’s factor out −3x2 instead. −3x6 + 3x2 = −3x2(x4 − 1) The second factor is the difference of two squares. Take the square roots, separating one pair with a plus sign, one pair with a minus sign. = −3x2(x2 + 1)(x2 − 1) The sum of squares does not factor. But the last factor is the difference of two squares. Take the square roots, separating one pair with a plus sign, one pair with a minus sign. = −3x2(x2 + 1)(x+ 1)(x− 1) Check: Multiply to check the result. −3x2(x2 + 1)(x+ 1)(x− 1) = −3x2(x2 + 1)(x2 − 1) = −3x2(x4 − 1) = −3x6 + 3x2 The factorization checks.Answer: −4x3(x2 + 4)(x+ 2)(x− 2) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Factor completely: x3y + 9xy3 + 6x2y2Factor completely: 3a2b4 + 12a4b2 − 12a3b3 Solution: The first rule of factoring is “Factor out the GCF.” The GCF of x3y, 9xy3, and 6x2y2 is xy, so we factor out xy. x3y + 9xy3 + 6x2y2 = xy(x2 + 9y2 + 6xy) Let’s order that second factor in descending powers of x. = xy(x2 + 6xy + 9y2) 6.6. FACTORING STRATEGY 459 The first and last terms of the trinomial factor are perfect squares. We suspect we have a perfect square trinomial, so we take the square roots of the first and last terms, check the middle term, and write: = xy(x+ 3y)2 Thus, x3y + 9xy3 + 6x2y2 = xy(x+ 3y)2. Check: Multiply to check the result. xy(x+ 3y)2 = xy(x2 + 6xy + 9y2) = x3y + 6x2y2 + 9xy3 Except for the order, this result is the same as the given polynomial. The factorization checks. Answer: 3a2b2(2a− b)2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor completely: 2x3 − 48x+ 20x2 Factor completely: 27x3 − 3x4 − 60x2 Solution: In the last example, we recognized a need to rearrange our terms after we pulled out the GCF. This time, let’s arrange our terms in descending powers of x right away. 2x3 − 48x+ 20x2 = 2x3 + 20x2 − 48x Now, let’s factor out the GCF. = 2x(x2 + 10x− 24) The last term of the trinomial factor is not a perfect square. Let’s move to the ac-method to factor. The integer pair −2, 12 has a product equal to ac = −24 and a sum equal to b = 10. Because the coefficient of x2 is one, this is a “drop in place” situation. We drop our pair in place and write: = 2x(x − 2)(x+ 12) Thus, 2x3 − 48x+ 20x2 = 2x(x− 2)(x+ 12). Check: Multiply to check the result. We use the FOIL method shortcut and mental calculations to speed things up. 2x(x− 2)(x+ 12) = 2x(x2 + 10x− 24) = 2x3 + 20x2 − 48x Except for the order, this result is the same as the given polynomial. The factorization checks. Answer: −3x2(x− 4)(x− 5) ! 460 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor completely: 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2Factor completely: 8x2 + 14xy − 15y2 Solution: There is no common factor we can factor out. We have a trinomial, but the first and last terms are not perfect squares, so let’s apply the ac-method. Ignoring the variables for a moment, we need an integer pair whose product is ac = −48 and whose sum is −13. The integer pair 3,−16 comes to mind (if nothing comes to mind, start listing integer pairs). Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using the integer pair 3,−16, then factor by grouping. 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2 = 2a2 + 3ab− 16ab− 24b2 = a(2a+ 3b)− 8b(2a+ 3b) = (a− 8b)(2a+ 3b) Thus, 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2 = (a− 8b)(2a+ 3b). Check: Multiply to check the result. We use the FOIL method shortcut and mental calculations to speed things up. (a− 8b)(2a+ 3b) = 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2 This result is the same as the given polynomial.

Factor completely: 30x4 + 38x3 − 20x2Factor completely: 36x3 + 60x2 + 9x Solution: The first step is to factor out the GCF, which in this case is 2x2. 30x4 + 38x3 − 20x2 = 2x2(15x2 + 19x− 10) The first and last terms of the trinomial factor are not perfect squares, so let’s move again to the ac-method. Comparing 15x2+19x−10 with ax2+bx+c, note that ac = (15)(−10) = −150. We need an integer pair whose product is −150 and whose sum is 19. The integer pair −6 and 25 satisfies these requirements. Because a != 1, this is not a “drop in place” situation, so we need to break up the middle term as a sum of like terms using the pair −6 and 25. = 2x2(15x2 − 6x+ 25x− 10) Factor by grouping. Factor 3x out of the first two terms and 5 out of the third and fourth terms. = 2x2(3x(5x− 2) + 5(5x− 2)) 6.6. FACTORING STRATEGY 461 Finally, factor out the common factor 5x− 2. = 2x2(3x+ 5)(5x− 2) Thus, 30x4 + 38x3 − 20x2 = 2x2(3x+ 5)(5x− 2). Check: Multiply to check the result. Use the FOIL method to first multiply the binomials. 2x2(3x+ 5)(5x− 2) = 2x2(15x2 + 19x− 10) Distribute the 2x2. = 30x4 + 38x3 − 20x2 This result is the same as the given polynomial.

Factor out 3x3. 15x6 − 33x5 − 240x4 + 528x3 = 3x3 [5x3 − 11x2 − 80x+ 176] The second factor is a four-term expression. Factor by grouping. = 3x3 [ x2(5x− 11)− 16(5x− 11)] = 3x3(x2 − 16)(5x− 11) The factor x2−16 is a difference of two squares. Take the square roots, separate one pair with a plus, one pair with a minus. = 3x3(x+ 4)(x− 4)(5x− 11) Thus, 15x6 − 33x5 − 240x4 + 528x3 = 3x3(x+ 4)(x− 4)(5x− 11). Check: Multiply to check the result. 3x3(x+ 4)(x− 4)(5x− 11) = 3x3(x2 − 16)(5x− 11) = 3x3(5x3 − 11x2 − 80x+ 176 = 15x6 − 33x5 − 240x4 + 528x3 This result is the same as the given polynomial.

For example, consider the trinomial: 12y2 − 11y − 36 We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −432 and whose sum is b = −11. We begin listing integer pair possibilities, but the process quickly becomes daunting. 1,− 432 2,− 216 · · · Note that the numbers in the second column are found by dividing ac = −432 by the number in the first column. We’ll now use this fact and the TABLE feature on our calculator to pursue the desired integer pair. 1. Enter the expression -432/X into Y1 in the Y= menu (see the first image in Figure 6.30). 2.

FACTORING STRATEGY 463 Now we can break the middle term of 12y2 − 11y − 36 into a sum of like terms using the ordered pair 16,−27, then factor by grouping. 12y2 − 11y − 36 = 12y2 + 16y − 27y − 36 = 4y(3y + 4)− 9(3y + 4) = (4y − 9)(3y + 4) Check: Use the FOIL method shortcut and mental calculations to multiply.

You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. A rectangular canvas picture measures 12 inches by 16 inches. A rectangular canvas picture measures 7 inches by 11 inches. The canvas is mounted inside a frame of uniform width, increasing the total area covered by both canvas and frame to 117 square inches. Find the uniform width of the frame. The canvas is mounted inside a frame of uniform width, increasing the total area covered by both canvas and frame to 396 square inches. Find the uniform width of the frame. Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. A carefully labeled figure will help us main- tain our focus. We’ll let x represent the uniform width of the frame. 12 + 2x 16 + 2x 12 + 2x 16 + 2x 12 16 12 16 xx x x 2. Set up an equation. If the inner rectangular dimensions are 16 inches by 12 inches, adding a frame of uniform width x makes the dimensions of the frame plus canvas 16 + 2x inches by 12 + 2x inches. The total area is found by multiplying these outer dimensions, A = (16 + 2x)(12 + 2x). If the total area is A = 396 square inches, then we have the following equation. (16 + 2x)(12 + 2x) = 396 3. Solve the equation. We start by expanding the right-hand side of the equation. (16 + 2x)(12 + 2x) = 396 192 + 56x+ 4x2 = 396 The resulting equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. 4x2 + 56x− 204 = 0 468 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING We could factor out 4 on the left-hand side, but since there is a zero on the right-hand side of the equation, it’s a bit easier to simply divide both sides by 4. Note how we divide each term on the left-hand side by the number 4. x2 + 14x− 51 = 0 We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −51 and whose sum is b = 14. The integer pair −3, 17 comes to mind. Since the coefficient of x2 is one, we can simply “drop in place” our ordered pair. (x− 3)(x+ 17) = 0 Thus, the solutions are x = 3 and x = −17. 4. Answer the question. The uniform width of the frame cannot be −17 inches, so we eliminate this solution from consideration. Hence, the uni- form width of the frame is 3 inches. 5. Look back. If the uniform width of the frame is 3 inches, then the final dimensions will look like the following. 18 22 18 22 12 16 12 16 33 3 3 Thus, the combined area of the frame plus canvas is A = (18)(22), or A = 396 square inches, the area given in the problem statement. Our solution is correct. Answer: 1 inch ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. A projectile is fired at an angle into the air from atop a cliffA projectile’s height (in feet) is given by the equation y = −16t2 + 144t+ 576, where time t is measured in seconds. How much time passes before the projectile hits the ground? overlooking the ocean. The projectile’s distance (in feet) from the base of the cliff is give by the equation x = 120t, (6.1) 6.7. APPLICATIONS OF FACTORING 469 and the projectile’s height above sea level (in feet) is given by the equation y = −16t2 + 288t+ 640, (6.2) where t is the amount of time (in seconds) that has passed since the projectile’s release. a) How much time passes before the projectile splashes into the ocean? b) At that time, how far is the projectile from the base of the cliff? Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. The variables are already set up for us. x = Distance from base of the cliff (in feet). y = Height above sea level (in feet). t = Time since projectile’s release (in seconds). 2. Set up an equation. The equations are already set up (see equation 6.1 and equation 6.2). 3. Solve the equation. When the projectile splashes into the ocean, its height above sea level at that moment is y = 0 feet. Substitute 0 for y in equation 6.2 and solve the resulting equation for t. y = −16t2 + 288t+ 640 0 = −16t2 + 288t+ 640 We could factor out −16, but since the left-hand side of this equation is zero, it’s a bit easier to divide both sides by −16. Note how we divide each term on the right-hand side by −16. 0 = t2 − 18t− 40 We need a pair of integers so that their product is ac = −40 and their sum is −18. The integer pair 2,−20 comes to mind. Since the coefficient of t2 is one, we can “drop in place” our integer pair. 0 = (t+ 2)(t− 20) Hence, the solutions are t = −2 and t = 20. 4. Answer the question. In answering question (a), the solution t = −2 seconds makes no sense. Thus, the projectile splashes into the ocean at t = 20 seconds. 470 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING In addressing question (b), to find the projectile’s distance from the base of the cliff at this moment, substitute t = 20 in equation 6.1. x = 120t x = 120(20) x = 2400 Hence, at the moment the projectile splashes into the ocean, it is 2,400 feet from the base of the cliff. 5. Look back. The best we can do here is check our solution t = 20 in equation 6.2. y = −16t2 + 288t+ 640 y = −16(20)2 + 288(20) + 640 y = −6400 + 5760 + 640 y = 0 Indeed, at t = 20, the projectile does splash into the ocean.

Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. Let k represent the first even integer. Then k + 2 represents the next consecutive even integer. 2. Set up an equation. The product of the integers is 728. Hence, we have the following equation. k(k + 2) = 728 3. Solve the equation. Expand the left-hand side of the equation. k2 + 2k = 728 The equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. k2 + 2k − 728 = 0 See Using the Calculator to Assist the ac-Method on page 462. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −728 and whose sum is b = 2. Enter -728/X in Y1, then set up the table (see Figure 6.31). 6.7. APPLICATIONS OF FACTORING 471 Figure 6.31: Load ac/X , or -728/X into Y1 in the Y= menu. Use the up- and down-arrow keys to scroll. Note that 28,−26 is the desired pair. Because the coefficient of k2 is one, we can “drop in place” the ordered pair. 0 = (k + 28)(k − 26) Hence, the solutions are k = −28 and k = 26. 4. Answer the question. If k = −28, the next consecutive even integer is k + 2 = −26. Secondly, if k = 26, the next consecutive even integer is k + 2 = 28. 5. Look back. Our first pair is −28 and −26. They have the required product of 728. Our second pair is 26 and 28. Their product is also 728. Both solutions check! Answer: 21 and 23 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4.

Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. A sketch will help us keep our focus. Let L represent the length of the rectangle and let W represent its width. L W L W 472 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 2. Set up an equation. The perimeter is 54 feet, so 2W+2L = 54, or dividing both sides by 2: W + L = 27 (6.3) The area is 180 square feet, so: LW = 180 (6.4) 3. Solve the equation. The system of equations (equations 6.3 and 6.4) can be solved using the substitution method. First, solve equation 6.3 for W : W = 27− L (6.5) Substitute equation 6.5 in equation 6.4, expand, then make one side zero. L(27− L) = 180 27L− L2 = 180 0 = L2 − 27L+ 180 The integer pair −12,−15 has product ac = 180 and sum b = −27. Moreover, the coefficient of L2 is one, so we can “drop in place” our integer pair. 0 = (L− 12)(L− 15) Hence, the solutions are L = 12 and L = 15. 4. Answer the question. Two possibilities for the width. Substitute L = 12 in (6.5). W = 27− L W = 27− 12 W = 15 Substitute L = 15 in (6.5). W = 27− L W = 27− 15 W = 12 Both answers give the same 15 by 12 foot rectangle, but we usually think of the term “length” as the longer side of the rectangle. So let’s go with the length is L = 15 feet and the width is W = 12 feet. 5. Look back. Let’s add L = 15 feet and W = 12 feet to a diagram. 15 ft 12 ft 15 ft 12 ft 6.7. APPLICATIONS OF FACTORING 473 If we add the dimensions around the rectangle, the perimeter is P = 15+ 12 + 15 + 12, or P = 54 feet, the perimeter required in the problem statement. Next, if we multiply the dimensions, then A = (15)(12), or A = 180 square feet, the area required in the problem statement. Our solution is correct!

Exponential notation is a simple example of such nota- tion that expands our thinking. The modern notation we use started seriously in 1636 and 1637 with James Humes and Rene Descartes, after centuries of mathematicians flirting with various approaches. Descartes may have been the first to use today’s radical symbol, combining the check symbol with the bar over the top in 1637.

NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 479 You might be asking “Why does raising to the power of minus one invert the number?” To answer this question, recall the product of a number and its reciprocal is one. For example, 4 · 1 4 = 1. (7.1) Next, consider what happens when we multiply 41 and 4−1. If we apply the usual law of exponents (assuming they work for both positive and negative exponents), we would add the exponents (1 + (−1) = 0). 41 · 4−1 = 40 (7.2) However, because 41 = 4 and 40 = 1, this last equation is equivalent to: 4 · 4−1 = 1 (7.3) When you compare Equation 7.1 and 7.3, it is clear that 4−1 and 1/4 are both reciprocals of the number 4. Because reciprocals are unique, 4−1 = 1/4. In similar fashion, one can discover the meaning of a−n. Start with the fact that multiplying reciprocals yields an answer of one. an · 1 an = 1 (7.4) If we multiply an and a−n, we add the exponents as follows. an · a−n = a0 Providing a != 0, then a0 = 1, so we can write an · a−n = 1 (7.5) Comparing Equations 7.4 and 7.5, we note that both 1/an and a−n are recip- rocals of an. Because every number has a unique reciprocal, a−n and 1/an are equal. Raising to a negative integer. Provided a != 0, a−n = 1 an . 480 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 2.

Using the third law of expo- nents ((am)n = amn), we can write this expression in two equivalent forms. 1. Note that 3−2 is equivalent to (32)−1.

EXAMPLE 9. Simplify: (2x−2y4)−3 Simplify: (3x4y−3)−2 Solution: The fourth law of exponents ((ab)n = anbn) says that when you raise a product to a power, you must raise each factor to that power. So we begin by raising each factor to the minus three power. (2x−2y3)−3 = 2−3(x−2)−3(y4)−3 To raise two to the minus three, we must cube two and invert: 2−3 = 1/8.

A number having the form a× 10b, where b is an integer and 1 ≤ |a| < 10, is said to be in scientific notation. The requirement 1 ≤ |a| < 10 says that the magnitude of a must be a least 1 and less than 10. • The number 12.34× 10−4 is not in scientific notation because |12.34| = 12.34 is larger than 10. • The number −0.95× 103 is not in scientific notation because |− 0.95| = 0.95 is less than 1. • The number 7.58× 10−12 is in scientific notation because |7.58| = 7.58 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. • The number −1.0× 1015 is in scientific notation because |− 1.0| = 1.0 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. After contemplating these examples, it follows that a number in scientific no- tation should have exactly one of the digits 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9 before the decimal point. Exactly one, no more, no less.

Solution: Because the speed of light is measured in miles per second, let’s first compute the number of seconds in 4.37 years. Because there are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, we can write: 4.37 yr = 4.37 yr× 365 day yr × 24 hr day × 60 min hr × 60 s min = 4.37"yr × 365 # #day "yr × 24 "hr ##day × 60 # #min "hr × 60 s ##min Note how the units cancel, indicating that the final answer is in seconds. With our calculator mode set to scientific notation (see the image on the right in Figure 7.2), we multiply the numbers to get the result shown in Figure 7.6. Rounding, the number of seconds in 4.37 years is approximately 1.38 × 108 seconds. Next, we compute the distance the light travels in 4.37 years. Using the fact that the distance traveled equals the speed times the time traveled, we have: Distance = Speed× Time = 1.86× 105 mi s · 1.38× 108 s = 1.86× 105 mi $s · 1.38× 108 $s Note how the units cancel, indicating that our answer is in miles.

Four thousand years ago, the Babylonians were solving selected quadratic equations. The Greek mathematician Pythagoras did geometrical studies of which the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles is well known even in modern times. In circa 250 BC Diophantes of Alexandria and in 750 AD al Khwarizmis of Arabia also wrote quadratic equations with solutions. These earlier math- ematicians limited their work to positive rational numbers, but in medieval times the Hindu Brahmagupta included solutions using positive and negative numbers and also included irrational numbers as well. In the 1600’s, Frenchman Rene Descartes wrote a geometric proof of the quadratic formula which simplified the previous information.

INTRODUCTION TO RADICAL NOTATION 537 Solution: We are looking for a number whose square is −36. However, every time you square a real number, the result is never negative.

The solutions of x2 = a are called square roots of a. Case: a > 0. The equation x2 = a has two real solutions, namely x = ±√a. • The notation √a calls for the nonegative square root. • The notation −√a calls for the negative square root. Case: a = 0.

Solve x2 = 16 for x, then simplify your answers. Solution: Because the right-hand side of x2 = 9 is positive, the equation has two solutions. x2 = 9 Original equation. x = ±√9 Two answers: −√9 and √9 To simplify these answers, we need to understand the following facts: • √9 calls for the nonnegative square root of 9. Because (3)2 = 9, the nonnegative square root of 9 is 3. Hence, √ 9 = 3. • −√9 calls for the negative square root of 9. Because (−3)2 = 9, the negative square root of 9 is −3. Hence, −√9 = −3. Thus, the solutions of x2 = 9 are x = ±3, which is equivalent to saying “x = −3 or x = 3.” Answer: 4, −4 ! 1When we say that −36 has no real square roots, we mean there are no real numbers that are square roots of −36. The reason we emphasize the word real in this situation is the fact that −36 does have two square roots that are elements of the complex numbers, a set of numbers that are usually introduced in advanced courses such as college algebra or trigonometry. 538 CHAPTER 8.

For exam- ple, if we start with x2 = 25, then the solutions are x = ±√25. Because 25 is a perfect square, we can simplify further, arriving at x = ±5. However, the right-hand side of x2 = a does not have to be a perfect square. For example, the equation x2 = 7 has two real solutions, x = ±√7.

We can find the total area of the square by squaring any one of the sides of the square. A = (a+ b)2 Square a side to find area. A = a2 + 2ab+ b2 Squaring a binomial pattern. Thus, the total area of the square is A = a2 + 2ab+ b2. A second approach to finding the area of the square is to sum the areas of the geometric parts that make up the square. We have four congruent right triangles, shaded in light red, with base a and height b. The area of each of these triangles is found by taking one-half times the base times the height; i.e., the area of each triangles is (1/2)ab. In the interior, we have a smaller square with side c. Its area is found by squaring its side; i.e., the area of the smaller square is c2. The total area of the square is the sum of its parts, one smaller square and four congruent triangles. That is: A = c2 + 4 ( 1 2 ab ) Adding the area of the interior square and the area of four right triangles. A = c2 + 2ab Simplify: 4((1/2)ab) = 2ab. The two expressions, a2 + 2ab+ b2 and c2 + 2ab, both represent the total area of the large square. Hence, they must be equal to one another. a2 + 2ab+ b2 = c2 + 2ab Each side of this equation represents the area of the large square. a2 + b2 = c2 Subtract 2ab from both sides. 8.2.

If a and b are the legs of a right triangle and c is its hypotenuse, then: a2 + b2 = c2 We say “The sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle equals the square of its hypotenuse.” Good hint. Note that the hypotenuse sits by itself on one side of the equation a2 + b2 = c2. The legs of the hypotenuse are on the other side. Let’s put the Pythagorean Theorem to work. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4.

However, in this situation, c represents the length of the hypotenuse and must be a positive number. Hence: c = 5 Nonnegative square root. Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is 5.

Use completing the square to help solve x2 = 2x+ 2.Use completing the square to help solve x2 = 3− 6x. Solution: First, move 2x to the left-hand side of the equation, keeping the constant 2 on the right-hand side of the equation. x2 − 2x = 2 On the left, take one-half of the coefficient of x: (1/2)(−2) = −1. Square the result: (−1)2 = 1. Add this result to both sides of the equation. x2 − 2x+ 1 = 2 + 1 x2 − 2x+ 1 = 3 We can now factor the left-hand side as a perfect square trinomial. (x− 1)2 = 3 Now, as in Examples 1, 2, and 3, we can take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember, there are two square roots. x− 1 = ±√3 Finally, add 1 to both sides of the equation. x = 1±√3 Thus, the equation x2 = 2x+ 2 has two answers, x = 1−√3 and x = 1+√3.

A second degree polynomial equation of the form ax2 + bx+ c = 0, where a, b, and c are any real numbers, is called a quadratic equation in x. The goal of this section is to develop a formulaic shortcut that will provide exact solutions of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx+ c = 0. We start by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. ax2 + bx+ c = 0 Quadratic equation. ax2 + bx = −c Subtract c from both sides. In preparation for completing the square, we next divide both sides of the equation by a. x2 + b a x = − c a Divide both sides by a. Now we complete the square. Take one-half of the coefficient of x, then square the result. 1 2 · b a = b 2a when squared gives ( b 2a )2 = b2 4a2 We now add b2/(4a2) to both sides of the equation. x2 + b a x+ b2 4a2 = − c a + b2 4a2 Add b2/(4a2) to both sides. On the left, we factor the perfect square trinomial. On the right, we make equivalent fractions with a common denominator.( x+ b 2a )2 = − c a · 4a 4a + b2 4a2 On the left, factor. On the right, create equivalent fractions with a common denominator.( x+ b 2a )2 = −4ac 4a2 + b2 4a2 Multiply numerators and denominators.( x+ b 2a )2 = b2 − 4ac 4a2 Add fractions. 572 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS When we take the square root, there are two answers. x+ b 2a = ± √ b2 − 4ac 4a2 Two square roots. When you take the square root of a fraction, you take the square root of both the numerator and denominator. x+ b 2a = ± √ b2 − 4ac√ 4a2 x+ b 2a = ± √ b2 − 4ac 2a Simplify: √ 4a2 = 2a. x = − b 2a ± √ b2 − 4ac 2a Subtract b/(2a) from both sides. Because both fractions have the same denominator, we can add and subtract numerators and put the answer over the common denominator. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. The equation ax2 + bx+ c = 0 is called a quadratic equation. Its solutions are given by x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a , called the quadratic formula. Whew! Fortunately, the result is a lot easier to apply than it is to develop! Let’s try some examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: x2 − 4x− 5 = 0.Solve for x: x2 − 8x+ 12 = 0 Solution: The integer pair 1,−5 has product ac = −5 and sum b = −4. Hence, this trinomial factors. x2 − 4x− 5 = 0 (x+ 1)(x− 5) = 0 Now we can use the zero product property to write: x+ 1 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 x = −1 x = 5 8.4. THE QUADRATIC FORMULA 573 Thus, the solutions are x = −1 and x = 5. Now, let’s give the quadratic formula a try. First, we must compare our equation with the quadratic equation, then determine the values of a, b, and c. ax2 + bx+ c = 0 x2 − 4x− 5 = 0 Comparing equations, we see that a = 1, b = −4, and c = −5. We will now plug these numbers into the quadratic formula. First, replace each occurrence of a, b, and c in the quadratic formula with open parentheses. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. Now we can substitute: 1 for a, −4 for b, and −5 for c. x = −(−4)±√(−4)2 − 4(1)(−5) 2(1) Substitute: 1 for a, −4 for b, and −5 for c. x = 4±√16 + 20 2 Simplify. Exponent first, then multiplication. x = 4±√36 2 Add: 16 + 20 = 36. x = 4± 6 2 Simplify: √ 36 = 6. Note that because of the “plus or minus” symbol, we have two answers. x = 4− 6 2 or x = 4 + 6 2 x = −2 2 x = 10 2 x = −1 x = 5 Note that these answers match the answers found using the ac-test to factor the trinomial.

Compare x2 − 5x− 7 = 0 with ax2 + bx+ c = 0 and note that a = 1, b = −5, and c = −7. Replace each occurrence of a, b, and c with open parentheses to prepare the quadratic formula for substitution. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. Substitute 1 for a, −5 for b, and −7 for c. x = −(−5)±√(−5)2 − 4(1)(−7) 2(1) Substitute: a = 1, b = −5, c = −7. x = 5±√25 + 28 2 Exponents and multiplication first. x = 5±√53 2 Simplify. Check: Use the calculator to check each solution (see Figure 8.16). Note that in storing (5−√53)/2 in X, we must surround the numerator in parentheses. Figure 8.16: Check (5 −√53)/2 and (5 +√53)/2. In each image in Figure 8.16, after storing the solution in X, note that the left- and right-hand sides of the original equation x2 = 5x + 7 produce the same number, verifying that our solutions are correct.Answer: (−7+√89)/2, (−7−√89)/2 ! 8.4.

An object is launched vertically and its height y (in feet)An object is launched vertically and its height y (in feet) above ground level is given by the equation y = 160 + 96t− 16t2, where t is the time (in seconds) that has passed since its launch. How much time must pass after the launch before the object returns to ground level? above ground level is given by the equation y = 320+192t−16t2, where t is the time (in seconds) that has passed since its launch. How much time must pass after the launch before the object returns to ground level? After placing the answer in simple form and reducing, use your calculator to round the answer to the nearest tenth of a second. Solution: When the object returns to ground level, its height y above ground level is y = 0 feet. To find the time when this occurs, substitute y = 0 in the formula y = 320 + 192t− 16t2 and solve for t. y = 320 + 192t− 16t2 Original equation. 0 = 320 + 192t− 16t2 Set y = 0. Each of the coefficients is divisible by −16. 0 = t2 − 12t− 20 Divide both sides by −16. Compare t2− 12t− 20 = 0 with at2 + bt+ c = 0 and note that a = 1, b = −12, and c = −20.

The answer is not in simple form, as we can factor out √ 16. t = 12±√16√14 2 √ 224 = √ 16 √ 14. t = 12± 4√14 2 Simplify: √ 16 = 4 Use the distributive property to divide both terms in the numerator by 2. t = 12 2 ± 4 √ 14 2 Divide both terms by 2. t = 6± 2√14 Simplify. Thus, we have two solutions, t = 6 − 2√14 and t = 6 + 2√14. Use your calculator to find decimal approximations, then round to the nearest tenth. t ≈ −1.5, 13.5 The negative time is irrelevant, so to the nearest tenth of a second, it takes the object approximately 13.5 seconds to return to ground level.

Arnie gets on his bike at noon and begins to ride due north At 6:00 am, a freight train passes through Sagebrush Junction heading west at 40 miles per hour. At 8:00 am, a passenger train passes through the junction heading south at 60 miles per hour. At what time of the day, correct to the nearest minute, will the two trains be 180 miles apart? at a constant rate of 12 miles per hour. At 1:00 pm, Barbara gets on her bike at the same starting point and begins to ride due east at a constant rate of 8 miles per hour. At what time of the day will they be 50 miles apart (as the crow flies)? Don’t worry about simple form, just report the time of day, correct to the nearest minute. Solution: At the moment they are 50 miles apart, let t represent the time that Arnie has been riding since noon. Because Barbara started at 1 pm, she has been riding for one hour less than Arnie. So, let t − 1 represent the numbers of hours that Barbara has been riding at the moment they are 50 miles apart. 578 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS Now, if Arnie has been riding at a constant rate of 12 miles per hour for t hours, then he has traveled a distance of 12t miles. Because Barbara has been riding at a constant rate of 8 miles per hour for t− 1 hours, she has traveled a distance of 8(t− 1) miles. 8(t− 1) 5012t Figure 8.17: 50 miles apart. The distance and direction traveled by Arnie and Barbara are marked in Figure 8.17. Note that we have a right triangle, so the sides of the triangle must satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.

Use (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2 to expand (8t− 8)2. 144t2 + 64t2 − 128t+ 64 = 2500 Square each term. 208t2 − 128t+ 64 = 2500 Simplify: 144t2 + 64t2 = 208t2 The resulting equation is nonlinear. Make one side equal to zero. 208t2 − 128t− 2436 = 0 Subtract 2500 from both sides. 52t2 − 32t− 609 = 0 Divide both sides by 4. Compare 52t2 − 32t − 609 = 0 with at2 + bt + c = 0 and note that a = 52, b = −32, and c = −609. Replace each occurrence of a, b, and c with open parentheses to prepare the quadratic formula for substitution. Note that we are solving for t this time, not x. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. Substitute 52 for a, −32 for b, and −609 for c. t = −(−32)±√(−32)2 − 4(52)(−609) 2(52) Substitute: 52 for a, −32 for b, and −609 for c t = 32±√1024 + 126672 104 Exponent, then multiplication. t = 32±√127696 104 Simplify.
