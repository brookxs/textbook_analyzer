Minimal common container of tree patterns
Tree patterns represent important fragments of XPath. In this paper, we show that some classes of tree patterns exhibit such a property that, given a finite number of tree patterns P 1 , ..., P n , there exists another pattern P (tree pattern or DAG-pattern) such that P 1 , ..., P n , are all contained in P , and for any tree pattern Q belonging to a given class C , P 1 , ..., P n , are contained in Q implies P is contained in Q .
