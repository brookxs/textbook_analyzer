Effective and efficient classification on a search-engine model
Traditional document classification frameworks, which apply the learned classifier to each document in a corpus one by one, are infeasible for extremely large document corpora, like the Web or large corporate intranets. We consider the classification problem on a corpus that has been processed primarily for the purpose of searching, and thus our access to documents is solely through the inverted index of a large scale search engine. Our main goal is to build the "best" short query that characterizes a document class using operators normally available within large engines. We show that surprisingly good classification accuracy can be achieved on average over multiple classes by queries with as few as 10 terms. Moreover, we show that optimizing the efficiency of query execution by careful selection of these terms can further reduce the query costs. More precisely, we show that on our set-up the best 10 terms query canachieve 90\% of the accuracy of the best SVM classifier (14000 terms), and if we are willing to tolerate a reduction to 86\% of the best SVM, we can build a 10 terms query that can be executed more than twice as fast as the best 10 terms query.
