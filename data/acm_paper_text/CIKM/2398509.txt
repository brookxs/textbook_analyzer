Balanced coverage of aspects for text summarization
We propose a new model for the guided text summarization task. In this task, it is required that a generated summary covers all the aspects, which are predefined for the topic of the given document cluster; for example, aspects for the topic "Accidents and Natural Disasters" include WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, WHO AFFECTED, DAMAGES and COUNTERMEASURES. We use as a scorer for an aspect, the maximum entropy classifier that predicts whether each sentence reflects the aspect or not. We formalize the coverage of the aspects as a max-min problem, which enables a summary to cover aspects in a well-balanced manner. In the max-min problem, the minimum of the aspect scores is going to be maximized so that the summary contains all the aspects as much as possible. Furthermore, we integrate the model based on the max-min problem with the maximum coverage summarization model, which generates a summary containing as many conceptual units as possible. Through the experiments on benchmark datasets for the guided summarization, we show that our model outperforms other approaches in terms of ROUGE-2.
