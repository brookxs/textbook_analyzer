Protecting location privacy against location-dependent attack in mobile services
Privacy preservation has recently received considerable attention for location-based mobile services. In this paper, we present location-dependent attack resulting from continuous and dependent location updates and propose an incremental clique-based cloaking algorithm, called ICliqueCloak, to defend against location-dependent attack. The main idea is to incrementally maintain maximal cliques for location cloaking in an un-directed graph that takes into consideration the effect of continuous location updates.
