Closing the loop in webpage understanding
Little work has been done towards an integrated statistical model for understanding webpage structures and processing natural language sentences within the HTML elements. This paper proposed a novel framework called WebNLP which enables bidirectional integration of page structure understanding and text understanding in an iterative manner. Experiments show that the WebNLP framework achieved significantly better performance.
