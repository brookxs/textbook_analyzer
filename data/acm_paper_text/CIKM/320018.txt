Self maintenance of multiple views in data warehousing
Materialized views ( MV ) at the data warehouse ( DW ) can be kept up to date in response to changes in data sources without accessing data sources for additional information. This process is usually refered to as “self maintenance of views”. A number of algorithms have been proposed for self maintenance of views, which use auxiliary views (AV) to keep some additional information in DW . In this paper we propose an algorithm for self maintainability of multiple MVs using the above approach. Our algorithm generates a simple maintenance query to incrementally maintain an MV along with its AV at DW . The algorithm maintains these views by minimizing the number and the size of the AVs . Our approach provides better insight into view maintenance issues by exploiting the dependencies and constraints that might exist in the data sources and multiple MVs at DW .
