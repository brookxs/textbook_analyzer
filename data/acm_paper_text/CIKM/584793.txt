On scalable information retrieval systems
Implementing scalable information retrieval systems requires the design and development of efficient methods to ingest data from multiple sources, search and retrieve results from both English and foreign language document collections and from collections comprising of multiple data types, harness high performance computer technology, and accurately answer user questions. Some recent efforts related to the development of scalable information retrieval systems are described. Particular emphasis is placed on those efforts that were adopted into commercial use.
