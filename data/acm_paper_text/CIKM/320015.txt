Queryable acyclic production systems
We pose a query problem about the behavior of a consultation system S : given a constraint formula q and a potential conclusion c for S , determine if there is a user input binding that satisfies q and causes S to conclude c . Existing rule-based expert systems, both forward and backward chaining[3], implement a consultation mechanism S , but are not designed for these queries about S . For general production systems, the queries are undecidable. Here we solve the problem for useful sublanguages of acyclic production systems. We implement a query tool in a Datalog + constraints framework, and optimize for “embedded decision trees” in the rule system. Our data complexity is &THgr;( n ·ƒ( n )) in the size of the embedded trees, versus &THgr;( n ·ƒ( n ) + n 2 ) for existing datalog evaluation algorithms, where ƒ( n ) is the cost of destructively conjoining a constraint of unit size into a conjunction of n constraints.
