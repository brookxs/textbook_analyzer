The dspace repository: can multiple institutions live in one space? a different approach
In late 2006, NITLE launched a pilot program for managed institutional repository services designed for smaller colleges and universities and the non-profit organizations that serve them. Twenty-six participating institutions helped pioneer this pilot effort, which laid the foundation for the development of production-level DSpace Services. These DSpace Services allowed campuses to start and grow their digital repositories with a minimal level of investment, with no hardware to purchase and very little application support expertise to develop. Campuses were able to focus on the work of building digital repositories within the context of a community of campuses sharing ideas and best practices. Lessons learned and next steps will be discussed.
