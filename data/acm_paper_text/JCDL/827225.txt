Modularization framework for digital museum exhibition
Conventionally, digital museum online exhibitions are constructed using handcrafted HTML pages which require tedious hypermedia composing. This paper proposes a sophisticated modularization framework for exhibition website construction by integrating XML and Flash MX. A typical exhibition page is differentiated into several "layers" containing specific types of "media elements". Several categories of modularized Flash-based "mediah-andlers" are used to process and present the layers containing media elements. A complete set of media-handlers presenting the content are then integrated together to give the final page presentation. Based on this modularization framework, the workflow for exhibition construction and management are significant improved.
