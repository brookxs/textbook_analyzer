MetRe: supporting the metadata revision process
MetRe is a prototype interface and service designed to support the metadata revision process. Improving consistency of metadata records within an environment is a common repository management task, due to potential for user error when submitting, as well as of other sources of error, such as systematic error resulting from the chosen deposit process. Evidence to support the metadata correction process may be gathered by automated metadata extraction tools, evidence from within the repository, or by comparison with best practice across the repository landscape. MetRe (Metadata Revision) is a prototype demonstrator that is able to identify several characteristic classes of error, twinned with an interface able to highlight several types of individual and systematic error, including a notion of local (intra-repository) and general (inter-repository) best practice.
