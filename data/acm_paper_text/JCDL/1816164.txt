In-depth utilization of Chinese ancient maps: a hybrid approach to digitizing map resources in CADAL
Digital map is getting increasingly popular as an intuitive and interactive platform for data presentation recently. Thus applications integrated with digital map have attracted much attention. But no offtheshelf systems or services could we use if the time span of maps be extended to historical ones. There are a large number of valuable ancient atlases in CADAL digital library. However, they are seldom made use of because the ones which are in image format are not convenient for users to read or search. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach to utilizing these atlases directly and constructing some applications based on ancient maps. We call it CAMAME which means Chinese Ancient Maps Automatic Marking and Extraction. We create a gazetteer to store the geographic information of sites which will be project on the map, then use kernel method to do the regression and correct the estimated results with image processing and local regression methods. The empirical results show that CAMAME is effective and efficient, by which most valuable data in the map images is marked and identified. Some Chinese literary chronicle applications that exhibit ancient literary and related historical information over those digitized atlas resources in CADAL digital library were developed.
