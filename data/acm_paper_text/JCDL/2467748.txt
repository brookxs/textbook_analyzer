Full-text and topic based authorrank and enhanced publication ranking
The idea behind AuthorRank is that a content created by more popular authors should rank higher than the content created by less popular authors. This paper brings this idea into scientific publications analysis to test whether the optimized topical AuthorRank can replace or enhance topical PageRank for publication ranking. First, the PageRank with Priors (PRP) algorithm was employed to rank topic-based publications and authors. Second, the first author's reputation was used for generating an AuthorRank score. Additionally, linear combination method of topical AuthorRank and PageRank were compared with several baselines. Finally, as shown in our evaluation results, the performance of topical AuthorRank combined with topic-based PageRank is better than other baselines for publication ranking.
