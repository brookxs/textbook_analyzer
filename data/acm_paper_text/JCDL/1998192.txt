SNAC: the social networks and archival context project
This demonstration will show the prototype access and search system for the Social Networks and Archival Context project. The system is built on a database of merged Encoded Archival Context - Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF) records derived from Encoded Archival Description (EAD) records held by the Library of Congress, the California Digital Library, the Northwest Digital Archives, and Virginia Heritage, combined with information from name authority files from the Library of Congress, OCLC Research, and the Getty Vocabulary Program. The database merges information from each instance of an individual name in these resources, along with variant names, biographical notes and their topical descriptions. The prototype interface makes this information searchable while retaining links to the various data sources, other resources (such as books by or about a person) and to other individuals, families and organizations associated with that name.
