Identification of works of manga using LOD resources: an experimental FRBRization of bibliographic data of comic books
Manga -- a Japanese term meaning graphic novel or comic -- has been globally accepted. In Japan, there are a huge number of monographs and magazines of manga published. The work entity defined in Functional Requirements of Bibliographic Records (FRBR) is useful to identify and find manga. This paper examines how to identify manga works in a set of bibliographic records maintained by Kyoto International Manga Museum. It is known that authority data is useful to identify works from the bibliographic records. However, the authority data of manga is not rich, because manga has been recognized as a sub-culture resource and is generally not included in library collections. In this study, we used DBpedia, which is a large Linked Open Data (LOD) resource created from Wikipedia, to identify FRBR manga entities in bibliographic records. The results of this study show that using LOD resources is a reasonable way to identify works from bibliographic records. It also shows the accuracy and efficiency of work identification depending on the quality of the LOD resources used.
