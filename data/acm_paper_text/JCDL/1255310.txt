Visual understanding environment
The Visual Understanding Environment (VUE) project at Tufts' Academic Technology department aims at providing faculty and students with tools to successfully integrate digital resources into their teaching and learning. VUE not only provides a visual environment for structuring, presenting, and sharing digital information but also viewing digital resources along with their metadata. The demonstration will showcase the federated search capabilities of VUE that enable users to search across multiple digital repositories. We will also present concept maps created using digital objects from repositories.
