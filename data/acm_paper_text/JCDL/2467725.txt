Medusa at the university of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: a digital preservation service based on PREMIS
The Medusa digital preservation service at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides a storage environment for digital content selected for long-term retention by content managers and producers affiliated with the Library in order to ensure its enduring access and use. This paper reports on Medusa development, with emphasis on the research processes that informed key decisions related to its design, the central role of PREMIS metadata in its architecture, and future directions of integrating PREMIS management into a Fedora repository architecture. In so doing, it describes a strategy of digital preservation content management that draws strength from the creation and management of comprehensive PREMIS preservation metadata records.
