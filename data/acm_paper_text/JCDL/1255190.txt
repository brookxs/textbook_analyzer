The OAI-ORE effort: progress, challenges, synergies
The panel will discuss various aspects of the ongoing Object Re-Use and Exchange (ORE) effort of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI). OAI-ORE is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and is a result of the "Augmenting Interoperability across Scholarly Repositories" meeting that took place in April 2006 at the Mellon Foundation. A panel at JCDL 2006 reported on this meeting. The goal of OAI-ORE is to develop, identify, and profile extensible standards and protocols that allow repositories, agents, and services to interoperate in the context of use and reuse of compound digital objects beyond the boundaries of the holding repositories.
