From kinescope to rich media: 50 years (ago) with Mike Wallace
What do Eleanor Roosevelt, Frank Lloyd Wright, Margaret Sanger, and Henry Kissinger have in common? All of them, and 55 other celebrities were interviewed by Mike Wallace in 1957-58, and the corresponding kinescopes have resided in the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas since the early 1960's. This demonstration will showcase an online searchable video digital library of the Wallace interviews created by researchers, staff, and students at the University of Texas School of Information and the Universidad Francisco Marroquín.
