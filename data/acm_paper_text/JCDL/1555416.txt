Developing a flexible content model for media repositories: a case study
This article describes the process and challenges of developing a content model that can support the content and metadata present in a complex media archive. Media archives have some of the most diverse requirements in an effort to catalog, preserve, and make accessible a wide range of content with multifaceted relationships between works. We focus particularly on the design and implementation of the WGBH Media Library and Archives' Fedora digital access repository for scholars, educational users and the public. It is our hope that the process and findings from this work can support the architecture and development of other media archives.
