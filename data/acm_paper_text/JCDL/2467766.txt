It has been well documented that cultural heritage institutions can enhance their metadata by sharing content through popular web services such as Flickr. Through the Flickr Feasibility Study, the IMLS Digital Collections and Content project examined how an aggregation service can facilitate participation of cultural heritage institutions in popular web services. This poster presents a proposed feedback framework through which an aggregation service can facilitate and increase the impact of Web user interactions with shared cultural heritage collections through direct metadata enhancement and user analysis.
