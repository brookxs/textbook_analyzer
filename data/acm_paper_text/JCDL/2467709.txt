A relevance feedback approach for the author name disambiguation problem
This paper presents a new name disambiguation method that exploits user feedback on ambiguous references across iterations. An unsupervised step is used to define pure training samples, and a hybrid supervised step is employed to learn a classification model for assigning references to authors. Our classification scheme combines the Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) classifier with complex reference similarity functions generated by a Genetic Programming framework. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields better results than state-of-the-art disambiguation methods on two traditional datasets.
