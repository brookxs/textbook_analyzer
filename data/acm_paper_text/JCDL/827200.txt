Expandability is one of the main requirements of future digital libraries. This paper introduces a digital library service system, OpenDLib, that has been designed to be highly expandable in terms of content, services and usage. The paper illustrates the mechanisms that enable expandability and discusses their impact on the development of the system architecture.
