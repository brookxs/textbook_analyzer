Education for digital stewardship: librarians, archivists or curators?
The large-scale digital repositories that are emerging today and expected to increase exponentially during this century will require information managers with the skills to archive, preserve, and organize massive amounts of data for use and re-use by a variety of interdisciplinary scholarly communities over time. Where will these managers come from, and what skills will they need? This workshop, organized by the US Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) will address these questions through presentations and discussion among educators and other interested participants. IMLS has invested more than $100 million since 2003 in the education of librarians, archivists and data curators through both formal and continuing education programs. This timely funding has enabled graduate schools of library and information science to reshape their curricula to address the emerging need for digital data managers. Are we prepared to meet the challenge?
