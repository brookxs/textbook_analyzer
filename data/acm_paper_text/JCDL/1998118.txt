A link-based visual search engine for Wikipedia
This paper introduces HMpara, a new search engine that aims to make Wikipedia easier to explore. It works on top of the encyclopedia's existing link structure, abstracting away from document content and allowing users to navigate the resource at a higher level. It utilizes semantic relatedness measures to emphasize articles and connections that are most likely to be of interest, visualization to expose the structure of how the available information is organized, and lightweight information extraction to explain itself.
