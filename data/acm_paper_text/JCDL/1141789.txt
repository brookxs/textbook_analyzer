What do digital librarians do
Without well-educated digital librarians, digital libraries cannot reach their full potential. In order to offer relevant courses and programs to train digital librarians, educators need feedback from practitioners. Current digital library professionals in academic libraries in the United States were surveyed to determine their activities, skills and training gaps. The findings have implications for the design of digital library education in order to meet workplace needs.
