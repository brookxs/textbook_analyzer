How important is metadata?
Metadata is expensive. Information services and digital library researchers spend considerable time, effort, and money on metadata. It is time to ask a number of important questions: How much metadata is really necessary and for what reason? What are the right metrics for metadata; its correctness, appropriateness, and return on investment? Is metadata harvesting really useful for the creation of digital library services? Are the assumptions about the utility, or even necessity, of metadata a legacy of years of library science and practice? Do these assumptions make sense in the current context of massive computing power and automatic analysis? .Clearly there is no one "correct' answer to these questions. The panel will provide the forum for practitioners and researchers from a number of areas to express their views and, hopefully, provoke stimulating discussions from the audience.
