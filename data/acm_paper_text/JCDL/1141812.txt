FRBR: enriching and integrating digital libraries
FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) is a promising framework for supporting rich indexation, and therefore rich interaction, in digital libraries. However, it is poorly reported in the digital library research literature and practical examples of its use are seldom discussed. In this paper, we introduce an implemented architecture for FRBR support that can supplement existing digital library systems. We also demonstrate the benefits gained by the user when FRBR data is used to enrich the user's interaction with the digital library.
