Apparatus and methods for production of printed aromatic and gustative information
As we advance with the implementation of novel technologies, apparati and protocols that combine existing technologies with emergent ones are becoming more relevant to ensure smoother transitions and overcome challenges that new technologies alone can not address. The author essentially suggests a new type of information exchange which focuses on the olfactory/gustatory perceptual realm of smell and taste. In principle, a printing module transforms signals received from the processing unit into olfactory documents that can, in turn, be stored and preserved as scented texts on thin layers of a gustative medium.
