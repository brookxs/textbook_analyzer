Robust registration of manuscript images
In this paper we present an application of image registration techniques to the specific domain of manuscript images. We show the application of this technique to images of the Venetus A, a 10th century manuscript of Homer's Iliad. The same algorithm is used to register images of the MS across time (including photographs separated by over a century), as well as across imaging modalities.
