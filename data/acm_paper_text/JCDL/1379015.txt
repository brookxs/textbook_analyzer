Automatic extraction of morphological information from botanical collections
Specific morphological information is often used by users to search botanical collections. However, traditional systems based on statistical models are often not effective for such search. This study automatically extracts morphological information from botanical collections using an adapted and enhanced information extraction system. Experimental results indicate this approach is promising. This study also indicates that this approach is generalizable to similar collections in the same domain and even to different domains with adaptation of the pattern recognition and knowledge base in the new domain.
