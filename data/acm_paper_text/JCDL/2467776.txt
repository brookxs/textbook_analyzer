OmniMea: an approach to improved content recruitment for institutional repositories
A common complaint of providers of institutional repository services is that they have low utilization by their intended user base. The reasons are varied, but two are germane to our project: lack of individual incentives among potentially participating faculty; and a perceived high barrier to entry. The OmniMea project adopts a user-centric focus by advocating for personal repositories as a more appealing concept and by directing relevant intellectual output placed in these personal repositories to the institutional repository for long-term curation. While our approach was explicitly aimed and capturing long-tail data, it has turned out to be more generally applicable.
