Digital libraries on handhelds for autistic children
Autism is a wide spectrum developmental disorder. Its prevalence has increased enormously. Each autistic child has different needs and requires individual therapy. Information technology can help these children and their families by augmenting therapy and providing communication tools. We are developing a digital library that provides such a communication tool on a Pocket PC. The tool will be integrated into the therapy sessions and the children will be able use it daily. Additionally, all the interactions with the tool are logged, allowing the therapist a detailed view of the effects of therapy on the children's communication.
