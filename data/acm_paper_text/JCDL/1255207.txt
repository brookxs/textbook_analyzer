Children's interests and concerns when using the international children's digital library: a four-country case study
This paper presents a case study of 12 children who used the International Children's Digital Library (ICDL) over four years and live in one of four countries: Germany, Honduras, New Zealand, and the United States. By conducting interviews, along with collecting drawings and book reviews, this study describes these children's interests in books, libraries, technology and the world around them. Findings from this study include: these young people increased the variety of books they read online; still valued their physical libraries as spaces for social interaction and reading; showed increased reading motivation; and showed interest in exploring different cultures.
