An integrated participatory platform for human evaluation of machine translation
We describe the functions of HeMT, a multilingual participatory platform for Human Evaluation of Machine Translation. HeMT is used by three types of users including translators, evaluators, and reviewers. It consists of six major modules: User Management, Manual Translation, User Training, Evaluation, Result Visualization, and Multilingual Lexicon Management. HeMT can be used by Digital Libraries and Machine Translation communities for conducting manual translation, machine translation evaluation, and computer-assisted translation tasks.
