Measuring the reputation of web sites: a preliminary exploration
We describe the preliminary results from a pilot study, which assessed the perceived reputation - authority and trustworthiness - of the output from five WWW indexing/ranking tools. The tools are based on three techniques: external link structures, internal content, or human selection/indexing. Twenty-two participants reviewed the output from each tool and assessed the reputation of the retrieved sites.
