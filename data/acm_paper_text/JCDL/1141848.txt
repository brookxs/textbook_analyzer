Supporting biological information work: research and education for digital resources and long-lived data
New practices are emerging in all stages of biological research, from data collection through dissemination of results. Through a series of cooperative projects with biologists working in data-intensive and informatics-based domains, we have documented requirements for digital libraries, tool development, and data management techniques to support contemporary scientific practice. This research is now serving as the foundation for a new biological informatics master's program to train scientific information specialists to manage and integrate scientific information and tools to support scientific problem solving and communication.
