How to annotate an image?: the need of an image annotation guide agent
The performance of retrieving an image in terms of text--type of queries depends heavily on the quality of the annotated descriptive metadata that describes the content of the images. However, effective annotation of an image can often be a laborious task that requires consistent domain knowledge. We showed that the critical property and common sense heuristics used by an annotation guide agent to aid the annotation of images could significantly lead to the improvement of the recall and precision of image retrieval.
