Electronic records processing: it's a CINCH!
In August 2011, five project partners (the State Library of North Carolina, the North Carolina State Archives, North Carolina Libraries for Virtual Education, Elon University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte) began a collaboration to develop a computer application that collects, ingests, and authenticates the electronic records that libraries and archives are often mandated to maintain. The application, called "CINCH," incorporates existing digital curation technologies, but adds to their functionality by creating a pull-down (or capture) utility to gather content available from the Internet. The final product will be a lightweight, open-source software tool that institutions required to collect and authenticate records on ingest can employ to retrieve and process their digital content.
