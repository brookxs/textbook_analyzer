FLOW: co-constructing low barrier repository infrastructure in support of heterogeneous knowledge collection(s)
Institutional repositories are being constructed today to address the needs of scholarly communication in a digital environment [1, 2]. The success of such institutional infrastructures as knowledge collections depends in part on offering low barriers for participation and on supporting heterogeneous knowledge inputs and outputs. The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) in partnership with CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research), the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Science & Engineering Library, has modified CERN's CDSware software to initiate the process of creating a local low barrier repository.
