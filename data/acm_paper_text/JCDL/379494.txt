Digital libraries and data scholarship
In addition to preserving and retrieving digital information, digital libraries need to allow data scholars to create post-publication references to objects within files and across collections of files. Such references can serve as new metadata in their own right and should also provide methods for efficiently extracting the subset of the original data that belongs to the object. This paper discusses some ideas about the requirements for such references within the context of long-term, active archival, where neither the data format nor the institutional basis can be guaranteed to remain constant.
