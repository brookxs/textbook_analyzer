Building digital library collections with greenstone
This tutorial will demonstrate how to build a variety of different kinds of digital library collections with the Greenstone digital library software, a comprehensive, open-source system for constructing, presenting, and maintaining information collections. Collections will be built from HTML documents; Word, PDF and PostScript documents; images in various formats; MP3 and MIDI audio; MARC records; and more. For each collection, various different full-text search indexes and metadata-based browsers will be created.Attendees who wish to are encouraged to bring their laptops, install Greenstone from a CD-ROM that we will provide, along with various sample files, and follow along with the demonstrations on their own machine.
