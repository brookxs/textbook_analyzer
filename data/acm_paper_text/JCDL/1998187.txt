Introducing Mr. DLib, a Machine-readable Digital Library
In this demonstration-paper we present Mr. DLib, a machine-readable digital library. Mr. DLib provides access to several millions of articles in full-text and their metadata in XML and JSON format via a RESTful Web Service. In addition, Mr. DLib provides related documents for given academic articles. The service is intended to serve researchers who need bibliographic data and full-text of scholarly literature for their analyses (e.g. impact and trend analysis); providers of academic services who need additional information to enhance their own services (e.g. literature recommendations); and providers who want to build their own services based on data from Mr. DLib.
