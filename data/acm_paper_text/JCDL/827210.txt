Processing and formatting system for digital collections
This system is being used to build structure data for the HEARTH digital collection and to manage the collection under the DLXS system. It allows student workers or unskilled employees to build structure metadata from scanned images for both monographs and serials, and manages the process of delivering the titles under DLXS once prepared. It allows supervisors to manage the work, simplifying tasks like re-assigning the in-progress work of graduated students.
