Workshop on the creation of standardized test collections, tasks and metrics for music information retrieval (MIR) and music digital library (MDL) evaluation
This workshop is designed to engage the participation of all those interested in MIR and MDL research and evaluation. Interested parties have been encouraged to submit formal "White Papers" outlining their individual perspectives on what needs to be done to create meaningful MIR and MDL test collections, retrieval tasks and evaluation metrics. Interested parties include musicologists, music theorists, audio-retrieval experts, symbolic-retrieval experts, librarians, lawyers, and business representatives. The compilation of these perspectives and the discussion that follows at the workshop are intended to form the bedrock upon which a solid foundation of future research can be built.
