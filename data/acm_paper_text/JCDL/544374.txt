Usability for digital libraries
As digital libraries are becoming increasingly available to, and used by, diverse user communities who do not have background or training in information sciences, the need to ensure that such libraries are usable and useful is becoming increasingly urgent. Usability issues can be tackled from various directions - technical, cognitive, social, design-oriented - and it is important to bring these different perspectives together, to share views, experiences and insights.
