Do public library websites consider the disabled or senior citizens?
The issues of mobility and sight impairment with respect to virtual accessibility are as important as physical accessibility when it comes to using public library services. However, few studies have discussed public library website accessibility from the perspective of underrepresented user groups. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accessibility of websites of public libraries and further identify the association between accessibility and public libraries' budgets. The study selected 20 public library systems that have the highest percentages of the disabled or senior citizen patrons. The study employed the Pearson correlation test in order to investigate the correlation between the accessibility and the budgets of public libraries. Preliminary findings show that most current public library websites do not comply with the Section 508. The findings indicate that public libraries did not consider their users or potential users with physical disabilities when designing their websites. Therefore, the findings suggest that public library websites are not suited to deliver effective information services for underrepresented user populations who need special assistance. Furthermore, this study finds that there is no significant association between the public library websites' accessibility and the budgets.
