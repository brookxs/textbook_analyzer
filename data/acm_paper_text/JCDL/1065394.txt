A web service framework for embedding discovery services in distributed library interfaces
Significant barriers deter web page designers and developers from incorporating dynamic content from web services into their page designs. Web services typically require designers to learn service protocols and have access to and knowledge of dynamic application servers or CGI in order to incorporate dynamic content into their pages. This paper describes a framework for embedding discovery services in distributed interfaces that seeks to simplify this process and eliminate these barriers, making the use of the dynamic content available to a wider audience and increasing its potential for adoption and use in educational design.
