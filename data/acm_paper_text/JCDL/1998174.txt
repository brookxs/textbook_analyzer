Representing educational content in digital library resources
A rubric for representing the educational content of digital resources was developed and tested in an experiment with preservice teachers. The ADMIRE (Analyzing Digital Materials In Resources for Education) rubric codes 11 types of digital content organized into five major categories; codes and categories are drawn from learning science and instructional research. The ADMIRE rubric was used to analyze the types of content present in digital resources that preservice teachers accepted or rejected for classroom use during instructional planning. Results show that the ADMIRE rubric provides a useful method to understand teachers' success in online search and the types of educational content that they value during instructional planning.
