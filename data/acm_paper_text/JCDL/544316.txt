Planning for future digital libraries programs
This panel will discuss alternatives for follow-on Federal program activities to the Interagency Digital Libraries Initiative - Phase 2 (DLI-2). The current Digital Libraries Initiative - Phase 2 awards receive final funding increments in FY 2003. The National Science Foundation and other interested agencies wish to begin informal planning for potential follow-on activities to DLI-2 at this time. As in the past, sponsoring agencies look to the various stakeholder communities to assist in the creation of funding programs that are responsive to values, needs and opportunities.Panelists will present viewpoints as to the most important topical elements and effective program structures in light of the continuing rapid evolution of digital libraries technologies, computing and communication infrastructures and dramatic increase in networked digital content. Audience remarks will be encouraged, particularly suggestions for enabling broad community involvement in the planning dialogue.
