Workshop 3: classification crosswalks
Mapping between/among classification schemes is beneficial within an organization that has a number of implicit schemes, between organizations seeking to exchange information, and in a digital library context where collections are organized by different classifications. This cross scheme mapping could be done manually, but if many schemes are to be mapped, it may be desirable to provide automated tools and techniques to support the process. This workshop will present research and projects that identify the state-of-the-practice and outline the research agenda. In addition to the educational part of the program, the afternoon will be devoted to ongoing NKOS activities related to a vocabulary mark-up language, mechanisms for search and retrieval of online knowledge organization sources, and a typology for describing knowledge organization sources that supports the development of knowledge organization services on the Web. The program is available from the NKOS Web site at http://nkos.slis.kent.edu.
