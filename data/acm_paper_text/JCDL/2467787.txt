CORE: aggregation use cases for open access
The push for free online availability of research outputs promoted by the Open Access (OA) movement is undoubtedly transforming the publishing industry. However, the mere availability of research outputs is insufficient. To exploit the full potential of OA, it must be possible to search, discover, mine, analyse, etc. this content. To achieve this, it is essential to improve the existing OA technical infrastructure to effectively support these functionalities. Many of the vital benefits of OA are expected to come with the ability to reuse OA content in unanticipated ways. Access to the OA content must therefore be flexible, yet practical, content-based and not just metadata based. In this demonstration, we present the CORE system, which aggregates millions of OA resources from hundreds of OA repositories and journals. We discuss the use cases aggregations should support and demonstrate how the CORE system addresses them, including searching, discovering, mining and analyzing content. We also show how aggregated OA content can be reused to build new applications on top of CORE's functionality.
