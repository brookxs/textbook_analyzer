Designing exploratory search tasks for user studies of information seeking support systems
This poster describes a procedure for designing exploratory tasks for use in laboratory evaluations of information seeking interfaces. This procedure is grounded in the literature on information seeking and information retrieval and has been refined by an evaluation of four tasks designed for a study of a faceted library catalog. The procedure is intended to be extensible to generate exploratory tasks for other types of interfaces and domains.
