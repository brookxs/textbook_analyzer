Shakespeare, god, and lonely hearts: transforming data access with many eyes
Data visualization has historically been accessible only to the technological elite. It is, after all, "serious" technology done by experts for experts. But recent web-based visualizations - ranging from political art projects to news stories - have reached millions. Unfortunately, while lay users can view sophisticated visualizations, they have few ways to create them. In order to "democratize" visualization, we have built Many Eyes, a web site where people may upload their own data, create interactive visualizations, and carry on conversations. By making these tools available to anyone on the web, the site fosters a social style of data analysis that empowers users to engage with public data through discussion and collaboration. Political discussions, citizen activism, religious conversations, game playing, and educational exchanges are all happening on Many Eyes. The public nature of these visualizations provides users with a transformative path to information literacy.
