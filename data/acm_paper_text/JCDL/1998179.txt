RFV: interactive geographical visualization for citation network exploration
Research Field Visualizer (RFV) is a system designed to visualize citation chains for publications within specific disciplines. RFV overlays publication information on geographical displays to aid in locating dense areas of research based on different search criteria, thus exposing a network of interconnected ideas across the world. Within this geographical context, RFV provides an interactive visualization of citation networks, allowing the user to explore chains of publication Our intention is to help people that want to learn about a field, such as prospective graduate students, understand current research directions, track research history, and ultimately find the places where authors are conducting relevant and interesting research.
