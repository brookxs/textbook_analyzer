A framework for collaborative information environments and unified access to distributed digital content
In this demo, we will present two prototypes of digital information portals developed using a new common framework: The High Performance Computing Virtual Consultant and the Tsunami Digital Library. This framework supports the creation of digital library portals that include not only local data but distributed content that is not under the control of the portal maintainers, such as remote web sites. The framework provides a common user interface across all resources, even if the resources are served by a remote web site. Furthermore, the framework contains features that support effective low maintenance operation and intelligent learning search and layout algorithms.
