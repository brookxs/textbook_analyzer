Addressing diverse corpora with cluster-based term weighting
Highly heterogeneous collections present difficulties to term weighting models that are informed by corpus-level frequencies. Collections which span multiple languages or large time periods do not provide realistic statistics on which words are interesting to a system. This paper presents a case where diverse corpora can frustrate term weighting and proposes a modification that weighs documents according to their class or cluster within the collection. In cases of diverse corpora, the proposed modification better represents the intuitions behind corpus-level document frequencies.
