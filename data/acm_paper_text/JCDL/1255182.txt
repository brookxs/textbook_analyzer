Factors affecting website reconstruction from the web infrastructure
When a website is suddenly lost without a backup, it maybe reconstituted by probing web archives and search engine caches for missing content. In this paper we describe an experiment where we crawled and reconstructed 300 randomly selected websites on a weekly basis for 14 weeks. The reconstructions were performed using our web-repository crawler named Warrick which recovers missing resources from the Web Infrastructure (WI), the collective preservation effort of web archives and search engine caches. We examine several characteristics of the websites over time including birth rate, decay and age of resources. We evaluate the reconstructions when compared to the crawled sites and develop a statistical model for predicting reconstruction success from the WI. On average, we were able to recover 61\% of each website's resources. We found that Google's PageRank, number of hops and resource age were the three most significant factors in determining if a resource would be recovered from the WI.
