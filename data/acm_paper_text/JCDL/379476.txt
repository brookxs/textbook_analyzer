Comprehensive access to printed materials (CAPM)
The CAPM Project features the development and evaluation of an automat ed, robotic on-demand scanning system for materials at remote locations. To date, we have developed a book retrieval robot and a valuation analysis framework for evaluating CAPM. We intend to augment CAPM by exploring approaches for automated page turning and improved valuation. These extensions will results in a more fully automated CAPM system and a valuation framework that will not only be useful for assessing CAPM specifically, but also for library services and functions generally.
