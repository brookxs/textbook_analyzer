Exploiting time-based synonyms in searching document archives
Query expansion of named entities can be employed in order to increase the retrieval effectiveness. A peculiarity of named entities compared to other vocabulary terms is that they are very dynamic in appearance, and synonym relationships between terms change with time. In this paper, we present an approach to extracting synonyms of named entities over time from the whole history of Wikipedia. In addition, we will use their temporal patterns as a feature in ranking and classifying them into two types, i.e., time-independent or time-dependent. Time-independent synonyms are invariant to time, while time-dependent synonyms are relevant to a particular time period, i.e., the synonym relationships change over time. Further, we describe how to make use of both types of synonyms to increase the retrieval effectiveness, i.e., query expansion with time-independent synonyms for an ordinary search, and query expansion with time-dependent synonyms for a search wrt. temporal criteria. Finally, through an evaluation based on TREC collections, we demonstrate how retrieval performance of queries consisting of named entities can be improved using our approach.
