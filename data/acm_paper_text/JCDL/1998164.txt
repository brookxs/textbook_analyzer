WPv4: a re-imagined Walden's paths to support diverse user communities
The Walden's Paths Project, as part of our philosophy of continual evaluation, seeks out user communities who may find our tool useful. However, our users, in the last few years, have reported a series of common issues and desired features. In order to support our users, we initiated a redesign of Walden's Paths to solve these problems and enable us to rapidly prototype and experiment with features and interfaces. In order to accomplish these goals, we have created a web service that handles the storage and representation of our Path data structure. This service is isolated from user interface layers, allowing multiple interface designs to be implemented on top of the same Path data structures. Our prototype interfaces also represent new areas for Paths such as collaborative work, offline presentation, and mobile computing.
