Chinese calligraphy specific style rendering system
Manifesting the handwriting characters with the specific style of a famous artwork is fascinating. In this paper, a system is built to render the user's handwriting characters with a specific style. A stroke database is established firstly. When rendering a character, the strokes are extracted and recognized, then proper radicals and strokes are filtered, finally these strokes are deformed and the result is generated. The Special Nine Grid (SNG) is presented to help recognize radicals and strokes. The Rule-base Stroke Deformation Algorithm (RSDA) is proposed to deform the original strokes according to the handwriting strokes. The rendering result manifests the specific style with high quality. It is feasible for people to generate the tablet or other artworks with the proposed system.
