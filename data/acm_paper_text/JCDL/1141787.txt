Curriculum development for digital libraries
The Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science (VT CS) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science (UNC SILS) have launched a curriculum development project in the area of digital libraries. Educational resources will be developed based on the ACM/IEEE-CS Computing Curriculum 2001. Lesson plans and modules will be developed in a variety of areas (that cover the topics of papers and conference sessions in the field), evaluated by experts in those areas, and then pilot tested in CS and LIS courses. An analysis of papers on digital library-related topics from several corpora was performed, to identify the areas in which more and less work has already been performed on these topics; this analysis will guide the initial stages of this curriculum development.
