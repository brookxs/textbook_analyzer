Digital gazetteers: integration into distributed digital library services
This NKOS workshop for JCDL (the 5th in the series: http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/) will focus on work-in-progress on gazetteer services and gazetteer-related projects in connection with distributed digital library services. It builds on the Digital Gazetteer Information Exchange (DGIE) workshop funded by the NSF in October 1999.Digital gazetteers are specialized KOS that map placenames and types of places to map-based locations and thus integrate word-based georeferencing to map-based georeferencing. The format consists of invited and selected presentations and discussion sessions, with the goal of developing collaborations for future research and development.Participants may provide handouts describing their own gazetteer and other NKOS related projects and will be given the opportunity to introduce their work and their interests briefly.
