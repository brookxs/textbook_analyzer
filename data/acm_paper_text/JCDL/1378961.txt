Note-taking, selecting, and choice: designing interfaces that encourage smaller selections
Our research develops note-taking applications for educational environments. Previous studies found that while copy-pasting notes can be more efficient than typing, for some users it reduces attention and learning. This paper presents two studies aimed at designing and evaluating interfaces that encourage focusing. While we were able to produce interfaces that increased desirable behaviors and improved satisfaction, the new interfaces did not improve learning. We suggest design recommendations derived from these studies, and describe a "selecting-to-read" behavior we encountered, which has implications for the design of reading and note-taking applications.
