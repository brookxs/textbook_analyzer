Library leaders on digital libraries and the future of the research library: a panel discussion
This panel presents perspectives from a group of research library leaders on the evolving relationships between the body of systems, services and technologies associated with digital libraries and the institution of the research library. Four panelists and the moderator will consider many questions, including whether libraries are being too timid or overly aggressive in engaging the world of digital libraries; the extent to which digital library technologies may threaten the future of the research library; and how changes in the practices of science and scholarship due to information technology and digital content will help shape the future of the research library and the integration of digital library technologies. We will also examine the possible roles of research libraries in helping to make digital library projects sustainable. The panel will also include time for questions from the audience.
