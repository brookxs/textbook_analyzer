Developing digital libraries education and training programs
Gaining education and training in the field of Digital Libraries is a difficult prospect. Relevant courses and experiences are usually scattered among different programs and institutions. Often, course content does not include the necessary mix of the theoretical and practical treatment. The workshop is aimed at developers, researchers, educators, and administrators interested in educational programs for training next generation of digital library professionals - both information technologists and librarians.
