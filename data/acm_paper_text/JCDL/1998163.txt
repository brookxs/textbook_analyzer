An analysis of personal collections among users of social media
We have been developing a system to support the management of collections of web-based resources called the Distributed Collection Manager (DCM). As work on DCM has progressed, questions about the characteristics of people's collections of web pages have arisen. Simultaneously, work in the area of social media technology has ignored investigating how people are trying to maintain their collections. In order to address these concerns, we performed an online user study of 125 individuals from a variety of online and offline communities. From this study we were able to examine the needs for a system to manage web-based distributed collections, how current tools affect maintenance, and the characteristics of current practices and problems in maintaining web-based collections.
