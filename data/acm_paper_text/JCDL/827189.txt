Integrating digital libraries into learning environments: the LEBONED approach
This paper presents the project LEBONED that focuses on the integration of digital libraries and their contents into web-based learning environments. We describe in general how the architecture of a standard learning management system has to be modified to enable the integration of digital libraries. An important part of this modification is the LEBONED Metadata Architecture which depicts the handling of metadata and documents imported from digital libraries. The main components of this architecture and their interrelation are presented in detail. Afterwards we show a practical application of the concepts described before: The integration of the digital library eVerlage into the learning management system Blackboard.
