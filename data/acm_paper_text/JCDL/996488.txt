Using digital libraries to build educational communities: the chemcollective
The ChemCollective is a new project in the targeted research track of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL). The project (http://www chemcollective org) was launched in spring 2004 at the National American Chemical Society (ACS) and National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) meetings. The research goal is to explore the degree to which digital library structures can attract and support a community of educators working towards a common vision of educational reform.
