How do users' search tactic selections influence search outputs in exploratory search tasks?
This study investigates the relationships between users' search tactic selections and search outputs while conducting exploratory searches in digital libraries. Frequencies of different types of search tactics applied in an exploratory search task were counted. Based on correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis, we identified types of search tactics that are associated with aspectual recall. Preliminary results indicate that browsing and evaluating item tactics affect aspectual recall in exploratory search tasks.
