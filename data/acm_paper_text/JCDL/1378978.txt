Digmap: a service for searching and browsing old maps
DIGMAP aims to become the main international resource discovery service for digitized old maps existing in libraries. The service reuses metadata from European national libraries and other relevant third party metadata sources. The gathered metadata is enhanced locally with geographical indexing and with record linking/clustering, leveraging on geographic gazetteers and authority files. When available, the images of the maps are also processed to extract potentially relevant features. This made it possible to develop a rich integrated environment for searching and browsing services with four perspectives: image's features, textual, geographic and temporal information.
