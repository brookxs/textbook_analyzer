The variety of ways in which instructors implement a modular digital library curriculum
With support from the National Science Foundation, researchers at Virginia Tech and the University of North Carolina developed a curriculum framework and a number of modules for instruction in the area of digital libraries. In 2008, 15 different modules were field tested by 11 instructors at 10 different institutions. As might be expected, instructors adapted these modules to fit the context of their courses, some of which are described here.
