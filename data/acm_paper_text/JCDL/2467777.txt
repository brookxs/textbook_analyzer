Mapping the intersection of science and philosophy
This poster presents what we believe to be the first attempt to empirically measure and visualize the cross-pollination of science and philosophy through citation patterns. Using the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy as a proxy for the philosophical literature, we plot SEP citations onto the UCSD Map of Science to highlight areas of science which overlap with philosophical discussion. An outline of further studies is also discussed.
