Improving simulation management systems through ontology generation and utilization
Content from simulation systems is useful in defining domain ontologies. We describe a digital library process to generate and leverage domain ontologies to support simulation systems tasks. Workflow ontologies may be used to define compositions of simulation-related services. Simulation model ontologies may be used in customizing collection management systems for tasks such as organization, interface construction, and metadata record generation.
