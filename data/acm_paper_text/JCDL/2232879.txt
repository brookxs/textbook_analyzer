A preliminary analysis of FRBR's bibliographic relationships for path based associative rules
The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (hereafter FRBR) has been adopted to address the relationships for bibliographic records and the related aggregate works. However, an approach to transform FRBR-based bibliographic relationships and their patterns into path-based rules for retrieval, navigation, display and data mining in the bibliographic space is still lacking. This study used the FRBR as a basis to analyze bibliographic relationships and their path-based rules. The novel "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" was used as a case study. Up until now, 87 unique records were retrieved from OCLC's Open WorldCat for analysis. Two specialists in library and information science familiar with FRBR conducted in-depth analysis to achieve inter-reliability agreement. This study generalizes several patterns of path-based rules for associating bibliographic records and outlines related issues for future study.
