Feasibility of developing curriculum standards metadata
We asked 18 teachers about their use of video and digital video in the classroom. In general teachers desired digital collections organized by curriculum objectives because curriculum objectives allowed them to quickly narrow search results based on particular units and objectives. To understand the implications for creating metadata, an example video was tagged according to 3 different state curricular standards. The time intensive task required both in-depth knowledge of the video and of the standards. This finding has implications for third party metadata generation.
