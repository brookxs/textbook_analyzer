Advanced overview of version 2.0 of the open archives initiative protocol for metadata harvesting
This tutorial is a follow-on to "Introduction to the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting" (OAI-PMH), given earlier the same day. It is appropriate for those who have completed the earlier tutorial or are already familiar with OAI-PMH. The tutorial will begin by highlighting the differences between versions 1.1 and 2.0 of the OAI-PMH, and then discuss possible migration strategies for 1.1 harvesters and repositories. Advanced topics and deployment scenarios will also be discussed, including: flow control, load balancing, error recovery, hierarchical harvesting, sets and alternate metadata formats.
