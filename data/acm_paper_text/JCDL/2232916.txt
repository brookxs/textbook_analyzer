The David Livingstone spectral imaging project
The David Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project is a collaborative, international effort to use spectral imaging technology and digital publishing to make available a series of faded, illegible texts produced by the famous Victorian explorer when he was stranded without ink or writing paper in Central Africa. The poster describes existing achievements of the project, plans for an innovative portal providing access to images and data, and preservation challenges.
