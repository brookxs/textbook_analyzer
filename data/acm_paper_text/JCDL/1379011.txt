A unique insight into department of energy research accomplishments: a special collection
This poster describes online access to a unique collection of Department of Energy (DOE) Research and Development (R&D) accomplishments. The collection features research of DOE and its predecessor agencies, the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). This special collection contains historically significant government documents, including items from the Manhattan Project era, that have been specially selected and digitized to make them accessible via the Web. Landmark documents in the collection include The Eightfold Way: A Theory of Strong Interaction Symmetry (authored by Nobel prize winner Murray Gell-Mann) and The First Weighing of Plutonium (authored by Nobel prize winner Glenn Seaborg). In addition to a database of approximately 250 specially-selected documents, all related aspects of the collection (documents, research areas, and/or Nobel Laureate information) are combined in Feature Topic pages for the added value of a single point of access to each compilation. Over sixty (60) Feature Topic pages include diverse topics such as "Video Games - Did They Begin at Brookhaven?" and "Human Genome Research: Decoding DNA". This collection features a large number of DOE-associated Nobel Laureates, including Enrico Fermi, winner of the 1938 Nobel prize in physics, and George Smoot, winner of the 2006 Nobel prize in physics, and showcases a diversity in DOE research areas, including solar energy (with related educational materials) and Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that are used to power spacecraft. Easy access to this unique collection is provided via DOE R&D Accomplishments at http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments. This special collection is continually growing, with additional Nobel Laureate and/or research topic documents and features being added on a regular basis.
