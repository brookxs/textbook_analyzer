The digital ideakeeper: integrating digital libraries with a scaffolded environment for online inquiry
Online inquiry is an important way of engaging learners in information--rich activities using online sources to explore questions in different fields, such as science. Online inquiry involves a set of interrelated activities, such as planning an investigation; seeking, analyzing, and making sense of online information; and synthesizing information into a final argument. However, learners may encounter several obstacles in trying to tackle an open--ended, complex process like online inquiry. Therefore, using a learner--centered design approach, we are developing the Digital Idea Keeper environment to extend digital libraries by integrating different tools and incorporating different scaffolding approaches to help learners effectively engage in online inquiry.
