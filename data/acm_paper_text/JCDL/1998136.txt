Do graphical search interfaces support effective search for and evaluation of digital library resources
This paper explores the cognitive processes and online behaviors in which preservice teachers engage when seeking educational resources for classroom instruction. Participants used graphical and keyword search interfaces provided by a large-scale digital library (NSDL.org) and a keyword search interface from a large, commercial search engine (Google.com) to complete searches for online materials that would support classroom instruction. Overall, findings from the current work indicate that a graphical search interface can support comprehension by providing a conceptual organization of domain content during digital search and evaluation. Findings also show that digital libraries allow users to offload processing related to resource trustworthiness, thereby increasing cognitive capacity for other purposes.
