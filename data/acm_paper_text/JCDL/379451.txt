Arc: an OAI service provider for cross-archive searching
The usefulness of the many on-line journals and scientific digital lib raries that exist today is limited by the lack of a service that can federate them through a unified interface. The Open Archive Initiative (OAI) is one major effort to address technical interoperability among distributed archives. The objective of OAI is to develop a framework to facilitate the discovery of content in distributed archives. In this paper, we describe our experience and lessons learned in building Arc, the first federated searching service based on the OAI protocol. Arc harvests metadata from several OAI compliant archives, normalizes them, and stores them in a search service based on a relational database (MySQL or Oracle). At present we have over 165K metadata records from 16 data providers from various domains.
