Distinguishing venues by writing styles
A principal goal for most research scientists is to publish. There are different kinds of publications covering different topics and requiring different writing formats. While authors tend to have unique personal writing styles, no work has been carried out to find out whether publication venues are distinguishable by their writing styles. Our work takes the first step into exploring this problem. Using the traditional classification approach and carrying out experiments on real data from the CiteSeer digital library, we demonstrate that venues are also distinguished by their writing styles.
