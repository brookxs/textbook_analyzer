Publishing earthquake engineering research data
Earthquake engineering brings together researchers from seismology, structural, mechanical, and geotechnical engineering whose research results in saving lives and protecting property during earthquakes and tsunamis. Such diversity poses unique challenges for data management, data archiving, preservation, and data publication. The poster demonstrates new innovative approaches to curation, visualization, and publishing of earthquake engineering research data in the NEEShub, a collaborative platform that provides a combined virtual research environment and data repository to researchers participating in the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulations (NEES) and to the earthquake engineering community in general. The poster provides graphical depictions demonstrating the curation workflows established in NEES, the progression of data from unprocessed sensor measurements to datasets that can be analyzed by a variety of analytical and visualization tools, and finally their transformation into a citable published product. It documents ways in which NEEShub exposes research data and facilitates collaboration and sharing, as well as re-use and repurposing of the datasets. Furthermore, the poster illustrates some of the successes of the NEEShub in its four years of existence including continuous growth in uploaded files, users, number of downloaded files, curated projects, and published datasets.
