Supporting revisitation with contextual suggestions
Web browsers provide only little support for users to revisit pages that they do not visit very often. We developed a browser toolbar that reminds users of visited pages related to the page that they currently viewing. The recommendation method combines ranking with propagation methods. A user evaluation shows that on average 22.7\% of the revisits were triggered by the toolbar, a considerable change on the participants' revisitation routines. In this paper we discuss the value of the recommendations and the implications derived from the evaluation.
