Creativity support: the mixed-initiative composition space
Creativity support is an important and challenging emerging area of research. combinFormation is being developed as a tool to support creativity through a mixed-initiative composition space. The system combines searches and information feeds, representing relevant information collections as compositions of image and text surrogates. The composition space affords human manipulation. This method has been shown to support information discovery in The Design Process, an interdisciplinary undergraduate course. In this demo, we demonstrate how combinFormation can be used to explore and discover information in digital libraries such as ACM Digital Library and the International Children's Digital Library.
