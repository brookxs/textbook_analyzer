MOOD-lighting: massive open online discovery using solr and blacklight
In this poster, we present findings from the user experience and metadata perspectives of using Blacklight and Solr to combine large and distinct resource sets. We also share results of a survey of academic and educational institutions on their approaches to Solr indexing and end-user options and identify next steps toward articulating best practices for user experience around discovery in the context of metadata.
