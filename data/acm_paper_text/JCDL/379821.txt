Workshop 5: information visualization for digital libraries: defining a research agenda for heterogeneous multimedia collections
This workshop will emphasize small group discussion and brainstorming to explore issues of visualization for heterogeneous digital libraries. The power of visualization lies in its ability to convey information at the high bandwidth of the human perceptual system, facilitating recognition of patterns in the information space, and supporting navigation in large collections. How do we extend these benefits to collections that span the range of digital media? Participants will explore this issue, with the aim of identifying a research agenda.
