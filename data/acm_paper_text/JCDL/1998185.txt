When personalization meets socialization: an iCADAL approach
CADAL has been a large-scale non-profit digital library. Besides various search facilities in the CADAL portal, we designed and implemented the iCADAL system for providing the user-oriented micro-content services on one million books in CADAL. Users of iCADAL can receive the stream of short messages of lending, annotation and the other reading activities shared by their followees in a twitter-like way, which combines socialization with personalization. Our implementation makes extensive use of open source softwares, i.e. Pylons, Cassandra, in order to support the high-traffic online micro-content services.
