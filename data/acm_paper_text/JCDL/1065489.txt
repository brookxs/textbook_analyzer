Facilitating the effective use of earth science data in education through digital libraries: bridging the gap between scientists and educators
Creating learning modules that utilize Earth data is a difficult task, requiring knowledge about the data, science, curriculum design, and the educational context. The Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) Data Services group hosted a workshop to bridge the knowledge gap between data providers and educators by assembling teams of experts in these areas to create data-rich learning modules. Face-to-face collaboration allowed the sharing of perspectives and encouraged the contribution of individual expertise, facilitating development of data-rich modules.
