Docear: an academic literature suite for searching, organizing and creating academic literature
In this demonstration-paper we introduce Docear, an 'academic literature suite'. Docear offers to scientists what an office suite like Microsoft Office offers to office workers. While an office suite bundles various applications for office workers (word processing, spreadsheets, presentation software, etc.), Docear bundles several applications for scientists: academic search engine, PDF reader, reference manager, word processor, mind mapping module, and recommender system. Besides Docear's general concept, its special features are presented in this paper, namely a modular composition, free full-text access to literature, information management as mind map, automatic metadata extraction of PDFs and recommendations.
