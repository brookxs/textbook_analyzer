A digital collections management system based on open source software
Robust and flexible digital collections management and presentation software is essential for creating and delivering digital collections. But digital library technologies and contents are not static. Continual evolution and investment are required to maintain the digital library. Few commercial digital library products are comprehensive and extensible enough to support this evolution. Many of these systems are in early release and have not been used and tested widely. Some require an initial investment in license fees or staff time that we could not afford. None of the products covered the full range of functionality needed for our digital library.
