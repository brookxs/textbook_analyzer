Persistent annotations deserve new URIs
Some digital libraries support annotations, but sharing these annotations with other systems or across the web is difficult because of the need of special applications to read and decode these annotations. Due to the frequent change of web resources, the annotation's meaning can change if the underlying resources change. This project concentrates on minting a new URI for every annotation and creating a persistent and independent archived version of all resources. Users should be able to select a segment of an image or a video to be part of the annotation. The media fragment URIs described in the Open Annotation Collaboration data model can be used, but in practice they have limits, and they face the lack of support by the browsers. So in this project the segments of images, and videos can be used in the annotations without using media fragment URIs.
