Locating thematic pinpoints in narrative texts with short phrases: a test study on Don Quixote
Traditional implementations provide only limited assistance for locating the information in narrative texts relevant to a certain point of interest. We are investigating providing a "reading wheel" for such purposes. The first step of the bigger picture, as inspired by the editorial compilation of a textbook's index, is an attempt to locate thematically coherent sentences to a given short phrase. In this paper, we propose a two-step methodology to increase the search performance and examine its effectiveness in a test study. We describe the experimental setup and report on the quantitative evaluation of the techniques involved.
