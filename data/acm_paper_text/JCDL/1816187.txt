AIRFrame: integrating diverse digital collections in astrobiology
Astrobiology is an inherently interdisciplinary field concerned with questions of life in the universe. This paper describes the design and ongoing implementation of the Astrobiology Integrative Research Framework (AIRFrame), an open source, ontology-driven information system designed to ingest and analyze heterogeneous inputs of both published and unpublished data, and to identify and illustrate latent connections between research in astrobiology's diverse constituent fields.
