Legal deposit of digital publications: a review of research and development activity
There is a global trend towards extending legal deposit to include dig ital publications in order to maintain comprehensive national archives. However, including digital publications in legal deposit regulation is not enough to ensure the long-term preservation of these publications. Concepts, principles and practices accepted and understood in the print environment, may have new meanings or no longer be appropriate in a networked environment. Mechanisms for identifying, selecting and depositing digital material either do not exist, or are inappropriate, for some kinds of digital publication. Work on developing digital preservation strategies is at an early stage. National and other deposit libraries are at the forefront of research and develop in this area, often working in partnership with other libraries, publishers and technology vendors. Most work is of a technical nature. There is some work on developing policies and strategies for managing digital resources. However, not all management issues or users needs are being addressed.
