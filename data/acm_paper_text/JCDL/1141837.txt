Evaluating the national science digital library
NSDL Core Integration is conducting a program-wide evaluation of all NSDL program activities. The evaluation will inventory and describe NSDL achievements to date, and identify directions for future development. The scale and complexity of the NSDL program - 200 projects over 5 years - poses significant challenges for the evaluation. The poster outlines the theoretical and practical approaches being used to guide and coordinate evaluation activities.
