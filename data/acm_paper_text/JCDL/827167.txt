Learning digital library technology across borders
This paper describes the background context and initial findings from an ongoing case study of an electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) digital library (DL) project in Brazil. The specific focus of the case study centers on the activities of a Brazilian government agency acting as a mediator between software developers - primarily academic institutions in the United States - and university clients in Brazil. The authors highlight the loosely integrated nature of the DL technology, and the uncertain relationship between developers and users in terms of support. These circumstances reinforce a view of technology transfer as a process of organizational learning. As a consequence, the mediating institution in the study is viewed as assuming multiple roles in advancing the project.
