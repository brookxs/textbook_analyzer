Semantic alerting for digital libraries
We previously investigated the support of alerting services across networks of heterogeneous digital libraries. We now report the first generation of semantically enhanced digital library alerting systems. Where previous alerting services have provided users with notifications of new library content using traditional metadata, we demonstrate the advantages and challenges of using semantic technologies. This uncovers key issues that are not yet fully understood in general event-based systems (including alerting systems).
