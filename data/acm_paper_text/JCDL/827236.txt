Palau Community College-Belau National Museum image archives digitization and access project
This poster presentation will describe a collaboration project between the Palau Community College (PCC) Library and the Belau National Museum (BNM). The project, funded by a two-year U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership Grant, will enhance access to the BNM Media Collection. The Media Collection is in great demand, and the pressures of human use exacerbate an already tenuous situation for the long-term preservation of the images. While digitization is not viewed as the preservation solution, it will assist the Museum to lessen the impact of human handling. By making the Media Collection more accessible through integration of the PCC Library's online catalog, a much wider audience will be reached, and mishandling of the original images will be significantly reduced.The PCC website, currently under final development will link the Library WebCollection Plus which will contain digitized images selected from the extensive photo archives, as well as digitized images of the ethnographic and other objects in the Museum's collection, including contemporary art. This poster session will enable viewers to see the range of images included in the project.This poster presentation will enable researchers to learn how this project will support scholarly research.
