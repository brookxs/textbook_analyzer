Digital Donne: workflow, editing tools, and the reader.s interface of a collection of 17th-century english poetry
We describe a multidisciplinary effort in the creation of an electronic repository of poems of John Donne - the renowned 17th-century English poet. We discuss the workflow we have adopted and the Web-based tools we have developed for maintaining a collection of transcriptions and images, a concordance of poems, a list of press variants, and a browsing interface that enables readers to access these materials. A complement to the multi-volume Variorum Edition of the Poetry of John Donne , this endeavor shows how a traditional scholarly edition can be enhanced by resources made available by computers and the Internet.
