The digital atlas of American religion
In this demonstration-paper we introduce DAAR, the Digital Atlas of American Religion (www.religionatlas.org). The DAAR is a web-based research platform with innovative data exploration and visualization tools to support research in the humanities. Using a user-centered design approach, we incorporated historic religion data on adherence, membership, and congregations with historic census data and new religion typologies as the test-bed for the tools that we developed to establish the technology infrastructure and framework that can be used for other humanities data.
