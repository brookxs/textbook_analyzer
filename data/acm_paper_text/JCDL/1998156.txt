Digital archives of taiwan agricultural history during the japanese colonial period
The National Chung Hsing University Library has built a digital archive about Taiwan agricultural history. The content is unique in that it covers historical materials about Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period from 1895 to 1945, and that they are all available in full text, in addition to metadata. To make these materials more accessible to the research and education community, a user-centered retrieval system incorporated with multi-language, subject browsing, cluster analysis, topic map, post-query classification methods was developed to help users find the inter-relationships among documents and the collective meaning of a sub-collection. Such system is anticipated to help advance research in Taiwan agricultural history and set a model for other similar endeavor.
