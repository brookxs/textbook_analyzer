Semantically augmented annotations in digitized map collections
Historic maps are valuable scholarly resources that record information often retained by no other written source. With the YUMA Map Annotation Tool we want to facilitate collaborative annotation for scholars studying historic maps, and allow for semantic augmentation of annotations with structured, contextually relevant information retrieved from Linked Open Data sources. We believe that the integration of Web resource linkage into the scholarly annotation process is not only relevant for collaborative research, but can also be exploited to improve search and retrieval. In this paper, we introduce the COMPASS Experiment, an ongoing crowdsourcing effort in which we are collecting data that can serve as a basis for evaluating our assumption. We discuss the scope and setup of the experiment framework and report on lessons learned from the data collected so far.
