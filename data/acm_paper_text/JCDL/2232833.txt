Modeling and exploiting heterogeneous bibliographic networks for expertise ranking
Recently expertise retrieval has received increasing interests in both academia and industry. Finding experts with demonstrated expertise for a given query is a nontrivial task especially from a large-scale Web 2.0 systems, such as question answering and bibliography data, where users are actively publishing useful content online, interacting with each other, and forming social networks in various ways, leading to heterogeneous networks in addition to the large amounts of textual content information. Many approaches have been proposed and shown to be useful for expertise ranking. However, most of these methods only consider the textual documents while ignoring heterogeneous network structures or can merely integrate with one additional kind of information. None of them can fully exploit the characteristics of heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a joint regularization framework to enhance expertise retrieval by modeling heterogeneous networks as regularization constraints on top of document-centric model. We argue that multi-typed linking edges reveal valuable information which should be treated differently. Motivated by this intuition, we formulate three hypotheses to capture unique characteristics for different graphs, and mathematically model those hypotheses jointly with the document and other information. To illustrate our methodology, we apply the framework to expert finding applications using a bibliography dataset with 1.1 million papers and 0.7 million authors. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve significantly better results than the baseline and other enhanced models.
