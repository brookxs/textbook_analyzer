Spatiotemporal mapping of Wikipedia concepts
Space and time are important dimensions in the representation of a large number of concepts. However there exists no available resource that provides spatiotemporal mappings of generic concepts. Here we present a link-analysis based method for extracting the main locations and periods associated to all Wikipedia concepts. Relevant locations are selected from a set of geotagged articles, while relevant periods are discovered using a list of people with associated life periods. We analyze article versions over multiple languages and consider the strength of a spatial/temporal reference to be proportional to the number of languages in which it appears. To illustrate the utility of the spatiotemporal mapping of Wikipedia concepts, we present an analysis of cultural interactions and a temporal analysis of two domains. The Wikipedia mapping can also be used to perform rich spatiotemporal document indexing by extracting implicit spatial and temporal references from texts.
