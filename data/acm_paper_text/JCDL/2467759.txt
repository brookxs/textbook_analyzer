A retrospective review on a decade of building a national science digital library to transform STEM education
Since 2000, the National Science Foundation's NSDL program has made many direct contributions to digital library research and STEM education. Originally called the National STEM Digital Library (and now National STEM Distributed Learning), the program catalyzed significant technology developments and served to advance state-of-the-art teaching and learning practices during a period of dramatic technological change. This poster describes the results of a three-day writing workshop, convened in April 2012, which generated a retrospective report and a series of interviews on the NSDL building process.
