Lessons learned from developing and evaluating a comprehensive digital library for engineering education
Educating the engineering education community in today's digital world requires straightforward yet flexible access to high-quality educational resources. The Teach Engineering and NEEDS (National Engineering Education Delivery System) digital libraries collaborated in 2005 to create and steward the K-Gray Engineering Pathway (EP), a premier portal to comprehensive engineering and computing education resources within the greater National Science Digital Library (NSDL). We collaborated to design navigation, implement features, and find imagery that could effectively address both K-12 and higher education audiences. A system was designed to serve both target audiences, including an expanded simple search on every page to include grade/audience level search fields. This search, on all main pages, also includes a choice of learning resource type and a link to the Advanced Search with expanded search fields. EP tailored many features such as community pages and cataloging to be distinguishable by K-12 versus higher education users. Evaluation studies show that our current strength is a consistent interface with strong usability features. In this paper, we a provide retrospective and summarize our lessons learned and evaluation results, along with our directions for future research and development.
