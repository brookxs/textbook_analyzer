Docear4Word: reference management for microsoft word based on BibTeX and the citation style language (CSL)
In this demo-paper we introduce Docear4Word which enables researchers to insert and format their references and bibliographies in Microsoft Word. Docear4Word is based on BibTeX and the Citation Style Language (CSL), features over 1,700 citation styles (Harvard, IEEE, ACM, etc.), is published as open source tool on http://docear.org, and runs with Microsoft Word 2002 (and later) on Windows XP (and later). Docear4Word is similar to the MS-Word add-ons that reference managers like Endnote, Zotero, or Citavi offer with the difference that it is being developed to work with the de-facto standard BibTeX and hence to work with almost any reference manager.
