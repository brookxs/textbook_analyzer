Analyzing viewing patterns while reading picture books
We examine the eye movements of children who can read books on their own as they read printed picture books. Our analysis focuses on two points; 1) Is it the pictures or the text that they most frequently gaze at?, and 2) In what sequence do they read picture books? Our results indicate that children look at both text and pictures, but that there are large variations in the ratio of viewing time for each child. Both circular and linear patterns are found in the sequence of eye movements.
