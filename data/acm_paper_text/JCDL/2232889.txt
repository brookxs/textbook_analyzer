CADAL digital calligraphy system
CADAL(China Academic Digital Associate Library) plays a primary role in Universal Digital Library. By the end of 2011, CADAL has digitized 1.85 million books. Chinese calligraphy occupies an important place in Chinese culture, and the collection of digitized Chinese calligraphy is the large part of CADAL resources. So, the services of making full use of the collections are required for diverse users, such as art historians, students and the public. Here we propose a CADAL Digital Calligraphy System, in which over 1,100 works and 100,000 characters are included, the services of multi-level metadata-based search(metadata-based books search, works search and characters search) and multi-grain calligraphic character search(content-based search and radical-based search) are provided. In the end, some search-related applications of CADAL Digital Calligraphy System are discussed.
