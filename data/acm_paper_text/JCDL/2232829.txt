A tale of two studies: is dissemination working?
In this paper we describe preliminary results from two ongoing research projects that investigate the dissemination practices surrounding digital STEM learning materials for undergraduates. This research consists of two related studies, : 1) survey research about the dissemination practices of NSF-funded PIs; and, 2) a case study on the dissemination practices of courseware developers who won the Premier Award for Excellence in Engineering Education. The vast majority of PIs reported in the survey that they do not take advantage of digital dissemination methods such as education digital libraries. Premier Award-winning innovators reported using multiple dissemination methods - traditional and digital. Recommendations are provided regarding how digital library developers might work with PIs to improve dissemination.
