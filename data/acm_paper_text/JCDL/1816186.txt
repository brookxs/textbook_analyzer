Generating citation digests for scientific publications
Science is characterized nowadays by unprecedented growth in the number of publications. Thus it would be helpful if there were a way to summarize the contents of the publications or explain the argumentative relationship between them (e.g. support, further improvement, critique). Such semantic analysis might involve analyzing the citation contexts (the paragraphs where a certain publication is referred to by another publication). Here we present our work on a system that creates the pre-requisites for such analysis by harvesting publications from the web, extracting the contexts from them, and aggregating them into citation digests that are retrieved in the context of user interactions with web sites that mention these publications.
