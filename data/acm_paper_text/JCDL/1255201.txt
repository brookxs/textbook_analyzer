Longitudinal study of changes in blogs
Web-based distributed collections often include links to documents that are expected to change frequently, such as blogs. The study reported here demonstrates that blog changes follow specific patterns. The results also illustrate the substantial role of standardized templates in blog pages. These results extend our earlier models that assess the significance of Web page change from a human perspective. These improved models will enable software systems to assist human collection managers in identifying unexpected changes and aberrant events.
