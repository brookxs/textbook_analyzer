Services for a customizable authority linking environment
The SCALE -- Services for a Customizable Authority Linking Environment-- project is developing tools to help integrate collections within the National Science Foundation's National Science Digital Library(NSDL) through terminological linking. These tools will transparentlyprovide reading support to NSDL collections by automatically linkingphrases in the content of one collection to relevant material in another collection. This will enhance the user experience in the NSDL and encourage greater integration of collections by increasing thevalue of each collection to other collections.
