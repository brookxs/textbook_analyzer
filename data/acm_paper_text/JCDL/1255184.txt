Generating best-effort preservation metadata for web resources at time of dissemination
HTTP and MIME, while sufficient for contemporary webpage access, do not provide enough forensic information to enable the long-term preservation of the resources they describe and transport. But what if the originating web server automatically provided preservation metadata encapsulated with the resource at time of dissemination ? Perhaps the ingestion process could be streamlined, with additional forensic metadata available to future information archeologists. We have adapted an Apache web server implementation of OAI-PMH which can utilize third-party metadata analysis tools to provide a metadata-rich description of each resource. The resource and its forensic metadata are packaged together as a complex object, expressed in plain ASCII and XML. The result is a CRATE: a self-contained preservation-ready version of the resource, created at time of dissemination .
