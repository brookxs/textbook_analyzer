Providing context for digital library content
In 2004, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis created FRASER (Federal Reserve Archival System for Economic Research, http://fraser.stlouisfed.org), a digital library of economic, financial, and banking data and policy documents. The history of American economic policy is documented in these publications, records, and archival materials. It has become evident that FRASER's growing user base needs additional context to improve users? ability to navigate, select, and understand the continually growing content. We have taken three approaches to improve the accessibility of our content: changes to the database, integration with other web databases, and addition of material to support teaching activities. We hope that these changes will broaden our audience and increase site traffic.
