Database selection for processing k nearest neighbors queries in distributed environments
We consider the processing of digital library queries, consisting of a text component and a structured component in distributed environments. The text component can be processed using techniques given in previous papers such as [7, 8, 11]. In this paper, we concentrate on the processing of the structured component of a distributed query. Histograms are constructed and algorithms are given to provide estimates of the desirabilities of the databases with respect to the given query. Databases are selected in descending order of desirability. An algorithm is also given to select tuples from the selected databases. Experimental results are given to show that the techniques provided here are effective and efficient.
