Timeline interactive multimedia experience (time): on location access to aggregate event information
Attending a complex scheduled social event, such as a multi-day music festival, requires a significant amount of planning before and during its progression. Advancements in mobile technology and social networks enable attendees to contribute content in real-time that can provide useful information to many. Currently access to and presentation of such information is challenging to use during an event. The Timeline Interactive Multimedia Experience (TIME) system aggregates information posted to multiple social networks and presents the flow of information in a multi-touch timeline interface. TIME was designed to be placed on location to allow real-time access to relevant information that helps attendees to make plans and navigate their crowded surroundings.
