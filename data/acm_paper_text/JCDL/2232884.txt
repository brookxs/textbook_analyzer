An exploration of the research trends in the digital library evaluation domain
Evaluation is a vital research area in the digital library domain, demonstrating a growing literature in conference and journal papers. In this poster we present the research trends that governed the field within the decade 2001--2010 in the JCDL and ECDL conferences. The DL evaluation literature was annotated using the domain ontology DiLEO, which defines explicitly the main concepts of the digital library evaluation field and their correlations. Several findings from this study underline the persistent character of quantitative research in evaluation initiatives.
