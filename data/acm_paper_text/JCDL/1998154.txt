Towards a model of the e-science data environment
Building digital libraries for preserving scientific digital data, ensuring its continued access, has emerged as a major initiative for funding agencies and academic institutions. Understanding the environments in which data is created, quality is assessed, and data is managed is a necessary antecedent to developing appropriate technologies to support the preservation and ongoing access to data. This paper reports on a study of 11 laboratories and research centers at three U.S. universities. Using the grounded theory methodology, this paper develops a new, generalized view of the e-Science data that attempts to explain the environment in which data is created, managed, documented, and preserved.
