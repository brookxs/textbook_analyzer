Keeping narratives of a desktop to enhance continuity of on-going tasks
We describe a novel interface by which a user can browse, bookmark and retrieve previously used working environments, i.e., desktop status, enabling the retention of the history of use of various sets of information. Significant tasks often require reuse of (sets of) information that was used earlier. Particularly, if a task involves extended interaction, then the task's environment has been through a lot of changes and can get complex. Under the current prevailing desktop-based computing environment, after an interruption to the task users can gain little assistance to get back to the context that they previously worked on. A user thus encounters increased discontinuity in continuing extended tasks.
