Extracting taxonomic relationships from on-line definitional sources using LEXING
We present a system which extracts the genus word and phrase from free -form definition text, entitled LEXING, for Lexical Information from Glossaries. The extractions will be used to build automatically a lexical knowledge base from on-line domain specific glossary sources. We combine statistical and semantic processes to extract these terms, and demonstrate that this combination allows us to predict the genus even in difficult situations such as empty head definitions or verb definitions. We also discuss the use of “linking prepositions” for use in skipping past empty head genus phrases. This system is part of a project to extract ontological information for energy glossary information.
