Studying the data practices of a scientific community
To be effective and at the same time sustainable, a community data curation model has to be aligned with the community's current work organization: practices and activities; divisions of labor; data and collaborative relationships; and the community's value structure, norms, and conventions for data, quality assessment, and data sharing. This poster discusses a framework for developing a community data curation model, using a case of the scientific community gathered around the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, a large national lab. The poster also reports findings of preliminary research based on semi-structured interviews with a sample of the main stakeholder groups of the community.
