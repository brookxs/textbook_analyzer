The national SMETE digital library program (panel session)
“To catalyze and support continual improvements in the quality of scien ce, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) education, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has established the National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL) program. The resulting digital library, a network of learning environments and resources for SMET education, will ultimately meet the needs of students and teachers at all levels-K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and lifelong learning-in both individual and collaborative settings, as well as formal and informal modes.” -National Science Foundation, 2001 The national in the NSDL program is quickly becoming a reality with the broad reach of the currently funded projects. This panel session will provide bring together the leaders developing the National SMETE Digital Library to provide a brief background and broad overview of the NSDL program. Panelists will discuss the overall vision and broad steps underway to develop the National SMETE Digital Library. Building the National SMETE Digital Library presents many challenges: Developing a shared vision for the form and function of the NSDL; Meeting the needs of diverse learners and of the many disciplines encompassed by the NSDL; Acquiring input from the community of users to ensure that the NSDL is both used and useable; Evaluating progress and impacts; Integrating technologies that already exist, and the development of new technologies; and Providing mechanisms for sharing and cooperation of knowledge and resources among NSDL collaborators.
