Capturing and curating published data
Verifiability and reproducibility are core tenets of the scholarly communication process. For many scientific publications, however, it is often the case that supporting datasets are not preserved, even when the article text is. And when they are, it is usually as a collection of files without relationships amongst one another or to the articles with which they are associated. There are some existing approaches that attempt to link datasets with articles after the fact (e.g.,NED ), but they are relatively few and involve substantial human intervention. The Digital Research and Curation Center in the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries, in conjunction with its partners has developed a proof-of-concept system that demonstrates an approach to capturing datasets during the process of submitting the associated article. As part of this process, linkages are established between the datasets and the article.
