eBizSearch: an OAI-compliant digital library for eBusiness
Niche Search Engines offer an efficient alternative to traditional search engines when the results returned by general-purpose search engines do not provide a sufficient degree of relevance and when nontraditional search features are required. Niche search engines can take advantage of their domain of concentration to achieve higher relevance and offer enhanced features. We discuss a new digital library niche search engine, eBizSearch, dedicated to e-business and e-business documents. The ground technology for eBizSearch is CiteSeer, a special-purpose automatic indexing document digital library and search engine developed at NEC Research Institute. We present here the integration of CiteSeer in the framework of eBizSearch and the process necessary to tune the whole system towards the specific area of e-business. We show how using machine learning algorithms we generate metadata to make eBizSearch Open Archives compliant. eBizSearch is a publicly available service and can be reached at [13].
