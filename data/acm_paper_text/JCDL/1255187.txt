Efficient summarization-aware search for online news articles
News portals gather and organize news articles published daily on the Internet. Typically, news articles are clustered into 'events' and each cluster is displayed with a short description of its contents. A particularly interesting choice for describing the contents of a cluster is a machine-generated multi-document summary of the articles in the cluster. Such summaries are informative and help news readers to identify and explore only clusters of interest. Naturally, multi-document clusters and summaries are also valuable to help users navigate the results of keyword-search queries. Unfortunately, current document summarizers are still slow; as a result, search strategies that define document clusters and their multi-document summaries online, in a query-specific manner, are prohibitively expensive. In contrast, search strategies that only return offline, query-independent document clusters are efficient, but might return clusters whose (query-independent) summaries are of little relevance to the queries. In this paper, we present an efficient Hybrid search strategy to address the limitations of fully online and fully offline summarization-aware search approaches. Extensive experiments involving user relevance judgments and real news articles show that the quality of our Hybrid results is high, and that these results are computed in substantially less time than with the fully online strategy. We have implemented our strategy and made it available on the Newsblaster news summarization system, which crawls and summarizes news articles from a variety of web sources on a daily basis.
