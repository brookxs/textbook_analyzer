An effective approach to entity resolution problem using quasi-clique and its application to digital libraries
We study how to resolve entities that contain a group of related elements in them (e.g., an author entity with a list of citations or an intermediate result by GROUP BY SQL query). Such entities, named as grouped-entities , frequently occur in many applications. By exploiting contextual information mined from the group of elements per entity in addition to syntactic similarity, we show that our approach, Quasi-Clique , improves precision and recall unto 91\% when used together with a variety of existing entity resolution solutions, but never worsens them.
