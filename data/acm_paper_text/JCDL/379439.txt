Integrating automatic genre analysis into digital libraries
With the number and types of documents in digital library systems incr easing, tools for automatically organizing and presenting the content have to be found. While many approaches focus on topic-based organization and structuring, hardly any system incorporates automatic structural analysis and representation. Yet, genre information (unconsciously) forms one of the most distinguishing features in conventional libraries and in information searches. In this paper we present an approach to automatically analyze the structure of documents and to integrate this information into an automatically created content-based organization. In the resulting visualization, documents on similar topics, yet representing different genres, are depicted as books in differing colors. This representation supports users intuitively in locating relevant information presented in a relevant form.
