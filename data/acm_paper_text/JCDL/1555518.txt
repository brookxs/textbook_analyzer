Our Americas archive partnership demonstration
The Our Americas Archive Partnership (OAAP) project is in year 2 of a 3-year IMLS funded grant led by Rice University in Partnership with the University of Maryland's Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). Designed to meet the needs of American studies scholars researching the Americas from a hemispheric perspective, OAAP is developing an integrated framework for the discovery of digital resources that are managed in heterogeneous distributed repositories. This demonstration will show the current state of the project's common interface to support resource discovery.
