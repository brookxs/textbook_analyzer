Visual interfaces to digital libraries
Today's digital libraries (DLs) are content rich, multimedia, multilingual collections that are distributed and accessed worldwide. Designing useful interfaces to access, understand, and manage this knowledge has become an active and challenging field of study. Visual interfaces to DLs aim to shift the user's mental load from slow reading to faster perceptual processes such as visual pattern recognition. They draw on progress in the new field of Information Visualization.The workshop in 2002 continues the theme started at JCDL 2001. In addition, the growth of the field warrants new perspectives on some of the issues we have addressed last year.
