Style-consistency calligraphy synthesis system in digital library
There are lots of digitized calligraphy works written by ancient famous calligraphists in CADAL (China-America Digital Academic Library) digital library. To make use of these resources, users want to generate a tablet or a piece of calligraphic works written by some ancient famous calligraphist. But some characters in the tablet or the calligraphic work hadn't been written by the calligraphist or though were ever written but are hard to read because of long time weathering. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to synthesize Chinese calligraphic characters which are in the same style of some calligraphist, and a corresponding system is developed for calligraphy works generation and tablets design. Calligraphic character is represented by a three-level hierarchical model. A novel approach for determining the character structure is proposed, which takes advantage of both the structure of the same characters of different styles and the structure of similar characters of the same style. A style evaluation model (SEM) is presented to evaluate whether the calligraphic character generated is in the same style of the specified calligraphist and to adjust the calligraphic character generated. Our experiments show that this system is effective.
