Pretty as a pixel: issues and challenges in developing a controlled vocabulary for video game visual styles
Despite the increase in interest in video games across commercial and academic areas, organizational systems for classifying them remain inadequate, particularly in describing the visual styles of video games. Because video games are by and large a visual medium, the ability to describe their visual "look" coherently and consistently greatly contributes to their discovery through classification. A set of controlled terms would be instrumental in complementing game recommendation engines and search applications in digital libraries to meet users' content-related information needs. In our study we examine the academic and user-generated content about video games' visual styles in order to extract potentially useful controlled vocabulary terms. These terms are then organized into facets and arranged into a classified schedule. In this poster, we discuss the challenges in our controlled vocabulary term definitions and their application.
