Integration of biomedical text and sequence OAI repositories
Archived biomedical literature and sequence data are growing rapidly. The Open Archives Initiative's Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) [1]. provides a convenient way for data sharing But it has not been tested in the biomedical domain, especially in dealing with different types of data, such as protein, and gene sequences. We built four individual OAI--PMH repositories based on different biomedical resources. Using the harvested data from the four repositories we created an integrated OAI-PMH repository, which hosts the linked literature and sequence data in a single place.
