Virtual DL poster sessions in second life
In Second Life (SL), a popular general-purpose 3D virtual world, we are supporting the Digital Library community in a variety of ways, including through virtual poster sessions. This brings together the interests of those involved in JCDL 2009, IEEE-TCDL, and NSF-supported work in SL aimed to assist education, training, and dissemination in the digital preservation area.
