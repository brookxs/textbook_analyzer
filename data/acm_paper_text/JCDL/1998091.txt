SimDL: a model ontology driven digital library for simulation systems
We propose a digital library design to support epidemic and public health simulation experiments in which model ontologies direct collection organization, user interface construction, and discovery. We have developed a SimDL instantiation of the ontological design tailored for a typical experimentation workflow. SimDL relies on an XML Schema description of a simulation model to form a domain and model specific ontology. We show this approach useful in building digital libraries to support collaborative simulation efforts.
