Indexing institutional data to promote library resource discovery
Most academic research libraries provide subject guides or data-driven subject portals on their websites to help users find information resources by topical research area. Unfortunately, these guides and portals are underutilized because users fail to discover them in their information search process. We describe an approach in development at NCSU to increase the discovery of library subject portals, and topically organized library resources in general. This approach exploits the rich topical content in available institutional data stores to generate subject recommendations related to the user's search query.
