Visual understanding environment
The Visual Understanding Environment (VUE) project at Tufts' Academic Technology department provides faculty and students with tools to successfully integrate digital resources into their teaching and learning. VUE provides a visual environment for structuring, presenting, and sharing digital information and an OKI-compliant software bridge for connecting to FEDORA-based digital repositories. Using VUE's concept mapping interface, faculty and students design customized semantic networks of digital resources drawing from digital libraries, local files and the Web. The resulting content maps can then be viewed and exchanged online.
