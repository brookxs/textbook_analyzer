A signal/semantic framework for image retrieval
This poster presents an approach for integrating perceptual signal features (i.e. color and texture) and semantic information within an integrated architecture for image retrieval. It relies on an expressive knowledge representation formalism handling high-level image descriptions and a full-text query framework. It consequently brings the level of image retrieval closer to users' needs by translating low-level signal features to high-level data and coupling it with semantics within index and query structures.
