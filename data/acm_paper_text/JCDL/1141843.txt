scientific research groups, digital libraries, & education: metadata from nanoscale simulation code
The NSDL Materials Digital Library Pathway (MatDL) is working with materials scientists to capture, in Dublin Core XML format, optimal description of nanoscale computer simulation output as research codes are executed. The long term goal of the work is to enable users, such as research groups and students, to efficiently and effectively manage their results for internal use, for exchange with outside collaborators, for use in educational settings, and for submissions to digital libraries.
