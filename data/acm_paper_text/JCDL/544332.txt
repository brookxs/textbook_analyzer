Visualizing the archive of a computer mediated communication process
The archive of computer-mediated communication (CMC) process contains knowledge shared and information about participants' behavior patterns. However, most CMC systems focus only on organizing the content of discussions. We propose to demo a prototype system that integrates a social visualization technique with existing information analysis technologies to graphically summarize both the content and behavior of a CMC process.
