The relation browser tool for faceted exploratory search
The Relation Browser (RB) is a tool developed by the Interaction Design Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for understanding relationships between items in a collection and for exploring an information space (e.g., a set of documents or webpages). The RB has been through a number of major design revisions. At JCDL 2007, we reported on two studies of information seeking that we conducted using the RB++ version of the Relation Browser software. Based on the results of those studies, we developed a set of design changes and implemented these in a new version called RB07. We will demonstrate the new RB07 interface and describe the rationale for our design changes.
