Social network document ranking
In search engines, ranking algorithms measure the importance and relevance of documents mainly based on the contents and relationships between documents. User attributes are usually not considered in ranking. This user-neutral approach, however, may not meet the diverse interests of users, who may demand different documents even with the same queries. To satisfy this need for more personalized ranking, we propose a ranking framework. Social Network Document Rank (SNDocRank), that considers both document contents and the relationship between a searched and document owners in a social network. This method combined the traditional tf-idf ranking for document contents with out Multi-level Actor Similarity (MAS) algorithm to measure to what extent document owners and the searcher are structurally similar in a social network. We implemented our ranking method in simulated video social network based on data extracted from YouTube and tested its effectiveness on video search. The results show that compared with the traditional ranking method like tf-idfs the SNDocRank algorithm returns more relevant documents. More specifically, a searcher can get significantly better results be being in a larger social network, having more friends, and being associated with larger local communities in a social network.
