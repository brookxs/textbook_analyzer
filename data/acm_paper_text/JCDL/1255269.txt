Mobile G-Portal supporting collaborative sharing and learning in geography fieldwork: an empirical study
Integrated with G-Portal, a Web-based geospatial digital library of geography resources, this paper describes the implementation of Mobile G-Portal, a group of mobile devices as learning assistant tools supporting collaborative sharing and learning for geography fieldwork. Based on a modified Technology Acceptance Model and a Task-Technology Fit model, an initial study with Mobile G-Portal was conducted involving 39 students in a local secondary school. The findings suggested positive indication of acceptance of Mobile G-Portal for geography fieldwork. The paper concludes with a discussion on technological challenges, recommendations for refinement of Mobile G-Portal, and design implications in general for digital libraries and personal digital assistants supporting mobile learning.
