Acceptance and use of electronic library services in ugandan universities
University libraries in Developing Countries (DCs), hampered by developmental problems, find it hard to provide electronic services. Donor communities have come in to bridge this technology gap by providing funds to university libraries for information technology infrastructure, enabling these university libraries to provide electronic library services to patrons. However, for these services to be utilized effectively, library end-users must accept and use them. To investigate this process in Uganda, this study modifies "The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology" (UTAUT) by replacing "effort expectancy" and "voluntariness" with "relevancy", "awareness" and "benefits" factors. In so doing, we developed the Service Oriented UTAUT (SOUTAUT) model whose dependent constructs predict 133\% of the variances in user acceptance and use of e-library services. The study revealed that relevancy moderated by awareness plays a major factor in acceptance and use of e-library services in DCs.
