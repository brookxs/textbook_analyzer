An application for semantic markup of biodiversity documents
We would like to demonstrate a machine-learning based semantic markup system that may be used to reformat free-text biodiversity documents in XML format for digital libraries. We named the system MARTT II. It is built on the MARTT engine described in [1], but with new components for example a parallel markup engine using the unsupervised learning algorithm described in [2]. The double Is in the name stand for Intuitive Interaction, which is our goal to make the system truly easy to use. They also mean the system supports two different automated markup engines, allowing the user to choose either one to use and make comparisons between the two.
