Science teachers' use of online resources and the digital library for Earth system education
A three-part study of teachers' use of online resources and of the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) was conducted from 2004 through summer 2006. The first two phases were qualitative and informed a survey administered to 622 science teachers across the U.S., one-fifth of whom had used DLESE. The findings present a profile of teachers and their access to Internet-connected computers and other hardware/electronic media devices in their classrooms; and teachers' preferences for resource formats (e.g., customizability) and educational web site features (e.g., tagged reading level). Analysis of variance showed that teachers with more than one working computer and teachers with more other devices valued the Internet more highly for teaching than did their less equipped peers. DLESE users valued the Internet more highly for their teaching, had more years teaching experience, and valued customizable resources more than their non-DLESE using peers. Most believed that resources catalogued in DLESE were scientifically accurate. Teachers used DLESE most often for finding hands-on activities, still images and other visual aids, and hand-outs; they were least likely to seek people, games, or assessment tools. The findings provide guidance for developers of K12 educational resources.
