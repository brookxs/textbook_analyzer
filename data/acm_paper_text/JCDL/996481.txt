ETANA-DL: managing complex information applications -- an archaeology digital library
Archaeological research results in the generation of large quantities of heterogeneous information managed by different projects using custom information systems. We will demonstrate a prototype Digital Library (DL) for integrating and managing archaeological data and providing services useful to various user communities ETANA--DL is a model--based, componentized, extensible, archaeological DL that manages complex information sources using the client--server paradigm of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI--PMH).
