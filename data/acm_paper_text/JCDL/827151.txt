The DSpace institutional digital repository system: current functionality
In this paper we describe DSpace™, an open source system that acts as a repository for digital research and educational material produced by an organization or institution. DSpace was developed during two years' collaboration between the Hewlett-Packard Company and MIT Libraries. The development team worked closely with MIT Libraries staff and early adopter faculty members to produce a 'breadth-first' system, providing all of the basic features required by a digital repository service. As well as functioning as a live service, DSpace is intended as a base for extending repository functionality, particularly to address long-term preservation concerns. We describe the functionality of the current DSpace system, and briefly describe its technical architecture. We conclude with some remarks about the future development and operation of the DSpace system.
