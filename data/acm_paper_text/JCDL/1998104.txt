Facilitating content creation and content research in building the city of lit digital library
In conjunction with Iowa City's designation as a UNESCO "City of Literature," an interdisciplinary research team at The University of Iowa collaborated to develop a digital library featuring important Iowa City authors and locations. The "City of Lit" digital library consists of a mobile application for the general public and a set of web-based interfaces for researchers and content creators. This paper explains the motivation and describes the design and implementation of the digital library, its framework, the user-side mobile app and our future plans. We also outline a pilot study, in which undergraduate students conducted scholarly research and created content for the digital collection.
