Dynamically generating conceptual browsing interfaces for digital libraries
A system is described that supports the dynamic generation of conceptual browsing interfaces. These interfaces are comprised of interacting visual components that contain different views onto a concept space that can be modeled as nodes and links. This algorithm uses a combined approach of tree--based processing with a grid--based drawing system to automatically generate the visual components. This algorithm is part of a larger digital library service, the NSDL Strand Map Service, which aims to provide educators and learners with conceptual browsing interfaces that help them to locate and use learning resources in educational digital libraries.
