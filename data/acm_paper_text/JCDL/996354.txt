Architecting an extensible digital repository
The Digital Collection and Archives (DCA) in partnership with Academic Technology (AT) at Tufts University developed a digital library solution for long-term storage and integration of existing digital collections, such as Perseus, TUSK, Bolles and Artifact. In this paper, we describe the Tufts Digital Library (TDL) architecture TDL is an extensible, modular, flexible and scalable architecture that uses Fedora at its core. The extensible nature of the TDL architecture allows for seamless integration of collections that may be developed in the future, while leveraging the extensive tools that are available as part of individual digital library applications at Tufts. We describe the functionality and implementation details of the individual components of TDL. Two applications that have successfully interfaced with TDL are presented. We conclude with some remarks about the future development of TDL.
