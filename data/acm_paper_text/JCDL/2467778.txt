The nuestra Iowa project: creating a digital collection as a tool for history education
This poster describes the progress of a research project exploring how public digital publishing affects undergraduate research and learning. Participants are students in "Latina/o Immigration", an undergraduate-level history course at the University of Iowa. Students use a custom web interface to create a digital exhibit about the history of Latino/as in Iowa, using multimedia primary-source materials from the Iowa Women's Archives (IWA). Students also use the tool to learn the concepts related to metadata and digital libraries.
