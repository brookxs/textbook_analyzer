Preparing resource discovery for digitized music: an analysis of an australian application
This paper examines procedures for the creation and delivery of digital music that are being undertaken by contributors to the National Library of Australia's federated music gateway MusicAustralia . The case study discusses access to and preservation of digital material as key drivers of the digitization movement, and compares projects being undertaken worldwide. Also analyzed are the underlying digitization principles and standards, and metadata schemas for the description and exchange of digital objects which facilitate record exchange and improve audience reach. The paper provides an overview of some individual contributing institutions, however particular focus is placed on the State Library of Queensland's (SLQ) approach to preparing its unique Queensland music collection for digital resource discovery in MusicAustralia . A detailed analysis of SLQ's strategy is presented, including its risk management approach to copyright implications,and consideration of infrastructure issues affecting the creation, preservation and online delivery of its digital music objects. Whilst SLQ's current digital music collection is relatively small, it has become core business of SLQ's Arts and Humanities branch, and the collection will expand with the continued incorporation of music material unique to Queensland into the collection. SLQ has developed a sound foundation for digitization based on widely endorsed principles and standards which should allow this to effectively occur.
