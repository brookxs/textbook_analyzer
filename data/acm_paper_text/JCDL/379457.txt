This panel is organized to share the experience gained and lessons lea rned in developing cutting-edge technology applications and digital libraries when different cultures meet together. “Culture”ù is interpreted in different ways and different context.

CMNets US affiliates include academic researchers from several universities, including Drexel University, Kent State University, Syracuse University, University of Kentucky, and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
