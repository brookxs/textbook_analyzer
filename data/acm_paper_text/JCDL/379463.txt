The Alexandria digital earth prototype
This note summarizes the system development activities of the Alexandr ia Digital Earth Prototype (ADEPT) Project.5 ADEPT and the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) are, respectively, the research and operational components of the Alexandria Digital Library Project. The goal of ADEPT is to build a distributed digital library (DL) of personalized collections of geospatially referenced information. This DL is characterized by: (1) services for building, searching, and using personalized collections; (2) collections of georeferenced multimedia information, including dynamic simulation models of spatially distributed processes; and (3) user interfaces employing the concept of a “Digital Earth”. Important near-term objectives for ADEPT are to build prototype collections that support undergraduate learning in physical, human, and cultural geography and related disciplines, and then to evaluate whether using such resources helps students learn to reason scientifically. Collections and services developed by ADEPT researchers will migrate to ADL as they mature.
