Evaluating digital libraries
"So far, evaluation has not kept pace with efforts in digital libraries (or with digital libraries themselves), has not become part of their integral activity, and has not been even specified as to what it means, and how to do it." - [1]Conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a digital library requires a "triangulation" approach including multiple models, procedures, and tools. Carrying out valid evaluations of digital libraries in a timely and efficient manner is the focus of this tutorial. Why is evaluation of digital libraries so important? Each year sees the introduction of new digital libraries promoted as valuable resources for education and other needs. Yet systematic evaluation of the implementation and efficacy of these digital library systems is often lacking. This tutorial is specifically designed to establish evaluation as a key strategy throughout the design, development, and implementation of digital libraries. The tutorial focuses on a decision-oriented model for evaluating digital libraries using multiple methods such as: service evaluation, usability evaluation, information retrieval, biometrics evaluation, transaction log analysis survey methods, interviews and focus groups, observations, and experimental methods. Participants in this tutorial will learn how to implement models and procedures for evaluating digital libraries at all levels of education. The tutorial includes presentations with actual case studies that are focused on a variety of digital library evaluation strategies. Participants will also receive a copy of Evaluating Digital Libraries: A User-Friendly Guide .
