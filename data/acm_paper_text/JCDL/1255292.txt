What do faculty need and want from digital libraries?
In this paper, we report on the results of a national survey of faculty members concerning their use of digital resources (DRs), collections of resources and digital libraries (DLs). The research reported here explored issues such as: value of DRs, motivation for using DRs and barriers to use of these resources in teaching. The results have implications for how DLs might develop education and outreach efforts to increase visibility and use of their collections.
