Bi2SoN: a digital library for supporting biomedical research
In the domain of biology a huge amount of different data sources is available. Therefore, information gathering and searching are challenging tasks. To avoid a manual assessment of all relevant data sources, their knowledge has to be integrated. The presented system focuses on all aspects needed for suitable data integration and retrieval for domain experts from the field of biology. The knowledge from different data sources is combined and further used for, e.g. synonym enrichment of the query term. The resulting prototype was presented to a group of domain experts who confirmed that the system delivers suitable results supporting the scientists by their literature search.
