PERSIVAL, a system for personalized search and summarization over multimedia healthcare information
In healthcare settings, patients need access to online information tha t can help them understand their medical situation. Physicians need information that is clinically relevant to an individual patient. In this paper, we present our progress on developing a system, PERSIVAL, that is designed to provide personalized access to a distributed patient care digital library. Using the secure, online patient records at New York Presbyterian Hospital as a user model, PERSIVAL's components tailor search, presentation and summarization of online multimedia information to both patients and healthcare providers.
