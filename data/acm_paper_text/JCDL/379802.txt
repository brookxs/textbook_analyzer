Digital facsimile editions and on-line editing
Digitizing a large collection of books is an expensive and time-consum ing task-but there may be volunteers all over the world who are willing to do a small portion of the task. This poster describes a system for making digital facsimile editions-e-books consisting of page images and OCRed but uncorrected text. The user can choose to view low or high resolution page images or text for each page or search the text. Authenticated users with little or no training can correct the text on-line, and the corrections are incorporated in the document. Source code is available for the described implementation, which is a part of the Christian Classics Ethereal Library (http://www.ccel.org).
