WikiMirs: a mathematical information retrieval system for wikipedia
Mathematical formulae in structural formats such as MathML and LaTeX are becoming increasingly available. Moreover, repositories and websites, including ArXiv and Wikipedia, and growing numbers of digital libraries use these structural formats to present mathematical formulae. This presents an important new and challenging area of research, namely Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we propose WikiMirs, a tool to facilitate mathematical formula retrieval in Wikipedia. WikiMirs is aimed at searching for similar mathematical formulae based upon both textual and spatial similarities, using a new indexing and matching model developed for layout structures. A hierarchical generalization technique is proposed to generate sub-trees from presentation trees of mathematical formulae, and similarity is calculated based upon matching at different levels of these trees. Experimental results show that WikiMirs can efficiently support sub-structure matching and similarity matching of mathematical formulae. Moreover, WikiMirs obtains both higher accuracy and better ranked results over Wikipedia in comparison to Wikipedia Search and Egomath. We conclude that WikiMirs provides a new, alternative, and hopefully better service for users to search mathematical expressions within Wikipedia.
