E-library of medieval chant manuscript transcriptions
In this paper we present our rationale and design principles for a distributed e-library of medieval chant manuscript transcriptions. We describe the great variety in neumatic notations, in order to motivate a standardised data representation that is lossless and universal with respect to these musical artefacts. We present some details of the data representation and an XML Schema for describing and delivering transcriptions via the Web. We argue against proposed data formats that look simpler, on the grounds that they will inevitably lead to fragmentation of digital libraries. We plan to develop applications software that will allow users to take full advantage of the carefully designed representation we describe, while shielding users from its complexity. We argue that a distributed e-library of this kind will greatly facilitate scholarship, education, and public appreciation of these artefacts.
