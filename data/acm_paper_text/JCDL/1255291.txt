Use vs. access: design and use in educational digital libraries
The poster will compare and contrast the design and usage assumptions of existing educational digital libraries and repositories to challenge digital library developers to meet the needs of their increasingly sophisticated users. Traditionally, assumptions have focused on access to a site and discovery of content, whereas we define use as content and its application (context, audience, etc.). In this poster we will review the assumptions that have driven the design of digital libraries, their services and evaluation. Measures of success such as page views of metadata rest on assumptions associated with access, i.e., the number of times a metadata record is displayed. This measure provides a very limited view of how a digital library is used. We believe that educational digital libraries need to go beyond such a limited view and think about what people actually do with material: Are they using it? Are they returning to it? Are they modifying it? Are they sharing it with others? We will explore an alternate set of metrics for determining the success (or failure) of educational digital libraries by examining metrics focused on use of the contents of educational digital libraries.
