Remote usability testing: a practice
For increasingly frequent use of library resources by remote users, remote usability testing has become a valuable tool for those who would pursue an empirical, user-centered design of the interfaces to their electronic resources and services. This paper describes our implementation of remote usability tests to evaluate prototypes of a web content management application developed by Vignette Corporation, and reports sample results to illustrate the utility of such an approach that can help designing and improving interfaces of digital library projects and their usability.
