Improving optical character recognition through efficient multiple system alignment
Individual optical character recognition (OCR) engines vary in the types of errors they commit in recognizing text, particularly poor quality text. By aligning the output of multiple OCR engines and taking advantage of the differences between them, the error rate based on the aligned lattice of recognized words is significantly lower than the individual OCR word error rates. This lattice error rate constitutes a lower bound among aligned alternatives from the OCR output. Results from a collection of poor quality mid-twentieth century typewritten documents demonstrate an average reduction of 55.0\% in the error rate of the lattice of alternatives and a realized word error rate (WER) reduction of 35.8\% in a dictionary-based selection process. As an important precursor, an innovative admissible heuristic for the A* algorithm is developed, which results in a significant reduction in state space exploration to identify all optimal alignments of the OCR text output, a necessary step toward the construction of the word hypothesis lattice. On average 0.0079\% of the state space is explored to identify all optimal alignments of the documents.
