Educational application integration with digital repository
The value of a digital repository increases tremendously when applications use the content in innovative ways. Tufts University has developed its repository based on the Fedora framework using the principles of service oriented architecture. The repository features innovative content models allowing the digital objects within the Tufts Digital Repository to be accessible through a variety of applications, including Perseus, Artifact, Tufts Digital Library (TDL) and Visual Understanding Environment (VUE). The poster will present the underlying architecture including latest services and their use in Educational Applications.
