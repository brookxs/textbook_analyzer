Mediating team work for digital heritage archiving
Building digital heritage requires substantial resources in materials, expertise, tools, and cost. Projects supported by governments and academics can only cover a small part of the world's heritage in both time and space dimensions. The preservation coverage problem is most serious in domains where sources of intellectual and cultural heritage may diminish or disappear over time. A central notion that helps resolve these issues is to facilitate global reach of digital technology to sources of valuable heritage. We propose an approach to exploit non-institutional resources for wider participation and coverage in digital heritage endeavor. The approach attempts to replicate institutional digital heritage work by teaming up non-institutional resources and providing standard practice.
