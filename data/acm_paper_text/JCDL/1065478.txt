Teaching boxes and web services: optimizing the digital library for earth system education for the classroom
A recent pilot program pioneered the development of Teaching Boxes by the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) with the Univ. of CA. Berkeley Museum of Paleontology, SF State Univ., USGS, and seven San Francisco area middle/high school teachers. This poster shares the current DLESE Teaching Box effort, explains the pilot program, and highlights the use of web services to create a context within which teachers can find, immediately use, or adapt relevant teaching and learning resources.
