What do you call it?: a comparison of library-created and user-created tags
In this paper, we describe an exploratory study comparing the abstracting and indexing practices of a semi-expert LIS community (metadata creators for the digital library, ipl2) and the social tags generated by Delicious users for the same corpus of materials. We find over 88\% of the resources in the ipl2 History collection were tagged at least once in Delicious. Overlap between the tags applied to ipl2 resources and indexing shows terms that the two groups are similar enough to be useful, yet dissimilar enough to provide new access points and description.
