Scientific publishing in the era of Petabyte data
Today's scientific datasets are growing into Petabytes. A similar transition is happening in industry and society. Web search companies have to deal routinely with tens of Petabytes, a substantial fraction of the world's computers go into data warehouses of the Big 5. Scientists, librarians and publishers are just beginning to grasp the magnitude and multi-faceted nature of the problems facing us. Every step of the usual scientific process will need to change and change soon. Science in the 21st century will require a different set of skills than previously, more computational and algorithmic thinking and more interdisciplinary interaction will be hallmarks of a successful scientist. The talk will present the challenges and trends in this 'brave new world'.
