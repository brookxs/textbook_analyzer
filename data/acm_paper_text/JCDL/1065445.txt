A focus-context browser for multiple timelines
Events may be best understood in the context of other events. We can call a set of related events a "timeline", because of the temporal ordering. Such timelines are themselves best understood in the context of other timelines. To facilitate the exploration of a collection of events and timelines, a visualization tool has been developed that facilitates the user's ability to compare and browse across events and timelines. In this model, each event is accompanied by a text description and links to related resources such as articles from digitized historical newspapers.
