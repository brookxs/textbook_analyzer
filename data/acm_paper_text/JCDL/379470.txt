Public use of digital community information sstems: findings from a recent study with implications for system design
The Internet has considerably empowered libraries and changed common p erception of what they entail. Public libraries, in particular, are using technological advancements to expand their range of services and enhance their civic roles. Providing community information (CI) in innovative, digital forms via community networks is one way in which public libraries are facilitating everyday information needs. These networks have been lauded for their potential to strengthen physical communities through increasing information flow about local services and events, and through facilitating civic interaction. However, little is known about how the public uses such digital services and what barriers they encounter. This paper presents findings about how digital CI systems benefit physical communities based on extensive case studies in three states. At each site, rich data were collected using online surveys, field observation, in-depth interviews and focus groups with Internet users, human service providers and library staff. Both the online survey and the follow-up interviews with respondents were based on sense-making theory. In our paper we discuss our findings regarding: (1) how the public is using digital CI systems for daily problem solving, and (2) the types of barriers they encounter. Suggestions for improving digital CI systems are provided.
