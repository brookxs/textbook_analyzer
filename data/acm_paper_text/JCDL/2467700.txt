Comparative appraisal: systematic assessment of expressive qualities
Clifford Lynch describes the value of digital libraries as adding interpretive layers to collections of cultural heritage materials. However, standard forms of evaluation, which focus on the degree to which a system solves problems, are insufficient assessments of the expressive qualities that distinguish such interpretive content. This paper describes a form of comparative, structured appraisal that supplements the existing repertoire of assessment techniques. Comparative appraisal uses a situationally defined set of procedures to be followed by multiple assessors in examining a group of artifacts. While this approach aims for a goal of systematic comparison based on selected dimensions, it is grounded in the recognition that expressive qualities are not conventionally measurable and that absolute agreement between assessors is neither possible nor desirable. The conceptual basis for this comparative method is drawn from the literature of writing assessment.
