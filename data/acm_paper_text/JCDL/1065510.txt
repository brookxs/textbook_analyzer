Building image-based electronic editions using the edition production technology
We demonstrate the Edition Production Technology (EPT), an integrated development environment for building Image-based Electronic Editions (IBEE). EPT is developed in Java on top of Eclipse platform and benefits from the openness of Eclipse's plugin architecture and its portability (currently EPT runs on Windows XP, Linux, and Mac OS X). EPT provides software support for building image-based digital libraries of historic documents. Starting with high resolution images of manuscripts and transcriptions of them, EPT tools provide support for creating XML encoding of the electronic edition, searching the electronic edition, linking text and images, and publishing the electronic edition (using filters and XSLT).
