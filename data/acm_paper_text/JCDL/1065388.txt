Comprehensive personalized information access in an educational digital library
This paper explores two ways to help students locate most relevant resources in educational digital libraries. One method gives a more comprehensive access to educational resources, through multiple pathways of information access, including browsing and information visualization. The second method is to access personalized information through social navigation support. This paper presents the details of the Knowledge Sea II system for comprehensive personalized access to educational resources and also presents the results of a classroom study. The study delivered a convincing argument for the importance of providing multiple information presentations modes, showing that only about 10\% of all resource accesses were made through the traditional search interface. We have also collected some solid evidence in favor of the social navigation support.
