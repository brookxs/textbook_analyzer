Collaboration and communication tools used by the biodiversity heritage library
Through the application of multiple strategies and tools, the Biodiversity Heritage Library has created an effective and collaborative multi-institutional virtual organization. The purpose of this paper is to explore the communication and collaboration strategies used by the BHL to create, maintain, and provide open access to its corpus of biodiversity literature. BHL, in its seventh year, is a mature service and no longer a pilot project. Largely driven from the ground up, and without any institutional mandate, the BHL has successfully and organically fostered an organizational model that has encouraged innovation, user engagement, and global expansion.
