A digital strategy for the Library of Congress
Digital libraries challenge the core practices of libraries and archiv es in many respects, not only in terms of accommodating digital information and technology, but also through the need to develop new economic and organizational models. As the world's largest library, the Library of Congress (LC) perhaps faces the most profound questions of how to collect, catalog, preserve, and provide access to digital resources. LC asked the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Academies for advice in this area by commissioning the study that culminated with the publication of LC21: A Digital Strategy for the Library of Congress. The panelists at this session will provide a brief summary of the LC21 report, review developments subsequent to the publication of LC21, and offer their thoughts on how the library community and information industry could engage LC to the benefit of the nation.
