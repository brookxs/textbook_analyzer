From nsdl 1.0 to nsdl 2.0: towards a comprehensive cyberinfrastructure for teaching and learning
NSDL is a premier provider of digital educational collections and services, which has been supported by NSF for eight years. As a mature program, NSDL has reached a point where it could either change direction or wind down. In this paper we argue there are reasons to continue the program and we outline several possible new program directions. These build on NSDL's learning platform, and they also look towards NSF's emerging interest in supporting work at the intersection of cyberinfrastructure and education. We consider NSDL's potential roles in several grand challenges that confront education, including: tailoring educational resources to students' needs, providing educators with a cyber-teaching environment, developing a cyber-workbench for researchers, and integrating education research and practice.
