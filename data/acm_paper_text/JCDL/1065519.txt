Using concept maps as a cross-language resource discovery tool for large documents in digital libraries
Project Gutenburg, the Million Book Project, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, Amazon's book search service, and the recently announced collaboration of Google and leading libraries, all aim to make available large numbers of book-length objects, in a variety of languages. Traditional approaches to discovering a suitable book for a particular purpose have generally relied on catalog records, sometimes enhanced with abstracts. Full-text searching - popular, e.g., with legal and government documents - and passage retrieval techniques, suitable for encyclopedias and reference works, have not been adequately tested with large collections of large objects.
