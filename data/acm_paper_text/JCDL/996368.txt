A query interface for an event gazetteer
We introduce an event gazetteer which stores and presents "locations in time". Each event is coded with attributes of event type, location, actor, and beginning and ending times. Events can also contain sets of other events. This paper reports the development of an interface for generating searches to these "part-of" relationships. For instance, we can search for all named Battles in the event database which occurred during the Civil War. Ultimately, we envision a flexible, broad-based service that is a resource for users ranging from students to genealogists and researchers interested in historical events.
