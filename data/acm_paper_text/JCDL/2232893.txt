Digital libraries for computational journalism
Computational journalism is driving the evolution of news media, devising new ways for collecting and analyzing large numbers of digital artifacts such as tweets and memes. This paper presents Breadcrumbs PDL, a specialized Personal Digital Library system that helps readers and journalists to access and use a collection of user-detected memes. PDL is part of Project Breadcrumbs, which aims to capitalize on public participation in the news media cycle. PDL supports browsing and exploration, and supports recommendations services that suggest alternative memes to read and ways to organize the users' personal workspace. Based on the users' clipping and organizational behaviors and textual similarities between clips, PDL can infer relationships between memes that computers alone cannot easily detect.
