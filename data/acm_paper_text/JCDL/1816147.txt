Visualizing personal digital collections
This paper describes the use of relational database management system (RDBMS) and treemap visualization to represent and analyze a group of personal digital collections created in the context of work and with no external metadata. We evaluated the visualization vis a vis the results of previous personal information management (PIM) studies. We suggest that this visualization supports analysis that allow understanding PIM practices overtime.
