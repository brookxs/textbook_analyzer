Template-based authoring of educational artifacts
The Walden's Paths project is developing tools for leveraging student learning with the incredible amount of educational material on the Web. Specialized templates based on established educational frameworks, learning theories, or activities aid path authors in creating pedagogically sound paths by guiding them in collecting and structuring the information included in the path. We describe a template based on the Inquiry-Based Learning educational framework and an implementation that provides support in applying the template to the path authoring process.
