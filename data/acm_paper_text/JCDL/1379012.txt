The ncsu catalog research testbed: a tool for evaluating faceted library catalog interfaces
Many libraries have recently been devoting significant efforts to modernizing their library catalog web interfaces. One popular approach is to create a faceted search interface to the library catalog. Faceted search interfaces can be complex, requiring designers to make many decisions about the placement and display of faceted search design elements on the page. Unfortunately little empirical research exists on how to optimize faceted search interfaces for library catalogs. To facilitate research in this area, the NCSU Libraries has developed the NCSU Catalog Research Testbed, a tool for developing and evaluating faceted library catalog interfaces.
