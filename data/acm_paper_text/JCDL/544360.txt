Building a digital collection of manuscripts from the library of the royal palace of Spain
With an aim of bringing cultural contents to cyberspace and spreading some unknown aspects of the history of the Americas, the Miguel de Cervantes Digital Library has embarked in a joint effort with the Library of the Royal Palace of Spain, to develop the digital web publication of the Manuscripts of the Americas in the Royal Collections funds. In this joint venture, the Library of Royal Palace supplied its invaluable contents for digitization, and the Miguel de Cervantes DL its technology and experience as a digital publisher. The goal was to join the ancient and the new, the most precious and carefully preserved documents with the new electronic publishing technologies. The result was to make freely available to a worldwide public those otherwise unreachable treasures of the Royal Collections.
