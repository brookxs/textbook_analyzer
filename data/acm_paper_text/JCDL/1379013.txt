Computer classification system usage in citeseer
The ACM society for computing and professionals provides a digital library whose Computer Classification System (CCS) is based on a taxonomy that has been continuously updated over the years. The CiteSeer digital library contains a large collection of computer science research papers, many of which are tagged with categories from the CCS taxonomy. By analyzing CiteSeer's tagged documents and by considering different time frames, we extracted statistics that shows how the CCS taxonomy covers the publications in computer and information science research sub-fields. We also studied size and growth of categories over the last four available years. We believe that the identification of such trends within taxonomies would greatly help to improve the structure of classification systems and would help the construction of more efficient browsing and searching systems.
