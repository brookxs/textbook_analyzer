Integrating ddi metadata into the nara transcontinental persistent archive prototype via the oai-pmh
The H.W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science (Odum), the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), and the School of Information and Library Science (SILS), all part of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), are collaborating with the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) on an extension of the National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) transcontinental persistent archive prototype (TPAP) data grid with the new integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS). The goal of the project is to enable collection interoperability between UNC-CH and SDSC using an iRODS environment. This poster presents the results of one part of that project, which is the development of a crosswalk between the Odum Institute Data Archive (OIDA) Data Document Initiative (DDI) metadata and the NARA TPAP iRODS metadata catalogue (iCAT) via the OAI-PMH.
