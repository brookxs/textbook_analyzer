User search characteristics on a specialized digital collection fordomain- and task-specific information
Domain-specialized digital collections have been growing rapidly in recent years. A good understanding of how users interact with such collections to accomplish domain-specific information tasks would help inform the design of effective systems. This study investigates users' interaction with a Web-based botanical collection by examining search logs recorded during an experiment. The findings indicate that while users' interactions with such collections demonstrate similar characteristics to those with general purpose search systems, they also demonstrate a domain- and task-specific nature.
