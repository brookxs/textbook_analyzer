Comparison of three digital library interfaces: open library, Google books, and Hathi Trust
Digital libraries often require very specialized interfaces in order to present various types of digital content. It is therefore critical to create interfaces that improve presentation of digital information and maximize user experience with digital collections. In this respect, this research aims to examine interfaces of three digital libraries that provide collections of digital text. The three digital libraries include Open Library, Google Books, and Hathi Trust. An evaluation matrix was developed to measure usability, aesthetics and interface components. The overall findings of the study showed that the majority of the participants preferred the Open Library interface followed by Google Books. The statistical analysis indicated that Open Library is significantly better than Google Books and Hathi Trust in terms of usability, aesthetics, and interface components. The preference for the Open Library stemmed largely from aesthetic choices. Participants also appreciated the use of elements that are analogous to their physical counterparts.
