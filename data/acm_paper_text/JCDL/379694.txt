A bucket architecture for the open video project
The Open Video project is a collection of public domain digital video available for research and other purposes. The Open Video collection currently consists of approximately 350 video segments, ranging in duration from 10 seconds to 1 hour. Rapid growth for the collection is planned through agreements with other video repository projects and provision for user contribution of video. To handle the increased accession, we are experimenting with “buckets”, aggregative intelligent publishing constructs for use in digital libraries.
