Iscapes: digital libraries environments for the promotion of scientific thinking by undergraduates in geography
This paper reviews considerations associated with implementing the Ale xandria Digital Earth Prototype (ADEPT) in undergraduate geography education by means of Iscapes (or Information landscapes). In particular, we are interested in how Iscapes might be used to promote scientific thinking by undergraduate students. Based upon an ongoing educational needs assessment, we present a set of conceptual principles that might selectively be implemented in the design of educational digital library environments.
