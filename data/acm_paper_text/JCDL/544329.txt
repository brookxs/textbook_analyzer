Digital library system: capture, analysis, query, and display 3D data
This paper describes development of a storage, archival, and sketch-based query and retrieval system for 3D objects. The initial focus has been Native American ceramic vessels, scanned and defined as a set of three-dimensional triangulated meshes composed of points and triangles. The process involves modeling the data with parametric surfaces, and extracting relevant features to raise the level of abstraction of data. The project uses a class based XML schema to catalog and organize vessel data. A visual query process was developed to permit users to interact with the data using sketches or by selecting sample vessel shapes to augment text and metric search criteria to retrieve original and modeled data, and interactive 2D and 3D models.
