User uncertainties with tabular statistical data: identification and resolution
United States government services are becoming increasingly Web-based, creating opportunities to make useful, even vital, information and services more accessible to citizens than in the past. This opportunity has challenged Federal agencies as they work to provide information and services that are easy to use and understandable to an extremely diverse constituency. This paper reports the findings of a study examining the questions and uncertainties of users during investigation of statistical tables. The questions and uncertainties are categorized, mapped to an XML DTD for use in a table-browsing system. Implications of the approach and results are discussed.
