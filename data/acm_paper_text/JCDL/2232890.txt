Characterize scientific domain and domain context
Domain knowledge map construction as an important method can describe the significant characters of a selected domain. In this research, we will address three problems for knowledge graph generation. Firstly, this paper will construct domain (core journals and conference proceedings) knowledge and domain context (domain citation) knowledge graphs, and propose a novel method to integrate those graphs. Secondly, two different methods will be investigated to associate keywords on the graph: Co-occur Domain Distance and Citation Probability Distribution Distance. Last but not least, the paper will propose an innovative method to evaluate the accuracy and coverage of knowledge graphs based on training keyword oriented Labeled-LDA model and validate different domain or domain context graphs.
