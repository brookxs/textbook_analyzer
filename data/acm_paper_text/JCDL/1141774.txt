Repository software evaluation using the audit checklist for certification of trusted digital repositories
The NDIIPP ECHO DEPository project [1] digital repository evaluation will use an augmented version of the draft Audit Checklist for Certification of Trusted Digital Repositories (Audit Checklist) [2] to provide a framework for examining how well currently popular repository software applications support the notion of a "trusted digital repository." The evaluation will also demonstrate the application of a scoring software evaluation methodology similar to one developed by the Center for Data Insight (CDI) at Northern Arizona University [3], used for evaluation data mining software. This scoring methodology in conjunction with the Audit Checklist can be used as a tool by librarians, archivists, and other data custodians to make informed decisions as they develop digital preservation management services.
