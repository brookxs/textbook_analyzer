Using standards in digital library design & development
This tutorial will cover a set of Standards and defacto Standards that can play a role in the design and development of Digital Library applications. The Standards that will be discussed are the ISO MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration, the ISO MPEG-21 Digital Item Identification, the ISO MPEG-21 Digital Item Processing, the Open Archives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, the Internet Archive ARC file format, the NISO OpenURL Framework for Context-Sensitive Services, and the proposed info URI scheme. The tutorial will discuss these Standards by illustrating how they have been used in the context of the aDORe Digital Object repository. aDORe [8] has been designed and implemented for ingesting, storing, and accessing a vast collection of Digital Objects at the Research Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Since aDORe is not a product, the tutorial is not a product advertisement. Rather, it is an opportunity for designers and developers to learn about Standards that can help addressing real-life challenges in DL design and development, and help increase interoperability across systems. The presenters are actively involved in all of the standardization efforts that are discussed.
