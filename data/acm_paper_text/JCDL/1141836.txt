A tool for teaching principles of image metadata generation
We developed a simple web-based prototype to familiarize students with digital library tools. To assist the students with the indexing task, the prototype provided basic functionalities, including metadata input form, photo search interface. The students generally expressed a positive feedback toward the use of digital library tools in their image indexing project.
