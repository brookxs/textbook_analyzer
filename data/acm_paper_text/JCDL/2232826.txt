Is it time to change the OER repositories role?
The growing number of digital libraries providing open educational resources (OER) requires effective resource discovery mechanisms to optimally exploit the benefits of their openness. This paper discusses the OER repositories role and presents a study aimed at understanding how educators find OER by seeking answers to questions such as: what proportion of users seeking OER go directly to OER repositories and what proportion uses search engines or some other means and why. Understanding how and with what tools users discover and access resources can have an impact on the OER repositories strategic development.
