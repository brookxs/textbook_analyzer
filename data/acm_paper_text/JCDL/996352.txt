Cybersecurity considerations for digital libraries in an era of pervasive computing
Information technology is becoming pervasive in our society; soon, its absence will be more noticeable than its presence, and for most people it will be an unavoidable part of everyday life. This talk will trace this evolution to the present day and make projections to an era later this decade when the prevailing system architecture may consist of information utilities accessed intuitively through a wide variety of specialized information appliances, many of them mobile. Principal among the challenges still impeding this emerging popular view of the future are the reliability and security of such global systems.Digital libraries, already playing an essential role in today's information-rich world, will assume central positions of even more significance in such pervasive systems Not only will they serve as repositories of knowledge and information, and as the primary mechanism for its retrieval and distribution, but they will be the focal point for the integration of information and scholarship across all boundaries of application, language, and media Since they will also inevitably become the target of malicious attack by people seeking unauthorized information, and by terrorists seeking to disrupt the global information infrastructure and the physical infrastructures built upon it, it is both timely and essential to study the cybersecurity characteristics future digital libraries will have to support.
