Demonstrating the semantic growbag: automatically creating topic facets for faceteddblp
The FacetedDBLP demonstrator allows to search computer science publications starting from some keyword and shows the result set along with a set of facets, e.g., distinguishing publication years, authors, or conferences. Furthermore, it uses GrowBag graphs, i.e., automatically created categorization systems, to create a topic facet, with which a user can characterize the result set in terms of main research topics and filter it according to certain subtopics.
