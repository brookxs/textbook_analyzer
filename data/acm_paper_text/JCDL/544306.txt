The ADEPT digital library architecture
The Alexandria Digital Earth ProtoType (ADEPT) architecture is a framework for building distributed digital libraries of georeferenced information. An ADEPT system comprises one or more autonomous libraries, each of which provides a uniform interface to one or more collections, each of which manages metadata for one or more items. The primary standard on which the architecture is based is the ADEPT bucket framework, which defines uniform client-level metadata query services that are compatible with heterogeneous underlying collections. ADEPT functionality strikes a balance between the simplicity of Web document delivery and the richness of Z39.50. The current ADEPT implementation runs as servlet-based middleware and supports collections housed in arbitrary relational databases.
