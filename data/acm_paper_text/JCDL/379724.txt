TilePic: a file format for tiled hierarchical data
TilePic is a method for storing tiled data of arbitrary t ype in a hierarchical, indexed format for fast retrieval. It is useful for storing moderately large, static, spatial datasets in a manner that is suitable for panning and zooming over the data, especially in distributed applications. Because different data types may be stored in the same object, TilePic can support semantic zooming as well. It has proven suitable for a wide variety of applications involving the networked access and presentation of images, geographic data, and text. The TilePic format and its supporting tools are unencumbered, and available to all.
