Understanding target users of a digital reference library
Through an investigation of the needs and practices of researchers in the humanities and social sciences, we identify key issues in the use of an online digital reference library, the Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiatives' "Support for the Learner: What, When, Where and Who". In this poster we present an examination of results from survey data and user tasks, and discuss implications for future design and implementation based on our findings.
