A technique for suggesting related Wikipedia articles using link analysis
With more than 3.7 million articles, Wikipedia has become an important social medium for sharing knowledge. However, with this enormous repository of information, it can often be difficult to locate fundamental topics that support lower-level articles. By exploiting the information stored in the links between articles, we propose that related companion articles can be automatically generated to help further the reader's understanding of a given topic. This approach to a recommendation system uses tested link analysis techniques to present users with a clear path to related high-level articles, furthering the understanding of low-level topics.
