Approximate ad-hoc query engine for simulation data
In this paper, we describe AQSim, an ongoing effort to design and impl ement a system to manage terabytes of scientific simulation data. The goal of this project is to reduce data storage requirements and access times while permitting ad-hoc queries using statistical and mathematical models of the data. In order to facilitate data exchange between models based on different representations, we are evaluating using the ASCI common data model that is comprised of several layers of increasing semantic complexity. To support queries over the spatial-temporal mesh structured data we are in the process of defining and implementing a grammar for MeshSQL
