A system for adding content-based searching to a traditional music library catalogue server
Most online music library catalogues can only be searched by textual m etadata. Whilst highly effective - since the rules for maintaining consistency have been refined over many years - this does not allow searching by musical content. Many music librarians are familiar with users humming their enquiries. Most systems providing a query by humming interface tend to run independently of music library catalogue systems and not offer similar textual metadata searching. This demonstration shows how we can integrate these two types of system based on work conducted as part of the NSF/JISC funded OMRAS project (http://www.omras.org).
