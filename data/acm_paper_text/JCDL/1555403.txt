Dimensional standard alignment in K-12 digital libraries: assessment of self-found vs. recommended curriculum
Enhancing the experience of digital library users depends, in part, on recognizing and understanding user tasks. In the context of K-12 educational libraries this means that we must understand how K-12 teachers interact with such libraries and how they assess the relevance of documents found or encountered. This paper presents the results of an experiment in which K-12 teachers scored the relevance of curriculum they found themselves and the relevance of documents their colleagues found and recommended. We found that teachers apply a significantly more detailed notion of relevance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, when searching for as compared to evaluating recommended curricula. Differences were observed in both relevance judgments and system interaction logs. These variations may be useful in identifying user intent and in dynamically adapting the behavior of digital libraries of educational material.
