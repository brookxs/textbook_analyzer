Ember: a case study of a digital memorial museum of born-digital artifacts
This paper discusses the creation of Ember, a collection of borndigital artifacts generated in the aftermath of the 1999 Aggie Bonfire collapse. Ember is an example of a previously unexamined class of cultural heritage digital libraries, which we describe as a digital memorial museum. Ember's artifacts consist of emails, photos, documents, and web pages that the communities surrounding the tragedy created. Due to the community investment and the personal nature of the artifacts, concerns arise on how the collection should be properly handled, which leads us to propose "Sensitivity" as an addition to the 5S model. Initially, we are focusing on the email portion of the collection, which can be viewed as the basis of an emerging oral tradition surrounding the Bonfire tragedy.
