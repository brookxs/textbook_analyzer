Cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and social sciences: advancing the humanities research agenda
In 2006 the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) released Our Cultural Commonwealth, the final report of the Commission on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences. The report, based on a study funded by the Mellon Foundation, explored how research environments might be created for the humanities and social sciences to complement those being developed to support scientific research. The report includes key recommendations addressed to universities, funding agencies, scholarly societies, academic libraries, publishers, Congress, state legislatures, and others. Implementation of the recommendations could potentially transform scholarship and exponentially increase access to resources and new scholarship in the humanities and social sciences. But the report has not been universally embraced. How will humanities scholarship be advanced by new technologies and research practices, and how will the academic community recognize new forms of scholarship? How will funding agencies respond to the challenges and issues raised? What does cyberinfrastructure mean for different domains within the humanities? These questions will be addressed by panelists and discussed by participants.
