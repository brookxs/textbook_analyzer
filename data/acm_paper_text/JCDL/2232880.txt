A qualitative analysis of information dissemination through twitter in a digital library
This study examines the use of Twitter in a digital library, the Internet Public Library (ipl2), to understand the content and dissemination patterns of Twitter messages posted by the ipl2. We conducted a content analysis on ipl2's messages on Twitter to develop a categorization of the type of tweets, and examined retweets and the active users who retweeted ipl2 tweets. We present our analysis of four areas related to the tweets: motivation, content, audience, and sources. Active users are categorized into eight groups. The research findings contribute to a further understanding of the actual use of Twitter in a digital library.
