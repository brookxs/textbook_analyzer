Workshop 1: visual interfaces to digital libraries - its past, present, and future
The design of easy-to-use and informative visual interfaces to digital libraries is an integral part to the advances of digital libraries. A wide range of approaches have been developed from a diverse spectrum of perspectives that focus on users and tasks to be supported, data to be modeled, and the efficiency of algorithms. Information visualization aims to exploit the human visual information processing system, especially with non-spatial data (such as documents and images typically found in digital libraries). Generally, information visualization examines semantic relationships intrinsic to an abstract information space and how they can be spatially navigated and memorized using similar cognitive processes to those that would apply during interactions with the real world. This workshop promotes the convergence of information visualization and digital libraries. It brings together researchers and practitioners in the areas of information visualization, digital libraries, human-computer interaction, library and information science, and computer science to identify the most important issues in the past and the present, and what should be done in the future.
