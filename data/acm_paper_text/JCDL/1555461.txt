Expanding the search for digital preservation solutions: adopting PREMIS in cultural heritage institutions
This paper will present some preliminary result on factors that affect the adoption of PREMIS (Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies) in cultural heritage institutions. The study employed a web-based survey to collect data from 123 participants in 20 countries as well as a semi-structured, follow-up telephone interview with a smaller sample of the survey respondents. Roger's diffusion of innovation theory was used as a theoretical framework. The main constructs considered for the study were relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability, and institution readiness. The study yielded both qualitative and quantitative data, and preliminary analysis showed that all six factors influence the adoption of PREMIS in varying degrees.
