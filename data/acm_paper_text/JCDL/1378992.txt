Isovera digital library
IsoveraDL is a digital library and peer review system. IsoveraDL allows you to upload and serve your learning resources along with associated record metadata in a very organized and dynamic way. IsoveraDL uses a resource publication workflow that models the existing off-line record management workflow in use by different AAAS BEN partners. In addition IsoveraDL also provides a Peer Review module which allows users to create and use dynamic Peer Review workflows. Using IsoveraDL, permitted users can upload records and metadata for Peer Reviewed by others. Metadata records can be validated by a different set of users before they are published. The record submission forms used in IsoveraDL for adding resources are highly customizable and administrative users have the option of setting up as many of these forms as required. The Controlled Vocabularies and metadata fields used in IsoveraDL conform to AAAS BEN Learning Object Metadata specification. Administrative users have the ability to edit or add to these vocabularies and fields if needed. Optionally, the IsoveraDL Peer Review module may be used in conjunction with IsoveraDL's record submission forms. If a record submission form is set up for Peer Review then all records submitted through the form are Peer Reviewed before they can be validated. Administrative users can create workflows, associated forms and reviewer groups for the Peer Review module. The Peer Review module also has a reporting interface through which administrative users can easily monitor the progress and workload of all records and users associated with the module. Once a record is validated and published, users are able to discover resources through IsoveraDL's search and browse functionality. Records published through IsoveraDL can be easily harvested to the AAAS BEN portal through the built-in Harvester module using OAI-PHM.
