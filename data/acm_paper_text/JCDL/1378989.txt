A ranking and exploration service based on large-scale usage data.
This poster presents the architecture and user interface of a prototype service that was designed to allow end-users to explore the structure of science and perform assessments of scholarly impact on the basis of large-scale usage data. The underlying usage data set was constructed by the MESUR project which collected 1 billion usage events from a wide range of publishers, aggregators, and institutional consortia.
