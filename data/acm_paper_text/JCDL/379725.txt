High tech or high touch (panel session): automation and human mediation in libraries
There are those who now think that traditional library services, such as cataloging and reference, will no longer be needed in the future, or at least will be fully automated. Others are equally adamant that human intervention is not only important but essential. Underlying such positions are a host of assumptions - about the continued existence and place of paper, the role of human intelligence and interpretation, the nature of research, and the significance of the human element. This panel brings together experts in libraries and digital technology to uncover such issues and assumptions and to discuss and debate the place of people and machines in cataloging and reference work.
