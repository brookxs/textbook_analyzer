Emphasis on examining results in fiction searches contributes to finding good novels
We studied how an enriched public library catalogue is used to access novels. 58 users searched for interesting novels to read in a simulated situation where they had only a vague idea of what they would like to read. Data consist of search logs, pre and post search questionnaires and observations. Results show, that investing effort on examining results improves search success, i.e. finding interesting novels, whereas effort in querying has no bearing on it. In designing systems for fiction retrieval, enriching result presentation with detailed book information would benefit users.
