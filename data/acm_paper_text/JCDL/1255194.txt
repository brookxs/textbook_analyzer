CiteSearch: next-generation citation analysis
The coverage of citations in citation databases of today is disjoint and incomplete, which can result in conflicting quality assessment outcomes across different data sources. Fusion approach to quality assessment that employs a range of citation-based methods to analyze data from multiple sources is one way to address this limitation. The paper discusses a citation analysis pilot study that measured the impact of scholarly publications based on the data mined from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar.
