Introducing high performance computing in digital library processing workflows
As larger collections need to be processed for digital library projects, libraries have to adopt technologies of scale. We present a case that involved creating image derivatives using High Performance Computing (HPC) resources. This experience opens up possibilities to conduct various processing tasks effectively and in reasonable time frames. Most importantly, it enables library IT staff access to cyberinfrastructure that can address the computing challenges of large-scale digital library projects.
