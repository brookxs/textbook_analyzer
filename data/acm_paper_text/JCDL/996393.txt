Use of MatML with software applications for e-learning
This pilot project investigates facilitating the development of the Semantic Web for e-learning through a practical example, using Materials Property Data Markup Language (MatML) to provide materials property data to a web-based application program Property data for 100 materials is marked up with MatML and used as an input format for an application program. Students use the program to generate graphs showing selected properties for different materials Selected graphs are submitted to the Materials Digital Library (MatDL) so that successive classes may be informed by earlier work to encourage new discoveries.
