Accessing the densho and historymakers oral history collections via informedia technologies
Densho is a nonprofit organization started in 1996 with the goal of documenting oral histories from Japanese Americans who were incarcerated during World War II. The HistoryMakers is a nonprofit established in 1999 with the goal of documenting video life oral history interviews highlighting the accomplishments of individual African Americans and African-American-led groups and movements. Both collections share the goal of broader, deeper use of the oral history content through digitization and automated processing where appropriate. This demonstration showcases the application of Carnegie Mellon Informedia digital video library processing and interfaces to enhance access into the interview segments.
