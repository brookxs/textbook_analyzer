Personalized spiders for web search and analysis
Searching for useful information on the World Wide Web has become incr easingly difficult. While Internet search engines have been helping people to search on the web, low recall rate and outdated indexes have become more and more problematic as the web grows. In addition, search tools usually present to the user only a list of search results, failing to provide further personalized analysis which could help users identify useful information and comprehend these results. To alleviate these problems, we propose a client-based architecture that incorporates noun phrasing and self-organizing map techniques. Two systems, namely CI Spider and Meta Spider, have been built based on this architecture. User evaluation studies have been conducted and the findings suggest that the proposed architecture can effectively facilitate web search and analysis.
