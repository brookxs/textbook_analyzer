A research agenda for data curation cyberinfrastructure
In 2008, the National Science Foundation released the DataNet solicitation, which presents an ambitious vision for a comprehensive data curation cyberinfrastructure in support of fourth paradigm science. The program subsequently funded two projects, DataONE and the Data Conservancy. The authors put forth an uncertainty framework for understanding the larger socio-cultural issues that influence the progress of DataNet projects and cyberinfrastructure projects in general. This framework highlights the key technical, organizational, scientific, and institutional contexts that the projects must consider as they mature.
