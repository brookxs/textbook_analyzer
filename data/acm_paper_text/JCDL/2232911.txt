Responsibility for research data quality in open access: a slovenian case
In the framework of a project aiming to realize a strategy of open research data access in Slovenia in accordance with OECD principles, we conducted a series of interviews with different target audiences in order to assess the initial conditions in the area of data handling. The data creators and data services expressed a high level of awareness about data quality issues, especially in relation to good publication potential. Barriers to ensuring the greater accessibility of data in the future include the little recognition and reputation for doing the related extra work involved in preparing data and documentation, the need for financial rewards for such additional work, and the undeveloped culture of data exchange in general. The motivation to provide open access to such data will involve a combination of requirements prescribed for data delivery, and the provision of support services and financial rewards, in particular changing the views held by the professional scientific community about the benefits of open data for research activities.
