Creating a multi disciplinary digital library in the 5S framework
This study identifies (1) the steps involved in framing a multi disciplinary digital library to the 5S Model, a formal model for digital libraries. (2) the major benefits the 5S Model delivers toward simplifying a digital library's resource info structure; including the creation of simplified resource classification trees and development of a user interface which interacts with such trees to enable the best in browse ability.This poster presents a graphical mapping of how individual naming functions of the spatial temporal organization (Fnodes) are mapped to the user interface. More so, the poser will display the importance of the examples of how the spaces element is used to create "HTML HELPERS" which eventually result in the ultimate in ease of usability on the user end. The blending of these components to suffice for all disciplines of a digital library are the fundamental ingredients to creating an established online repository.
