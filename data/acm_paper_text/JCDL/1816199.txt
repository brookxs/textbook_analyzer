Multiple sources with multiple portals: a demonstration of the ensemble computing portal in second life
This demonstration is an overview of our Ensemble pathway project with group members on-location at the conference and in the virtual world of Second Life from remote locations providing a live walk-through tour of our project online. This approach allows the demonstration to extend beyond the allocated conference session as a means to attract people to JCDL/ICADL.
