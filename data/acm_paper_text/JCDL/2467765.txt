Semi-automated rediscovery of lost YouTube music videos
Users frequently post popular material to YouTube, and in response, others link to these videos from social media, blogs, forums, and email. However, this content may be removed for numerous reasons, only to resurface again at another URL. This continuous movement and breaking of the web graph makes it difficult for users to relocate content that has moved in YouTube. We present Volitrax, an add-on for FireFox which redirects users to YouTube music videos that have moved to a different URL within YouTube. Volitrax acts as an intermediary that corrects the web graph transparently so YouTube links continue to work even after the content has changed locations.
