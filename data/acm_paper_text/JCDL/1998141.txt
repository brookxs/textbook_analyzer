Event detection with spatial latent Dirichlet allocation
A large number of news articles are generated every day on the Web. Automatically identifying events from a large document collection is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose two event detection approaches using generative models. We combine the popular LDA model with temporal segmentation and spatial clustering. In addition, we adapt an image segmentation model, SLDA, for spatial-temporal event detection on text. The results of our experiments show that both approaches outperform the traditional content-based clustering approaches on our datasets.
