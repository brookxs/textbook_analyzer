Tools for managing collaboration, communication, and website content development in a distributed digital library community
This poster showcases tools that the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) has developed to address the needs of its distributed community members to manage collaboration and communication, as well as the development of their own websites using DLESE templates. DLESE has customized several open source content management systems and has integrated its suite of Web services into them. These services enable developers to add customized search services, smart links, and RSS feeds, etc. to their sites.
