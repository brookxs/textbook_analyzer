Collaborative classifier agents: studying the impact of learning in distributed document classification
We developed a multi-agent framework where agents had limited/distributed knowledge for document classification and collaborated with each other to overcome the knowledge distribution. Each agent was equipped with a certain learning algorithm for predicting potential collaborators, or helping agents. We conducted experimental research on a standard news corpus to examine the impact of two learning algorithms: Pursuit Learning and Nearest Centroid Learning. For a fundamental retrieval operation, namely classification, both algorithms achieved competitive classification effectiveness and efficiency. Subsequently, the impact of the learning exploration rate and the maximum collaboration range on classification effectiveness and efficiency were examined. Close investigation of agent learning dynamics revealed increasing and stabilizing patterns that were enhanced by the learning algorithms.
