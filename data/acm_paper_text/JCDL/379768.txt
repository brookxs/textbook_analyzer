Content management for digital museum exhibitions
An online exhibition of a digital museum often consists of a variety of multimedia objects such as webpages, animation, and video clips. Ideally, there should be different exhibitions on the same topic for users with different needs. The difficulty is that it is time-consuming to produce illustrative and intriguing online exhibitions. In this paper, we present a content management system for producing exhibitions. This framework is a novel approach for organizing digital collections and for quickly selecting, integrating, and composing objects from the collection to produce exhibitions of different presentation styles, one for each user group. A prototype based on our framework has been implemented and successfully used in the production of a Lanyu digital museum. Using our method, the Lanyu Digital Museum online exhibition has several features: (1) It provides an easy way to compose artifacts extracted from the digital collection into exhibitions. (2) It provides an easy way to create different presentations of the same exhibition content that are catered to users with different needs. (3) It provides easy-to-use film-editing capability to re-arrange an exhibition and to produce new exhibitions from existing ones.
