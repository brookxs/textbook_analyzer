The climate change collection: a case study on digital library collection review and the integration of research, education and evaluation
Validating the scientific quality and potential of digital resources use in classroom settings has become a major focus of recent digital library efforts such as the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE). The Climate Change Collection is thematic collection of digital resources relating to the topic of global climate change and natural climate variability designed as a pilot project for reviewing the scientific quality and pedagogical potential of selected digital resources using a focused and streamlined approach. The collection offers a case-study in integrating research and education through the collaborative efforts of an interdisciplinary review team made up of professionals from the fields of climate research, geoscience education, cognitive psychology, and evaluation. Each participant received a stipend for their involvement in the process. Designed as an experiment in streamlined collection development, it is anticipated that the experience of the Climate Change Collection effort will help inform future digital library review and collection-building efforts.
