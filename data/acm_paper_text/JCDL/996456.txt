DLIST: opening lis research and practice
In this paper we describe DLIST, a digital library for Library and Information Science Research and Practice and for Information Technology as it relates to LIS It is built upon the open access eprints model, but that extends materials in the collection beyond the formal, scholarly literature to include other types of content created by researchers and practitioners. DLIST is intended to promote resource sharing in LIS and IT and to attempt to bridge the gap between research and practice. The notion of open access is briefly discussed as a central tenet for the development of the intellectual commons as an interactive space for learning.
