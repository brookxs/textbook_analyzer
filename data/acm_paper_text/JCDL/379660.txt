Audio watermarking techniques for the National Gallery of the Spoken Word
This is one of two companion papers describing technical challenges faced in the development of the National Gallery of the Spoken Word (NGSW). The present paper describes watermarking technologies for intellectual property protection. Following an introduction to data watermarking, the paper focuses on a new algorithm called \textit{transform encryption coding} (TEC) and its application to watermarking the NGSW archives. TEC has a number of flexible features that make it amenable to the NGSW development.
