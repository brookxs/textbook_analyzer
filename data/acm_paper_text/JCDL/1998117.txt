Visualizing collaboration networks implicit in digital libraries using OntoStarFish
This paper presents the design rationale and initial findings derived from preliminary usage of OntoStarFish, a visualization technique aimed at taking advantage of implicit relationships that can be inferred from large collections of documents in digital libraries. OntoStarFish makes such relationships explicit so users may visualize them and detect potential collaboration networks. Users that may be interested in exploring collaboration networks include researchers looking for partners for specific projects as well as funding agencies concerned with the strength of associations among participants of competing proposals. OntoStarFish is based upon the use of multiple fisheye views that can be placed on top of starfields, dynamic scatter plots for which each axis is determined by a lightweight ontology of attributes associated to potential collaborators.
