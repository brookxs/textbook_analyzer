This is what i'm doing and why: reflections on a think-aloud study of dl users' information behaviour
Many user-centred studies of digital libraries (DLs) include a think-aloud element and are usually conducted with the purpose of identifying usability issues related to the DLs used or understanding aspects of users' information behaviour. However, few of these studies present detailed accounts of how their think-aloud data was collected and analysed or reflect on this process. In this paper, we discuss and reflect on the decisions made when planning and conducting a think-aloud study of lawyers' interactive information behaviour. Our discussion is framed by Blandford et al.'s PRET A Rapporter ('ready to report') framework - a framework that can be used to plan, conduct and describe user-centred studies of DL use from an information work perspective.
