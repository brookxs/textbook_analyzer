Web2MARC: sharing and using STEM digital content in school libraries
Digital content can benefit K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning, but it is not widely integrated. Many school librarians are not sure how to build upon their expertise to share and link digital learning resources in their roles as resource providers and instructional collaborators. This poster will present Web2MARC, a web-based application for integration of digital resources into school library collections. Further work on the state of school library STEM collections, survey analysis, and Web2MARC is slated to be complete in 2013.
