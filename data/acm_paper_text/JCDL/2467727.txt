Domain-specific image geocoding: a case study on Virginia tech building photos
The use of map-based browser services is of great relevance in numerous digital libraries. The implementation of such services, however, demands the use of geocoded data collections. This paper investigates the use of image content local representations in geocoding tasks. Performed experiments demonstrate that some of the evaluated descriptors yield effective results in the task of geocoding VT building photos. This study is the first step to geocode multimedia material related to the VT April 16, 2007 school shooting tragedy.
