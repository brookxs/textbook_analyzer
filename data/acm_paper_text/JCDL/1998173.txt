CTRnet DL for disaster information services
We describe our work in collecting, analyzing and visualizing online information (e.g., Web documents, images, tweets), which are to be maintained by the Crisis, Tragedy and Recovery Network (CTRnet) digital library. We have been collecting resources about disaster events, as well as campus and other major shooting events, in collaboration with the Internet Archive (IA). Social media data (e.g., tweets, Facebook data) also have been collected and analyzed. Analyzed results are visualized using graphs and tag clouds. Exploratory content-based image retrieval has been applied in one of our image collections. We explain our CTR ontology development methodology and collaboration with Arlington County, VA and IBM, in a Center for Community Security and Resilience funded project.
