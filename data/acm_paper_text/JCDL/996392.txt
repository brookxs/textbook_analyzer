Usability, learning, and subjective experience: user evaluation of K-MODDL in an undergraduate class
Based on the CIAO! framework, this paper describes the initial evaluation of the Kinematic Model for Design Digital Library (K-MODDL), which is being used in an undergraduate mathematics class. Along with revealing general usability problems, our results describe users' subjective experiences and highlight the usefulness of various physical and digital models in facilitating learning. Interesting relationships among usability, learning, and subjective experience were discovered.
