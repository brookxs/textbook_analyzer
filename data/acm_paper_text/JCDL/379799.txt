Development of an earth environmental digital library system for soil and land-atmospheric data
We propose and examine new methods for automatic data loading system and flexible user interface system with many features such as 3D visualization. We implement the earth environmental digital library and operate it on the Web. Though our system is focusing the limited users like earth environmental researchers, more than 8000 hits per month describe the practical usefulness of it.
