Distributed resource discovery: using z39.50 to build cross-domain information servers
This short paper describes the construction and application of Cross-D omain Information Servers using features of the standard Z39.50 information retrieval protocol[11]. We use the Z39.50 Explain Database to determine the databases and indexes of a given server, then use the SCAN facility to extract the contents of the indexes. This information is used to build “collection documents” that can be retrieved using probabilistic retrieval algorithms.
