Experimenting with the automatic assignment of educational standards to digital library content
This paper describes exploratory research concerning the automatic assignment of educational standards to lesson plans. An information retrieval based solution was proposed, and the results of several experiments are discussed. Results suggest the optimal solution would be a recommender tool where catalogers receive suggestions from the system but humans make the final decision.
