Light-weight communal digital libraries
We describe Kepler, a collection of light-weight utilities that allow for simple and quick digital library construction. Kepler bridges the gap between established, organization-backed digital libraries and groups of researchers that wish to publish their findings under their control, anytime, anywhere yet have the advantage of their personal libraries. The personal libraries, or "archivelets", are Open Archives Initiative (OAI) compliant and thus available for harvesting from OAI service providers. A Kepler archivelet can be installed in the order of minutes by an author on a personal machine and a Kepler group server in the order of hours.
