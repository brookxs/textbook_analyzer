HeinOnline
HeinOnline is a new online archive of law journals. Development of He inOnline began in late 1997 through the cooperation of Cornell Information Technologies, William S. Hein & Co., Inc. of Buffalo, NY, and the Cornell Law Library. Built upon the familar Dienst and new Open Archive Initiative protocols, HeinOnline extends the reliable and well-established management practices of open access archives like NCSTRL and CoRR to a subscription-based collection. The decisions made in creating HeinOnline, Dienst architectural extensions, and issues which have arisen during operation of HeinOnline are described.
