Text retrieval conference (TREC) genomics pre-track workshop
The goal of this workshop is to allow individuals interested in the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC, trec.nist.gov) Genomics Pre-Track to come together to discuss common goals and interests for the pre-track. The workshop will be designed to generate a plan for developing a common set of tasks, databases, and evaluation measures for the pre-track. The morning will be devoted to presentations by attendees, with the topics to be covered determined by selection by the program committee. The afternoon will be geared towards developing a plan for the pre-track, with the structure based on the number of attendees (i.e., if attendance is large, we will break into small groups).
