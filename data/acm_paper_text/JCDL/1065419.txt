HiBO: a system for automatically organizing bookmarks
In this paper, we introduce the HiBO bookmark management system. HiBO aims at extending the populated personal repositories (aka bookmarks) by automatically organizing their contents into topics, through the use of a built-in subject hierarchy. HiBO offers customized personalized services, such as the meaningful grouping and ordering of bookmarks within the hierarchy's topics in terms of the bookmarks' conceptual similarity to each other. HiBO also provides a framework that allows the user to customize and assist the categorization process.
