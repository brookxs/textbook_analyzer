Usage analysis of a public website reconstruction tool
The Web is increasingly the medium by which information is published today, but due to its ephemeral nature, web pages and sometimes entire websites are often "lost" due to server crashes, viruses, hackers, run-ins with the law, bankruptcy and loss of interest. When a website is lost and backups are unavailable, an individual or third party can use Warrick to recover the website from several search engine caches and web archives (the Web Infrastructure). In this short paper, we present Warrick usage data obtained from Brass, a queueing system for Warrick hosted at Old Dominion University and made available to the public for free. Over the last six months, 520 individuals have reconstructed more than 700 websites with 800K resources from the Web Infrastructure. Sixty-two percent of the static web pages were recovered, and 41\% of all website resources were recovered. The Internet Archive was the largest contributor of recovered resources (78\%).
