Using national bibliographies for rights clearance
In the process of digitizing a book, a library needs to clear the rights associated with it. Rights clearance is a time consuming process, and possibly, with higher costs than the actual digitization. To analyze the rights situation, a range of information is required, which is distributed across several national databases hosted in national libraries, publishers and collective rights organizations. National bibliographies are key data sources in these processes, as they are the only source to identify all the publications of a specific intellectual work per country. However, national bibliographies are not built for rights clearance purposes. The information in bibliographic records results from cataloguing practices with users and library management in mind, and links between different publications of a single intellectual work are not available. This paper presents a study on the implications of data quality problems of national bibliographies for the identification of all publications of a work. It also presents an approach for work data extraction and matching based on similarity of the most discriminatory attributes of works. Evaluation has shown that the data quality problems are difficult to overcome, as our best approach achieved an F0,5-measure of 0,91. These results help to speed up the process of discovering all relevant publications per work significantly, with sufficient recall.
