Redeye: a digital library for forensic document triage
Forensic document analysis has become an important aspect of investigation of many different kinds of crimes from money laundering to fraud and from cybercrime to smuggling. The current workflow for analysts includes powerful tools, such as Palantir and Analyst's Notebook, for moving from evidence to actionable intelligence and tools for finding documents among the millions of files on a hard disk, such as Forensic Toolkit (FTK). Analysts often leave the process of sorting through collections of seized documents to filter out noise from actual evidence to highly labor-intensive manual efforts. This paper presents the Redeye Analysis Workbench, a tool to help analysts move from manual sorting of a collection of documents to performing intelligent document triage over a digital library. We will discuss the tools and techniques we build upon in addition to an in-depth discussion of our tool and how it addresses two major use cases we observed analysts performing. Finally, we also include a new layout algorithm for radial graphs that is used to visualize clusters of documents in our system.
