The vocalsearch music search engine
The VocalSearch system is a music search engine developed at Northwestern University and available on the internet (vocalsearch.org). This system lets the user query for the desired song in a number of ways: sung queries, queries entered as music notation, and text-based lyrics search. Users are also able to contribute songs to the system, making them searchable for future users. The result is a flexible system that lets the user find the song using their preferred modality (music notation, text, music notation). This demonstration lets users try out the VocalSearch system.
