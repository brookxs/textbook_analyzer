DSpace at MIT: meeting the challenges
DSpace is a joint development effort by HP and MIT to establish an ele ctronic system that will enable MIT faculty and researchers to capture, preserve, manage, and disseminate their intellectual output, and that will enable the Institute to maintain its intellectual heritage. The effort further aims to facilitate sharing of intellectual content and metadata among institutions by minimizing barriers to adoption and federation. This brief paper describes the motivation behind the project, its goals, objectives, progress, and references to detailed definition & design materials.
