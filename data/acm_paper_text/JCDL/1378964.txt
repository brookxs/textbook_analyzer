Broadening participation in computing with the k-gray engineering pathway digital library
This demonstration presents a digital library for educators at all levels to easily identify, select, and use educational resources that have been shown through research to be effective for increasing the participation of women and under-represented minorities in information technology. The library consists of practices from the Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) program in NSF CISE and elsewhere that have been researched or evaluated for their promise or effectiveness to recruit, retain, or advance under-represented groups in IT fields of study or research careers. We do not develop the practices, but instead describe them and make them easy for users to find and evaluate in a central location.
