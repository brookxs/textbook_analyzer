Building metadata-based navigation using semantic web standards: the Dublin Core 2003 conference proceedings
One of the touted benefits of the Semantic Web is that it will make searches more precise and efficient by leveraging metadata about web--delivered content. Faceted metadata retrieval is an approach to providing users access to large collections of semi--structured data and content that promises an improvement in usability over that available using more traditional search methods. In this demonstration we illustrate how the on--line proceedings for the 2003 Dublin Core Conference were implemented by combining traditional and innovative knowledge organization techniques. The 2003 Dublin Core Conference Proceedings served as a test--bed for generating a faceted metadata retrieval interface from instance metadata, ontologies, and controlled vocabularies expressed in RDF and RDF Schema. We share lessons learned in the design and implementation of the proceedings, and in particular focus on emerging best practices for representing and sharing metadata using Dublin Core Metadata recommendations, new interpretations of traditional Library and Information Science information retrieval techniques, and implementations of Semantic Web standards.
