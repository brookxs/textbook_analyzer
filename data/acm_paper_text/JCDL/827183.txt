A scientific digital library in context: an Earth Radiation Budget Experiment collection in the atmospheric sciences data center digital library
At the NASA Langley Research Center, the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) Data Management Team and the Atmospheric Sciences Data Center are developing a digital collection for the ERBE project. The main goal is long-term preservation of a comprehensive information environment. The secondary goal is to provide a context for these data products by centralizing the 25-year research project's scattered information elements. The development approach incorporates elements of rapid prototyping and user-centered design in a standards-based implementation. A working prototype is in testing with a small number of users.
