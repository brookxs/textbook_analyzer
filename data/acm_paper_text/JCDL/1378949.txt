slab: smart labeling of family photos through an interactive interface
A novel technique for semi-automatic photo annotation is proposed and evaluated. The technique, sLab, uses face processing algorithms and a simplified user interface for labeling family photos. A user study compared our system with two others. One was Adobe Photoshop Element. The other was an in-house implementation of a face clustering interface recently proposed in the research community. Nine participants performed an annotation task with each system on faces extracted from a set of 150 images from their own family photo albums. As the faces were all well known to participants, accuracy was near perfect with all three systems. On annotation time, sLab was 25\% faster than Photoshop Element and 16\% faster than the face clustering interface.
