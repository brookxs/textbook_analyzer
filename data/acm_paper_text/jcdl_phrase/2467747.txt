pretty as a pixel : issues and challenges in developing a controlled-vocabulary for video-game visual styles despite the increase in interest in video-games across commercial and academic areas , organizational-systems for classifying them remain inadequate , particularly in describing the visual styles of video-games . because video-games are by and large a visual medium , the ability to describe their visual `` look '' coherently and consistently greatly contributes to their discovery through classification . a set of controlled terms would be instrumental in complementing game recommendation-engines and search-applications in digital-libraries to meet users ' content-related information-needs . in our study we examine the academic and user-generated-content about video-games ' visual styles in order to extract potentially useful controlled-vocabulary terms . these terms are then organized into facets and arranged into a classified schedule . in this poster , we discuss the challenges in our controlled-vocabulary term definitions and their application .
