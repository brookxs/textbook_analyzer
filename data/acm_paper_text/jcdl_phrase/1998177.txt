using a hidden-markov-model to transcribe handwritten bushman texts the bushman texts in the bleek and lloyd collection contain complex diacritics that make automatic transcription difficult . transcriptions of these texts would allow for enhanced digital-library services to be created for interacting with the collection . in this study , an investigation into automatic transcription of the bushman texts was performed using the popular method of using a hidden-markov-model for text line recognition . the results show that while this technique may be well suited to well-constrained and understood scripts , its application to more complex scripts introduces a number of difficulties that need to be overcome .
