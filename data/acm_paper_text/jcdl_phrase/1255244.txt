using bilingual etd collections to mine phrase translations phrase-translation lists can enhance cross-language-information-retrieval . however , finding translations for technical phrases is difficult . bilingual-dictionaries have limited coverage for specialized fields , and even more limited coverage of technical phrases . since phrases can have very specific meanings in technical fields , this limits the quality of translations produced by generic machine-translation-systems . we hypothesize that digital-libraries of electronic-theses-and-dissertations (etds) are a good source of technical phrase translations . we have acquired a collection of 3,086 spanish etds about computer-science from scirus , the universidad nacional aut noma de m xico (mexico-city) , and universidad de las am ricas (puebla) . by using english etds from ndltd , we have a comparable-corpus of computing-related documents from which to mine phrase translations . we describe our method and its formative-evaluation .
