context identification of sentences in related work sections using a conditional-random-field : towards intelligent digital-libraries identification of contexts associated with sentences is becoming increasingly necessary for developing intelligent-information-retrieval systems . this article describes a supervised-learning mechanism employing a conditional-random-field (crf) for context identification and sentence-classification . specifically , we focus on sentences in related work sections in research-articles . based on a generic rhetorical pattern , a framework for modelling the sequential flow in these sections is proposed . adopting a generalization strategy , each of these sentences is transformed into a set-of-features , which forms our dataset . we distinguish between two kinds of features for each of these sentences viz. , citation features and sentence features . while an overall accuracy of 96.51 \ % is achieved by using a combination of both citation and sentence features , the use of sentence features alone yields an accuracy of 93.22 \ % . the results also show f-scores ranging from 0.99 to 0.90 for various classes indicating the robustness of our application .
