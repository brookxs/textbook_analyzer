oer recommender : linking nsdl pathways and opencourseware repositories the oer recommender (www.oerrecommender.org) is a web-service that helps people find relevant open-educational-resources . it links the digital learning-resources in the national-science-digital-library (nsdl) disciplinary pathways with courses in opencourseware repositories thereby providing critical contextual-information . when a person browses a web-page in a participating nsdl pathway or opencourseware repository , the recommender annotates the page with a `` recommended resources '' link . the poster will describe the motivations for the project , provide detail on the recommendation engine , display recommendations for participating collections , and describe how other collections can participate in the project .
