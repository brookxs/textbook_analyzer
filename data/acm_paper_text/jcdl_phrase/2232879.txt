a preliminary analysis of frbr 's bibliographic relationships for path based associative rules the functional-requirements for bibliographic-records (hereafter frbr) has been adopted to address the relationships for bibliographic-records and the related aggregate works . however , an approach to transform frbr-based bibliographic relationships and their patterns into path-based rules for retrieval , navigation , display and data-mining in the bibliographic space is still lacking . this study used the frbr as a basis to analyze bibliographic relationships and their path-based rules . the novel `` harry potter and the philosopher 's stone '' was used as a case-study . up until now , 87 unique records were retrieved from oclc 's open worldcat for analysis . two specialists in library-and-information-science familiar with frbr conducted in-depth analysis to achieve inter-reliability agreement . this study generalizes several patterns of path-based rules for associating bibliographic-records and outlines related issues for future study .
