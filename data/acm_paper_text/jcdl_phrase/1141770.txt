quantifying software-requirements for supporting archived office-documents using emulation this paper addresses the issues associated with building software images to support a collection of archived documents using machine emulators . emulation has been proposed as a strategy for preservation of digital documents that require their original software for access . the creation of software images is a critical component in archiving documents via emulation . the software images include the operating-system , application-software , and supporting software artifacts such as fonts and codecs (compression-decompression algorithm) . a practical emulation environment to support a-digital document requires both an emulator and a software image . this paper considers the issues associated with creating such software images to support microsoft-office documents . in particular , we discuss a set of software-tools and strategies that we developed to automatically analyze the dependencies of microsoft-office documents on software resources and supporting files . as a proof-of-concept , the tools and strategies have been applied to establish dependencies of office-documents from a document library containing approximately 200,000 documents and to automatically collect missing resources such as fonts . the software-tools are a first step toward an interactive-system that aids in the construction of robust emulation environments for preserving digital-artifacts . however , they may also be used in other contexts , for example , to support screening of documents for archiving and migration to new platforms to ensure correct visualization .
