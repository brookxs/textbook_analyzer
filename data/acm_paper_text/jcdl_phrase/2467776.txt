omnimea : an approach to improved content recruitment for institutional-repositories a common complaint of providers of institutional-repository services is that they have low utilization by their intended user base . the reasons are varied , but two are germane to our project : lack of individual incentives among potentially participating faculty ; and a perceived high barrier to entry . the omnimea project adopts a user-centric focus by advocating for personal repositories as a more appealing concept and by directing relevant intellectual output placed in these personal repositories to the institutional-repository for long-term curation . while our approach was explicitly aimed and capturing long-tail data , it has turned out to be more generally applicable .
