eliminating the redundancy in blocking-based entity-resolution methods entity-resolution is the task of identifying entities that refer to the same real-world object . it has important applications in the context of digital-libraries , such as citation-matching and author-disambiguation . blocking is an established methodology for efficiently addressing this problem ; it clusters similar entities together , and compares solely entities inside each cluster . in order to effectively deal with the current large , noisy and heterogeneous-data collections , novel blocking methods that rely on redundancy have been introduced : they associate each entity with multiple blocks in order to increase recall , thus increasing the computational cost , as well . in this paper , we introduce novel techniques that remove the superfluous comparisons from any redundancy-based-blocking method . they improve the time-efficiency of the latter without any impact on the end result . we present the optimal-solution to this problem that discards all redundant comparisons at the cost of quadratic space-complexity . for applications with space limitations , we also present an alternative , lightweight solution that operates at the abstract level of blocks in order to discard a significant part of the redundant comparisons . we evaluate our techniques on two large , real-world-data sets and verify the significant improvements they convey when integrated into existing blocking methods .
