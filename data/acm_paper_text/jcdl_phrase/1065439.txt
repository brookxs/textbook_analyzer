in the company of readers : the digital library book as practiced place most digital-libraries (dls) necessarily focus on the complex issues that arise when library collections are freed from their physical anchors in buildings and on paper . typical investigations look at supporting adults in work-settings , such as school or research . much less attention has been paid to younger generations of readers . as ever more digital venues cater to youngsters ' attentions , a role for the dl as a catalyst of social-interactions around traditional literacy practices begins to take shape . based on prior research on annotation systems , constructive hypertexts , and computer-support for cooperative-work coupled with our contextual-inquiries with children , we have developed a prototype for a-digital book that supports social-interactions through annotations . by placing and sharing notes , groups of readers transform the book from an artifact into a living record of communal experience . a system of support for marks and notes in the context of reading for pleasure can turn the digital library book into a `` practiced place , '' a location that is not only accessible , but also welcoming , engaging and supportive of the activities children are interested in and therefore likely to engage in . our experience with alph , a prototype book-reader supporting a range of rhetorical marks and note-writing , suggests that future dls need to look beyond augmenting work-based literacy practices by creating dynamic and social reading environments .
