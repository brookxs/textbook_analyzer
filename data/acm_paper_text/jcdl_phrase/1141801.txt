categorizing web-search-results into meaningful and stable categories using fast-feature techniques when search-results against digital-libraries and web-resources have limited metadata , augmenting them with meaningful and stable category-information can enable better overviews and support user exploration . this paper proposes six fast-feature techniques that use only features available in the search result list , such as title , snippet , and url , to categorize results into meaningful categories . they use credible knowledge-resources , including a us government organizational hierarchy , a thematic hierarchy from the open-directory-project (odp) web-directory , and personal browse histories , to add valuable metadata to search-results . in three tests the percent of results categorized for five representative queries was high enough to suggest practical benefits : general web-search (76-90 \ %) , government web search (39-100 \ %) , and the bureau of labor statistics website (48-94 \ %) . an additional test submitted 250 trec queries to a search-engine and successfully categorized 66 \ % of the top 100 using the odp and 61 \ % of the top 350 . fast-feature techniques have been implemented in a prototype search-engine . we propose research-directions to improve categorization rates and make suggestions about how web-site designers could re-organize their sites to support fast categorization of search-results .
