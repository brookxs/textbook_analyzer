on content-driven search-keyword suggesters for literature-digital-libraries we propose and evaluate a `` content-driven search keyword suggester '' for keyword-based-search in literature-digital-libraries . suggesting search keywords at an early stage , i.e. , while the user is entering search-terms , is helpful for constructing more accurate , less ambiguous , and focused-search keywords for queries . our search keyword suggestion approach is based on an a priori analysis of the publication collection in the digital-library at hand , and consists of the following steps . we (i) parse the document collection using the link-grammar-parser , a syntactic-parser of english , (ii) group publications based on their `` most-specific '' research topics , (iii) use the parser-output to build a hierarchical-structure of simple and compound tokens to be used to suggest search-terms , (iv) use textrank , a text-summarization-tool , to assign topic-sensitive scores to keywords , and (v) use the identified research-topics to help user aggregate search keywords prior to the actual search-query execution . we experimentally show that the proposed framework , which is optimized to work on literature-digital-libraries , promises a more scalable , high quality , and user-friendly search-keyword-suggester when compared to its competitors . we validate our proposal experimentally using a subset of the acm sigmod anthology digital-library as a testbed , and by employing the research-pyramid model to identify the `` most-specific '' research topics .
