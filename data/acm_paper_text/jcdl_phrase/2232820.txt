to envisage and design the transition from a-digital archive system developed for domain-experts to one for non-domain users diverse digital-resources are commonly used by different types of users . it is common practice to develop those application having in mind a set of requirements for a specific target category of users . we envisaged and designed the ipsa archive and system using a similar approach : the identification of a set of requirements for researchers in illuminated-manuscripts as a target group of domain professional users . the ipsa system has been in use as a research-tool by domain professionals . the consideration that the content of the archive managed by the ipsa system could be of interest for other types of users suggested reconsidering its approach to envisage a new system designed around the same archive of illuminated-manuscripts for their access by diverse categories of users . the paper reports on the work that was conducted to re-design and re-engineer the system to match requirements and expectations of non-domain users .
