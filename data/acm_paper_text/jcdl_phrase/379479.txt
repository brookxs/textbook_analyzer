use of multiple digital-libraries : a case-study the aim of the work reported here was to better understand the usabili ty issues raised when digital-libraries are used in a natural setting . the method used was a protocol-analysis of users working on a task of their own choosing to retrieve documents from publicly available digital-libraries . various classes of usability difficulties were found . here , we focus on use in context - that is , usability concerns that arise from the fact that libraries are accessed in particular ways , under technically and organisationally imposed constraints , and that use of any particular resource is discretionary . the concepts from an interaction-framework , which provides support for reasoning about patterns of interaction between users and systems , are applied to understand interaction issues .
