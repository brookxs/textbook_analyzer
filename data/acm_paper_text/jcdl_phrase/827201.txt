the web-dl environment for building digital-libraries from the-web the-web contains a huge volume of unstructured-data , which is difficult to manage . in digital-libraries , on the other hand , information is explicitly organized , described , and managed . community-oriented services are built to attend specific information-needs and tasks . in this paper , we describe an environment , web-dl , that allows the construction of digital-libraries from the-web . the web-dl environment will allow us to collect data from the-web , standardize it , and publish it through a-digital library system . it provides support to services and organizational-structure normally available in digital-libraries , but benefiting from the breadth of the-web contents . we experimented with applying the web-dl environment to the networked-digital-library-of-theses-and-dissertations (ndltd) , thus demonstrating that the rapid construction of dls from the-web is possible . also , web-dl provides an alternative as a largescale solution for interoperability between independent digital-libraries .
