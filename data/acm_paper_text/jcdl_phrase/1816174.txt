ensemble pdp-8 : eight principles for distributed portals ensemble , the national-science-digital-library (nsdl) pathways project for computing , builds upon a diverse group of prior nsdl , dl-i , and other projects . ensemble has shaped its activities according to principles related to design , development , implementation , and-operation of distributed portals . here we articulate 8 key principles for distributed portals (pdps) . while our focus is on education and pedagogy , we expect that our experiences will generalize to other digital-library application-domains . these principles inform , facilitate , and enhance the ensemble r&d and production activities . they allow us to provide a broad range of services , from personalization to coordination across communities . the eight pdps can be briefly summarized as : (1) articulation across communities using ontologies . (2) browsing tailored to collections . (3) integration across interfaces and virtual-environments . (4) metadata-interoperability and integration . (5) social-graph construction using logging and metrics . (6) superimposed-information and annotation integrated across distributed-systems . (7) streamlined user-access with ids . (8) web-2.0 multiple social-network-system interconnection .
