community-design of dlese 's collections review policy : a technological-frames analysis in this paper , i describe the design of a collection review policy for the digital library for earth-system education (dlese) . a distinctive feature of dlese as a-digital library is the & lquo ; dlese community & rquo ; , composed of voluntary members who contribute metadata and resource reviews to dlese . as the dlese community-is open , the question of how to evaluate community contributions is a crucial part of the review policy-design process . in this paper , technological-frames theory is used to analyse this design-process by looking at how the designers work with two differing definitions of the & lquo ; peer reviewer & rquo ; , (a) peer reviewer as arbiter or editor , and (b) peer reviewer as colleague . content-analysis of dlese documents shows that these frames can in turn be related to two definitions that dlese offers of itself : dlese as a library , and dlese as a-digital artifact . the implications of the presence of divergent technological-frames for the design process are summarised , and some suggestions for future-research are outlined .
