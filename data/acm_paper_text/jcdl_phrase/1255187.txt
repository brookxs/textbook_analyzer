efficient summarization-aware-search for online-news articles news portals gather and organize news-articles published daily on the internet . typically , news-articles are clustered into ` events ' and each cluster is displayed with a short description of its contents . a particularly interesting choice for describing the contents of a cluster is a machine-generated multi-document-summary of the articles in the cluster . such summaries are informative and help news readers to identify and explore only clusters of interest . naturally , multi-document clusters and summaries are also valuable to help users navigate the results of keyword-search queries . unfortunately , current document summarizers are still slow ; as a result , search-strategies that define document clusters and their multi-document summaries online , in a query-specific manner , are prohibitively expensive . in contrast , search-strategies that only return offline , query-independent document clusters are efficient , but might return clusters whose (query-independent) summaries are of little relevance to the queries . in this paper , we present an efficient hybrid-search strategy to address the limitations of fully online and fully offline summarization-aware-search approaches . extensive experiments involving user relevance judgments and real news-articles show that the quality of our hybrid results is high , and that these results are computed in substantially less time than with the fully online strategy . we have implemented our strategy and made it available on the newsblaster news-summarization system , which crawls and summarizes news-articles from a variety of web sources on a daily basis .
