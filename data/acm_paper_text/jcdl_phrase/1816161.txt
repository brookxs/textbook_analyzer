binarizationshop : a user-assisted-software suite for converting old documents to black-and-white converting a scanned-document to a binary-format (black-and-white) is a key step in the digitization process . while many existing binarization algorithms operate robustly for well-kept documents , these algorithms often produce less than satisfactory results when applied to old documents , especially those degraded with stains and other discolorations . for these challenging documents , user-assistance can be advantageous in directing the binarization procedure . many existing algorithms , however , are poorly designed to incorporate user-assistance . in this paper , we discuss a software-framework , binarizationshop , that combines a series of binarization approaches that have been tailored to exploit user-assistance . this framework provides a practical approach for converting difficult documents to black-and-white .
