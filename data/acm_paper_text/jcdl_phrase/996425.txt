lost in memories : interacting with photo-collections on pdas we developed two browsers to support large personal-photo-collections on pdas . our first browser is based on a traditional , folder-based layout that utilizes either the user 's manually created organization-structure , or a system-generated structure . our second browser uses a novel-interface that is based on a vertical , zoomable timeline . this timeline browser does not require users to organize their photos , but instead , relies solely on system-generated structure . our system creates a hierarchical-structure of the user 's photos by applying time-based-clustering to identify subsets of photos that are likely to be related . in a user-experiment , we compared users ' searching and browsing performance across these browsers , using each user 's own photo-collection . photo-collection sizes varied between 500 and 3000 photographs our results show that our timeline browser is at least as effective for searching and browsing tasks as a traditional browser that requires users to manually organize their photos .
