toward a model of self-administering-data we describe a model of self-administering-data . in this model , a declarative description of how a data object should behave is attached to the object , either by a user or by a data-input device . a widespread infrastructure of self-administering-data handlers is presumed to exist ; these handlers are responsible for carrying out the specifications attached to the data . typically , the specifications express how and to whom the data should be transferred , how it should be incorporated when it is received , what rights recipients of the data will have with respect to it , and the kind of relation that should exist between distributed copies of the object . functions such as distributed-version-control can be implemented on top of the basic handler functions . we suggest that this model can provide superior support for common cooperative functions . because the model is declarative , users need only express their intentions once in creating a self-administering description , and need not be concerned with manually performing subsequent repetitious operations . because the model is peer-to-peer , users are less dependent on additional , perhaps costly resources , at least when these are not critical . an initial implementation of the model has been created . we are experimenting with the model both as a tool to aid in digital-library functions , and as a possible replacement for some server oriented functions .
