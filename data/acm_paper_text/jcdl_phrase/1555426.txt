generative model-based metasearch for data-fusion in information-retrieval `` data-fusion '' refers to the problem in information-retrieval (ir) where several lists of documents ranked against a query are to be merged into a single ranked list for presentation to a user . data-fusion is also known as `` metasearch . '' in a-digital library setting data-fusion may support operations such as federated-search based on multiple repository representations . this paper presents a novel approach to the fusion problem : generative model-based metasearch (gem) . we suggest viewing the appearance of documents in a return set as the outcome of a probabilistic process ; some documents are likely to occur in the model , while others are unlikely . using bayesian parameter-estimation to fit a multinomial-distribution based on the return sets to be merged , gem achieves a final ranking by listing documents in decreasing probability of generation under the induced model . we also introduce what we call `` the impatient reader '' approach to normalizing document ranks in service to the fusion-operation . we report results from several experiments on trec-data suggesting that gem , informed with impatient reader document scores , operates at state-of-the-art levels of effectiveness .
