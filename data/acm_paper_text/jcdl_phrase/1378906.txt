gazetiki : automatic creation of a geographical-gazetteer geolocalized databases are becoming necessary in a wide variety of application-domains . thus far , the creation of such databases has been a costly , manual process . this drawback has stimulated interest in automating their construction , for example , by mining geographical-information from the-web . here we present and evaluate a new automated technique for creating and enriching a geographical-gazetteer , called gazetiki . our technique merges disparate information from wikipedia , panoramio , and web-search-engines in order to identify geographical names , categorize these names , find their geographical coordinates and rank them . the information produced in gazetiki enhances and complements the geonames database , using a similar domain-model . we show that our method provides a richer structure and an improved coverage compared to another known attempt at automatically building a geographic database and , where possible , we compare our gazetiki to geonames .
