topic-models for taxonomies concept taxonomies such as mesh , the acm computing classification system , and the ny times subject-headings are frequently used to help organize data . they typically consist of a set of concept names organized in a hierarchy . however , these names and structure are often not sufficient to fully capture the intended meaning of a taxonomy node , and particularly non-experts may have difficulty navigating and placing data into the taxonomy . this paper introduces two semi-supervised topic-models that automatically augment a given taxonomy with many additional keywords by leveraging a corpus of multi-labeled documents . our experiments show that users find the topics beneficial for taxonomy interpretation , substantially increasing their cataloging accuracy . furthermore , the models provide a better information rate compared to labeled lda .
