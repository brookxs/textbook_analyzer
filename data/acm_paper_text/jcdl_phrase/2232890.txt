characterize scientific-domain and domain context domain-knowledge map-construction as an important method can describe the significant characters of a selected domain . in this research , we will address three problems for knowledge graph-generation . firstly , this paper will construct domain (core journals and conference-proceedings) knowledge and domain context (domain citation) knowledge graphs , and propose a novel method to integrate those graphs . secondly , two different methods will be investigated to associate keywords on the graph : co-occur domain distance and citation probability-distribution distance . last but not least , the paper will propose an innovative method to evaluate the accuracy and coverage of knowledge graphs based on training keyword oriented labeled-lda model and validate different domain or domain context graphs .
