do graphical search interfaces support effective search for and evaluation of digital-library-resources this paper explores the cognitive-processes and online-behaviors in which preservice-teachers engage when seeking educational-resources for classroom-instruction . participants used graphical and keyword-search interfaces provided by a large-scale digital-library (nsdl.org) and a keyword-search interface from a large , commercial-search-engine (google.com) to complete searches for online materials that would support classroom-instruction . overall , findings from the current work indicate that a graphical-search-interface can support comprehension by providing a conceptual organization of domain content during digital search and evaluation . findings also show that digital-libraries allow users to offload processing related to resource trustworthiness , thereby increasing cognitive capacity for other purposes .
