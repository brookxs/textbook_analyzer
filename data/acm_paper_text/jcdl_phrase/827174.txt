the oai-pmh static repository and static repository gateway although the oai-pmh specification is focused on making it straightforward for data providers to expose metadata , practice shows that in certain significant situations deployment of oai-pmh conformant repository software remains problematic . in this paper , we report on research aimed at devising solutions to further lower the barrier to make metadata collections harvestable . we provide an in depth description of an approach in which a data-provider makes a metadata-collection available as an xml file with a specific format -- an oai static repository - which is made oai-pmh harvestable through the intermediation of software - an oai static repository gateway - operated by a third party . we describe the properties of both components , and provide insights in our experience with an experimental implementation of a gateway .
