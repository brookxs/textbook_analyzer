modeling and exploiting heterogeneous bibliographic networks for expertise ranking recently expertise-retrieval has received increasing interests in both academia and industry . finding experts with demonstrated expertise for a given query is a nontrivial task especially from a large-scale web 2.0 systems , such as question-answering and bibliography data , where users are actively publishing useful content online , interacting with each other , and forming social-networks in various ways , leading to heterogeneous-networks in addition to the large amounts of textual content information . many approaches have been proposed and shown to be useful for expertise ranking . however , most of these methods only consider the textual-documents while ignoring heterogeneous-network structures or can merely integrate with one additional kind of information . none of them can fully exploit the characteristics of heterogeneous-networks . in this paper , we propose a joint regularization-framework to enhance expertise-retrieval by modeling heterogeneous-networks as regularization constraints on top of document-centric model . we argue that multi-typed linking edges reveal valuable information which should be treated differently . motivated by this intuition , we formulate three hypotheses to capture unique characteristics for different graphs , and mathematically model those hypotheses jointly with the document and other information . to illustrate our methodology , we apply the framework to expert-finding applications using a bibliography dataset with 1.1 million papers and 0.7 million authors . the experimental-results show that our proposed approach can achieve significantly better results than the baseline and other enhanced models .
