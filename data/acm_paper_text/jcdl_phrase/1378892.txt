building a dynamic-lexicon from a-digital library we describe here in detail our work toward creating a dynamic-lexicon from the texts in a large digital-library . by leveraging a small structured-knowledge source (a 30,457 word treebank) , we are able to extract selectional-preferences for words from a 3.5 million word latin corpus . this is promising news for low-resource languages and digital-collections seeking to leverage a small human investment into much larger gain . the library architecture in which this work is developed allows us to query customized subcorpora to report on lexical usage by author , genre or era and allows us to continually update the lexicon as new texts are added to the collection .
