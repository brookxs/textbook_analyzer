ackseer : a repository and search-engine for automatically extracted acknowledgments from digital-libraries acknowledgments are widely used in scientific articles to express gratitude and credit collaborators . despite suggestions that indexing acknowledgments automatically will give interesting insights , there is currently , to the best of our knowledge , no such system to track acknowledgments and index them . in this paper we introduce ackseer , a search-engine and a repository for automatically extracted acknowledgments in digital-libraries . ackseer is a fully automated system that scans items in digital-libraries including conference-papers , journals , and books extracting acknowledgment sections and identifying acknowledged entities mentioned within . we describe the architecture of ackseer and discuss the extraction algorithms that achieve a f1 measure above 83 % . we use multiple named-entity-recognition (ner) tools and propose a method for merging the outcome from different recognizers . the resulting entities are stored in a database then made searchable by adding them to the ackseer index along with the metadata of the containing paper/book . we build ackseer on top of the documents in citeseerx digital-library yielding more than 500,000 acknowledgments and more than 4 million mentioned entities .
