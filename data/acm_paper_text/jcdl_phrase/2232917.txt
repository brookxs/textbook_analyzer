the logical-form of the proposition expressed by a metadata record metadata records are a ubiquitous and foundational feature of contemporary information-systems . however , while their simple surface-structure may lead us to think that the semantics of a metadata record is unproblematic and easily discerned , our analysis of an example record suggests otherwise . we show three possibilities for the logical-form of the proposition expressed by a metadata record . all three are substantially different in the first order constructs utilized , and no two can be recognized as equivalent for the purposes of information-organization . the semantics of the common metadata record is elusive . the main source of this problem appears to be the identifier attribute . although identifier attributes have the syntactic appearance of any other attribute in the metadata vocabulary , this uniformity conceals their potential for assuming a distinctive semantic-role , and one which appears to cross the traditional object language / metalanguage boundary , suggesting that translation of colloquial metadata records into logic-based knowledge representations does not take place entirely at a first-order level .
