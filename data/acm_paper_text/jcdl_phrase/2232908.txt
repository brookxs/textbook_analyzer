meta-line : lineage information for improved metadata-quality controlled content-quality also in terms of indexing is one of the major advantages of using digital-libraries in contrast to general web sources or web-search-engines . however , considering today 's information flood the mostly manual effort in acquiring new sources and creating suitable (semantic) metadata for content-indexing and retrieval is already prohibitive . a recent solution is given by automatic-generation of metadata , where various methods currently become more widespread . but in this case neglecting quality-assurance is even more problematic , because heuristic generation often fails and the resulting low-quality metadata will directly diminish the quality-of-service that a-digital library provides . to address this problem , we propose a metadata-quality model to determine the overall quality of a metadata set and validate individual requirements imposed on that metadata set . furthermore , lineage information is provided to trace the quality evolution of a metadata set .
