what do you call it ? : a comparison of library-created and user-created tags in this paper , we describe an exploratory-study comparing the abstracting and indexing practices of a semi-expert lis community (metadata creators for the digital library , ipl2) and the social-tags generated by delicious users for the same corpus of materials . we find over 88 \ % of the resources in the ipl2 history collection were tagged at least once in delicious . overlap between the tags applied to ipl2 resources and indexing shows terms that the two groups are similar enough to be useful , yet dissimilar enough to provide new access-points and description .
