building preservation environments the preservation of digital entities requires data-management technologies that are provided by digital-libraries and data-grids . digital-libraries provide standard data organization and presentation mechanisms . data-grids provide support for infrastructure-independence , the ability to incorporate new-technology as it becomes available . preservation environments integrate these technologies to assure the authenticity and integrity of digital entities . we will describe the concepts behind preservation and illustrate the concepts with three data-preservation environments based on the nara research prototype persistent archive , the nhprc persistent archive testbed , and the nsf nsdl persistent archive .
