insights into collections gaps through examination of null result searches in dlese we describe the analysis of zero result searches in dlese , the digital library for earth-system education , with the intent to use the information to discover gaps in the collection . close examination of null result searches reveals insights into the kinds of information sought by users but which is missing from the collection . although it is not possible to consistently isolate collection-gaps as a cause for null result searches , it is possible to define a set of null result searches that are very likely to have been caused by collections gaps . this information can be used to improve a collection in specific subject areas . we recommend using this method , along with other inputs , for a-digital library with a specific collection scope but a broad and mostly unknown user base , and we recognize the need for automating this analysis .
