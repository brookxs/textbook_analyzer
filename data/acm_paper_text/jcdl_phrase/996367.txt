digital-trail-libraries we propose the idea of an online , user submitted digital-library of recreation trails . digital-libraries of trails offer advantages over paper guidebooks in that they are more accurate , dynamic and not limited to the experience of the author (s) . the basic representation of a trail is a gps track log , recorded as recreators travel on trails . as users complete trips , the gps track logs of their trips are submitted to the central library voluntarily . a major problem is that track logs will overlap and intersect each other . we present a method for the combination of overlapping and intersecting gps track logs to create a network of gps trails . each trail segment in the network can then be characterized by automatic and manual means , producing a-digital library of trails . we also describe the topofusion system which creates , manages and visualizes gps-data , including gps-networks .
