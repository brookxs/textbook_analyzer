text-clustering with important-words using normalization important-words , which usually exist in part of title , subject and keywords , can briefly reflect the main topic of a document . in recent years , it is a common practice to exploit the semantic topic of documents and utilize important-words to achieve document-clustering , especially for short-texts such as news-articles . this paper proposes a novel method to extract important-words from subject and keywords of articles , and then partition documents only with those important-words . considering the fact that frequencies of important-words are usually low and the scale matrix dataset for important-words is small , a normalization method is then proposed to normalize the scale dataset so that more accurate results can be achieved by sufficiently exploiting the limited-information . the experiments validate the effectiveness of our method .
