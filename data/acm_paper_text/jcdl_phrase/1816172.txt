a mathematical-framework for modeling and analyzing migration time file-format obsolescence has so far been considered the major risk in long-term-storage of digital-objects . there are , however , growing indications that file-transfer may be a real threat as the migration time , i.e. , the time required to migrate petabytes of data , may easily spend years . however , hardware-support is usually limited to 3-4 years and a situation can emerge when a new migration has to be started although the previous one is still not finished yet . this paper chooses a process-modeling approach to obtain estimates of upper-and-lower-bounds for the required migration time . the advantage is that information about potential bottlenecks can be acquired . our theoretical considerations are validated by migration tests at the national library of norway (nb) as well as at our department .
