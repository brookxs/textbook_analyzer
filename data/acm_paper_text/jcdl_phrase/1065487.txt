an information-network overlay architecture for the nsdl we describe the underlying data-model and implementation of a new architecture for the national-science-digital-library (nsdl) by the core integration team (ci) . the architecture is based on the notion of an information-network overlay . this network , implemented as a graph of digital-objects in a fedora repository , allows the representation of multiple information entities and their relationships . the architecture provides the framework for contextualization and reuse of resources , which we argue is essential for the utility of the nsdl as a tool for teaching-and-learning .
