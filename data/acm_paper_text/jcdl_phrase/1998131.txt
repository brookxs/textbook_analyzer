a social network-aware top-n recommender system using gpu a book recommender-system is very useful for a-digital library . good book recommender-systems can effectively help users find interesting and relevant books from the massive resources , by providing individual recommendation book list for each end-user . by now , a variety of collaborative-filtering algorithms have been invented , which are the cores of most recommender-systems . however , because of the explosion of information , especially in the internet , the improvement of the efficiency of the collaborative filting (cf) algorithm becomes more and more important . in this paper , we first propose a parallel top-n-recommendation algorithm in cuda (compute-unified-device-architecture) which combines the collaborative-filtering and trust-based approach to deal with the cold-start user problem . then based on this algorithm , we present a parallel book recommender-system on a gpu (graphics-processor-unit) for cadal digital-library platform . our experimental-results show our algorithm is very efficient to process the large-scale-datasets with good accuracy , and we report the impact of different values of parameters on the recommendation-performance .
