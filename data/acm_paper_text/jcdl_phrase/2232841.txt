re-ranking bibliographic-records for personalized library search this work will introduce a new approach to ranking bibliographic-records in library search , which is currently dominated by an opac style search paradigm , where results are typically not ranked by relevance . the approach we propose in the paper provides the user with the ability to access bibliographic-records in a way responsive to his or her preferences , which is essentially done by looking at a community or a group of people who share interests with the user and making use of their publication records to re-rank search-results . the experiment found that the present approach gives a clear edge over conventional search-methods .
