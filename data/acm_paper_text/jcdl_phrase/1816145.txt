a user-centered-design of a personal-digital-library for music-exploration we describe the evaluation of a personal-digital-library environment designed to help musicians capture , enrich and store their ideas using a spatial-hypermedia paradigm . the target user-group is musicians who primarily use audio and text for composition and arrangement , rather than with formal music-notation . using the principle of user-centered-design , the software-implementation was guided by a diary-study involving nine musicians which suggested five requirements for the software to support : capturing , overdubbing , developing , storing , and organizing . moreover , the underlying spatial data-model was exploited to give raw audio compositions a hierarchical-structure , and - to aid musicians in retrieving previous ideas - a search-facility is available to support both query-by-humming and text-based queries . a user-evaluation of the completed design with eleven subjects indicated that musicians , in general , would find the hypermedia environment useful for capturing and managing their moments of musical-creativity and exploration . more specifically they would make use of the query-by-humming facility and the hierarchical track organization , but not the overdubbing facility as implemented .
