automatic-extraction of core learning goals and generation of pedagogical sequences through a collection of digital-library-resources a key challenge facing educational-technology researchers is how to provide structure and guidance when learners use unstructured and open tools such as digital-libraries for their own learning . this work attempts to use computational methods to identify that structure in a domain-independent way and support learners as they navigate and interpret the information they find . this article highlights a computational methodology for generating a pedagogical sequence through core learning goals extracted from a collection of resources which in this case , are resources from the digital library for earth-system education (dlese) . this article describes how we use the technique of multi-document-summarization to extract the core learning goals from the digital library-resources and how we create a supervised classifier that performs a pair-wise classification of the core learning goals ; the judgments from these classifications are used to automatically generate pedagogical sequences . results show that we can extract good core learning goals and make pair-wise classifications that are up to 76 % similar to the pair-wise classifications generated from pedagogical sequences created by two science-education experts . thus we can dynamically generate pedagogically meaningful-learning paths through digital-library-resources .
