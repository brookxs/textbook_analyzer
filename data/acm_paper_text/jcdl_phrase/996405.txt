metaextract : an nlp-system to automatically assign metadata we have developed metaextract , a system to automatically assign dublin-core + gem metadata using extraction techniques from our natural-language-processing research metaextract is comprised of three distinct processes : equery and html-based extraction modules and a keyword generator module . we conducted a web-based survey to have users evaluate each metadata element 's quality . only two of the elements , title and keyword , were shown to be significantly different , with the manual quality slightly higher . the remaining elements for which we had enough data to test were shown not to be significantly different ; they are : description , grade , duration , essential resources , pedagogy-teaching method , and pedagogy-group .
