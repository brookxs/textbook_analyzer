physics pathway : a-digital library filled with synthetic-interviews physics pathway is a-digital library available through an adobe-flash portal whose contents are a series of interviews with four experts who answer questions about the pedagogy of teaching physics . the answers were collected over a broad time span , but are presented to the user as if he or she is conducting the personal interview , similar to naturally conversing with the expert . this `` synthetic interview '' style is discussed in this paper , with a mixed methods evaluation by 19 high-school-teachers who used physics pathway for a 14-week period at the end of 2010 . the evaluation with teachers showed that the synthetic-interviews validated or reinforced their ideas on their course materials and delivery . as these are teachers who are relatively new to physics instruction , confirmation that they are teaching well is important . physics pathway is linked with compadre , a member of the national-science-digital-library .
