building a marc-to-olac crosswalk : repurposing library-catalog data for the language-resources community the open language archives community (olac) is an international partnership of institutions which are building a network of interoperating repositories and services to create a worldwide virtual-library of language-resources (that is , resources that document , describe , or develop the more than 7,000 known languages of the world) . olac uses a community-specific refinement of qualified dublin-core [http://www.language-archives.org/olac/metadata.htm] along with a community-specific refinement of the oai protocol for metadata-harvesting [http://www.language-archives.org/olac/repositories.htm] to maintain an aggregated catalog of the holdings of the 35 participating archives . olac recognizes that the language-resources of interest to the community come not only from sources within the community but also from many sources outside the community . this poster describes one approach we have developed for addressing this issue , namely , a crosswalk that transforms the marc21 catalog for a library or archive into an oai static repository that holds an olac metadata record for each marc record identified as describing a language-resource .
