approximate ad-hoc query-engine for simulation-data in this paper , we describe aqsim , an ongoing effort to design and impl ement a system to manage terabytes of scientific-simulation data . the goal of this project is to reduce data-storage requirements and access-times while permitting ad-hoc-queries using statistical and mathematical-models of the data . in order to facilitate data-exchange between models based on different representations , we are evaluating using the asci common-data-model that is comprised of several layers of increasing semantic complexity . to support queries over the spatial-temporal mesh structured-data we are in the process of defining and implementing a grammar for meshsql
