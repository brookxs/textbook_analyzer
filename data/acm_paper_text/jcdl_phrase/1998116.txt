integrating implicit-structure visualization with authoring promotes ideation we need to harness the growing wealth of information in digital-libraries to support intellectual work involving creative and exploratory processes . prior research on hypertext-authoring shifted the focus from explicit structure to direct presentation of content aided by `` implicit '' spatial-representation of structure . we likewise shift the field of information-visualization . using hypertext 's rubric , we redefine what most people think of as `` information-visualization '' as explicit structure visualization . we alternatively address implicit-structure visualization , presenting content directly , representing structure with spatiality and other visual-features . we integrate authoring to emphasize the role of human thought in learning and ideation . prior research has shown that people iteratively collect and organize information by clipping magazines , piling clippings in somewhat messy ways , and organizing them . messyorganizer is an iterative implicit-structure visualization algorithm which , like human practice , gradually collects and organizes information clippings . content is depicted directly . structural-relationships are visualized implicitly through spatial-positioning of related elements , with overlap and translucence . the simulated-annealing-algorithm is applied to a model of semantic-relatedness over a spatial grid . we develop an experiment comparing products created with the integrated-environment versus separated visualization and authoring spaces . results reveal that participants have more novel and varied ideas when visualization is integrated with authoring .
