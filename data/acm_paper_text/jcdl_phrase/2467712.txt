the challenges of digging data : a study of context in archaeological data reuse field-archaeology only recently developed centralized systems for data-curation , management , and reuse . data documentation guidelines , standards , and ontologies have yet to see wide adoption in this discipline . moreover , repository practices have focused on supporting data-collection , deposit , discovery , and access more than data-reuse . in this paper we examine the needs of archaeological data reusers , particularly the context they need to understand , verify , and trust data others collect during field-studies . we then apply our findings to the existing work on standards-development . we find that archaeologists place the most importance on data-collection procedures , but the reputation and scholarly affiliation of the archaeologists who conducted the original field-studies , the wording and structure of the documentation created during field-work , and the repository where the data are housed also inform reuse . while guidelines , standards , and ontologies address some aspects of the context-data reusers need , they provide less guidance on others , especially those related to research-design . we argue repositories need to address these missing dimensions of context to better support data-reuse in archaeology .
