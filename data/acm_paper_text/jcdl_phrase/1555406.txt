automatically generating high quality metadata by analyzing the document code of common file types a major challenge for content-management in intranets and other large-scale document-storage-and-retrieval services is the generation of high quality metadata . manual generation of metadata is resource demanding and is often viewed by collection managers and document authors as inefficient use of their time , and there is a desire for other ways to create the needed metadata . automatic-metadata-generation (amg) is methods for generating metadata without manual-interaction using computer-program (s) to interpret the document and possibly the document context . current amg research has been limited to collection of similarly formatted documents . the research presented in this paper expands the field of amg by presenting an approach that is independent of a common visualization scheme ; amg based on document-code analysis . this is done by showing amg possibilities from latex , word and powerpoint documents and how this approach can significantly increase the quality of the generated metadata . this by avoiding common quality reducing factors as missing completeness , low accuracy , logical consistency and coherence and timeliness by giving amg algorithms direct-access to the user specified intellectual content and the file formatting . this research shows how this amg approach can be combined with other amg approaches , drawing on their strengths in order to achieve the desired high quality metadata entities .
