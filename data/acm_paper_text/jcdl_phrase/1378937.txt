a simple method for citation metadata-extraction using hidden-markov-models this paper describes a simple method for extracting metadata fields from citations using hidden-markov-models . the method is easy to implement and can achieve levels of precision-and-recall for heterogeneous citations comparable to or greater than other hmm-based methods . the method consists largely of string-manipulation and otherwise depends only on an implementation of the viterbi-algorithm , which is widely available , and so can be implemented by diverse digital-library-systems .
