improving algorithm-search using the algorithm co-citation network-algorithms are an essential part of computational-science . an algorithm-search engine , which extracts pseudo-codes and their metadata from documents , and makes it searchable , has recently been developed as part of the citeseerx suite . however , this algorithm-search engine only retrieves and ranks relevant algorithms solely on textual-similarity . here , we propose a method for using the algorithm co-citation network to infer the similarity between algorithms . we apply a graph-clustering algorithm on the network for algorithm recommendation and make suggestions on how to improve the current citeseerx algorithm-search engine .
