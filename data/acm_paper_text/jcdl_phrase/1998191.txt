perambulating libraries : demonstrating how a victorian idea can help olpc users share books in this extended abstract we detail how the open-source digital-library toolkit greenstone [4] can help users of the xolaptop produced by the one-laptop-per-child foundation manage and share electronic-documents . the idea draws upon mobile libraries (bookmobiles) for its inspiration , which first appeared in victorian times . the implemented technique works by building on the mesh-network that is instrumental to the xo-laptop approach . to use the technique , on each portable xo-laptop a version of greenstone is installed , allowing the owner to develop and manage their own set of books . the version of greenstone has been adapted to support a form of interoperability we have called digital-library talkback . on the mesh , when two xo-laptops `` see '' each other , the two users can search and browse the other user 's digital-library ; when they see a book they like , they can have it transferred to their library with a single click using the digital library talkback mechanism .
