automatic syllabus classification syllabi are important educational-resources . however , searching for a syllabus on the web using a generic search-engine is an error-prone process and often yields too many non-relevant links . in this paper , we present a syllabus classifier to filter noise out from search-results . we discuss various steps in the classification-process , including class definition , training-data preparation , feature-selection , and classifier building using svm and na ve-bayes . empirical-results indicate that the best version of our method achieves a high classification-accuracy , i.e. , an f 1 value of 83 \ % on average .
