developing recommendation services for a-digital library with uncertain and changing data in developing recommendation services for a new digital-library called ilumina (www.ilumina-project.org) , we are faced with several challenges related to the nature of the data we have available . the availability and consistency of data associated with ilumina is likely to be highly variable . any recommendation strategy we develop must be able to cope with this fact , while also being robust enough to adapt to additional types of data available over time as the digital library develops . in this paper we describe the challenges we are faced with in developing a system that can provide our users with good , consistent recommendations under changing and uncertain conditions .
