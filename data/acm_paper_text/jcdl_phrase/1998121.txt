collabseer : a search-engine for collaboration discovery collaborative-research has been increasingly popular and important in academic circles . however , there is no open-platform available for scholars or scientists to effectively discover potential collaborators . this paper discusses collabseer , an open-system to recommend potential research collaborators for scholars and scientists . collabseer discovers collaborators based on the structure of the coauthor-network and a user 's research interests . currently , three different network structure-analysis methods that use vertex-similarity are supported in collabseer : jaccard similarity , cosine-similarity , and our relation strength similarity-measure . users can also request a recommendation by selecting a topic of interest . the topic of interest list is determined by collabseer 's lexical-analysis module , which analyzes the key-phrases of previous publications . the collabseer system is highly modularized making it easy to add or replace the network-analysis module or users ' topic of interest analysis module . collabseer integrates the results of the two modules to recommend collaborators to users . initial experimental-results over a subset of the citeseerx database show that collabseer can efficiently discover prospective collaborators .
