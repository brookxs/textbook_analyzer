finding a metaphor for collecting and disseminating distributed nsdl content and communications the national-science-digital-library (nsdl) dramatically broadens the information about stem resources that it can accept and make available to its users with the introduction of the nsdl data-repository (ndr) architecture . [1] . on ramp is a platform for managing workflow , and creating , editing , distributing and storing content from multiple-users and groups in a variety of formats to transform information into knowledge by enabling the nsdl community to engage in a rich exchange of information . [2] flexible content that is small , modular , and adaptable is favored to promote this type of distributed reusable and multilayered information in an educational-digital-library such as nsdl.in this poster we trace the process used to determine a metaphor for the nsdl on ramp (onr) content and communications-system by exhibiting iterative designs for a user-interface derived from onr user-survey results .
