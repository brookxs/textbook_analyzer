scientific-research groups , digital-libraries , & education : metadata from nanoscale simulation code the nsdl materials digital-library pathway (matdl) is working with materials scientists to capture , in dublin-core xml-format , optimal description of nanoscale computer-simulation output as research codes are executed . the long term goal of the work is to enable users , such as research groups and students , to efficiently and effectively manage their results for internal use , for exchange with outside collaborators , for use in educational settings , and for submissions to digital-libraries .
