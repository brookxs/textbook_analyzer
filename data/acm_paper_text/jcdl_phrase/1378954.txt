plato : a service-oriented decision-support-system for preservation-planning the fast changes of technologies in today 's information landscape have considerably shortened the lifespan of digital-objects . digital-preservation has become a pressing challenge . different strategies such as migration and emulation have been proposed ; however , the decision for a specific tool e.g. for format migration or an emulator is very complex . the process of evaluating potential solutions against specific requirements and building a plan for preserving a given set of objects is called preservation-planning . so far , it is a mainly manual , sometimes ad-hoc process with little or no tool-support . this paper presents a service-oriented-architecture and decision-support-tool that implements a solid preservation-planning process and integrates services for content-characterisation , preservation action and automatic object comparison to provide maximum support for preservation-planning endeavours .
