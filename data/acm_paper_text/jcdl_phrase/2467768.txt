providing context for digital-library content in 2004 , the federal reserve bank of st. louis created fraser (federal reserve archival system for economic-research , http://fraser.stlouisfed.org) , a-digital library of economic , financial , and banking data and policy documents . the history of american economic policy is documented in these publications , records , and archival materials . it has become evident that fraser 's growing user base needs additional context to improve users ? ability to navigate , select , and understand the continually growing content . we have taken three approaches to improve the accessibility of our content : changes to the database , integration with other web-databases , and addition of material to support teaching activities . we hope that these changes will broaden our audience and increase site traffic .
