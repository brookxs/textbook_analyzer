a relevance-feedback approach for the author-name-disambiguation problem this paper presents a new name-disambiguation method that exploits user-feedback on ambiguous references across iterations . an unsupervised step is used to define pure training-samples , and a hybrid supervised step is employed to learn a classification-model for assigning references to authors . our classification-scheme combines the optimum-path forest (opf) classifier with complex reference similarity-functions generated by a genetic-programming framework . experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields better results than state-of-the-art disambiguation methods on two traditional datasets .
