measuring historical word-sense variation we describe here a method for automatically identifying word-sense variation in a dated collection of historical books in a large digital-library . by leveraging a small set of known translation book pairs to induce a bilingual sense inventory and labeled-training-data for a wsd classifier , we are able to automatically classify the latin word-senses in a 389 million word-corpus and track the rise and fall of those senses over a span of two thousand years . we evaluate the performance of seven different classifiers both in a tenfold test on 83,892 words from the aligned-parallel-corpus and on a smaller , manually annotated sample of 525 words , measuring both the overall accuracy of each system and how well that accuracy correlates (via mean-square-error) to the observed historical variation .
