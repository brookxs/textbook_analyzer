looking for new , not known music only : music-retrieval by melody style with the growth of digital-music , content-based-music-retrieval (cbmr) has attracted increasingly attention . for most cbmr systems , the task is to return music objects similar to query in syntactic-properties such as pitch and interval contour sequence . these approaches provide users the capability to look for music that has been heard . however , sometimes , listeners are looking , not for music they have been known , but for music that is new to them . moreover , people sometimes want to retrieve music that `` feels like '' another music object or a music style . to the best of our knowledge , no published work investigates the content-based music style retrieval . this paper describes an approach for cbmr by melody style . we proposed four types of query-specification for melody style query . the output of the melody style query is a music list ranked by the degree of relevance , in terms of music style , to the query . we developed the melody style mining algorithm to obtain the melody style-classification rules . the style ranking is determined by the style-classification rules . the experiment showed the proposed approach provides a satisfactory way for query-by-melody-style .
