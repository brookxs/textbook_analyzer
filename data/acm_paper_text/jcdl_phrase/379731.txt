an algorithm for automated rating of reviewers the current system for scholarly information dissemination may be amen able to significant improvement . in particular , going from the current system of journal publication to one of self-distributed documents offers significant cost and timeliness advantages . a major concern with such alternatives is how to provide the value currently afforded by the peer-review system . here we propose a mechanism that could plausibly supply such value . in the peer-review system , papers are judged meritorious if good reviewers give them good reviews . in its place , we propose a collaborative-filtering algorithm which automatically rates reviewers , and incorporates the quality of the reviewer into the metric of merit for the paper . such a system seems to provide all the benefits of the current peer-review system , while at the same time being much more flexible . we have implemented a number of parameterized variations of this algorithm , and tested them on data available from a quite different application . our initial experiments suggest that the algorithm is in fact ranking reviewers reasonably .
