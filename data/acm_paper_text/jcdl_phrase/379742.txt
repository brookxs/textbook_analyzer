looking at digital-library usability from a reuse perspective the need for information-systems to support the dissemination and reus e of educational-resources has sparked a number of large-scale digital-library efforts . this article describes usability-findings from one such project - the digital library for earth-system education (dlese) - focusing on its role in the process of educational resource reuse . drawing upon a reuse model developed in the domain of software-engineering , the reuse cycle is broken down into five stages : formulation of a reuse intention , location , comprehension , modification , and sharing . using this model to analyze user-studies in the dlese project , several implications for library system-design and library outreach activities are highlighted . one finding is that resource reuse occurs at different stages in the educational design-process , and each stage imposes different and possibly conflicting-requirements on digital-library-design . another finding is that reuse is a distributed process across several artifacts , both within and outside of the library itself . in order for reuse to be successful , a usability line can not be drawn at the library boundary , but instead must encompass both the library system and the educational-resources themselves .
