using web-information for creating publication-venue authority-files citations to publication venues in the form of journal , conference and workshop contain spelling-variants , acronyms , abbreviated forms and misspellings , all of which make more difficult to retrieve the item of interest . the task of discovering and reconciling these variant forms of bibliographic references is known as authority work . the key goal is to create the so called authority-files , which maintain , for any given bibliographic item , a list of variant labels (i.e. , variant strings) used as a reference to it . in this paper we propose to use information available on the web to create high quality publication-venue authority-files . our idea is to recognize (and extract) references to publication venues in the text-snippets of the answers returned by a search-engine . references to a same publication-venue are then reconciled in an authority-file . each entry in this file is composed of a canonical-name for the venue , an acronym , the venue type (i.e. , journal , conference , or workshop) , and a mapping to various forms of writing its name in bibliographic-citations . experimental-results show that our web-based method for creating authority-files is superior to previous work based on straight string-matching techniques . considering the average-precision in finding correct venue canonical names , we observe gains up to 41.7 \ % .
