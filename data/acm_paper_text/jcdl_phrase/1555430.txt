using timed-release cryptography to mitigate the preservation risk of embargo periods due to temporary access restrictions , embargoed data can not be refreshed to unlimited parties during the embargo time-interval . a solution to mitigate the risk of data loss has been developed that uses a data-dissemination framework , the timed-locked embargo framework (tlef) , that allows data refreshing of encrypted instances of embargoed content in an open , unrestricted scholarly community . tlef exploits implementations of existing technologies to `` time-lock '' data using timed-release cryptology so that tlef can be deployed as digital-resources encoded in a complex object format suitable for metadata-harvesting . the framework successfully demonstrates dynamic record identification , time-lock puzzle encryption , encapsulation and dissemination as xml-documents . we implement tlef and provide a quantitative-analysis of its successful data harvest of time-locked embargoed data with minimum time overhead without compromising data-security and integrity .
