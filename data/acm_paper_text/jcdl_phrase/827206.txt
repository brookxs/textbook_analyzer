link attachment (preferential and otherwise) in contributor-run digital-libraries ibiblio is a-digital library whose materials are submitted and maintained by volunteer-contributors . this study analyzes the emergence of hyperlinke d structures within the ibiblio collection . in the context of ibiblio , we analyze the suitability of barabasi 's model of preferential-attachment to describe the distribution of incoming links . we find that the degree of maintainer activity for a given site (as measured by the voluntary development ofdescriptive metadata) is a stronger link count predictor for ibiblio than is a site 's age , as the standard-model predicts . thus we argue that the efforts of ibiblio 's contributors positively affectthe popularity of their materials .
