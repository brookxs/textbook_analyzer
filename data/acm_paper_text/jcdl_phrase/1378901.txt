exploring educational standard alignment : in search of ` relevance ' the growing availability of online k-12-curriculum is increasing the need for meaningful alignment of this curriculum with state-specific standards . promising automated and semi-automated alignment-tools have recently become available . unfortunately , recent alignment-evaluation studies report low inter-rater-reliability , e.g. , 32 \ % with two raters and 35 documents . while these results are in line with studies in other domains , low reliability makes it difficult to accurately train automatic systems and complicates comparison of different services . we propose that inter-rater-reliability of broadly defined , abstract-concepts such as ` alignment ' or ` relevance ' must be expected to be low due to the real-world complexity of teaching and the multidimensional nature of the curricular documents . hence , we suggest decomposing these concepts into less abstract , more precise measures anchored in the daily practice of teaching . this article reports on the integration of automatic-alignment results into the interface of the teach engineering collection and on an evaluation-methodology intended to produce more consistent document-relevance ratings . our results (based on 14 raters x 6 documents) show high inter-rater-reliability (61 - 95 \ %) on less abstract relevance dimensions while scores on the overall ` relevance ' concept are (as expected) lower (64 \ %) . despite a relatively small-sample size , regression-analysis of our data resulted in an explanatory (r 2 = .75) and statistically stable (p-values
