interacting with and through a-digital library collection : commenting behavior in flickr 's the commons there is growing interest by digital-collection providers to engage collection users in interacting with the collection (e.g. by tagging or annotating collection contents) and with the collection organizers and other users (e.g. to form loose `` communities '' associated with the collection) . at present , little has been documented as to the uptake of these mechanisms in specific collections , or the range of behaviors that emerge as users bend existing facilities to their own needs . this paper is one step in that direction : it describes the social-information behaviors exhibited in a cultural-heritage photography collection in the commons on flickr , and suggests implications for digital-library-design in response to these behaviors .
