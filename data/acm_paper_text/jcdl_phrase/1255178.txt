categorization and analysis of text in computer-mediated-communication archives using visualization digital-libraries (dls) for online-discourse contain large amounts of valuable information that is difficult to navigate and analyze . visualization-systems developed to facilitate improved cmc archive analysis and navigation primarily focus on interaction-information , with little emphasis on textual content . in this paper we present a system that provides dl exploration services such as visualization , categorization , and analysis for cmc text . the system incorporates an extended feature-set comprised of stylistic , topical , and sentiment related features to enable richer content-representation . the system also includes the ink blot technique which utilizes decision-tree models and text overlay to visualize cmc messages . ink blots can be used for text-categorization and analysis across forums , authors , threads , messages , and over time . the proposed system 's analysis capabilities were evaluated with a series of examples and a qualitative-user-study . empirical categorization experiments comparing the ink blot technique against a benchmark support-vector-machine-classifier were also conducted . the results demonstrated the efficacy of the ink blot technique for text-categorization and also highlighted the effectiveness of the extended feature-set for improved text-categorization .
