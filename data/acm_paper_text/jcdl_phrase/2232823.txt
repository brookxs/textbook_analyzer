digital-preservation and knowledge-discovery based on documents from an international health-science program important biomedical-information is often recorded , published or archived in unstructured and semi-structured textual form . artificial-intelligence and knowledge-discovery techniques may be applied to large volumes of such data to identify and extract useful metadata , not only for providing access to these documents , but also for conducting analyses and uncovering patterns and trends in a field . the system for preservation of electronic resources (sper) , an information-management tool developed at the u.s. national-library-of-medicine , provides these capabilities by integrating machine-learning , data-mining and digital-preservation techniques . in this paper , we present an overview of sper and its ability to retrieve information from one such dataset . we show how sper was applied to the semi-structured records of an international health-science program , the 46-year continuous archive of conference-publications and related documents from the joint cholera panel of the u.s.-japan cooperative medical-science program (cmsp) . we explain the techniques by which metadata was extracted automatically from the semi-structured-document contents to preserve these publications , and show how such data was used to quantitatively describe the activity of a research-community toward a preliminary study of a subset of its specific health-science program goals .
