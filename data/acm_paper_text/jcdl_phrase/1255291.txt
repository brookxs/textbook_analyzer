use vs. access : design and use in educational-digital-libraries the poster will compare and contrast the design and usage assumptions of existing educational-digital-libraries and repositories to challenge digital-library developers to meet the needs of their increasingly sophisticated users . traditionally , assumptions have focused on access to a site and discovery of content , whereas we define use as content and its application (context , audience , etc.) . in this poster we will review the assumptions that have driven the design of digital-libraries , their services and evaluation . measures of success such as page views of metadata rest on assumptions associated with access , i.e. , the number of times a metadata record is displayed . this measure provides a very limited view of how a-digital library is used . we believe that educational-digital-libraries need to go beyond such a limited view and think about what people actually do with material : are they using it ? are they returning to it ? are they modifying it ? are they sharing it with others ? we will explore an alternate set of metrics for determining the success (or failure) of educational-digital-libraries by examining metrics focused on use of the contents of educational-digital-libraries .
