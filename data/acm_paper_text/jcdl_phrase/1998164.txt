wpv4 : a re-imagined walden 's paths to support diverse user communities the walden 's paths project , as part of our philosophy of continual evaluation , seeks out user-communities who may find our tool useful . however , our users , in the last few years , have reported a series of common issues and desired features . in order to support our users , we initiated a redesign of walden 's paths to solve these problems and enable us to rapidly prototype and experiment with features and interfaces . in order to accomplish these goals , we have created a web-service that handles the storage and representation of our path data-structure . this service is isolated from user-interface layers , allowing multiple interface designs to be implemented on top of the same path data-structures . our prototype interfaces also represent new areas for paths such as collaborative-work , offline presentation , and mobile computing .
