standards or semantics for curriculum search ? aligning digital-library-resources with national and state educational-standards to help k-12-teachers search for relevant curriculum is an important issue in the digital-library community . aligning standards from different states promises to help teachers in one state find appropriate materials created and cataloged elsewhere . although such alignments provide a powerful means for crosswalking standards and curriculum across states , alignment matrices are intrinsically sparse . hence , we hypothesize that such sparseness may cause significant numbers of false-negatives when used for searching curriculum . our preliminary results confirm the false-negative hypothesis , demonstrate the usefulness of term-based techniques in addressing the false-negative problem , and explore ways to combine term occurrence data with standards correlations .
