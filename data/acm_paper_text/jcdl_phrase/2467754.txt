a classification-scheme for algorithm citation function in scholarly works algorithms are ubiquitous in the computer-science literature . a search-engine for algorithms has been tested as part of the citeseerx suite ; however , it only retrieves algorithms whose metadata is textually matched with the search-query . such a limitation occurs because a traditional search-engine does not have the ability to understand what algorithms are and how they work . here , we present an initial effort in understanding the semantics of algorithms . specifically , we identify how an existing algorithm can be used in scholarly works and propose a classification-scheme for algorithm function .
