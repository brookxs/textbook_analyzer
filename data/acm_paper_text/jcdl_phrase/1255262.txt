automatic patent-classification using citation-network information : an experimental-study in nanotechnology classifying and organizing documents in repositories is an active research-topic in digital-library studies . manually classifying the large volume of patents and patent applications managed by patent offices is a labor-intensive task . many previous studies have employed patent contents for patent-classification with the aim of automating this process . in this research we propose to use patent citation-information , especially the citation-network structure-information , to address the patent-classification problem . we adopt a kernel-based approach and design kernel-functions to capture content information and various citation-related information in patents . these kernels . performances are evaluated on a testbed of patents related to nanotechnology . evaluation results show that our proposed labeled citation-graph kernel , which utilized citation-network structures , significantly outperforms the kernels that use no citation-information or only direct citation-information .
