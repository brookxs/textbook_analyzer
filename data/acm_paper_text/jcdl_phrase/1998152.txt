designing interconnected distributed-resources for collaborative-inquiry_based science-education this paper describes the design and evaluation of a distributed information resource system (irs) shared between field and laboratory settings for higher-education geology students . an investigation of geo-science scholarship and technical pilot studies highlighted the importance of situational specific and distributed information usage . to advance our understanding of novel resource approaches (i.e. from tabletops to tablets) and collaborative-learning , two in-depth field-trials evaluated 21 students ' information journeys (i.e. initiating information-needs , facilitating information and collaborative-interpretation) . analysis identified how a designing for a varied device ecology supported information-filtering and empathy between locations provoking deeper reflection and abstract understanding in the field , while live collaborative remote-interaction provided an engaging yet distinct learning-experience for those in the laboratory .
