using markov-models and innovation-diffusion as a tool for predicting digital-library access and distribution this paper , discusses a general approach to predicting data-access rates and user-access-patterns for planning distribution capacities and for monitoring data usage . the approach uses a steady-state markov-model to describe user-activities and innovation-diffusion to describe the rate at which a na ? ve population adopts accessing-data from a-digital library .
