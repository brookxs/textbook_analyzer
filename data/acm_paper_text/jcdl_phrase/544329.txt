digital-library-system : capture , analysis , query , and display 3d-data this paper describes development of a storage , archival , and sketch-based query-and-retrieval system for 3d-objects . the initial focus has been native-american ceramic vessels , scanned and defined as a set of three-dimensional triangulated meshes composed of points and triangles . the process involves modeling the data with parametric-surfaces , and extracting relevant features to raise the level of abstraction of data . the project uses a class_based xml-schema to catalog and organize vessel data . a visual-query process was developed to permit users to interact with the data using sketches or by selecting sample vessel shapes to augment text and metric search criteria to retrieve original and modeled data , and interactive 2d and 3d models .
