the dienst-oai gateway though the open-archive-initiative protocol for metadata-harvesting (oai-pmh) is becoming the de facto standard for digital-libraries , some of its predecessors are still in use . although a limited number of dienst repositories continue to be populated , others are precariously unsupported . the dienst open archive gateway (dog) is a gateway between the oai-pmh and the dienst (version 4.1) protocol . dog allows oaipmh harvesters to extract metadata records (in rfc-1807 or dublin-core) from dienst servers .
