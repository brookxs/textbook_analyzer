in-depth utilization of chinese ancient maps : a hybrid-approach to digitizing map resources in cadal digital-map is getting increasingly popular as an intuitive and interactive platform for data-presentation recently . thus applications integrated with digital-map have attracted much attention . but no offtheshelf systems or services could we use if the time span of maps be extended to historical ones . there are a large number of valuable ancient atlases in cadal digital-library . however , they are seldom made use of because the ones which are in image format are not convenient for users to read or search . in this paper , we propose a novel hybrid-approach to utilizing these atlases directly and constructing some applications based on ancient maps . we call it camame which means chinese ancient maps automatic-marking and extraction . we create a gazetteer to store the geographic-information of sites which will be project on the map , then use kernel-method to do the regression and correct the estimated results with image-processing and local-regression methods . the empirical-results show that camame is effective and efficient , by which most valuable data in the map-images is marked and identified . some chinese literary chronicle applications that exhibit ancient literary and related historical-information over those digitized atlas resources in cadal digital-library were developed .
