developing practical automatic-metadata-assignment and evaluation-tools for internet resources this paper describes the development of practical automatic-metadata-assignment tools to support automatic record creation for virtual-libraries , metadata repositories and digital-libraries , with particular reference to library-standard metadata . the development-process is incremental in nature , and depends upon an automatic-metadata-evaluation tool to objectively measure its progress . the evaluation-tool is based on and informed by the metadata created and maintained by librarian experts at the infomine project , and uses different metrics to evaluate different metadata fields . in this paper , we describe the form and function of common metadata fields , and identify appropriate performance-measures for these fields . the automatic-metadata-assignment tools in the ivia virtual-library software are described , and their performance is measured . finally , we discuss the limitations of automatic-metadata-evaluation , and cases where we choose to ignore its evidence in favor of human-judgment .
