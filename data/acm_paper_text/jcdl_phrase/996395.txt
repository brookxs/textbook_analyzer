semantic-video-classification and feature-subset-selection under context-and-concept-uncertainty as large-collections of videos become one key component of digital-libraries , there is an urgent need of semantic-video-classification and feature-subset-selection to enable more effective video-database organization and retrieval . however , most existing techniques for classifier-training require a large number of labeled samples to learn correctly and suffer from the problems of context-and-concept-uncertainty when only a limited number of labeled samples are available . to address the problems of context-and-concept-uncertainty , we have proposed a novel framework to achieve incremental classifier-training by integrating a limited number of labeled samples with a large number of unlabeled-samples . specifically , the contributions of this paper include : (a) using the salient-objects to achieve a middle-level understanding of video contents and enhance the quality of features on discriminating among different semantic video concepts ; (b) modeling the semantic video concepts by using the finite-mixture-models to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient-objects ; (c) developing an adaptive-em-algorithm to integratethe unlabeled-samples to enable incremental classifier-training and address the problem of context-uncertainty ; (d) proposing a cost-sensitive video-classification technique to address the problem of concept uncertainty over time ; (e) supporting automatic-video-annotation via semantic-classification our experimental-results in a certain domain of medical-education videos have also been provided a convincing proof of our conclusions .
