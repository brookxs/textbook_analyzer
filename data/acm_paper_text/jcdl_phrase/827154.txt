protein association-discovery in biomedical-literature protein association-discovery can directly contribute toward developing protein pathways ; hence it is a significant problem in bioinformatics . lucas (library of user-oriented concepts for access services) was designed to automatically extract and determine associations among proteins from biomedical-literature . such a tool has notable potential to automate database-construction in biomedicine , instead of relying on experts ' analysis . this paper reports on the mechanisms for automatically generating clusters of proteins . a formal evaluation of the system , based on a subset of 2000 medline titles and abstracts , has been conducted against swiss-prot database in which the associations among concepts are entered by experts manually .
