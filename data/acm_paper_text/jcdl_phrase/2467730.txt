constructing an anonymous dataset from the personal digital photo libraries of mac app-store users personal digital photo libraries embody a large amount of information useful for research into photo-organization , photo-layout , and development of novel photo-browser features . even when anonymity can be ensured , amassing a sizable dataset from these libraries is still difficult due to the visibility and cost that would be required from such a study . we explore using the mac app-store to reach more users to collect data from such personal digital photo libraries . more specifically , we compare and discuss how it differs from common data collection methods , e.g. amazon-mechanical-turk , in terms of time , cost , quantity , and design of the data-collection application . we have collected a large , openly available photo feature dataset using this manner . we illustrate the types of data that can be collected . in 60 days , we collected data from 20,778 photo sets (473,772 photos) . our study with the mac app-store suggests that popular application distribution-channels is a viable means to acquire massive-data collections for researchers .
