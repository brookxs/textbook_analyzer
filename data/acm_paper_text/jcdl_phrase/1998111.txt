sharedcanvas : a collaborative model for medieval manuscript layout dissemination in this paper we present a model based on the principles of linked-data that can be used to describe the interrelationships of images , texts and other resources to facilitate the interoperability of repositories of medieval-manuscripts or other culturally important handwritten-documents . the model is designed from a set of requirements derived from the real-world use-cases of some of the largest digitized medieval content holders , and instantiations of the model are intended as the input to collection-independent page turning and scholarly presentation interfaces . a canvas painting paradigm , such as in pdf and svg , was selected based on the lack of a one to one correlation between image and page , and to fulfill complex requirements such as when the full text of a page is known , but only fragments of the physical object remain . the model is implemented using technologies such as oai-ore aggregations and oac annotations , as the fundamental building-blocks of emerging linked digital-libraries . the model and implementation are evaluated through prototypes of both content providing and consuming applications . although the system was designed from requirements drawn from the medieval manuscript domain , it is applicable to any layout-oriented presentation of images of text .
