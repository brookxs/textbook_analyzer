tags in domain-specific sites : new information ? if researchers use tags in retrieval applications they might assume , implicitly , that tags represent novel information , e.g. , when they attribute performance-improvement in their retrieval algorithm (s) to the use of tags . in this work , we investigate whether this assumption is true . we focus on the use of tags in domain-specific websites because such websites are more likely to have a coherent , discernible website structure and because the users that are searching for and tagging pages in such a site may have specific information-needs (as opposed to the broad range of information-needs that users have when browsing/searching the-internet at large) . for this study , we assume that the application of the same tag to multiple pages provides an indication that those pages are related . to determine whether this indication of relatedness is contributing new information , we first measure whether pages with common tag (s) could have been deemed as related based on site structure as measured by shortest navigational distance between pages . second , we measure whether or not tags could have been determined algorithmically based on standard tf-idf scores of terms on the page . based on our analysis of two different sites , we found that tags contribute novel information that is not discernible from site structure or site/page content .
