query-page intention matching using clicked titles and snippets to boost search rankings users of text-retrieval-systems input only a few keywords or sometimes just one keyword to the systems even if they had complex-information-needs . due to the lack of query keywords , it becomes hard to return relevant search-results that satisfy the demands of each user . because digital-documents , in contrast to queries , are generally composed of many kinds of keywords , it is also difficult to estimate the main topic or grasp the inherent intentions of the documents . in this paper , we present techniques to represent users ' search intentions and the intentions that digital-documents can satisfy by making use of clicked titles and snippets acquired from a click-log-analysis . we then present a method to match these intentions to boost search-result-rankings . through experiments that use click-logs and indexes of a commercial-search-engine , we verified our method 's capability of significantly improving search precision .
