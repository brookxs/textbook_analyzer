a-digital library for water main break identification and visualization this paper describes a prototype of a-digital library for water main break identification and visualization . many utilities rely on an emergency call to detect water main breaks , because breaks are difficult to predict . collecting the information by call requires time consuming human efforts . furthermore , it is not archived and not shared with others . collecting and archiving the information by tweets , news , and web-resources helps users to identify relevant water main breaks efficiently . in developing this prototype , we extracted location-information from text instead of using gps-data . we also describe the importance of tweet visualization by location , and how we visualize tweets on a map .
