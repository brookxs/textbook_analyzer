error anaylsis of chinese-text segmentation using statistical-approach the chinese-text segmentation is important for the indexing of chinese documents , which has significant impact on the performance of chinese-information-retrieval . the statistical-approach overcomes the limitations of the dictionary_based approach . the statistical-approach is developed by utilizing the statistical-information about the association of adjacent characters in chinese-text collected from the chinese-corpus both known words and unknown words can be segmented by the statistical-approach . however , errors may occur due to the limitation of the corpus . in this work , we have conducted the error-analysis of two chinese-text segmentation techniques using statistical-approach , namely , boundary-detection and heuristic-method such error-analysis is useful for the-future development of the automatic text segmentation of chinese-text or other text in oriental languages . it is also helpful to understand the impact of these errors on the information-retrieval-system in digital-libraries .
