distributed-web-search efficiency by truncating results a large set of web-documents (the trec gov2 collection) comes from many separate internet hosts , such as www.nih.gov and travel.state.gov . there is considerable variability in the number of web-pages (i.e. , documents) from each host . in this paper , we present and evaluate a method for setting a maximum number of `` hits '' that may be presented for each web host . federated-search environments are increasingly common components of digital-libraries and in these environments , the benefit of such a maximum is that it can reduce the number of possibly relevant documents presented by each subcollection , without hurting early-precision measures such as p@20 . derivation of a maximum number , which is proportional to the subcollection size but not sensitive to different search topics , is made possible by an analysis of patterns of relevance-judgment across approximately 17,000 web hosts in gov2 .
