collaborative-design with use-case scenarios digital-libraries , particularly those with a community-based governanc e structure , are best designed in a collaborative setting . in this paper , we compare our experience using two design-methods : a task-centered method that draws upon a group 's strength for eliciting and formulating tasks , and a use-case method that tends to require a focus on defining an explicit process for tasks . we discuss how these methods did and did not work well in a collaborative setting .
