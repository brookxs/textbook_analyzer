trends in metadata practices : a longitudinal-study of collection federation with the increasing focus on interoperability for distributed digital content , resource developers need to take into consideration how they will contribute to large federated collections , potentially at the national and international level . at the same time , their primary objectives are usually to meet the needs of their own institutions and user-communities . this tension between local practices and needs and the more global potential of digital-collections has been an object of study for the imls digital collections and content (imls dcc) project . our practical aim has been to provide integrated access to over 160 imls-funded digital-collections through a centralized collection registry and metadata-repository . during the course of development , the research team has investigated how collections and items can best be represented to meet the needs of local resource developers and aggregators of distributed-content , as well as the diverse user communities they may serve . this paper presents results from a longitudinal-analysis of imls dcc development trends between 2003 and 2006 . changes in metadata applications have not been pronounced . however , multi-scheme use has become less common , and use of dublin-core remains high , even as recognition of its limitations grows . locally developed schemes are used as much as marc , and may be on the increase as new collections are incorporating less traditional library and museum materials , and more interactive and multimedia-content . based on our empirical understanding of metadata use in practice , patterns in new content-development , and user-community indicators , our research has turned toward identifying metadata relationships between items and collections to preserve context and enhance functionality and usefulness for scholarly user-communities .
