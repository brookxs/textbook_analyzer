free benchmark-corpora for preservation experiments : using model-driven-engineering to generate data-sets digital-preservation is an active area of research , and recent years have brought forward an increasing number of characterisation tools for the object-level analysis of digital-content . however , there is a profound lack of objective , standardised and comparable metrics and benchmark collections to enable experimentation and validation of these tools . while fields such as information-retrieval have for decades been able to rely on benchmark collections annotated with ground-truth to enable systematic improvement of algorithms and systems along objective metrics , the digital preservation field is yet unable to provide the necessary ground-truth for such benchmarks . objective indicators , however , are the key enabler for quantitative experimentation and innovation . this paper presents a systematic model-driven benchmark-generation framework that aims to provide realistic approximations of real-world digital-information collections with fully known ground-truth that enables systematic quantitative experimentation , measurement and improvement against objective indicators . we describe the key motivation and idea behind the framework , outline the technological building-blocks , and discuss results of the generation of page-based and hierarchical documents from a ground-truth model . based on a discussion of the benefits and challenges of the approach , we outline future work .
