a comparative-study of citations and links in document-classification it is well known that links are an important source of information when dealing with web collections . however , the question remains on whether the same techniques that are used on the web can be applied to collections of documents containing citations between scientific papers . in this work we present a comparative-study of digital-library citations and web-links , in the context of automatic-text-classification . we show that there are in fact differences between citations and links in this context . for the comparison , we run a series of experiments using a-digital library of computer-science papers and a web-directory . in our reference collections , measures based on co-citation tend to perform better for pages in the web-directory , with gains up to 37 \ % over text_based classifiers , while measures based on bibliographic-coupling perform better in a-digital library . we also propose a simple and effective way of combining a traditional text_based classifier with a citation-link based classifier . this combination is based on the notion of classifier reliability and presented gains of up to 14 \ % in micro-averaged f1 in the web collection . however , no significant gain was obtained in the digital-library . finally , a user-study was performed to further investigate the causes for these results . we discovered that misclassifications by the citation-link based classifiers are in fact difficult cases , hard to classify even for humans .
