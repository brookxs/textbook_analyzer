computer classification-system usage in citeseer the acm society for computing and professionals provides a-digital library whose computer classification-system (ccs) is based on a taxonomy that has been continuously updated over the years . the citeseer digital-library contains a large-collection of computer-science-research papers , many of which are tagged with categories from the ccs taxonomy . by analyzing citeseer 's tagged documents and by considering different time frames , we extracted statistics that shows how the ccs taxonomy covers the publications in computer and information science research sub-fields . we also studied size and growth of categories over the last four available years . we believe that the identification of such trends within taxonomies would greatly help to improve the structure of classification-systems and would help the construction of more efficient browsing and searching systems .
