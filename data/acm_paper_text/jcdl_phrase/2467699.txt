wikimirs : a mathematical information-retrieval-system for wikipedia mathematical formulae in structural formats such as mathml and latex are becoming increasingly available . moreover , repositories and websites , including arxiv and wikipedia , and growing numbers of digital-libraries use these structural formats to present mathematical formulae . this presents an important new and challenging area of research , namely mathematical information-retrieval (mir) . in this paper , we propose wikimirs , a tool to facilitate mathematical formula retrieval in wikipedia . wikimirs is aimed at searching for similar mathematical formulae based upon both textual and spatial similarities , using a new indexing and matching model developed for layout structures . a hierarchical generalization technique is proposed to generate sub-trees from presentation trees of mathematical formulae , and similarity is calculated based upon matching at different levels of these trees . experimental-results show that wikimirs can efficiently support sub-structure matching and similarity-matching of mathematical formulae . moreover , wikimirs obtains both higher accuracy and better ranked results over wikipedia in comparison to wikipedia search and egomath . we conclude that wikimirs provides a new , alternative , and hopefully better service for users to search mathematical expressions within wikipedia .
