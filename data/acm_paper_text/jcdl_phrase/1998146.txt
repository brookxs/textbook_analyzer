when use-cases are not useful : data-practices , astronomy , and digital-libraries as science becomes more dependent upon digital-data , the need for data-curation and for data digital-libraries becomes more urgent . questions remain about what researchers consider to be their data , their criteria for selecting and trusting data , and their orientation to data challenges . this paper reports findings from the first 18 months of research on astronomy-data practices from the data conservancy . initial findings suggest that issues for data-production , use , preservation , and sharing revolve around factors that rarely are accommodated in use-cases for digital-library-system design including trust in data , funding structures , communication-channels , and perceptions of scientific value .
