addressing the challenge of visual-information access from digital-image and video-libraries while it would seem that digital-video-libraries should benefit from access mechanisms directed to their visual contents , years of trec-video-retrieval-evaluation (trecvid) research have shown that text-search against transcript narrative-text provides almost all the retrieval capability , even with visually oriented generic topics . a within-subjects study involving 24 novice participants on trecvid 2004 tasks again confirms this result . the study shows that satisfaction is greater and performance is significantly better on specific and generic information-retrieval-tasks from news broadcasts when transcripts are available for search . additional runs with 7 expert-users reveal different novice and expert interaction-patterns with the video-library interface , helping explain the novices ' lack of success with image-search and visual-feature browsing for visual-information needs . analysis of trecvid visual-features well suited for particular tasks provides additional insights into the role of automated feature-classification for digital-image and video-libraries .
