rethinking preservation validation with the preserved object and repository risks ontology (porro) for securing digital longevity , the processes of preservation-planning and evaluation are fundamentally implicit and share similar complexity . means are required for the identification , documentation and association of those properties of data , representation and management mechanisms that in combination lend value , facilitate interaction and influence the preservation process . these properties may be almost limitless in terms of diversity , but are integral to the establishment of classes of risk-exposure , and the planning and deployment of appropriate preservation-strategies . we present porro , an ontology_based approach for documenting objects , repositories and risk-information , intended to support preservation decision-making and evaluation .
