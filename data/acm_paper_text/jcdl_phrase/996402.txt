enhancing digital-libraries with techlens + the number of research papers available is growing at a staggering rate . researchers need tools to help them find the papers they should read among all the papers published each year . in this paper , we present and experiment with hybrid-recommender algorithms that combine collaborative-filtering and content-based . filtering to recommend research papers to users . our hybrid-algorithms combine the strengths of each filtering approach to address their individual weaknesses . we evaluated our algorithms through offline experiments on a database of 102 , 000 research papers , and through an online-experiment with 110 users . for both experiments we used a dataset created from the citeseer repository of computer-science-research papers . we developed separate english and portuguese versions of the interface and specifically recruited american and brazilian users to test for cross-cultural effects . our results show that users value paper recommendations , that the hybrid algorithms can be successfully combined , that different algorithms are more suitable for recommending different kinds of papers , and that users with different levels of experience perceive recommendations differently these results can be applied to develop recommender-systems for other types of digital-libraries .
