on the extraction of vocal-related information to facilitate the management of popular-music collections with the explosive growth of networked collections of musical material , there is a need to establish a mechanism like a-digital library to manage music data . this paper presents a content-based processing-paradigm of popular song collections to facilitate the realization of a music-digital-library . the paradigm is built on the automatic-extraction of information of interest from music audio-signals . because the vocal part is often the heart of a popular song , we focus on developing techniques to exploit the solo vocal signals underlying an accompanied performance . this supports the necessary functions of a music-digital-library , namely , music data-organization , music-information retrieval/recommendation , and copyright-protection .
