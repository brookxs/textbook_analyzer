bibrank : a language-based model for co-ranking entities in bibliographic networks bibliographic documents are basically associated with many entities including authors , venues , affiliations , etc. . while bibliographic-search engines addressed mainly relevant-document ranking according to a query topic , ranking other related relevant bibliographic entities is still challenging . indeed , document-relevance is the primary level that allows inferring the relevance of the other entities regardless of the query topic . in this paper , we propose a novel integrated ranking-model , called bibrank , that aims at ranking both document and author entities in bibliographic networks . the underlying algorithm propagates entity scores through the network by means of citation and authorship links . moreover , we propose to weight these relationships using content-based indicators that estimate the topical-relatedness between entities . in particular , we estimate the common similarity between homogeneous entities by analyzing marginal citations . we also compare document and author language-models in order to evaluate the level of author 's knowledge on the document-topic and the document representativeness of author 's knowledge . experiment results on the representative citeseerx dataset show that bibrank model outperforms baseline ranking-models with a significant improvement .
