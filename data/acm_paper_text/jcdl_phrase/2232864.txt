improving multi-faceted book-search by incorporating sparse latent-semantic-analysis of click-through logs multi-faceted book-search engine presents diverse category-style options to allow users to refine search-results without re-entering a query . in this paper , we propose a novel multi-faceted book-search engine that utilizes users ' query-related latent intents mined from click-through logs as multiple facets for books . the latent query-intents can be effectively and efficiently discovered by applying the sparse latent-semantic-analysis (lsa) model to users ' query and clicking behaviors in the click-through logs . this paper presents the details to improve the multi-faceted book-search by incorporating the compact-representation of query-intent-book relationships generated by sparse lsa into the off-line and online-processing procedures . the specificity of latent query-intents can be flexibly changed by adjusting the sparsity level of projection matrix in the sparse lsa model . we evaluated our approach on cadal click-through logs containing 45,892 queries and 164,822 books . the experimental-results show the sparse lsa model with more sparse projection matrix tends to discover the more specific latent query-intents . the latent query-intents suggested by our approach usually gain the high user-satisfaction ratio .
