repository synchronization in the oai framework the open-archives-initiative protocol for metadata-harvesting (oai-pmh) began as an alternative to distributed-searching of scholarly eprint repositories . the model embraced by the oai-pmh is that of metadata-harvesting , where value-added-services (by a `` service-provider '') are constructed on cached copies of the metadata extracted from the repositories of the harvester 's choosing . while this model dispenses with the well known problems of distributed-searching , it introduces the problem of synchronization . stated simply , this problem arises when the service-provider 's copy of the metadata does not match the metadata currently at the constituent repositories . we define some metrics for describing the synchronization problem in the oai-pmh . based on these metrics , we study the synchronization problem of the oai-pmh framework and propose several approaches for harvesters to implement better synchronization . in particular , if a repository knows its update frequency , it can publish it in an oai-pmh identify response using an optional about container that borrows from rdf site syndication (rss) format .
