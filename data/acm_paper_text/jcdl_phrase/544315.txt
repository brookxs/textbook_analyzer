how important is metadata ? metadata is expensive . information-services and digital-library researchers spend considerable time , effort , and money on metadata . it is time to ask a number of important questions : how much metadata is really necessary and for what reason ? what are the right metrics for metadata ; its correctness , appropriateness , and return-on-investment ? is metadata-harvesting really useful for the creation of digital-library services ? are the assumptions about the utility , or even necessity , of metadata a legacy of years of library-science and practice ? do these assumptions make sense in the current context of massive computing power and automatic-analysis ? . clearly there is no one `` correct ' answer to these questions . the panel will provide the forum for practitioners and researchers from a number of areas to express their views and , hopefully , provoke stimulating discussions from the audience .
