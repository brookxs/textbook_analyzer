content-based-indexing of musical scores this paper describes a method of automatically creating a content-based index of musical scores . the goal is to capture the themes , or motifs , that appear in the music . the method was tested by building an index of 25 orchestral movements from the classical-music literature . for every movement , the system captured the primary theme , or a variation of the primary theme . in addition , it captured 13 of 28 secondary themes . the resulting index was 14 \ % of the size of the database . a further reduction of 2 \ % is possible ; however , this discards secondary themes . a listening experiment using five orchestral movements showed that people can reliably recognize secondary themes after listening to a piece of music-therefore , it may be necessary to retain secondary themes in a score index .
