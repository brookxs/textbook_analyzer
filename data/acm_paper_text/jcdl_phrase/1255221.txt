toward alternative measures for ranking venues : a case of database-research community-ranking of publication venues is often closely related with important issues such as evaluating the contributions of individual scholars/research groups , or subscription decision-making . the development of large-scale digital-libraries and the availability of various meta-data provide the possibility of building new measures more efficiently and accurately . in this work , we propose two novel measures for ranking the impacts of academic venues an easy-to-implement seed-based measure that does not use citation-analysis , and a realistic browsing-based measure that takes an article reader 's behavior into account . both measures are computationally efficient yet mimic the results of the widely accepted impact-factor . in particular , our proposal exploits the fact that : (1) in most disciplines , there are `` top '' venues that most people agree on ; and (2) articles that appeared in good venues are more likely to be viewed by readers . our proposed measures are extensively evaluated on a test-case of the database-research community using two real bibliography data-sets - acm and dblp . finally , ranks of venues by our proposed measures are compared against the impact-factor using the spearman 's rank-correlation coefficient , and their positive rank-order relationship is proved with a statistical significance-test .
