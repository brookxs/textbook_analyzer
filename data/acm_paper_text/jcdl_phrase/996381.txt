the 3d vase museum : a new approach to context in a-digital library we present a new approach to displaying and browsing a-digital library collection , a set of greek vases in the perseus digital-library . our design takes advantage of three-dimensional-graphics to preserve context even while the user focuses in on a single item . in a typical digital-library user-interface , a user can either get an overview for context or else see a single selected item , sacrificing the context view . in our 3d vase museum , the user can navigate seamlessly from a high level scatterplot-like plan view to a perspective overview of a subset of the collection , to a view of an individual item , to retrieval of data associated with that item , all within the same virtual room and without any mode-change or special command . we present this as an example of a solution to the problem of focus-plus-context in information-visualization . we developed 3d-models from the 2d photographs in the collection and placed them in our 3d virtual room . we evaluated our approach by comparing it to the conventional interface in perseus using tasks drawn from archaeology courses and found a clear improvement subjects who used our 3d vase museum performed the tasks 33 \ % better and did so nearly three times faster .
