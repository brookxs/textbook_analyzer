exploiting log-files in video-retrieval while research into user-centered text-retrieval is based on mature evaluation-methodologies , user-evaluation in multimedia-retrieval is still in its infancy . user-evaluations can be expensive and are also often non-repeatable . an alternative way of evaluating such systems is the use of simulations . in this poster , we present an evaluation-methodology which is based on exploiting log-files recorded from a user-study we conducted .
