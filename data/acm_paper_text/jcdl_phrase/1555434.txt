a polyrepresentational approach to interactive-query-expansion interactive-query-expansion (iqe) presents suggested terms to the user during their search to enable better information-retrieval (ir) . however , iqe terms are poorly used , and tend to lack information meaningful to the user . the lack of cognitive and functional support during query-refinement is a well documented problem , and despite the work carried out , it is still an under researched area . this stagnation in progress has been partly due to the long held belief that users are able to make good iqe term selections , and that the de facto way iqe terms are presented is effective . in this paper , we introduce a novel method to improve the presentation of iqe terms by providing supplementary information alongside them . we describe a user-study that compared our novel polyrepresentational approach to iqe against a conventional iqe system and a baseline system . our findings have shown that a polyrepresentational approach to iqe can address the ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding iqe , and improve the perceived-usefulness of the terms .
