transferring structural markup across translations using multilingual-alignment and projection we present here a method for automatically projecting structural-information across translations , including canonical citation structure (such as chapters and sections) , speaker information , quotations , markup for people and places , and any other element in tei-compliant xml that delimits spans of text that are linguistically symmetrical in two languages . we evaluate this technique on two datasets , one containing perfectly transcribed texts and one containing errorful ocr , and achieve an accuracy rate of 88.2 \ % projecting 13,023 xml tags from source-documents to their transcribed translations , with an 83.6 \ % accuracy rate when projecting to texts containing uncorrected ocr . this approach has the potential to allow a highly granular multilingual digital-library to be bootstrapped by applying the knowledge contained in a small , heavily curated collection to a much larger but unstructured one .
