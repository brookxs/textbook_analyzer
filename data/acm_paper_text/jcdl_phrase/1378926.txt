a study of awareness in multimedia-search awareness of another 's activity is an important aspect of facilitating collaboration between users , enabling an `` understanding of the activities of others '' [1] . techniques such as collaborative-filtering enable a form of asynchronous awareness , providing recommendations generated from the past activity of a-community of users . in this paper we investigate the role of awareness and its effect on search-behavior in collaborative-multimedia retrieval . we focus on the scenario where two users are searching at the same time on the same task , and via the interface , can see the activity of the other user . the main research question asks : does awareness of another searcher aid a user when carrying out a multimedia-search session ? to encourage awareness , an experimental-study was designed where two users were asked to find as many relevant video shots as possible under different awareness conditions . these were individual search (no awareness of each other) , mutual awareness (where both user 's could see each other 's search screen) , and unbalanced awareness (where one user is able to see the other 's screen , but not vice-versa) . twelve pairs of users were recruited , and the four worst performing trecvid 2006 search topics were used as search-tasks , under four different awareness conditions . we present the results of this study , followed by a discussion of the implications for multimedia digital-library-systems .
