tagging semantics : investigations with wordnet the content of a tag-sequence references both a user 's concepts and the user 's conceptualization of an information-object . the tagging history of 823 users of the delicious social-tagging service is analyzed using wordnet . three semantic measures of the tagging content are developed : the level of category references , the changes in category-level for each noun as the tagging sequence unfolds , and the scope of concept coverage as the compactness of the wordnet subgraph for the noun senses . observed patterns of concept reference as a function of sequence position hint at dynamic properties of the tag production-process by marking a trace of cognitive-activity . if tagging is object-categorization , these measures provide a view of the personal categorization behavior of non-professionals and illuminate biases in the production of ` folksonomies ' due to tag production processes .
