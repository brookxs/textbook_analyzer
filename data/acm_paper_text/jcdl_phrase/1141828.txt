automatic feature thesaurus-enrichment : extracting generic terms from digital-gazetteer adl gazetteer is a digitalized worldwide gazetteer developed in the alexandria digital-library (adl) project , which contains millions of geographic names (placenames) . the placenames are indexed with type terms from the adl feature-type thesaurus (ftt) , a hierarchical category scheme . the paper proposes a two-step method to enrich the category scheme automatically : to discover frequent generic terms by detecting phase boundaries with a mutual information-based method , and to correlate the generic terms with the relevant type terms by hierarchical-clustering . the correlation pair established can then be used to supplement the ftt with the generic terms found . the extensive experiments conducted on millions of adlg placenames demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods . besides the thesaurus-enrichment , the potential applications of this research include : to suggest likely type terms when categorizing new placenames , and to help users choose likely search-terms .
