generating fuzzy semantic-metadata describing spatial-relations from images using the r-histogram automatic-generation of semantic-metadata describing spatial-relations is highly desirable for image-digital-libraries relative spatial-relations between objects in an image convey important information about the image . because the perception of spatial-relations is subjective , we propose a novel framework for automatic-metadata-generation based on fuzzy k - nn classification that generates fuzzy semantic-metadata describing spatial-relations between objects in an image . for each pair of objects of interest , the corresponding r-histogram is computed and used as input for a set of fuzzy k -- nn classifiers . the r-histogram is a quantitative representation of spatial-relations between two objects the outputs of the classifiers are soft class labels for each of the following eight spatial-relations : 1) left of , 2) right of , 3) above , 4) below , 5) near , 6) far , 7) inside , 8) outside because the classifier-training stage involves annotating the training-images manually , it is desirable to use as few training-images as possible . to address this issue , we applied existing prototype-selection techniques and also devised two new extensions . we evaluated the performance of different fuzzy k - nn algorithms and prototype-selection algorithms empirically on both synthetic and real images . preliminary experimental-results show that our system is able to obtain good annotation accuracy (92 \ % -- 98 \ % on synthetic-images and 82 \ % -- 93 \ % on real images) using only a small training set (4 -- 5 images) .
