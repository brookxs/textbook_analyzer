discovering australia 's research data access to data crucial to research is often slow and difficult . when research problems cross disciplinary boundaries , problems are exacerbated . this paper argues that it is important to make it easier to find and access data that might be found in an institution , in a disciplinary data store , in a government department , or held privately . we explore how to meet ad-hoc needs that can not easily be supported by a disciplinary ontology , and argue that web-pages that describe data-collections with rich links and rich text are valuable . we describe the approach followed by the australian national data-service (ands) in making such pages available . finally , we discuss how we plan to evaluate this approach .
