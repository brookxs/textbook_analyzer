power to the people : end-user building of digital-library-collections naturally , digital-library-systems focus principally on the reader : th e consumer of the material that constitutes the library . in contrast , this paper describes an-interface that makes it easy for people to build their own library collections . collections may be built and served locally from the user 's own web-server , or (given appropriate permissions) remotely on a shared digital-library host . end-users can easily build new collections styled after existing ones from material on the web or from their local files-or both , and collections can be updated and new ones brought on-line at any time . the interface , which is intended for non-professional end-users , is modeled after widely used commercial software-installation packages . lest one quail at the prospect of end-users building their own collections on a shared system , we also describe an-interface for the administrative user who is responsible for maintaining a-digital library installation .
