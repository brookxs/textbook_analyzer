towards a new reading-experience via semantic-fusion of text and music in cadal , there preserve a lot of chinese classical literatures , including graceful prose and verse . these works written in ancient chinese comparatively are concise in vocabulary and sentence patterns . but they express rich feelings and convey a wealth of information . although can be explained in modern chinese , the aesthetic sense in those works disappears . so we aim to illustrate the feeling in these works using chinese traditional-music which is also another part of chinese-culture . this is an interesting and challenging work . in this paper , the correlation between the text and music is studied . a novel approach is proposed to model the latent-semantic-association underlying the two medium . based on the correlation model we learned from training-data , we can associate a literary work (mainly verse and prose in our digital-library) with a few music pieces automatically . when a reader is appreciating a literary work , a piece of background-music is playing meanwhile , the information and emotion implied by the work and music blend together . the reader may be immersed into the emotion and obtain aesthetic enjoyment intensively . we implement the proposed method and design-experiments to evaluate the performance of it . the experimental result substantiates the feasibility of the proposed approach in this paper .
