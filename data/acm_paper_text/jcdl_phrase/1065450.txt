to grow in wisdom : vannevar-bush , information-overload , and the life of leisure it has been nearly sixty years since vannevar-bush 's essay , `` as we may think , '' was first published in the atlantic monthly , an article that foreshadowed and possibly invented hypertext . while much has been written about this seminal piece , little has been said about the argument bush presented to justify the creation of the memex , his proposed personal-information device . this paper revisits the article in light of current technological and social-trends . it notes that bush 's argument centered around the problem of information-overload and observes that in the intervening years , despite massive technological-innovation , the problem has only become more extreme . it goes on to argue that today 's manifestation of information-overload will require not just better management of information but the creation of space and time for thinking and-reflection , an objective that is consonant with bush 's original aims .
