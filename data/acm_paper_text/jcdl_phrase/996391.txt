element matching in concept-maps concept-maps (cm) are informal , semantic , node-link conceptual-graphs used to represent knowledge in a variety of applications . algorithms that compare concept-maps would be useful in supporting educational processes and in leveraging indexed digital-collections of concept-maps . map comparison begins with element matching and faces computational challenges arising from vocabulary overlap , informality , and organizational variation . our implementation of an adapted similarity flooding algorithm improves matching of cm knowledge elements over a simple string-matching approach .
