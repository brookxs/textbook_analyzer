building searchable collections of enterprise speech-data we have applied speech-recognition and text-mining technologies to a set of recorded outbound marketing calls and analyzed the results . since speaker-independent-speech-recognition technology results in a significantly lower recognition-rate than that found when the recognizer is trained for a particular speaker , we applied a number of post-processing algorithms to the output of the recognizer to render it suitable for the textract text-mining-system . we indexed the call transcripts using a search-engine and used textract and associated java-technologies to place the relevant terms for each document in a relational-database . following a search-query , we generated a thumbnail display of the results of each call with the salient terms highlighted . we illustrate these results and discuss their utility . we took the results of these experiments and continued this analysis on a set of talks and presentations . we describe a distinct document genre based on the note-taking concept of document-content , and propose a significant new method for measuring speech-recognition-accuracy . this procedure is generally relevant to the problem of capturing meetings and talks and providing a searchable index of these presentations on the web .
