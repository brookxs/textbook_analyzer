digital-libraries for scientific-data discovery and reuse : from vision to practical reality science-and-technology research is becoming not only more distributed and collaborative , but more highly instrumented . digital-libraries provide a means to capture , manage , and access the data-deluge that results from these research enterprises . we have conducted research on data-practices and participated in developing data management services for the center for embedded networked-sensing since its founding in 2002 as a national-science-foundation science-and-technology center . over the course of eight years , our digital-library strategy has shifted dramatically in response to changing technologies , practices , and policies . we report on the development of several dl systems and on the lessons-learned , which include the difficulty of anticipating data requirements from nascent technologies , building-systems for highly diverse work-practices and data-types , the need to bind together multiple single-purpose systems , the lack of incentives to manage and share data , the complementary nature of research-and-development in understanding practices , and sustainability .
