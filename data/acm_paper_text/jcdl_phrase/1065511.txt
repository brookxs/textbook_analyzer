eviada : ethnomusicological video for instruction and analysis digital-archive the field of ethnomusicology depends heavily on ethnographic-research or `` fieldwork '' by researchers that often involves the capture and subsequent analysis of audio and video information , to help document and understand the musical practices of people all over the world . ethnomusicologists have used a variety of recording technologies over the years to capture film and video , and much of this footage lies in researchers ' offices and home basements . no systematic mechanism exists for preserving and providing access to this video for other students and scholars.the ethnomusicological video for instruction and analysis digital-archive (eviada) [1] is a multi-year collaborative project between indiana university and the university of michigan to create a-digital archive for field video recordings captured by ethnomusicology researchers . this digital-archive will serve both to preserve this content for future generations of scholars and also to provide a resource to support teaching-and-learning in ethnomusicology , anthropology , and related disciplines . the creation of eviada has involved a unique collaboration between ethnomusicologists , librarians , archivists , and technologists in carrying out all stages of the project , including video digitization , metadata-creation , and system and user-interface design.as part of the project , we are developing several software-tools : the segmentation/annotation tool is a java-swing application written using apple 's quicktime for java-api . it allows an ethnomusicologist who is contributing a video collection to the archive to divide that video into a hierarchy of segments , attach free-text descriptions and controlled-vocabulary terms to each segment , and output this information in the form of a mets [3] xml-document incorporating mods [2] descriptive-metadata records . this mets document can then be ingested into downstream archival and delivery-systems . we hope to evolve this software into a more general-purpose tool for the creation of mets documents for video objects.we are also building a web-based-user-interface on top of the fedora-digital-repository system to allow users to search and browse video-content in the collection via the descriptive-metadata and annotations , making appropriate-use of controlled-vocabulary thesauri to increase search recall .
