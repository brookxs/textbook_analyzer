lessons-learned from developing and evaluating a comprehensive digital-library for engineering-education educating the engineering-education community in today 's digital world requires straightforward yet flexible access to high-quality educational-resources . the teach engineering and needs (national engineering-education delivery-system) digital-libraries collaborated in 2005 to create and steward the k-gray engineering pathway (ep) , a premier portal to comprehensive engineering and computing-education resources within the greater national-science-digital-library (nsdl) . we collaborated to design navigation , implement features , and find imagery that could effectively address both k-12 and higher-education audiences . a system was designed to serve both target audiences , including an expanded simple search on every page to include grade/audience level search fields . this search , on all main pages , also includes a choice of learning-resource type and a link to the advanced search with expanded search fields . ep tailored many features such as community pages and cataloging to be distinguishable by k-12 versus higher-education users . evaluation-studies show that our current strength is a consistent interface with strong usability features . in this paper , we a provide retrospective and summarize our lessons-learned and evaluation results , along with our directions for future-research and development .
