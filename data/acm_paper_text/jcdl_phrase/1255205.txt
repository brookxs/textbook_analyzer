a unified platform for archival description and access the archival community has developed content and data-structure standards to facilitate access to the diverse and unique sets of archival records , personal papers , and manuscript collections that are held by archival repositories and special-collections libraries . however , these standards are difficult for archivists to use and are often implemented in ways that negatively affect materials-handling workflows , depriving archival users of the best possible access to the totality of materials available within an individual repository . the authors propose that archival descriptive problems can be addressed by implementing a web/database application that is tailored specifically to archival needs and can be implemented with little technical knowledge . this paper describes the system-architecture of one such tool , the archon software package , which was developed at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign . archon automates many technical tasks , such as producing a searchable website , an ead instance or a marc record . although the system utilizes sophisticated algorithms and optimizations , it is easily extensible because most development takes place in an easy-to-use , object-oriented environment .
