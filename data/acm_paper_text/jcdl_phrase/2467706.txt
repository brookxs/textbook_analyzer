automatic tag recommendation for metadata annotation using probabilistic-topic-modeling the increase of the complexity and advancement in ecological and environmental sciences encourages scientists across the world to collect data from multiple places , times , and thematic scales to verify their hypotheses . accumulated over time , such data not only increases in amount , but also in the diversity of the data sources spread around the world . this poses a huge challenge for scientists who have to manually search for information . to alleviate such problems , onemercury has recently been implemented as part of the dataone project to serve as a portal for accessing environmental and observational-data across the globe . onemercury harvests metadata from the data hosted by multiple repositories and makes it searchable . however , harvested metadata records sometimes are poorly annotated or lacking meaningful keywords , which could affect effective retrieval . here , we develop algorithms for automatic-annotation of metadata . we transform the problem into a tag-recommendation problem with a controlled tag library , and propose two variants of an algorithm for recommending tags . our experiments on four datasets of environmental-science metadata records not only show great promises on the performance of our method , but also shed light on the different natures of the datasets .
