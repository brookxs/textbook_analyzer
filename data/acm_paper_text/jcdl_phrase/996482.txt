geographic-information-retrieval (gir) ranking methods for digital-libraries this demo will presents results from an evaluation of algorithms forranking results by probability-of-relevance for geographic-information-retrieval (gir) applications . we will demonstrate an algorithm for gir ranking based on logistic-regression from samples of the test-collection we also show the effects of different representations of the geographic regions being searched , including minimumbounding rectangles , convex-hulls , and complex polygons .
