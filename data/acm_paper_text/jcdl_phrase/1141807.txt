ecopod : a mobile tool for community_based biodiversity collection-building biological studies rely heavily on large-collections of species observations . all of these collections can not be compiled by biology professionals alone . skilled amateurs can assist by contributing observations they make in the field . the challenge with such contributions is their potentially questionable quality . we present our pda-based application ecopod , which replaces traditional paper field guides with a mobile-computing platform . ecopod aims both to increase the efficiency of the identification-process and its reliability . the application solicits as little information from the user as possible . at the same time it places no restrictions on the sequencing of the identification-process . this approach is to make our solution attractive to both skilled amateurs and professionals . the tool creates a record of the identification-process , thereby providing an audit-trail for quality-assurance . ecopod 's user-interface driver computes information-gain over identification metadata to maximize screen utilization . the tool ingests sdd , an international standard for xml-datasets that describe organisms .
