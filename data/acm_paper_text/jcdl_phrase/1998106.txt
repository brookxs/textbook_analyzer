indexing musical pieces using their major repetition with the growing presence of large-collections of musical content , methods for facilitating efficient browsing and fast comparisons of audio pieces become more and more useful . notably , methods that isolate relevant parts in audio pieces give an insight of the musical content and can be used to improve similarity-evaluation systems . in this context , we propose an indexing-method that allows retrieving in audio-signals particular parts , namely a major repetition . we use harmonic representations together with string-matching techniques to strictly define and isolate such segments . experiments on state-of-the-art structural datasets show a strong correlation between the retrieved parts and the perceived structure of pieces .
