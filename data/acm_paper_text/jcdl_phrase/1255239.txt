a rich opac user-interface with ajax open public-access catalogs (opacs) provide patrons with a user-interface (ui) to help their information-seeking-tasks . even though many opac uis are now web-based , their architectures are often static , which does not allow them to integrate user-assistance modules dynamically . we report on a ui that supports integration of such modules , while providing a usable and rich environment . we explore how asynchronous javascript + xml (ajax) can be employed to create an opac ui that offers a better user-experience and task-support . our developed ui features a modular-architecture that combines several natural-language-processing (nlp) modules employed to enhance information-seeking . our ui manages queries in a novel way with a tabbed interface featuring an overview/details presentation-model , and an ajax query results data-grid . preliminary user-testing results are also presented .
