xtagger : a new approach to authoring document-centric-xml the process of authoring document-centric-xml documents in humanities disciplines is very different from the approach espoused by the standard xml-editing software with the data-centric view of xml . where data-centric-xml is generated by first describing a tree-structure of the encoding and then providing the content for the leaf elements , document-centric encodings start with content which is then marked up . in the paper we describe our approach to authoring document-centric-xml documents and the tool , xtagger , originally developed for this purpose within the electronic boethius project [2] , otherwise enhanced within the archway project [5] , an interdisciplinary project devoted to development of methods and software for preparation of image-based-electronic-editions of historic manuscripts .
