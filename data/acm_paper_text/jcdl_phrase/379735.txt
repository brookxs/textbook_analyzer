designing a-digital library for young-children as more information-resources become accessible using computers , our digital-interfaces to those resources need to be appropriate for all people . however when it comes to digital-libraries , the interfaces have typically been designed for older children or adults . therefore , we have begun to develop a-digital library-interface developmentally appropriate for young-children (ages 5-10 years old) . our prototype-system we now call searchkids offers a graphical-interface for querying , browsing and reviewing search-results . this paper describes our motivation for the research , the design partnership we established between children and adults , our design-process , the-technology outcomes of our current work , and the lessons we have learned .
