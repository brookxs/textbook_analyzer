how can spreaders affect the indirect infuence on twitter ? most studies on social-influence have focused on direct influence , while another interesting question can be raised as whether indirect influence exists between two users who 're not directly connected in the network and what affects such influence . in addition , the theory of complex contagion tells us that more spreaders will enhance the indirect influence between two users . our observation of intensity of indirect influence , propagated by n parallel spreaders and quantified by retweeting probability on twitter , shows that complex contagion is validated globally but is violated locally . in other words , the retweeting probability increases non-monotonically with some local drops .
