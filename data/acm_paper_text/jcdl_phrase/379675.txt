extracting taxonomic relationships from on-line definitional sources using lexing we present a system which extracts the genus word and phrase from free - form definition text , entitled lexing , for lexical-information from glossaries . the extractions will be used to build automatically a lexical-knowledge-base from on-line domain-specific glossary sources . we combine statistical and semantic processes to extract these terms , and demonstrate that this combination allows us to predict the genus even in difficult situations such as empty head definitions or verb definitions . we also discuss the use of linking prepositions for use in skipping past empty head genus phrases . this system is part of a project to extract ontological information for energy glossary information .
