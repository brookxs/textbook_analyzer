unsupervised creation of small-world-networks for the preservation of digital objects the prevailing model for digital-preservation is that archives should be similar to a `` fortress '' : a large , protective infrastructure built to defend a relatively small collection of data from attack by external-forces . such projects are a luxury , suitable only for limited collections of known importance and requiring significant institutional commitment for sustainability . in previous research , we have shown the-web infrastructure (i.e. , search-engine-caches , web-archives) refreshes and migrates web-content in bulk as side-effects of their user-services , and these results can be mined as a useful , but passive preservation service . our current-research involves a number of questions resulting from removing the implicit assumption that web-based data objects must passively await curatorial services : what if data objects were not tethered to repositories ? what are the implications if the content were actively seeking out and injecting itself into the-web infrastructure (i.e. , search-engine-caches , web-archives) ? all of this leads to our primary research question : can we create objects that preserve themselves more effectively than repositories or web infrastructure can ?
