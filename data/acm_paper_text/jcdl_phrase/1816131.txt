citing for high impact the question of citation behavior has always intrigued scientists from various disciplines . while general citation-patterns have been widely studied in the literature we develop the notion of citation-projection graphs by investigating the citations among the publications that a given paper cites . we investigate how patterns of citations vary between various scientific disciplines and how such patterns reflect the scientific impact of the paper . we find that idiosyncratic citation-patterns are characteristic for low impact papers ; while narrow , discipline-focused citation-patterns are common for medium impact papers . our results show that crossing-community , or bridging citation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are characteristic for both low and high impact papers . last , we observe that recently citation-networks are trending toward more bridging and interdisciplinary forms .
