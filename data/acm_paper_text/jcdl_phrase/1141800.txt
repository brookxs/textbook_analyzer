keyphrase extraction-based query-expansion in digital-libraries in pseudo-relevance-feedback , the two key factors affecting the retrieval-performance most are the source from which expansion terms are generated and the method of ranking those expansion terms . in this paper , we present a novel unsupervised query expansion-technique that utilizes keyphrases and pos phrase categorization . the keyphrases are extracted from the retrieved documents and weighted with an algorithm based on information-gain and co-occurrence of phrases . the selected keyphrases are translated into disjunctive-normal-form (dnf) based on the pos phrase categorization-technique for better query refomulation . furthermore , we study whether ontologies such as wordnet and mesh improve the retrieval-performance in conjunction with the keyphrases . we test our techniques on trec 5 , 6 , and 7 as well as a medline collection . the experimental-results show that the use of keyphrases with pos phrase categorization produces the best-average precision .
