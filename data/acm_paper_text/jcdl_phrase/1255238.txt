static reformulation : a user-study of static hypertext for query-based reformulation hypertext allows users to navigate between related materials in digital-libraries . the most fundamental automated hypertexts are those constructed on the basis of semantic-similarity . such hypertexts have been evaluated by a variety of means , but seldom by real-users given simulated real-world tasks . we claim that while other methods exist , one of the best ways to prove the usefulness of hypertext is to show the benefits for users performing realistic tasks . we compare the reformulation of queries that users perform in keyword searching , to the query-reformulation implicit in browsing between documents linked by similarity of content . we find that a static automatically-constructed similarity hypertext provides useful linking between related items , improving the retrieval of targets when used to augment standard keyword-search .
