building domain-specific web collections for scientific digital-libraries : a meta-search enhanced focused-crawling method collecting domain-specific documents from the-web using focused-crawlers has been considered one of the most important strategies to build digital-libraries that serve the scientific community . however , because most focused-crawlers use local-search-algorithms to traverse the-web space , they could be easily trapped within a limited sub-graph of the-web that surrounds the starting urls and build domain-specific collections that are not comprehensive and diverse enough to scientists and researchers . in this study , we investigated the problems of traditional focused-crawlers caused by local-search-algorithms and proposed a new crawling approach , meta-search enhanced focused-crawling , to address the problems . we conducted two user-evaluation experiments to examine the performance of our proposed approach and the results showed that our approach could build domain-specific collections with higher quality than traditional focused-crawling techniques .
