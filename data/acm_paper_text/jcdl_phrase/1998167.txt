analytic potential of data : assessing reuse value realizing the vision of networked-data collections and services requires large bodies of scientific-data that can be used in new ways . adapting the concept of epistemological potential , we illustrate an approach for assessing the value of data for reuse in new domains . two criteria for this analytic potential - integrity and fit-for-purpose - are recognized aspects of data-curation , however identifying potential domains of interest for reuse requires knowledge of practices and needs across disciplines . evaluating analytic potential will become increasingly important for libraries and repositories to make informed decisions about recruitment and curation of data for interdisciplinary-science .
