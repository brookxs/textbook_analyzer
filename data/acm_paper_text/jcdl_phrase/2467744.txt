automatic-performance-evaluation of dewarping methods in large-scale digitization of historical-documents geometric distortions are among the major challenging issues in the analysis of historical document images . such distortions appear as arbitrary warping , folds and page curl , and have detrimental effects upon recognition (ocr) and readability . while there are many dewarping techniques discussed in the literature , there exists no standard method by which their performance can be evaluated against each other . in particular , there is not any satisfactory method capable of comparing the results of existing dewarping techniques on arbitrary wrapped documents . the existing methods either rely on the visual comparison of the output and input images or depend on the recognition-rate of an ocr system . in the case of historical-documents , ocr either is not available or does not generate an acceptable result . in this paper , an objective and automatic-evaluation methodology for document-image dewarping technique is presented . in the first step , all the baselines in the original distorted image as well as dewarped image are modelled precisely and automatically . then based on the mathematical function of each line , a comprehensive metric which calculates the performance of a dewarping technique is introduced . the presented method does not require user interference in any stage of evaluation and therefore is quite objective . experimental-results , applied to two state-of-the art dewarping methods and an industry-standard commercial-system , demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dewarping evaluation-method .
