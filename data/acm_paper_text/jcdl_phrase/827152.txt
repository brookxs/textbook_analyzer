metis : lightweight , flexible , and web-based workflow services for digital-libraries the metis project is developing workflow technology designed for use in digital-libraries by avoiding the assumptions made by traditional workflow-systems . in particular , digital-libraries have highly distributed sets of stake-holders who nevertheless must work together to perform shared activities . hence , traditional assumptions that all members of a workflow belong to the same organization , work in the same fashion , or have access to similar computing platforms are invalid . the metis approach makes use of event-based workflows to support the distributed nature of digital-library workflow and employs techniques to make the resulting technology lightweight , flexible , and integrated with the-web . this paper describes the conceptual-framework behind the metis approach as well as a prototype which implements the framework . the prototype represents a `` proof-of-concept '' of the metis framework and approach as we show how it can both model and execute a peer-review workflow drawn from a `` real-world '' digital-library . after describing related work , the paper concludes with a discussion of future-research opportunities in the area of digital-library workflow and outlines how metis is being deployed to a small set of digital-libraries for additional evaluation .
