an application of multiple-viewpoints to content-based-image-retrieval content-based-image-retrieval uses features that can be extracted from the images themselves . using more than one representation of the images in a collection can improve the results presented to a user without changing the underlying feature-extraction or search technologies . we present an example of this `` multiple viewpoint '' approach , multiple image channels , and discuss its advantages for an image-seeking user . this approach has also been shown to dramatically improve retrieval-effectiveness in content-based-image-retrieval systems [3] .
