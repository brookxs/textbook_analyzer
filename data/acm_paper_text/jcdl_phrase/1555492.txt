designing exploratory search-tasks for user-studies of information-seeking support-systems this poster describes a procedure for designing exploratory tasks for use in laboratory evaluations of information-seeking interfaces . this procedure is grounded in the literature on information-seeking and information retrieval and has been refined by an evaluation of four tasks designed for a study of a faceted library-catalog . the procedure is intended to be extensible to generate exploratory tasks for other types of interfaces and domains .
