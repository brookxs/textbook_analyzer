snac : the social-networks and archival context project this demonstration will show the prototype access and search-system for the social-networks and archival context project . the system is built on a database of merged encoded archival context - corporate bodies , persons , and families (eac-cpf) records derived from encoded-archival-description (ead) records held by the library-of-congress , the california digital-library , the northwest digital-archives , and virginia heritage , combined with information from name authority files from the library-of-congress , oclc research , and the getty vocabulary program . the database merges information from each instance of an individual name in these resources , along with variant names , biographical notes and their topical descriptions . the prototype interface makes this information searchable while retaining links to the various data sources , other resources (such as books by or about a person) and to other individuals , families and organizations associated with that name .
