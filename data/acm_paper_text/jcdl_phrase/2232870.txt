evaluating and ranking patents using weighted citations citation counts have been widely used in a-digital library for purposes such as ranking scientific publications and evaluating patents . this paper demonstrates that distinguishing different types of citations could rank better for these purposes . we differentiate patent citations along two dimensions (assignees and technologies) into four types , and propose a weighted citation approach for assessing and ranking patents . we investigate five weight-learning methods and compare their performance . our weighted citation method performs consistently better than simple citation counts , in terms of rank correlations with patent renewal status . the estimated weights on different citations are consistent with economic insights on patent citations . our study points to an interesting and promising research line on patent citation and network-analysis that has not been explored .
