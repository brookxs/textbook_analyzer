recovering a website 's server components from the-web infrastructure our previous research has shown that the collective-behavior of search-engine-caches (e.g. , google , yahoo , live search) and web-archives (e.g. , internet-archive) results in the uncoordinated but large-scale refreshing and migrating of web-resources . interacting with these caches and archives , which we call the-web infrastructure (wi) , allows entire websites to be reconstructed in an approach we call lazy preservation . unfortunately , the wi only captures the client-side view of a web-resource . while this may be useful for recovering much of the content of a website , it is not helpful for restoring the scripts , web-server configuration , databases , and other server-side components responsible for the construction of the website 's resources . this paper proposes a novel technique for storing and recovering the server-side components of a website from the wi . using erasure-codes to embed the server-side components as html comments throughout the website , we can effectively reconstruct all the server components of a website when only a portion of the client-side resources have been extracted from the wi . we present the results of a preliminary study that baselines the lazy preservation of ten eprints repositories and then examines the preservation of an eprints repository that uses the erasure-code technique to store the server-side eprints software throughout the website . we found nearly 100 \ % of the eprints components were recoverable from the wi just two weeks after the repository came online , and it remained recoverable four months after it was `` lost '' .
