learning to deduplicate identifying record replicas in digital-libraries and other types of digital-repositories is fundamental to improve the quality of their content and services as well as to yield eventual sharing efforts . several deduplication strategies are available , but most of them rely on manually chosen settings to combine evidence used to identify records as being replicas . in this paper , we present the results of experiments we have carried out with a novel machine-learning-approach we have proposed for the deduplication problem . this approach , based on genetic-programming (gp) , is able to automatically generate similarity-functions to identify record replicas in a given repository . the generated similarity-functions properly combine and weight the best evidence available among the record fields in order to tell when two distinct records represent the same real-world entity . the results of the experiments show that our approach outperforms the baseline method by fellegi and sunter by more than 12 \ % when identifying replicas in a data-set containing researcher 's personal-data , and by more than 7 \ % , in a data-set with article citation data .
