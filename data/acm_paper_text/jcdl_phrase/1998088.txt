extending digital-repository architectures to support disk image preservation and access disk images (bitstreams extracted from physical-media) can play an essential role in the acquisition and management of digital collections by serving as containers that support data-integrity and chain of custody , while ensuring continued access to the underlying bits without depending on physical carriers . widely used today by practitioners of digital-forensics , disk images can serve as baselines for comparison for digital-preservation activities , as they provide fail-safe mechanisms when curatorial actions make unexpected changes to data ; enable access to potentially valuable data that resides below the file-system level ; and provide options for future analysis . we discuss established digital-forensics techniques for acquiring , preserving and annotating disk images , provide examples from both research and educational collections , and describe specific forensic tools-and-techniques , including an object-oriented data packaging framework called the advanced-forensic-format (aff) and the digital forensics xml (dfxml) metadata representation .
