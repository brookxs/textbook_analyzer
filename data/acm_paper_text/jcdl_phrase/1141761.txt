an effective approach to entity-resolution problem using quasi-clique and its application to digital-libraries we study how to resolve entities that contain a group of related elements in them (e.g. , an author entity with a list of citations or an intermediate-result by group by sql-query) . such entities , named as grouped-entities , frequently occur in many applications . by exploiting contextual-information mined from the group of elements per entity in addition to syntactic similarity , we show that our approach , quasi-clique , improves precision-and-recall unto 91 \ % when used together with a variety of existing entity-resolution solutions , but never worsens them .
