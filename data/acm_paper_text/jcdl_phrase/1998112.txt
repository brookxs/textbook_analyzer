use of subimages in fish-species-identification : a qualitative-study many scholarly tasks involve working with subdocuments , or contextualized fine-grain information , i.e. , with information that is part of some larger unit . a-digital library (dl) facilitates management , access , retrieval , and use of collections of data-and-metadata through services . however , most dls do not provide infrastructure or services to support working with subdocuments . superimposed-information (si) refers to new information that is created to reference subdocuments in existing information-resources . we combine this idea of si with traditional dl services , to define and develop a dl with si (si-dl) . we explored the use of subimages and evaluated the use of superidr , a prototype si-dl , in fish-species-identification , a scholarly task that involves working with subimages . the contexts and strategies of working with subimages in superidr suggest new and enhanced support (si-dl services) for scholarly tasks that involve working with subimages , including new ways of querying and searching for subimages and associated information . the main conceptual contributions of our work are the insights gained from these findings of the use of subimages and of superidr , which lead to recommendations for the design of digital-libraries with superimposed-information .
