from nsdl 1.0 to nsdl 2.0 : towards a comprehensive cyberinfrastructure for teaching-and-learning nsdl is a premier provider of digital educational collections and services , which has been supported by nsf for eight years . as a mature program , nsdl has reached a point where it could either change direction or wind down . in this paper we argue there are reasons to continue the program and we outline several possible new program directions . these build on nsdl 's learning-platform , and they also look towards nsf 's emerging interest in supporting work at the intersection of cyberinfrastructure and education . we consider nsdl 's potential roles in several grand-challenges that confront education , including : tailoring educational-resources to students ' needs , providing educators with a cyber-teaching environment , developing a cyber-workbench for researchers , and integrating education-research and practice .
