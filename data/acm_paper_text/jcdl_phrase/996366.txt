automatic organization for digital-photographs with geographic coordinates we describe photocompas , a system that utilizes the time and location-information embedded in digital-photographs to automatically organize a personal-photo-collection photocompas produces browseable location and event hierarchies for the collection . these hierarchies are created using algorithms that interleave time and location to produce an organization that mimics the way people think about their photo-collections . in addition , our algorithm annotates the generated hierarchy with geographical names . we tested our approach in case-studies of three real -- world collections and verified that the results are meaningful and useful for the collection owners .
