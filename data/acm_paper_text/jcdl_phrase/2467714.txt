vertical-selection in the information-domain of children in this paper we explore the vertical-selection methods in aggregated-search in the specific domain of topics for children between 7 and 12 years old . a test-collection consisting of 25 verticals , 3.8 k queries and relevant assessments for a large sample of these queries mapping relevant verticals to queries was built . we gather relevant assessment by envisaging two aggregated-search systems : one in which the-web vertical is always displayed and in which each vertical is assessed independently from the-web vertical . we show that both approaches lead to a different set of relevant verticals and that the former is prone to bias of visually oriented verticals . in the second part of this paper we estimate the size of the verticals for the target-domain . we show that employing the global size and domain-specific size-estimation of the verticals lead to significant improvements when using state-of-the art methods of vertical-selection . we also introduce a novel vertical and query-representation based on tags from social-media and we show that its use lead to significant performance gains .
