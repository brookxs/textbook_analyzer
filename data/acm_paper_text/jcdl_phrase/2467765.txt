semi-automated rediscovery of lost youtube music-videos users frequently post popular material to youtube , and in response , others link to these videos from social-media , blogs , forums , and email . however , this content may be removed for numerous reasons , only to resurface again at another url . this continuous movement and breaking of the-web graph makes it difficult for users to relocate content that has moved in youtube . we present volitrax , an add-on for firefox which redirects users to youtube music-videos that have moved to a different url within youtube . volitrax acts as an intermediary that corrects the-web graph transparently so youtube links continue to work even after the content has changed locations .
