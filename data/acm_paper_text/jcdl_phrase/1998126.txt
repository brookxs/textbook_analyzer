understanding digital-library-adoption : a use-diffusion approach with the growth in operational digital-libraries , the need for automatic methods capable of characterizing adoption and use has grown . we describe a computational methodology for producing two , inter-related , user typologies based on use-diffusion . use-diffusion theory views technology-adoption as a process that can lead to widely different patterns of use across a given population of potential users ; these models use measures of frequency and variety to characterize and describe these usage-patterns . the methodology uses computational techniques such as clickstream entropy and clustering to produce both coarse-grained and fine-grained user typologies . a case-study demonstrates the utility and applicability of the method : it is used to understand how middle and high-school-science teachers participating in an academic year-long field-trial adopted and integrated digital-library-resources into their instructional planning and teaching . the resulting fine-grained user typology identified five different types of teacher-users , including `` interactive-resource specialists '' and `` community seeker specialists '' this typology was validated through comparison with qualitative and quantitative data collected using traditional educational field-research-methods .
