using standards in digital-library-design & development this tutorial will cover a set of standards and defacto standards that can play a role in the design and development of digital-library-applications . the standards that will be discussed are the iso mpeg-21-digital-item-declaration , the iso mpeg-21 digital item identification , the iso mpeg-21 digital item processing , the open-archives protocol for metadata-harvesting , the-internet archive arc file-format , the niso openurl framework for context-sensitive services , and the proposed info uri scheme . the tutorial will discuss these standards by illustrating how they have been used in the context of the adore digital-object repository . adore [8] has been designed and implemented for ingesting , storing , and accessing a vast collection of digital-objects at the research-library of the los alamos national laboratory . since adore is not a product , the tutorial is not a product advertisement . rather , it is an opportunity for designers and developers to learn about standards that can help addressing real-life challenges in dl design-and-development , and help increase interoperability across systems . the presenters are actively involved in all of the standardization efforts that are discussed .
