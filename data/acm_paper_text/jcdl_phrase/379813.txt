the virtual naval hospital : the digital library as knowledge-management tool for nomadic patrons to meet the information-needs of isolated primary care providers and t heir patients in the united-states (u.s.) navy , a-digital health sciences library - virtual naval hospital (http://www.vnh.org) - was created through a unique partnership between academia and government . the creation of the digital library was heavily influenced by the principles of user-centered-design , and made allowances for the nomadic nature of the digital librarys patrons and the heterogeneous-access they have to internet bandwidth . the result is a-digital library that has been in operation since 1997 , that continues to expand in size , that is heavily used , and that is highly regarded by its patrons . over time , the digital library has evolved into a knowledge-management system for the u.s.-navy bureau of medicine and surgery . a number of valuable technical , personal , and political lessons have been learned about delivering digital-library and knowledge-management services to nomadic patrons . they can be summarized by stating that to succeed in the design-and-implementation of a-digital library that serves as a knowledge-management tool , regardless of the field of endeavor , one must focus initially and then consistently on the population served and what their mission is , and tailor the digital library to their needs . if this is done , the result will be a tool that is heavily used and sincerely appreciated . these lessons-learned will become increasingly valuable as society moves towards a ubiquitous-computing environment .
