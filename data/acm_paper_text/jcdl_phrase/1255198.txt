can social-bookmarking enhance search in the-web ? social-bookmarking is an emerging type of a web-service that helps users share , classify , and discover interesting resources . in this paper , we explore the concept of an enhanced-search , in which data from social-bookmarking systems is exploited for enhancing search in the-web . we propose combining the widely used link-based-ranking metric with the one derived using social-bookmarking data . first , this increases the precision of a standard link-based search by incorporating popularity estimates from aggregated data of bookmarking users . second , it provides an opportunity for extending the search capabilities of existing search-engines . individual-contributions of bookmarking users as well as the general statistics of their activities are used here for a new kind of a complex search where contextual , temporal or sentiment-related information is used . we investigate the usefulness of social-bookmarking systems for the purpose of enhancing web-search through a series of experiments done on datasets obtained from social-bookmarking systems . next , we show the prototype-system that implements the proposed approach and we present some preliminary results .
