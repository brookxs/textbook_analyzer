using word-sense-discrimination on historic-document-collections word-sense-discrimination is the first , important step towards automatic-detection of language-evolution within large , historic-document-collections . by comparing the found word-senses over time , we can reveal and use important information that will improve understanding and accessibility of a-digital archive . algorithms for word-sense-discrimination have been developed while keeping today 's language in mind and have thus been evaluated on well selected , modern datasets . the quality of the word-senses found in the discrimination step has a large impact on the detection of language-evolution . therefore , as a first step , we verify that word-sense-discrimination can successfully be applied to digitized historic-documents and that the results correctly correspond to word-senses . because accessibility of digitized historic collections is influenced also by the quality of the optical-character-recognition (ocr) , as a second step we investigate the effects of ocr-errors on word-sense-discrimination results . all evaluations in this paper are performed on the times archive , a collection of newspaper articles from 1785 - 1985 .
