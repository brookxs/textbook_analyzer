exploring digital-libraries : integrating browsing , searching , and visualization exploring services for digital-libraries (dls) include two major paradigms , browsing and searching , as well as other services such as clustering and visualization . in this paper , we formalize and generalize dl exploring services within a dl theory . we develop theorems to indicate that browsing and searching can be converted or mapped to each other under certain conditions . the theorems guide the design and implementation of exploring services for an integrated archaeological dl , etana-dl . its integrated browsing and searching can support users in moving seamlessly between these operations , minimizing context-switching , and keeping users focused . it also integrates browsing and searching into a single visual-interface for dl exploration . a user-study to evaluate etana-dl 's exploring services helped validate our hypotheses .
