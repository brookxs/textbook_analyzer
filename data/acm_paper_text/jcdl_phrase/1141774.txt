repository software-evaluation using the audit checklist for certification of trusted digital-repositories the ndiipp echo depository project [1] digital-repository evaluation will use an augmented version of the draft audit checklist for certification of trusted digital-repositories (audit checklist) [2] to provide a framework for examining how well currently popular repository software applications support the notion of a `` trusted digital-repository . '' the evaluation will also demonstrate the application of a scoring software-evaluation methodology similar to one developed by the center for data insight (cdi) at northern arizona university [3] , used for evaluation-data mining-software . this scoring methodology in conjunction with the audit checklist can be used as a tool by librarians , archivists , and other data custodians to make informed decisions as they develop digital-preservation-management services .
