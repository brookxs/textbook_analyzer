visual-interactive querying for multivariate research-data-repositories using bag-of-words large amounts of multivariate-data are collected in different areas of scientific-research and industrial-production . these data are collected , archived and made publicly available by research-data-repositories . in addition to meta-data based access , content-based approaches are highly desirable to effectively retrieve , discover and analyze data-sets of interest . several such methods , that allow users to search for particular curve progressions , have been proposed . however , a major challenge when providing content-based-access -- interactive-feedback during query-formulation -- has not received much attention yet . this is important because it can substantially improve the user 's search-effectiveness . in this paper , we present a novel interactive feedback approach for content-based-access to multivariate research data . thereby , we enable query modalities that were not available for multivariate-data before . we provide instant search-results and highlight query-patterns in the result-set . real-time-search suggestions give an overview of important patterns to look for in the data-repository . for this purpose , we develop a bag-of-words index for multivariate-data as the back-end of our approach . we apply our method to a large repository of multivariate-data from the climate-research domain . we describe a use-case for the discovery of interesting patterns in maritime climate-research using our new visual-interactive query-tools .
