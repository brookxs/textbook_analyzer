comparative-study of name-disambiguation problem using a scalable blocking-based framework in this paper , we consider the problem of ambiguous author-names in bibliographic-citations , and comparatively study alternative approaches to identify and correct such name variants (e.g. , `` vannevar-bush '' and `` v. vush '') . our study is based on a scalable two-step framework , where step 1 is to substantially reduce the number of candidates via blocking , and step 2 is to measure the distance of two names via coauthor information . combining four blocking methods and seven distance-measures on four data-sets , we present extensive experimental-results , and identify combinations that are scalable and effective to disambiguate author-names in citations .
