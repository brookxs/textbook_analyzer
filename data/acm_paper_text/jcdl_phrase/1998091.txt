simdl : a model ontology driven digital-library for simulation-systems we propose a-digital library-design to support epidemic and public-health simulation-experiments in which model ontologies direct collection-organization , user-interface-construction , and discovery . we have developed a simdl instantiation of the ontological-design tailored for a typical experimentation workflow . simdl relies on an xml-schema description of a simulation-model to form a domain and model specific ontology . we show this approach useful in building digital-libraries to support collaborative-simulation efforts .
