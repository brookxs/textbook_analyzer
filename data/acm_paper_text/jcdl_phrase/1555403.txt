dimensional standard alignment in k-12 digital-libraries : assessment of self-found vs. recommended curriculum enhancing the experience of digital-library users depends , in part , on recognizing and understanding user-tasks . in the context of k-12 educational libraries this means that we must understand how k-12-teachers interact with such libraries and how they assess the relevance of documents found or encountered . this paper presents the results of an experiment in which k-12-teachers scored the relevance of curriculum they found themselves and the relevance of documents their colleagues found and recommended . we found that teachers apply a significantly more detailed notion of relevance , both qualitatively and quantitatively , when searching for as compared to evaluating recommended curricula . differences were observed in both relevance-judgments and system interaction logs . these variations may be useful in identifying user-intent and in dynamically adapting the behavior of digital-libraries of educational-material .
