note-taking , selecting , and choice : designing interfaces that encourage smaller selections our research develops note-taking applications for educational environments . previous studies found that while copy-pasting notes can be more efficient than typing , for some users it reduces attention and learning . this paper presents two studies aimed at designing and evaluating interfaces that encourage focusing . while we were able to produce interfaces that increased desirable behaviors and improved satisfaction , the new-interfaces did not improve learning . we suggest design-recommendations derived from these studies , and describe a `` selecting-to-read '' behavior we encountered , which has implications for the design of reading and note-taking applications .
