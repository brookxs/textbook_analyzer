discovering gis sources on the web using summaries in this paper , we consider the problem of discovering gis data sources on the web . source-discovery queries for gis data are specified using keywords and a region-of-interest . a source is considered relevant if it contains data that matches the keywords in the specified region . existing techniques simply rely on textual-metadata accompanying such datasets to compute relevance to user-queries . such approaches result in poor search-results , often missing the most relevant-sources on the web . we address this problem by developing more meaningful summaries of gis datasets that preserve the spatial-distribution of keywords . we conduct experiments showing the effectiveness of proposed summarization techniques by significantly improving the quality of query results over baseline approaches , while guaranteeing scalability and high-performance .
