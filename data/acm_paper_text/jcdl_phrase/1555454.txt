aligning mets with the oai-ore data-model the open-archives-initiative - object-reuse-and-exchange (oai-ore) specifications provide a flexible set of mechanisms for transferring complex-data objects between different systems . in order to serve as an exchange syntax , oai-ore must be able to support the import of information from localized data-structures serving various communities-of-practice . in this paper , we examine the metadata encoding & transmission standard (mets) and the issues that arise when trying to map from a localized structural-metadata schema into the oai-ore data-model and serialization syntaxes .
