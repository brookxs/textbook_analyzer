developing a-digital learning-environment : an evaluation of design-and-implementation processes the alexandria digital earth prototype (adept) project (1999 -- 2004) builds upon the alexandria digital-library project (1994 -- 1999) to add functions and services for undergraduate-teaching to a-digital library of geospatial resources . the ` digital-learning-environment ' (dle) services are being developed and evaluated iteratively over the course of this research project . in the 2002 -- 2003 academic year , the dle was implemented during the fall and spring terms in undergraduate geography courses at the university of california , santa barbara (ucsb) . evaluation of the fall term implementation identified design-issues of time and complexity for creating and organizing course domain-knowledge . the spring term implementation added new-services to integrate course-content into class presentation formats . the implementation was evaluated via interviews with the course instructor , development staff , and students , and by observations (in person and videotaped) of the course . results indicated that usability and functionality for the instructor had increased between the two course offerings students found classroom-presentations to be useful for understanding concepts , and web-access to the presentations useful for study and review . assessments of student-learning suggest modest improvements over time developers are now applying lessons-learned during these implementations to improve the system for subsequent implementation in the 2003 -- 2004 academic year .
