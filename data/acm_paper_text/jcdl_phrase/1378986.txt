education for digital stewardship : librarians , archivists or curators ? the large-scale digital-repositories that are emerging today and expected to increase exponentially during this century will require information managers with the skills to archive , preserve , and organize massive amounts of data for use and re-use by a variety of interdisciplinary scholarly communities over time . where will these managers come from , and what skills will they need ? this workshop , organized by the us institute-of-museum-and-library-services (imls) will address these questions through presentations and discussion among educators and other interested participants . imls has invested more than $ 100 million since 2003 in the education of librarians , archivists and data curators through both formal and continuing-education programs . this timely funding has enabled graduate schools of library-and-information-science to reshape their curricula to address the emerging need for digital-data managers . are we prepared to meet the challenge ?
