evaluation of kernel-based link-analysis measures on research-paper recommendation we compare various kernel-based link-analysis measures on graph nodes to evaluate their utility as a research-paper recommendation-system . the compared measures include the kandola et al. 's von neumann kernel , its extension that takes communities into account , and smola and kondor 's regularized laplacian . chebotarev and shamis ' matrix forest-based algorithm , kleinberg 's hits authority-ranking , and classic co-citation-coupling are also evaluated . the experimental result shows that kernel-based methods outperform hits and co-citation-coupling , with the community-based von neumann kernel achieving the highest score .
