archiving the-web using page changes patterns : a case-study a pattern is a model or a template used to summarize and describe the behavior (or the trend) of a data having generally some recurrent events . patterns have received a considerable attention in recent years and were widely studied in the data-mining field . various pattern-mining approaches have been proposed and used for different applications such as network-monitoring , moving-object-tracking , financial or medical-data-analysis , scientific-data-processing , etc. . in these different contexts , discovered patterns were useful to detect anomalies , to predict data behavior (or trend) , or more generally , to simplify data-processing or to improve system-performance . however , to the best of our knowledge , patterns have never been used in the context of web-archiving . web-archiving is the process of continuously collecting and preserving portions of the world-wide-web for future generations . in this paper , we show how patterns of page changes can be useful tools to efficiently archive web-sites . we first define our pattern model that describes the changes of pages . then , we present the strategy used to (i) extract the temporal-evolution of page changes , to (ii) discover patterns and to (iii) exploit them to improve web-archives . we choose the archive of french public tv channels france t l visions as a case-study in order to validate our approach . our experimental-evaluation based on real web-pages shows the utility of patterns to improve archive quality and to optimize indexing or storing .
