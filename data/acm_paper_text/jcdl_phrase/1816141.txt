do wikipedians follow domain-experts ? : a domain-specific study on wikipedia knowledge-building wikipedia is one of the most successful online knowledge-bases , attracting millions of visits daily . not surprisingly , its huge success has in turn led to immense research interest for a better understanding of the collaborative-knowledge-building process . in this paper , we performed a (terrorism) domain-specific case-study , comparing and contrasting the knowledge-evolution in wikipedia with a knowledge-base created by domain-experts . specifically , we used the terrorism knowledge base (tkb) developed by experts at mipt . we identified 409 wikipedia articles matching tkb records , and went ahead to study them from three aspects : creation , revision , and link evolution . we found that the knowledge-building in wikipedia had largely been independent , and did not follow tkb - despite the open and online availability of the latter , as well as awareness of at least some of the wikipedia contributors about the tkb source . in an attempt to identify possible reasons , we conducted a detailed analysis of contribution behavior demonstrated by wikipedians . it was found that most wikipedians contribute to a relatively small set of articles each . their contribution was biased towards one or very few article (s) . at the same time , each article 's contributions are often championed by very few active contributors including the article 's creator . we finally arrive at a conjecture that the contributions in wikipedia are more to cover knowledge at the article level rather than at the domain level .
