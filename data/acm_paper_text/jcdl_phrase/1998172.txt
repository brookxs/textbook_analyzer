improving simulation-management systems through ontology generation and utilization content from simulation-systems is useful in defining domain-ontologies . we describe a-digital library process to generate and leverage domain-ontologies to support simulation-systems tasks . workflow ontologies may be used to define compositions of simulation-related services . simulation-model ontologies may be used in customizing collection-management systems for tasks such as organization , interface construction , and metadata record-generation .
