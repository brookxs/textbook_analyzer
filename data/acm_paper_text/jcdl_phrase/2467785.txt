docear4word : reference management for microsoft-word based on bibtex and the citation style language (csl) in this demo-paper we introduce docear4word which enables researchers to insert and format their references and bibliographies in microsoft-word . docear4word is based on bibtex and the citation style language (csl) , features over 1,700 citation styles (harvard , ieee , acm , etc.) , is published as open-source-tool on http://docear.org , and runs with microsoft-word 2002 (and later) on windows-xp (and later) . docear4word is similar to the ms-word add-ons that reference managers like endnote , zotero , or citavi offer with the difference that it is being developed to work with the de-facto standard bibtex and hence to work with almost any reference manager .
