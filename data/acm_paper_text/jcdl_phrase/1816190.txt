analyzing viewing-patterns while reading picture books we examine the eye-movements of children who can read books on their own as they read printed picture books . our analysis focuses on two points ; 1) is it the pictures or the text that they most frequently gaze at ? , and 2) in what sequence do they read picture books ? our results indicate that children look at both text and pictures , but that there are large variations in the ratio of viewing time for each child . both circular and linear patterns are found in the sequence of eye-movements .
