a document-corpus browser for in-depth reading software-tools , including web-browsers , e-books , electronic-document formats , search-engines , and digital-libraries are changing the way people read , making it easier for them to find and view documents . however , while these tools provide significant help with short-term reading projects involving small numbers of documents , they provide less help with longer-term reading projects , in which a topic is to be understood in depth by reading many documents . for such projects , readers must find and manage many documents and citations , remember what has been read , and prioritize what to read next . this paper describes three integrated software tools that facilitate in-depth reading . a first tool extracts citation-information from documents . a second finds on-line documents from their citations . the last is a document-corpus browser that uses a zoomable-user-interface to show a corpus at multiple granularities while supporting reading-tasks that take days , weeks , or longer . we describe these tools and the design principles that motivated them .
