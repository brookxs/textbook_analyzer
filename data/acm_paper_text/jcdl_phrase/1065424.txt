digital-libraries ' support for the user 's ` information journey ' the temporal elements of users ' information-requirements are a continually confounding aspect of digital-library-design . no sooner have users ' needs been identified and supported than they change . this paper evaluates the changing information-requirements of users through their ` information journey ' in two different domains (health and academia) . in-depth analysis of findings from interviews , focus-groups and observations of 150 users have identified three stages to this journey : information initiation , facilitation (or gathering) and interpretation . the study shows that , although digital-libraries are supporting aspects of users ' information facilitation , there are still requirements for them to better support users ' overall information-work in context . users are poorly supported in the initiation phase , as they recognize their information-needs , especially with regard to resource-awareness ; in this context , interactive press-alerts are discussed . some users (especially clinicians and patients) also require support in the interpretation of information , both satisfying themselves that the information is trustworthy and understanding what it means for a particular individual .
