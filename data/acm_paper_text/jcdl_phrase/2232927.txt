structured-audio content-analysis and metadata in a-digital library this work illustrates how audio-content-analysis of music and manually assigned structural temporal metadata can be used to form a-digital library designed for musicological exploration . in addition to text-based searching and browsing , the document view is enriched with an interactive structured-audio time-line that shows ground-truth data representing the logical segments to the song , and a version that was automatically generated for comparison . a self-similarity `` heat '' map is also displayed , and is interactive . clicking within the map at a co-ordinate (x , y) results in the audio being played simultaneous at time offset x and y , panned left and right , respectively , to make it easier for the listener to separate out the differences . the musicologist can also initiate an audio content_based query starting at any point in the song . this produces a ranked result-set which can be further studied through their respective document views . alternatively they can perform a musical-structure search (for example , for songs that contain the structure b , b , c , b , c) .
