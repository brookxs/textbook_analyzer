merging metadata : a sociotechnical study of crosswalking and interoperability digital-library-interoperability relies on the use of a common metadata-format . however , implementing a common metadata-format among multiple digital-libraries is not always a straightforward exercise . this paper reviews some of the metadata issues that arose during the merger of two digital-libraries , the-internet public-library and the librarian 's internet index . as part of the merger , each library 's metadata was crosswalked to dublin-core . this required considerable work . a sociotechnical analysis suggests that the metadata for each library had been shaped in complex ways over time by local factors , and that this complexity negatively impacted the efficiency of the crosswalk . some implications of this finding for digital-library-interoperability are discussed .
