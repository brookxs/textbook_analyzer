bibliographic attribute-extraction from erroneous references based on a statistical model in this paper , we propose a method for extracting bibliographic attributes from reference-strings captured using optical-character-recognition (ocr) and an extended hidden-markov-model . bibliographic attribute-extraction can be used in two ways . one is reference-parsing in which attribute values are extracted from ocr-processed references for bibliographic matching . the other is reference alignment in which attribute values are aligned to the bibliographic record to enrich the vocabulary of the bibliographic database . in this paper , we first propose a statistical model for attribute-extraction that represents both the syntactical-structure of references and ocr error patterns . then , we perform experiments using bibliographic references obtained from scanned images of papers in journals and transactions and show that useful attribute values are extracted from ocr-processed references . we also show that the proposed model has advantages in reducing the cost of preparing training-data , a critical problem in rule-based-systems .
