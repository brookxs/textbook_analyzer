cares : a ranking-oriented cadal recommender-system a recommender-system is useful for a-digital library to suggest the books that are likely preferred by a user . most recommender-systems using collaborative-filtering approaches leverage the explicit user ratings to make personalized recommendations . however , many users are reluctant to provide explicit-ratings , so ratings-oriented recommender-systems do not work well . in this paper , we present a recommender-system for cadal digital-library , namely cares , which makes recommendations using a ranking-oriented collaborative-filtering-approach based on users ' access logs , avoiding the problem of the lack of user-ratings . our approach employs mean ap correlation coefficients for computing similarities among users ' implicit preference-models and a random-walk_based algorithm for generating a book ranking personalized for the individual . experimental-results on real access logs from the cadal web-site show the effectiveness of our system and the impact of different values of parameters on the recommendation-performance .
