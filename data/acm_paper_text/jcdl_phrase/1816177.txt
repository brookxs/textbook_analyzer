this is what i 'm doing and why : reflections on a think-aloud-study of dl users ' information-behaviour many user-centred studies of digital-libraries (dls) include a think-aloud element and are usually conducted with the purpose of identifying usability-issues related to the dls used or understanding aspects of users ' information-behaviour . however , few of these studies present detailed accounts of how their think-aloud data was collected and analysed or reflect on this process . in this paper , we discuss and reflect on the decisions made when planning and conducting a think-aloud-study of lawyers ' interactive information behaviour . our discussion is framed by blandford et al. 's pret a rapporter (` ready to report ') framework - a framework that can be used to plan , conduct and describe user-centred studies of dl use from an information-work perspective .
