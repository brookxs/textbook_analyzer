non-linear book manifolds : learning from associations the dynamic-geometry of digital-libraries mainstream approaches in the design of virtual-libraries basically exploit the same ambient space as their physical twins . our paper is an attempt to rather capture automatically the actual space on which the books live , and learn the virtual-library as a non-linear book manifold . this tackles tantalizing questions , chief among which whether modeling should be static and book focused (e.g.using bag-of-words encoding) or dynamic and user focused (e.g. relying on what we define as a bag of readers encoding) . experiments on a real-world digital-library display that the latter encoding is a serious challenger to the former . our results also show that the geometric layers of the manifold learned bring sizeable advantages for retrieval and visualization purposes . for example , the topological layer of the manifold allows to craft manifold association-rules ; experiments display that they bring dramatic improvements over conventional association-rules built from the discrete topology of book sets.improvements embrace each of the following major standpoints on association-rule-mining : computational , support , confidence , lift , and leverage standpoint .
