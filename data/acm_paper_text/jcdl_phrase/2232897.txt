do public-library websites consider the-disabled or senior-citizens ? the issues of mobility and sight impairment with respect to virtual accessibility are as important as physical accessibility when it comes to using public-library services . however , few studies have discussed public-library website accessibility from the perspective of underrepresented user-groups . the purpose of this study is to evaluate the accessibility of websites of public-libraries and further identify the association between accessibility and public-libraries ' budgets . the study selected 20 public-library systems that have the highest percentages of the-disabled or senior citizen patrons . the study employed the pearson-correlation test in order to investigate the correlation between the accessibility and the budgets of public-libraries . preliminary findings show that most current public-library websites do not comply with the section-508 . the findings indicate that public-libraries did not consider their users or potential users with physical-disabilities when designing their websites . therefore , the findings suggest that public-library websites are not suited to deliver effective information-services for underrepresented user populations who need special assistance . furthermore , this study finds that there is no significant association between the public-library websites ' accessibility and the budgets .
