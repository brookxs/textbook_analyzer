next generation knowledge-organization-systems : integration challenges and strategies this year 's networked-knowledge-organization-systems (nkos) workshop built on seven years of workshops in the u.s. and europe on issues regarding enabling networked-knowledge-organization-systems (kos) , such as classification-systems , thesauri , gazetteers , taxonomies , and ontologies , to support the description , retrieval , and use of diverse information-resources . now , many efforts are underway to research the issues and implement solutions to the challenges of networking and integrating kos across somewhat isolated domains : indexing services and thesaurus builders ; computer scientists and systems integrators ; ontologists ; taxonomists ; and others . in many cases , requirements to solve these integration issues have become mission-critical ; the need to support computational , programmatic integration to handle masses of data from independent-sources is pushing the research-and-development agenda . the need to move forward to meet these challenges while at the same time applying the best-practices and `` wisdom '' developed through years of practical-experience is acute.the jcdl-nkos workshop for 2005 brought together researchers and implementers from diverse international communities who are developing new models , conducting research , and implementing practical solutions for networking kos and integrating the associated information and data resources .
