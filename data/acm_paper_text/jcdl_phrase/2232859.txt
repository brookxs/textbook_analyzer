event-centric search and exploration in document-collections textual data ranging from corpora of digitized historic-documents to large-collections of news-feeds provide a rich source for temporal and geographic-information . such types of information have recently gained a lot of interest in support of different search and exploration tasks , e.g. , by organizing news along a timeline or placing the origin of documents on a map . however , for this , temporal and geographic-information embedded in documents is often considered in isolation . we claim that through combining such information into (chronologically ordered) event-like features interesting and meaningful search and exploration tasks are possible . in this paper , we present a framework for the extraction , exploration , and visualization of event-information in document-collections . for this , one has to identify and combine temporal and geographic expressions from documents , thus enriching a document-collection by a set of normalized events . traditional search queries then can be enriched by conditions on the events relevant to the search subject . most important for our event-centric approach is that a search result consists of a sequence of events relevant to the search-terms and not just a document hit-list . such events can originate from different documents and can be further explored , in particular events relevant to a search-query can be ordered chronologically . we demonstrate the utility of our framework by different (multilingual) search and exploration scenarios using a wikipedia corpus .
