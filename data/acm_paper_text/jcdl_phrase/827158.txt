methods for precise named-entity matching in digital-collections in this paper , we describe an interactive-system , built within the context of climb project , which permits a user to locate the occurrences of named-entities within a given text . the named-entity tool was developed to identify references to a single art object (e.g. a particular building) with high precision in text related to images of that object in a-digital collection . we start with an authoritative list of art objects , and seek to match variants of these named-entities in related text . our approach is to `` decay '' entities into progressively more general variants while retaining high precision . as variants become more general , and thus more ambiguous , we propose methods to disambiguate intermediate results . our results will be used to select records into which automatically generated metadata will be loaded .
