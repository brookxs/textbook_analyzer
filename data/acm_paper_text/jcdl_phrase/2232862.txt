concept-chaining utilizing meronyms in text characterization for most , the-web is the first source to answer a question formulated by curiosity , need , or research reasons . this phenomenon is due to the-internet 's ubiquitous-access , ease-of-use , and the extensive and ever expanding content . the problem is no longer the need to acquire content to encourage use , but to provide organizational tools to support content-categorization that will facilitate improved access-methods . this paper presents the results of a new text characterization algorithm that combines semantic and linguistic-techniques utilizing domain-based ontology background-knowledge . it explores the combination of meronym , synonym , and hypernym linguistic relationships to create a set of concept chains used to represent concepts found in a document . the experiments show improved accuracy over bag-of-words_based term-weighting methods and reveal characteristics of the meronym contribution to document-representation .
