social network-based recommendation : a graph random-walk kernel approach traditional recommender-system research often explores customer , product , and transaction information in providing recommendations . social-relationships in social-networks are related to individuals ' preferences . this study investigates the product-recommendation problem based solely on people 's social-network information . taking a kernel-based approach , we capture consumer social-influence similarities into a graph random-walk kernel and build svr models to predict consumer opinions . in experiments on a dataset from a movie review website , our proposed model outperforms trust-based models and state-of-the-art graph-kernels .
