visualizing digital-collections at archive-it archive-it , a subscription-service from the-internet archive , allows users to create , maintain and view digital-collections of web-resources . the current interface of archive-it is largely text-based , supporting drill-down navigation using lists of uris . to provide an overview of each collection and highlight the collection 's underlying characteristics , we present four alternate visualizations (image plot with histogram , wordle , bubble chart and timeline) . the sites in an archive-it collection may be organized by the collection curator into groups for easier navigation . however , many collections do not have such groupings , making them difficult to explore . we introduce a heuristics-based categorization for such collections .
