an unsupervised technical difficulty ranking-model based on conceptual terrain in the latent-space search-results of the existing general-purpose search-engines usually do not satisfy domain-specific-information-retrieval tasks as there is a mis-match between the technical-expertise of a user and the results returned by the search-engine . in this paper , we investigate the problem of ranking domain-specific documents based on the technical difficulty . we propose an unsupervised conceptual terrain-model using latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) for re-ranking search results obtained from a similarity_based search-system . we connect the sequences of terms under the latent-space by the semantic distance between the terms and compute the traversal cost for a document indicating the technical difficulty . our experiments on a domain-specific corpus demonstrate the efficacy of our method .
