biodiversity and biocomplexity informatics : policy and implementation science versus citizen-science biological science is one of the top ten social-trends and the twenty-first century has been defined as `` the age of biology '' [1] . one of the central themes of this age is biodiversity . biodiversity is the richness of life . biodiversity includes the variety of genes within one species through the complex interconnection of all life within an environment . one of the grand-challenges of the twenty-first century is to document and understand the world 's natural heritage . the management of the many kinds of information associated with this endeavor is `` biodiversity-informatics . '' there are many efforts developing worldwide to collect and distribute this information in digital-collections . some of these efforts are complementary ; some efforts are in conflict and are just independent . there is a great need to integrate this information to increate its usefulness and value . unfortunately , this integration is extremely difficult because of the diversity of the use and users of the information and the diversity of the information itself . the panelists will discuss different perspectives on the construction of global biodiversity digital-libraries from the perspective of different goals and uses .
