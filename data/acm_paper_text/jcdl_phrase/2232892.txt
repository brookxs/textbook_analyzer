data determination , disambiguation , and referencing in molecular-biology-entity and instance determination , disambiguation , and referencing , referred to as authority-control in libraries , are essential for scientific-research . this study examines the authority-control practices and issues in molecular-biology using literature and-scenario analyses . the analyses imply that the concept of authority-control in molecular-biology is associated with three tasks : named-entity-recognition , disambiguation , and unification . the identified authority-control issues were conceptualized as quality problems caused by four sources : inconsistent or incomplete mapping , context-changes , entity changes , and changes in entity metadata . this study can inform librarians and repository curators of the needs and issues of authority-control in molecular-biology and other related disciplines .
