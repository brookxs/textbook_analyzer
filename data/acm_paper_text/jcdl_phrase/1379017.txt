a cluster-based simulation of facet-based search the recent increase of online-video has challenged the research in the field of video-information-retrieval . video-search engines are becoming more and more interactive , helping the user to easily find what he or she is looking for . in this poster , we present a new approach of using an iterative-clustering algorithm on text and visual-features to simulate users creating new facets in a facet-based-interface . our experimental-results prove the usefulness of such an approach .
