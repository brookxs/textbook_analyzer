enhancing digital-libraries using missing content-analysis this work shows how the content of a-digital library can be enhanced to better satisfy its users ' needs . missing content is identified by finding missing content topics in the system 's query-log or in a pre-defined taxonomy of required knowledge . the collection is then enhanced with new relevant knowledge , which is extracted from external-sources that satisfy those missing content topics . experiments we conducted measure the precision of the system before and after content-enhancement . the results demonstrate a significant improvement in the system effectiveness as a result of content-enhancement and the superiority of the missing content-enhancement policy over several other possible policies .
