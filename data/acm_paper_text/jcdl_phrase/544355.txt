structured models of scientific-concepts for organizing , accessing , and using learning-materials concepts and their interrelationships are the fundamental building-blocks for representing the phenomena investigated in mathematics , science , and engineering (mse) . the knowledge represented in learning-materials for the sciences is typically organized around term-based or `` weakly-structured '' models of concepts and their interrelationships . we introduce a `` strongly-structured '' model of scientific-concepts that provides the foundation for a knowledge-base (kb) of concept representations . it focuses on such attributes as the objective representations , operational-semantics , use , and interrelationships of concepts , all of which play important roles in constructing representations of phenomena that further understanding of mse domains of knowledge.we have developed a strongly-structured model of concepts for sme domains in terms of a frame-based krs with slots and attribute-value fillers . the model , whose framework is shown in figure 1 , is implemented as an xml-schema . this schema is used as the basis for creating domain-specific kbs containing xml records of concepts.the alexandria digital-library (adl) digital earth testbed system (http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu) has been extended with : (1) a kb of scientific-concepts , from the domain of physical-geography , that are represented in terms of our xml-schema for concept-representation ; (2) a collection of heterogeneous learning-materials exemplifying the concepts and their properties in various contexts ; and (3) services that provide a variety of views of the content of the kb and associated collection . (please refer to the jcdl paper `` the adept digital-library architecture '' by janee and frew .) this extension to adl is being deployed in teaching an introductory-course in physical-geography in fall , 2002 .
