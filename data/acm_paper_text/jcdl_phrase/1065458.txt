e-library of medieval chant manuscript transcriptions in this paper we present our rationale and design-principles for a distributed e-library of medieval chant manuscript transcriptions . we describe the great variety in neumatic notations , in order to motivate a standardised data-representation that is lossless and universal with respect to these musical artefacts . we present some details of the data-representation and an xml-schema for describing and delivering transcriptions via the-web . we argue against proposed data formats that look simpler , on the grounds that they will inevitably lead to fragmentation of digital-libraries . we plan to develop applications software that will allow users to take full advantage of the carefully designed representation we describe , while shielding users from its complexity . we argue that a distributed e-library of this kind will greatly facilitate scholarship , education , and public appreciation of these artefacts .
