on querying geospatial and georeferenced metadata resources in g-portal g-portal is a web-portal system providing a range of digital-library services to access geospatial and georeferenced resources on the web . among them are the storage and query subsystems that provide a central repository of metadata resources organized under different projects . in gportal , all metadata resources are represented in xml (extensible-markup-language) and they are compliant to some resource schemas defined by their creators . the resource schemas are extended versions of a basic resource schema making it easy to accommodate all kinds of metadata resources while maintaining the portability of resource data . to support queries over the geospatial and georeferenced metadata resources , a xquery-like query-language known as rql (resource query-language) has been designed . in this paper , we present the rql language-features and provide some experimental findings about the storage design and query-evaluation strategies for rql queries .
