digital-library-education : the current-status in this paper , we review and examine the current-status of digital-library-education and compare the range of provision with that found in earlier studies [1 , 2 , 3] . it is found that the number of institutions offering programmes or courses in digital-library-education is still increasing . about 43 \ % of these programmes or courses are stand-alone rather than integrated with wider material . the curriculum-design and focused teaching areas appear more systematic and comprehensive than in earlier studies . over half the institutions examined in this study have posted their detailed course information on-line . most courses offered are now based on a combination of theory-and-practice , and are available at different levels . there are increasing opportunities for funding for developing new initiatives in digital-library-education . however , since digital-library-education is still at an early stage , an optimized model of best-practice in digital-library-education has not yet emerged .
