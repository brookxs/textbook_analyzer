building a search-engine for computer-science course syllabi syllabi are rich educational-resources . however , finding computer-science syllabi on a generic search-engine does not work well . towards our goal of building a syllabus collection we have trained various machine-learning-classifiers to recognize computer-science syllabi from other web-pages and the discipline that they represent (ai or se for instance) among other things . we have crawled 50 computer-science departments in the us and gathered 100,000 candidate pages . our best classifiers are more than 90 % accurate at identifying syllabi from real-world-data . the syllabus repository we created is live for public-use (at http://syllabus.sdakak.com) and contains more than 3000 syllabi that our classifiers filtered out from the crawl data . we present an analysis of the various feature-selection methods and classifiers used .
