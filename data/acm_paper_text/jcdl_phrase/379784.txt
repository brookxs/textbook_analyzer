persival : personalized summarization over multimedia health-care information in this demonstration , we present several integrated components of per sival personalized-retrieval and summarization of image , video and anguage) [1] , a system designed to provide personalized-access to a distributed digital library of medical literature and consumer-health-information . the global system architecture of persival is best described as a two-stage processing-pipeline . the first stage is a retrieval-system that matches user queries with relevant multimedia-data in the library . the second stage is a visualization-system that processes the multimedia-data matched by the first stage for display . our demonstration focuses on the second stage of persival 's processing-pipeline . given a set of relevant documents for certain predefined queries , our integrated demonstration seeks to give a tailored response for either physicians or patients , featuring textual summaries , as well as relevant medical definitions . to visualize the summaries and definitions , we employ automated constraint-based-layout of the user-interface that allows for rich-interaction between summaries and definitions . persival 's natural-language-processing and user-interface modules make up the visualization portion of the system and illustrate state-of-the-art digital-library technology . following are the modules presented in our demonstration .
