descriptive-metadata , iconclass , and digitized emblem literature early modern emblems combined text and image . though there were many variants , the archetypical emblem literary form (mid-sixteenth through mid-eighteenth centuries) consisted of an image (the pictura) , a text inscription (the inscriptio) , and a text epigram (the subscriptio) , the last usually in verse . digitized emblem literature poses interesting challenges as regards content and metadata granularity , the use of interdisciplinary controlled-vocabularies , and the need to present digitized primary sources in a complex-network of associated sources , derivatives , and contemporaneous context . in this paper , we describe a-digital library web-application designed to better support the ways emblem scholars search for and use digitized emblem books , focusing on metadata design , issues of resource granularity and identification , and the use of linked-data-web services for iconclass , a multilingual classification-system for cultural-heritage art and images . outcomes to date , achieved by emblem scholars and librarians working in collaboration , provide a case-study for multi-faceted , interactive approaches to curating mixed text-image digital-resources and the use of linked-data vocabulary services . lessons-learned highlight the value of librarian-scholar collaboration and help to illustrate why digital-libraries need to move beyond merely disseminating digitized book surrogates .
