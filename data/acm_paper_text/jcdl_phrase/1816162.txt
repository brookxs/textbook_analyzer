using an ontology and a multilingual glossary for enhancing the nautical-archaeology digital-library access to materials in digital-collections has been extensively studied within digital-libraries . exploring a collection requires customized indices and novel-interfaces to allow users new exploration mechanisms . materials or objects can then be found by way of full-text , faceted , or thematic indexes . there has been a marked interest not only in finding objects in a collection , but in discovering relationships and properties . for example , multiple-representations of the same object enable the use of visual-aids to augment collection exploration . depending on the domain and characteristics of the objects in a collection , relationships among components can be used to enrich the process of understanding their contents . in this context , the nautical-archaeology digital-library (nadl) includes multilingual textual - and visual-rich objects (shipbuilding treatises , illustrations , photographs , and drawings) . in this paper we describe an approach for enhancing access to a collection of ancient technical-documents , illustrations , and photographs documenting archaeological excavations . because of the nature of our collection , we exploit a multilingual glossary along with an ontology . preliminary tests of our prototype suggest the feasibility of our method for enhancing access to the collection .
