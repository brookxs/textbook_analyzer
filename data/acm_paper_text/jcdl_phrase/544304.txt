interfaces for palmtop image-search will current technology-support search for video news or entertainment on mobile-platforms ? an ipaq palmtop version of the informedia digital-video-library interface has already been developed at the chinese university of hong-kong . for these displays , the desktop technique of showing a large grid of images in parallel is not feasible . perceptual-psychology experiments suggest that time-multiplexing may be as effective as space-multiplexing for this kind of primed recognition-task . in fact , it has been specifically suggested that image-retrieval interfaces using rapid-serial-visual-presentation (rsvp) may perform significantly better than parallel presentation even on a desktop computer [2] . in our experiments , we did not find this to be true . an important difference between previous rsvp experiments and our own is that image-search engines rank retrievals , and correct answers are more likely to occur early in the list of results . thus we found that scrolling (and low rsvp presentation rates) led to better recognition of answers that occur early , but worse for answers that occur far down the list . this split confounded the global effects that we hypothesized , yet in itself is an important consideration for future interface designs , which must adapt as search-technology improves .
