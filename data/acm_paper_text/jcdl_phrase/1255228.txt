drowning in data : digital-library architecture to support scientific use of embedded-sensor-networks new-technologies for scientific-research are producing a deluge of data that is overwhelming traditional tools for data-capture , analysis , storage , and access . we report on a study of scientific practices associated with dynamic deployments of embedded-sensor-networks to identify requirements for data digital-libraries . as part of continuing research on scientific-data-management , we interviewed 22 participants in 5 environmental-science projects to identify data-types and uses , stages in their data life-cycle , and requirements for digital-library architecture . we found that scientists need continuous access to their data from the time that field-experiments are designed through final analysis and publication , thus reflecting a broader notion of `` digital-library . '' six categories of requirements are discussed : the ability to obtain and maintain data in the field , verify data in the field , document data-context for subsequent interpretation , integrate data from multiple sources , analyze data , and preserve data . three digital-library efforts currently underway within the center for embedded networked-sensing are addressing these requirements , with the goal of a tightly-coupled interoperable framework that , in turn , will be a component of cyberinfrastructure for science .
