learning metadata from the evidence in an on-line citation-matching scheme citation-matching , or the automatic grouping of bibliographic references that refer to the same document , is a data-management problem faced by automatic digital-libraries for scientific-literature such as citeseer and google-scholar . although several solutions have been offered for citation-matching in large bibliographic-databases , these solutions typically require expensive batch clustering operations that must be run offline . large digital-libraries containing citation-information can reduce maintenance costs and provide new-services through efficient online-processing of citation data , resolving document citation relationships as new records become available . additionally , information found in citations can be used to supplement document-metadata , requiring the generation of a canonical citation record from merging variant citation subfields into a unified `` best guess '' from which to draw information . citation-information must be merged with other information-sources in order to provide a complete document record . this paper outlines a system and algorithms for online citation-matching and canonical metadata-generation . a bayesian-framework is employed to build the ideal citation record for a document that carries the added advantages of fusing information from disparate sources and increasing system resilience to erroneous-data .
