an exploration of pattern-based subtopic modeling for search-result-diversification traditional information-retrieval-models do not necessarily provide users with optimal-search experience because the top ranked documents may contain the same piece of relevant-information , i.e. , the same subtopic of a query . the goal of search-result-diversification is to return search-results that not only are relevant to the query but also cover different subtopics . therefore , the subtopic modeling is an important research-topic in search-result-diversification . in this paper , we propose a novel pattern_based method to extract subtopics from retrieved documents . the basic idea is to explicitly model a query subtopic as a semantically meaningful-text unit in relevant documents . we apply a frequent-pattern-mining algorithm to efficiently extract these text units (patterns) from retrieved documents . we then model a query subtopic with a single pattern and rank subtopics based on their similarity with the query . these pattern_based subtopics are then used to diversify search-results .
