correcting common distortions in camera-imaged library materials we present a technique to correct image-distortion that can occur when library materials are imaged by cameras . our approach provides a general-framework to undo a variety of common distortions , including binder curl , fold distortion , and combinations of the two . our algorithm is described and demonstrated on several examples .
