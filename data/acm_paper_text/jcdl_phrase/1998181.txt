liquid benchmarks : benchmarking-as-a-service experimental-evaluation and comparison-of-techniques , algorithms or complete systems is a crucial requirement to assess the practical impact of research results . the quality of published experimental-results is usually limited due to several reasons such as : limited time , unavailability of standard-benchmarks or shortage of computing-resources . moreover , achieving an independent , consistent , complete and insightful assessment for different alternatives in the same domain is a time and resource consuming task . we demonstrate liquid benchmark as a cloud-based service that provides collaborative platforms to simplify the task of peer researchers in performing high quality experimental evaluations and guarantee a transparent scientific crediting process . the service allows building repositories of competing research implementations , sharing testing computing platforms , collaboratively building the specifications of standard-benchmarks and allowing end-users to easily create and run testing experiments and share their results .
