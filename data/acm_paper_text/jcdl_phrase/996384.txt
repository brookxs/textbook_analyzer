panorama : extending digital-libraries with topical-crawlers a large amount of research , technical and professional documents are available today in digital formats digital-libraries are created to facilitate search-and-retrieval of information supplied by the documents . these libraries may span an entire area-of-interest (e.g. , computer-science) or be limited to documents within a small organization . while tools that index , classify , rank and retrieve documents from such libraries are important , it would be worthwhile to complement these tools with information available on the web . we propose one such technique that uses a topical-crawler driven by the information extracted from a research document . the goal of the crawler is to harvest a collection of web-pages that are focused on the topical subspaces associated with the given document . the collection created through web-crawling is further processed using lexical and linkage-analysis . the entire process is automated and uses machine-learning-techniques to both guide the crawler as well as analyze the collection it fetches . a report is generated at the end that provides visual-cues and information to the researcher .
