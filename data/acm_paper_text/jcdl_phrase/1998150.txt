web-video-search by mutual-boosting between the inside and outside text of video this paper proposes a new idea and approach for the-web video-search . instead of only using the surrounding text of video in webpage , our approach boosts mutually and utilizes jointly the inside and outside text of video to support the video-based and frame-based search . in our approach , the inside text is the video caption , while the outside text is the surrounding text of video in webpage . in our view , the caption text , although has some wrong characters and words caused by the automatic caption recognition , is a useful indicator for the content of video . while the relevant surrounding texts of video , although is difficult to locate and confirm , have the correct characters and words which usually indicate the video-content , especially the title and introduction of video . in this paper , we integrate their advantages and alleviate their disadvantages by the mutual-boosting idea , that is , to employ the inside text to confirm the relevance of outside text , and to utilize the relevant outside text to correct the inside text . mutual-boosting not only enhances the query-by-text video-search , but also further supports the query-by-text frame search with the corrected caption . based on the above idea , our approach can be divided into three phases : firstly , we proposed a new approach for automatic caption detection and extraction . then , we extract the surrounding text candidates of video . finally , the mutual-boosting approach is employed to get the relevant and accurate text of web-video . the experiments show the proposed approach can achieve good performance .
