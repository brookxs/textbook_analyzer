integrating data and text-mining processes for digital-library-applications this paper explores the integration of text-mining and data-mining-techniques , digital-library-systems , and computational and data-grid technologies with the objective of developing an online classification service exemplar . we discuss the current-research issues relating to the use of data-mining-algorithms and toolkits for textual data ; the necessary changes within the cheshire3 information framework to accommodate analysis workflows ; the outcomes of a demonstrator based on the national-library-of-medicine 's medline dataset ; and the provision of comparable metrics for evaluation purposes . the prototype has resulted in extremely accurate online classification services and offers a novel method of supporting text-mining and data-mining within a highly scaled computational environment , integrated seamlessly into the digital library architecture .
