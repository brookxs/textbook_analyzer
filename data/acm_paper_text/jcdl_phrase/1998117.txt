visualizing collaboration-networks implicit in digital-libraries using ontostarfish this paper presents the design rationale and initial findings derived from preliminary usage of ontostarfish , a visualization-technique aimed at taking advantage of implicit-relationships that can be inferred from large-collections of documents in digital-libraries . ontostarfish makes such relationships explicit so users may visualize them and detect potential collaboration-networks . users that may be interested in exploring collaboration-networks include researchers looking for partners for specific projects as well as funding agencies concerned with the strength of associations among participants of competing proposals . ontostarfish is based upon the use of multiple fisheye-views that can be placed on top of starfields , dynamic scatter plots for which each axis is determined by a lightweight ontology of attributes associated to potential collaborators .
