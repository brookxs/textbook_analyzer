subject metadata-enrichment using statistical-topic-models creating a collection of metadata records from disparate and diverse sources often results in uneven , unreliable and variable quality subject metadata . having uniform , consistent and enriched subject metadata allows users to more easily discover material , browse the collection , and limit keyword-search results by subject . we demonstrate how statistical-topic-models are useful for subject metadata-enrichment . we describe some of the challenges of metadata-enrichment on a huge scale (10 million metadata records from 700 repositories in the oaister digital-library) when the metadata is highly heterogeneous (metadata about images and text , and both cultural-heritage material and scientific-literature) . we show how to improve the quality of the enriched metadata , using both manual and statistical-modeling techniques . finally , we discuss some of the challenges of the production-environment , and demonstrate the value of the enriched metadata in a prototype portal .
