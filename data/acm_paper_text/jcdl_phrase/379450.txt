enforcing interoperability with the open-archives-initiative repository explorer the open-archives-initiative (oai) is an organization dedicated to sol ving problems of digital-library-interoperability by defining simple protocols , most recently for the exchange of metadata . the success of such an activity requires vigilance in specification of the protocol as well as standardization of implementation . the lack of standardized implementation is a substantial barrier to interoperability in many existing client/server protocols . to avoid this pitfall we developed the repository explorer , a tool that supports manual and automated-protocol-testing . this tool has a significant impact on simplifying development of interoperability interfaces and increasing the level of confidence of early adopters of the-technology , thus exemplifying the positive impact of exhaustive-testing and-quality assurance on interoperability ventures .
