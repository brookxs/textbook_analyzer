data , data-use , and scientific-inquiry : two case-studies of data-practices data are proliferating far faster than they can be captured , managed , or stored . what types of data are most likely to be used and reused , by whom , and for what purposes ? answers to these questions will inform information-policy and the design of digital-libraries . we report findings from semi-structured-interviews and field-observations to investigate characteristics of data-use and reuse and how those characteristics vary within and between scientific communities . the two communities studied are researchers at the center for embedded network sensing (cens) and users of the sloan-digital-sky-survey (sdss) data . the data-practices of cens and sdss researchers have implications for data-curation , system-evaluation , and policy . some data that are important to the conduct of research are not viewed as sufficiently valuable to keep . other data of great value may not be mentioned or cited , because those data serve only as background to a given investigation . metrics to assess the value of documents do not map well to data .
