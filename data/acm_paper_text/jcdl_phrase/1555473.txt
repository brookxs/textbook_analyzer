mashing up life-science-literature resources in the life-sciences one of the pronounced problems is the deluge of new results and data that are produced on a daily basis . this data can take many different forms , e.g. microarray probes , gene sequences , protein structures and is added by hundreds of research centers world-wide in a largely uncoordinated fashion . thus integration of life-science data is growing in importance . unfortunately , most research centers do not have particular incentive to spend efforts on integrating their data with data produced by others . this task is largely left to large publicly-sponsored institutions like the us national-library-of-medicine and similar institutions in other countries . unfortunately , despite their work in this area , the integration of web-based life-science resources is still an open issue (and one ever growing in importance) as these organizations can not cope with the information deluge that is happening on a daily basis in the life-sciences . thus it becomes essential that as many as possible third parties are engaged in the process . here we demonstrate a simple prototype of a browser-plugin that creates a platform for third parties to contribute to cross-linking related online life-science data resources and thus improving the search experience and the productivity of the life-science community . the plugin creates a convenient programming-interface that minimizes the effort that arises for such third-party contributors . we have provided reference implementations using the plugin that cross-link life-science-literature resources and illustrate the potential for third parties to create mashups that could be applied also in areas other than the life-sciences .
