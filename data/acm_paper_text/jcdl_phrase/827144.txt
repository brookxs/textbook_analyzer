structural-analysis of musical signals for indexing and thumbnailing a musical piece typically has a repetitive structure . analysis of this structure will be useful for music-segmentation , indexing and thumbnailing . this paper presents an algorithm that can automatically analyze the repetitive structure of musical signals . first , the algorithm detects the repetitions of each segment of fixed length in a piece using dynamic-programming . second , the algorithm summarizes this repetition information and infers the structure based on heuristic-rules . the performance of the approach is demonstrated visually using figures for qualitative-evaluation , and by two structural-similarity measures for quantitative-evaluation . based on the structural-analysis result , this paper also proposes a method for music-thumbnailing . the preliminary results obtained using a corpus of beatles ' songs show that automatic structural-analysis and thumbnailing of music are possible .
