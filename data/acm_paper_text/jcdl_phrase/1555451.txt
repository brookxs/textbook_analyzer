mobility , digital-libraries and a rural indian village millions of people in developed countries routinely create and share digital-content ; but what about the billions of others in on the wrong side of what has been called the ` global-digital-divide ' ? this paper considers three mobile-platforms to illustrate their potential in enabling rural indian villagers to make and share digital stories . we describe our experiences in creating prototypes using mobile-phones ; high-end media-players ; and , paper . interaction designs are discussed along with findings from various trials within the village and elsewhere . our approach has been to develop prototypes that can work together in an integrated fashion so that content can flow freely and in interesting ways through the village . while our work has particular relevance to those users in emerging world contexts , we see it also informing needs and practices in the developed world for user-generated-content .
