a tree-based method for fast melodic-retrieval the evolution of aurally queryable melodic databases (so-called query-by-humming systems) has reached a point where retrieval-accuracy is relatively high , even at large database sizes . with this accuracy has come a decrease in retrieval speed as methods have become more sophisticated and computationally expensive . in this paper , we turn our attention to heuristically culling songs from our database that are unlikely given a sung-query , in hopes that we can increase speed by reducing the number of matching computations necessary to reach the proper target song .
