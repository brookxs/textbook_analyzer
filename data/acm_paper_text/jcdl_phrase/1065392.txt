a new framework for building digital-library-collections this paper introduces a new framework for building digital-library-collections and contrasts it with existing systems . it describes a significant new step in the development of a widely-used open-source digital-library-system , greenstone , which has evolved over many years . it is supported by a fresh implementation , which forced us to rethink the entire design rather than making incremental improvements . the redesign capitalizes on the best ideas from the existing system , which have been refined and developed to open new avenues through which digital-librarians can tailor their collections . we demonstrate its flexibility by showing how digital-library-collections can be extended and altered to satisfy new requirements .
