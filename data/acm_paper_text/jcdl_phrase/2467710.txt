a distributed archival network for process-oriented autonomic long-term-digital-preservation the reliable and consistent long-term-preservation of digital-content and metadata is becoming increasingly important -- even though the storage media used are potentially subject to failures , or the data formats may become obsolete over time . a common approach is to replicate data across several sites to increase their availability . nevertheless , network , software , or hardware failures as well as the evolution of data formats have to be coped with in a timely and , ideally , an autonomous way , without intervention of an administrator . in this paper we present distarnet , a distributed , autonomous long-term-digital-preservation system . essentially , distarnet exploits dedicated processes to ensure the integrity and consistency of data with a given replication degree . at the data level , distarnet supports complex-data objects , the management of collections , annotations , and arbitrary links between digital-objects . at process level , dynamic-replication management , consistency-checking , and automated recovery of the archived digital-objects is provided utilizing autonomic behavior governed by preservation policies without any centralized component . we present the concepts and implementation of the distributed distarnet preservation approach . most importantly , we provide details of the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the distarnet system . the former addresses the effectiveness of the internal preservation processes while the latter evaluates distarnet 's performance regarding the overall archiving storage-capacity and scalability .
