towards usage-based impact metrics : first results from the mesur project . scholarly usage-data holds the potential to be used as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real-time , and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact . however , the formal groundwork to reliably and validly exploit usage-data is lacking , and the exact nature , meaning and applicability of usage-based metrics is poorly understood . the mesur project funded by the andrew w. mellon foundation constitutes a systematic effort to define , validate and cross-validate a range of usage-based metrics of scholarly impact . mesur has collected nearly 1 billion usage events as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data from significant publishers , aggregators and institutional consortia to construct a large-scale usage-data reference set . this paper describes some major challenges related to aggregating and processing usage-data , and discusses preliminary results obtained from analyzing the mesur reference data-set . the results confirm the intrinsic value of scholarly usage-data , and support the feasibility of reliable and valid usage-based metrics of scholarly impact .
