adaptive sorted-neighborhood methods for efficient record-linkage traditionally , record-linkage algorithms have played an important role in maintaining digital-libraries - i.e. , identifying matching citations or authors for consolidation in updating or integrating digital-libraries . as such , a variety of record-linkage algorithms have been developed and deployed successfully . often , however , existing solutions have a set of parameters whose values are set by human experts off-lineand are fixed during the execution . since finding the ideal values of such parameters is not straightforward , or no such single ideal value even exists , the applicability of existing solutions to new scenarios or domains is greatly hampered . to remedy this problem , we argue that one can achieve significant improvement by adaptively and dynamically changing such parameters of record-linkage algorithms . to validate our hypothesis , we take a classical record-linkage algorithm , the sorted-neighborhood method (snm) , and demonstrate how we can achieve improved accuracy and performance by adaptively changing its fixed sliding-window size . our claim is analytically and empirically validated using both real and synthetic-data sets of digital-libraries and other domains .
