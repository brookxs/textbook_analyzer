automatic event generation from multi-lingual news stories we propose a novel approach for automatic-generation of topically-rela ted events from multi-lingual news sources . named-entity terms are extracted automatically from the news content . together with the content terms , they constitute the basis of representing the story . we employ transformation-based linguistic-tagging approach for named-entity-extraction . two methods of gross translation on chinese story-representation into english have been implemented . the first approach uses only a bilingual-dictionary . the second method makes use of a parallel-corpus as an additional resource . unsupervised-learning is employed to discover the events .
