entag : enhancing social-tagging for discovery the entag (enhanced tagging for discovery) project investigated the effect on indexing-and-retrieval when using only social-tagging versus when using social-tagging in combination with suggestions from a controlled-vocabulary . two different contexts were explored : tagging by readers of a-digital collection and tagging by authors in an institutional-repository ; also two different controlled-vocabularies were examined , dewey-decimal-classification and acm-computing-classification-scheme . for each context a separate demonstrator was developed and a user-study conducted . the results showed the importance of controlled-vocabulary suggestions for both indexing-and-retrieval : to help produce ideas of tags to use , to make it easier to find focus for the tagging , as well as to ensure consistency and increase the number of access-points in retrieval . the value and usefulness of the suggestions proved to be dependent on the quality of the suggestions , both in terms of conceptual relevance to the user and in appropriateness of the terminology . the participants themselves could also see the advantages of controlled-vocabulary terms for retrieval if the terms used were from an authoritative source .
