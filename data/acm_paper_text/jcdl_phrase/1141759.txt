the challenge of virginia banks : an evaluation of named-entity analysis in a 19th-century newspaper collection this paper evaluates automatic-extraction of ten named-entity classes from a 19th century newspaper , the civil war years of the richmond times dispatch , digitized with imls support by the university of richmond . this paper analyzes success with ten categories of entities prominent in these newspapers and the particular problems that these classes of named-entities raise . personal and place names are familiar but some more important categories (such as ship names and military units) illustrate some of the challenges that named-entity-identification confronts as it evolves into a fundamental tool not only for automatic-metadata-generation but also for searching and browsing as well . we conclude by suggesting the kinds of knowledge sources that digital-libraries need to assemble as part of their machine readable reference collections to support named-entity-identification as a core service .
