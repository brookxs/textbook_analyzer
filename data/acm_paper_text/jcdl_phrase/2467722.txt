access-patterns for robots and humans in web-archives although user-access-patterns on the live web are well-understood , there has been no corresponding study of how users , both humans and robots , access web-archives . based on samples from the-internet archive 's public wayback-machine , we propose a set of basic usage-patterns : dip (a single access) , slide (the same page at different archive times) , dive (different pages at approximately the same archive time) , and skim (lists of what pages are archived , i.e. , timemaps) . robots are limited almost exclusively to dips and skims , but human accesses are more varied between all four types . robots outnumber humans 10:1 in terms of sessions , 5:4 in terms of raw http accesses , and 4:1 in terms of megabytes transferred . robots almost always access timemaps (95 % of accesses) , but humans predominately access the archived web-pages themselves (82 % of accesses) . in terms of unique archived web-pages , there is no overall preference for a particular time , but the recent past (within the last year) shows significant repeat accesses .
