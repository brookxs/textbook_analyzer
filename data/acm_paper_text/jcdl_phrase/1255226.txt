the gray lady gets a new dress : a field-study of the times news-reader increasingly individuals are turning to online-sources for their daily news . traditional newspapers have developed significant web presences to compete with newer services such as news-aggregators and emerging genres such as blogs and other forms of citizen-journalism . this paper reports the results of a field-study to investigate the use of a new rss-driven , template-based presentation mechanism that delivers a daily newspaper to subscribers ' laptops and desktops ; the times news-reader hybridizes elements of print newspapers with aspects of online-news . we explore how this application compares with print and web-based news reading and evaluate functionality developed to draw in readers from both audiences . finally we examine three general technological implications drawn from current use : how the news-reader may adapt to different styles of reading ; how the news-reader 's functionality may be extended to highlight the timeliness of the content and to personalize the application ; and how long-term-use of the news-reader can result in a personal-news archive .
