evaluating sliding and sticky target policies by measuring temporal drift in acyclic walks through a web-archive when a user-views an archived page using the archive 's user-interface (ui) , the user selects a datetime to view from a list . the archived web-page , if available , is then displayed . from this display , the-web archive ui attempts to simulate the-web browsing-experience by smoothly transitioning between archived pages . during this process , the target datetime changes with each link followed ; drifting away from the datetime originally selected . when browsing sparsely-archived pages , this nearly-silent drift can be many years in just a few clicks . we conducted 200,000 acyclic walks of archived pages , following up to 50 links per walk , comparing the results of two target datetime policies . the sliding target policy allows the target datetime to change as it does in archive uis such as the-internet archive 's wayback-machine . the sticky target policy , represented by the memento api , keeps the target datetime the same throughout the walk . we found that the sliding target policy drift increases with the number of walk steps , number of domains visited , and choice (number of links available) . however , the sticky target policy controls temporal drift , holding it to less than 30 days on average regardless of walk length or number of domains visited . the sticky target policy shows some increase as choice increases , but this may be caused by other factors . we conclude that based on walk length , the sticky target policy generally produces at least 30 days less drift than the sliding target policy .
