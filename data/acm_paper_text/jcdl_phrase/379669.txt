locating question difficulty through explorations in question space three different search-effectiveness measures were used to classify 50 question narratives as easy or hard . each measure was then encoded onto a spatial-representation of interquestion similarity . discriminant-analysis based on the resulting map was able to predict question difficulty with approximately 80 \ % accuracy , robust across multiple measures . implications for the design of digital document collections are discussed .
