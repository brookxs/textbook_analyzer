generating best-effort preservation metadata for web-resources at time of dissemination http and mime , while sufficient for contemporary webpage access , do not provide enough forensic information to enable the long-term-preservation of the resources they describe and transport . but what if the originating web-server automatically provided preservation metadata encapsulated with the resource at time of dissemination ? perhaps the ingestion process could be streamlined , with additional forensic metadata available to future information archeologists . we have adapted an apache-web-server implementation of oai-pmh which can utilize third-party metadata-analysis tools to provide a metadata-rich description of each resource . the resource and its forensic metadata are packaged together as a complex object , expressed in plain ascii and xml . the result is a crate : a self-contained preservation-ready version of the resource , created at time of dissemination .
