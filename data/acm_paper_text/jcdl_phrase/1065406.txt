detecting and supporting known-item-queries in online-public-access-catalogs when users seek to find specific resources in a-digital library , they often use the library-catalog to locate them . these catalog queries are defined as known-item-queries . as known-item-queries search for specific resources , it is important to manage them differently from other search types , such as area searches . we study how to identify known-item-queries in the context of a large academic institution 's online public access catalog (opac) , in which queries are issued via a simple keyword interface . we also examine how to recognize when a known item query has retrieved the item in question . our approach combines techniques in machine-learning , language-modeling and machine-translation-evaluation metrics to build a classifier capable of distinguishing known-item-queries and correctly classifies titles for whether they are the known item sought with an 80 \ % and 95 \ % correlation to human-performance , respectively on each task . to our knowledge , this is the first report of such work , which has the potential to streamline the user-interface of both opacs and digital-libraries in support of known item searches .
