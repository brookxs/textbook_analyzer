the concept-space interchange protocol the concept-space interchange protocol supports the deployment of conceptual browsing interfaces in digital-libraries . the protocol provides a programmatic-interface to dynamically generate interactive visual components that enable users to navigate a concept-space , request information about concepts , and request library-resources aligned with concepts . the concept-space interchange protocol has been implemented as part of the nsdl strand map service , which enables digital-library developers to create user-interfaces and services based on nationally recognized k-12 science learning goals developed by the american association for the advancement of science . the protocol , the principles underpinning its design , and the problem-centered-design methodology used to create it are described .
