user-interface-evaluation of meta-indexes for search in the indexer 's legacy project , we have created meta-indexes for domain-oriented collections of digital-books in order to promote searching , navigation and browsing in digital-collections . because the meta-index is a new knowledge structure , we have used focus-groups and sample tasks to collect information on user 's perception and use of meta-indexes . user 's responses were positive and their suggestions led to improvements in our online meta-dex user-interface (mui) tool , which will be tested in subsequent user-studies .
