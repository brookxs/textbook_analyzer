topic-model methods for automatically identifying out-of-scope resources recent years have seen the rise of subject-themed digital-libraries , such as the nsdl pathways and the digital library for earth-system education (dlese) . these libraries often need to manually verify that contributed resources cover topics that fit within the theme of the library . we show that such scope judgments can be automated using a combination of text-classification-techniques and topic-modeling . our models address two significant challenges in making scope judgments : only a small number of out-of-scope resources are typically available , and the topic distinctions required for digital-libraries are much more subtle than classic text-classification problems . to meet these challenges , our models combine support-vector-machine learners optimized to different performance-metrics and semantic topics induced by unsupervised statistical-topic-models . our best model is able to distinguish resources that belong in dlese from resources that do n't with an accuracy of around 70 \ % . we see these models as the first steps towards increasing the scalability of digital-libraries and dramatically reducing the workload required to maintain them .
