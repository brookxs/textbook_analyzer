seeking information in realistic books : a user-study there are opposing views on whether readers gain any advantage from using a computer model of a 3d physical book . there is enough evidence , both anecdotal and from formal user-studies , to suggest that the usual html or pdf presentation of documents is not always the most convenient , or the most comfortable , for the reader . on the other hand it is quite clear that while 3d-book models have been prototyped and demonstrated , none are in routine use in today 's digital-libraries . and how do 3d-book models compare with actual books ? this paper reports on a user-study designed to compare the performance of a practical realistic book implementation with conventional formats (html and pdf) and with physical books . it also evaluates the annotation features that the implementation provides .
