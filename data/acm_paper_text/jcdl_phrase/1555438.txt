no bull , no spin : a comparison of tags with other forms of user metadata user-contributed-tags have shown promise as a means of indexing multimedia collections by harnessing the combined efforts and enthusiasm of online-communities . but tags are only one way of describing multimedia items . in this study , i compare the characteristics of public tags with other forms of descriptive-metadata ` titles and narrative captions ` that users have assigned to a collection of very similar images gathered from the photo-sharing service flickr . the study shows that tags converge on different descriptions than the other forms of metadata do , and that narrative metadata may be more effective than tags for capturing certain aspects of images that may influence their subsequent retrieval and use . the study also examines how photographers use peoples ' names to personalize the different types of metadata and how they tell stories across short sequences of images . the study results are then brought to bear on design-recommendations for user-tagging tools and automated-tagging algorithms and on using photo-sharing sites as de facto art and architecture resources .
