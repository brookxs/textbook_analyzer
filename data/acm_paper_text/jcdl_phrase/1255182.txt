factors affecting website-reconstruction from the-web infrastructure when a website is suddenly lost without a backup , it maybe reconstituted by probing web-archives and search-engine-caches for missing content . in this paper we describe an experiment where we crawled and reconstructed 300 randomly selected websites on a weekly basis for 14 weeks . the reconstructions were performed using our web-repository crawler named warrick which recovers missing resources from the-web infrastructure (wi) , the collective preservation effort of web-archives and search-engine-caches . we examine several characteristics of the websites over time including birth-rate , decay and age of resources . we evaluate the reconstructions when compared to the crawled sites and develop a statistical model for predicting reconstruction success from the wi . on average , we were able to recover 61 \ % of each website 's resources . we found that google 's pagerank , number-of-hops and resource age were the three most significant factors in determining if a resource would be recovered from the wi .
