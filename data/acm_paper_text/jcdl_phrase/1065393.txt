using collection descriptions to enhance an aggregation of harvested item-level metadata as an increasing number of digital-library projects embrace the harvesting of item-level descriptive-metadata , issues of description granularity and concerns about potential loss of context when harvesting item-level metadata take on greater significance . collection-level-description can provide valuable context for item-level metadata records harvested from disparate and heterogeneous providers . this paper describes an ongoing experiment using collection-level-description in concert with item-level metadata to improve quality of search and discovery across an aggregation of metadata describing resources held by a consortium of large academic-research libraries . we present details of approaches implemented so far and preliminary analyses of the potential utility of these approaches . the paper concludes with a brief discussion of related issues and future work plans .
