the challenges of statistical digital-libraries what are statistical digital-libraries ? who uses them ? for what purpose ? how do they differ from or resemble text-focused digital-libraries ? what are the research-issues associated with their use and the implications for interface design?these are just some of the issues the panelists have been grappling with over the last few years as government-agencies and academic-libraries rush to make their holdings web-accessible to both the users they have always served and all kinds of new-users with varying statistical and computing skills.the panelists represent a variety of user-oriented perspectives-some are developers , some are intermediaries , some are users themselves . their primary user focus varies from university students and faculty to government-policy analysts , but the casual or first-time-user must also be served.the panelist will focus their remarks on the challenges of statistical libraries on a multitude of dimensions , including technical , social , behavioral , economic , organizational , etc. . the discussion should both inform and entice the audience to pursue some difficult and interesting problems in digital-library research .
