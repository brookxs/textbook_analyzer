units of evidence for analyzing subdisciplinary difference in data practice studies digital-libraries (dls) are adapting to accommodate research data and related services . the complexities of this new content spans the elements of dl development , and there are questions concerning data-selection , service-development , and how best to align these with local , institutional initiatives for cyberinfrastructure , data-intensive research , and data stewardship . small-science disciplines are of particular relevance due to the prevalence of this mode of research in the academy , and the anticipated magnitude of data-production . to support data-acquisition into dls - and subsequent data-reuse - there is a need for new knowledge on the range and complexities inherent in practice-data-curation arrangements for small-science research . we present a flexible methodological-approach crafted to generate data units to analyze these relationships and facilitate cross-disciplinary comparisons .
