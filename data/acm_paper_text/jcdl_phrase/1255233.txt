goal-directed-evaluation for the improvement of optical-music-recognition on early-music prints optical-music-recognition (omr) systems are promising tools for the creation of searchable digital-music libraries . using an adaptive omr system for early-music prints based on hidden-markov-models , we leverage an edit-distance evaluation-metric to improve recognition-accuracy . baseline results are computed with new labeled training and test-sets drawn from a diverse group of prints . we present two experiments based on this evaluation-technique . the first resulted in a significant improvement to the feature-extraction function for these images . the second is a goal-directed comparison of several popular adaptive-binarization algorithms , which are often evaluated only subjectively . accuracy increased by as much as 55 \ % for some pages , and the experiments suggest several avenues for further research .
