leveraging a common representation for personalized-search and summarization in a medical-digital-library despite the large amount of online medical literature , it can be difficult for clinicians to find relevant-information at the point of patient care . in this paper , we present techniques to personalize the results of search , making use of the online patient-record as a sophisticated , pre-existing user-model . our work in persival , a medical-digital-library , includes methods for re-ranking the results of search to prioritize those that better match the patient-record . it also generates summaries of the re-ranked results which highlight information that is relevant to the patient under the physician 's care . we focus on the use of a common representation for the articles returned by search and the patient-record which facilitates both the re-ranking and the summarization tasks . this common approach to both tasks has a strong positive effect on the ability to personalize information .
