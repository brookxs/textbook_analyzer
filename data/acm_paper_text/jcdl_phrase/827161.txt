convergence of knowledge-management and e-learning : the getsmart experience the national-science-digital-library (nsdl) , launched in december 2002 , is emerging as a center of innovation in digital-libraries as applied to education . as a part of this extensive project , the getsmart system was created to apply knowledge-management techniques in a learning-environment . the design of the system is based on an analysis of learning-theory and the information-search process . its key notion is the integration of search-tools and curriculum support with concept-mapping . more than 100 students at the university of arizona and virginia tech used the system in the fall of 2002 . a database of more than one thousand student-prepared concept-maps has been collected with more than forty thousand relationships expressed in semantic , graphical , node-link representations . preliminary analysis of the collected data is revealing interesting knowledge-representation patterns .
