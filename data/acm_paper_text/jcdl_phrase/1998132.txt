a source independent framework for research-paper recommendation as the number of research papers available on the web has increased enormously over the years , paper recommender-systems have been proposed to help researchers on automatically finding works of interest . the main problem with the current approaches is that they assume that recommending algorithms are provided with a rich set of evidence (e.g. , document-collections , citations , profiles) which is normally not widely available . in this paper we propose a novel source independent framework for research-paper recommendation . the framework requires as input only a single research-paper and generates several potential queries by using terms in that paper , which are then submitted to existing web-information sources that hold research papers . once a set of candidate papers for recommendation is generated , the framework applies content-based recommending algorithms to rank the candidates in order to recommend the ones most related to the input paper . this is done by using only publicly available metadata (i.e. , title and abstract) . we evaluate our proposed framework by performing an extensive experimentation in which we analyzed several strategies for query-generation and several ranking strategies for paper recommendation . our results show that good recommendations can be obtained with simple and low-cost strategies .
