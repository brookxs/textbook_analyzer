'' this question is studied by approximating the-web via sampling uris from dmoz , delicious , bitly , and search-engine indexes and measuring number of archive copies available in various public web-archives . the results indicate that 35 \ % -90 \ % of uris have at least one archived copy , 17 \ % -49 \ % have two to five copies , 1 \ % -8 \ % have six to ten copies , and 8 \ % -63 \ % at least ten copies . the number of uri copies varies as a function of time , but only 14.6-31 .3 \ % of uris are archived more than once per month .
