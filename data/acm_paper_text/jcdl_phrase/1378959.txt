improving navigation interaction in digital-documents this paper investigates novel-interactions for supporting within-document navigation . we focus on one specific interaction : the following of figure references . through this interaction we illuminate factors also found in other forms of navigation . three alternative interactions for supporting figure navigation are described and evaluated through a user-study . experimentation proves the advantages of our interaction-design , and the degree to which the interaction of existing reader software can be improved .
