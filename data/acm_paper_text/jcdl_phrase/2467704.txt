lsh-based large-scale chinese-calligraphic-character recognition chinese calligraphy is the art of handwriting and is an important part of chinese traditional culture . but due to the complexity of shape and styles of calligraphic characters , it is difficult for com-mon people to recognize them . so it would be great if a tool is provided to help users to recognize the unknown calligraphic characters . but the well-known ocr (optical character recogni-tion) technology can hardly help people to recognize the unknown characters because of their deformation and complexity . numerous collections of historical chinese calligraphic works are digitized and stored in cadal (china academic digital associate library) calligraphic system [1] , and a huge database ccd (calligraphic character dictionary) is built , which contains character images labeled with semantic-meaning . in this paper , a lsh-based large-scale chinese-calligraphic-character recognition method is proposed basing on ccd . in our method , gist descriptor is used to represent the global-features of the calligraphic character images , lsh (locality-sensitive-hashing) is used to search ccd to find the similar character images to the recognized calligraphic character image . the recognition is based on the semantic probability which is computed according to the ranks of retrieved images and their distances to the recognized image in the gist feature-space . our experiments show that our method is effective and efficient for recognizing chinese-calligraphic-character image .
