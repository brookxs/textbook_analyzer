the sead datanet prototype : data-preservation services for sustainability-science in this poster we will present the sead project [1] and its prototype software and describe how sead approaches long-term-data preservation and access through multiple partnerships and how it supports sustainability-science researchers in their data-management , analysis and archival needs . sead 's initial prototype-system currently is being tested by ingesting datasets from the national center for earth surface dynamics (1.6 terabyte of data containing over 450,000 files) [2] and packaging them for transmission to long-term archival-storage .
