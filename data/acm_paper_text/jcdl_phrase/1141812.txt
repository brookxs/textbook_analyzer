frbr : enriching and integrating digital-libraries frbr (functional-requirements for bibliographic-records) is a promising framework for supporting rich indexation , and therefore rich-interaction , in digital-libraries . however , it is poorly reported in the digital-library research-literature and practical examples of its use are seldom discussed . in this paper , we introduce an implemented architecture for frbr support that can supplement existing digital-library-systems . we also demonstrate the benefits gained by the user when frbr data is used to enrich the user 's interaction with the digital library .
