design of a digital-library for human-movement this paper is focused on a central aspect in the design of our planned digital-library for human-movement , i.e. on the aspect of representation and recognition of human-activity from video-data . the method of representation is important since it has a major impact on the design of all the other building-blocks of our system such as the user interface/query block or the activity recognition/storage block . in this paper we evaluate a representation method for human-movement that is based on sequences of angular poses and angular velocities of the human skeletal joints , for storage-and-retrieval of human-actions in video-databases . the choice of a representation method plays an important role in the database-structure , search-methods , storage-efficiency etc. . for this representation , we develop a novel approach for complex human-activity-recognition by employing multidimensional-indexing combined with temporal or sequential correlation . this scheme is then evaluated with respect to its efficiency in storage-and-retrieval . for the indexing we use postures of humans in videos that are decomposed into a set of multidimensional tuples which represent the poses/velocities of human-body parts such as arms , legs and torso . three novel methods for human-activity-recognition are theoretically and experimentally compared . the methods require only a few sparsely sampled human postures . we also achieve speed invariant recognition of activities by eliminating the time-factor and replacing it with sequence information . the indexing-approach also provides robust recognition and an efficient storage/retrieval of all the activities in a small set of hash-tables .
