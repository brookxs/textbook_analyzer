recommendation as link-prediction : a graph kernel-based machine-learning-approach recommender-systems have demonstrated commercial success in multiple industries . in digital-libraries they have the potential to be used as a support-tool for traditional information-retrieval functions . among the major recommendation-algorithms , the successful collaborative-filtering (cf) methods explore the use of user-item interactions to infer user-interests . based on the finding that transitive user-item associations can alleviate the data-sparsity problem in cf , multiple heuristic-algorithms were designed to take advantage of the user-item interaction-networks with both direct and indirect interactions . however , the use of such graph-representation was still limited in learning-based algorithms . in this paper , we propose a graph kernel-based recommendation framework . for each user-item pair , we inspect its associative interaction graph (aig) that contains the users , items , and interactions n steps away from the pair . we design a novel graph-kernel to capture the aig structures and use them to predict possible user-item interactions . the framework demonstrates improved performance on an online bookstore dataset , especially when a large number of suggestions are needed .
