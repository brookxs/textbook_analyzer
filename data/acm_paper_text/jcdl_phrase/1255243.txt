efficient topic-based unsupervised name-disambiguation name-ambiguity is a special case of identity-uncertainty where one person can be referenced by multiple name variations in different situations or even share the same name with other people . in this paper , we focus on the problem of disambiguating person-names within web-pages and scientific documents . we present an efficient and effective two-stage approach to disambiguate names . in the first stage , two novel topic-based models are proposed by extending two hierarchical bayesian text models , namely probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis (plsa) and latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) . our models explicitly introduce a new variable for persons and learn the distribution of topics with regard to persons and words . after learning an initial model , the topic distributions are treated as feature-sets and names are disambiguated by leveraging a hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering method . experiments on web-data and scientific documents from citeseer indicate that our approach consistently outperforms other unsupervised-learning methods such as spectral-clustering and dbscan clustering and could be extended to other research fields . we empirically addressed the issue of scalability by disambiguating authors in over 750,000 papers from the entire citeseer dataset .
