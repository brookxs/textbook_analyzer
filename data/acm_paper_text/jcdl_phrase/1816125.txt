making web-annotations persistent over time as digital-libraries (dl) become more aligned with the-web architecture , their functional components need to be fundamentally rethought in terms of uris and http . annotation , a core scholarly activity enabled by many dl solutions , exhibits a clearly unacceptable characteristic when existing models are applied to the-web : due to the representations of web-resources changing over time , an annotation made about a web-resource today may no longer be relevant to the representation that is served from that same resource tomorrow . we assume the existence of archived versions of resources , and combine the temporal-features of the emerging open annotation data-model with the capability offered by the memento framework that allows seamless-navigation from the uri of a resource to archived versions of that resource , and arrive at a solution that provides guarantees regarding the persistence of web-annotations over time . more specifically , we provide theoretical solutions and proof-of-concept experimental evaluations for two problems : reconstructing an existing annotation so that the correct archived version is displayed for all resources involved in the annotation , and retrieving all annotations that involve a given archived version of a web-resource .
