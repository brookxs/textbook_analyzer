distributed resource discovery : using z39 .50 to build cross-domain information servers this short paper describes the construction and application of cross-d omain information servers using features of the standard z39 .50 information-retrieval protocol [11] . we use the z39 .50 explain database to determine the databases and indexes of a given server , then use the scan facility to extract the contents of the indexes . this information is used to build collection documents that can be retrieved using probabilistic-retrieval algorithms .
