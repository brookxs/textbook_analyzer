frbr and facets provide flexible , work-centric access to items in library collections this paper explores a technique to improve searcher access to library collections by providing a faceted-search interface built on a data-model based on the functional-requirements for bibliographic-records (frbr) . the prototype provides a work-centric view of a moving-image collection that is integrated with bibliographic and holdings data . two sets of facets address important user-needs : `` what do you want ? '' and `` how/where do you want it ? '' enabling patrons to narrow , broaden and pivot across facet values instead of limiting them to the tree-structured hierarchy common with existing frbr applications . the data-model illustrates how frbr is being adapted and applied beyond the traditional library-catalog .
