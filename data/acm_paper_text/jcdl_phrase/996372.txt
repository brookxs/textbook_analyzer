realistic books : a bizarre homage to an obsolete medium ? for many readers , handling a physical book is an enjoyably exquisite part of the information-seeking process . many physical-characteristics of a book-its size , heft , the patina of use on its pages and so on-communicate ambient qualities of the document it represents . in contrast , the experience of accessing and exploring digital-library documents is often dull . the emphasis is utilitarian ; technophile rather than bibliophile . we have extended the page-turning algorithm we reported at last year 's jcdl into a scaleable , systematic approach that allows users to view and interact with realistic visualizations of any textual-based document in a greenstone collection . here , we further motivate the approach , illustrate the system in use , discuss the system-architecture and present a user-evaluation our work leads us to believe that far from being a whimsical gimmick , physical book models can usefully complement conventional document viewers and increase the perceived-value of a-digital library system .
