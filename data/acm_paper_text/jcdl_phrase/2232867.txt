exploiting real-time-information retrieval in the microblogosphere information-seeking-behavior in microblogging environments such as twitter differs from traditional web-search . the best performing microblog retrieval techniques attempt to utilize both semantic and temporal-aspects of documents . in this paper , we present an effective approach , including the query-modeling , the document modeling and the temporal re-ranking , to discover the most recent but relevant-information to the query . for the query-modeling , we introduce a two-stage pseudo-relevance-feedback query-expansion to overcome the severe vocabulary-mismatch problem of short-message retrieval in microblog . for the document modeling , we propose two ways to expand document with the help of the shortened url . for the temporal re-ranking , we suggest several methods to evaluate the temporal-aspects of documents . experimental-results demonstrate that our approach obtains significant improvements compared with baseline systems . specifically , the proposed system gives 26.37 % and 9.94 % further increases in p@30 and map over the best performing result on highrel in the trec '11 real-time-search task .
