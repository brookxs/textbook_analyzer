improving historical-research by linking digital library information to a global genealogical database journals , letters , and other writings are of great value to historians and those who research their own family-history ; however , it can be difficult to find writings by specific people , and even harder to find what others wrote about them . we present a prototype web-based-system that enables users to discover information about historical people (including their own ancestors) by linking digital library content to unique personids from a genealogical database . users can contribute content such as scanned journals or information about where items can be found . they can also transcribe content and tag it with personids to identify who it is about . additional features provide tools for users to explore historical contexts and relationships . these include the ability to tag places and to create a historical social network by specifying non-family relationships or by using a mechanism we call rosters to imply participation in some group or event .
