retrieval and exploratory-search in multivariate research-data-repositories using regressional features increasing amounts of data are collected in many areas of research and application . the degree to which this data can be accessed , retrieved , and analyzed is decisive to obtain progress in fields such as scientific-research or industrial-production . we present a novel method supporting content-based-retrieval and exploratory-search in repositories of multivariate research data . in particular , functional-dependencies are a key characteristic of data that researchers are often interested in . our methods are able to describe the functional-form of such dependencies , e.g. , the relationship between inflation and unemployment in economics . our basic idea is to use feature-vectors based on the goodness-of-fit of a set of regression-models , to describe the data mathematically . we denote this approach regressional features and use it for content-based-search and , since our approach motivates an intuitive definition of interestingness , for exploring the most interesting data . we apply our method on considerable real-world research datasets , showing the usefulness of our approach for user-centered access to research data in a-digital library system .
