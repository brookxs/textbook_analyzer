impact and prospect of social-bookmarks for bibliographic-information-retrieval this paper presents our ongoing study of the current/future impact of social bookmarks (or social-tags) on information-retrieval (ir) . our main research question asked in the present work is `` how are social-tags compared with conventional , yet reliable manual-indexing from the viewpoint of ir performance ? '' . to answer the question , we look at the biomedical-literature and begin with examining basic statistics of social-tags from citeulike in comparison with medical subject-headings (mesh) annotated in the medline bibliographic database . then , using the data , we conduct various experiments in an ir setting , which reveals that social-tags work complementarily with mesh and that retrieval-performance would improve as the coverage of citeulike grows .
