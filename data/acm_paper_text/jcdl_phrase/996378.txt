translating unknown cross-lingual queries in digital-libraries using a web-based approach users ' cross-lingual queries to a-digital library system might be short and not included in a common translation-dictionary (unknown terms) . in this paper , we investigate the feasibility of exploiting the-web as the corpus source to translate unknown query terms for cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) in digital-libraries . we propose a web-based term-translation approach to determine effective translations for unknown query terms by mining bilingual search-result pages obtained from a real web-search-engine . this approach can enhance the construction of a domain-specific bilingual-lexicon and benefit clir services in a-digital library that only has monolingual document-collections very promising results have been obtained in generating effective translation-equivalents for many unknown terms , including proper nouns , technical-terms and web-query terms .
