understanding cultural-heritage-experts ' information-seeking needs we report on our user-study on the information-seeking-behavior of cultural-heritage-experts and the sources they use to carry out search-tasks . seventeen experts from nine cultural-heritage institutes in the netherlands were interviewed and asked to answer questionnaires about their daily search activities . the interviews helped us to better understand their search motivations , types , sources and tools . a key finding of our study is that the majority of search-tasks involve relatively complex-information gathering . this is in contrast to the relatively simple fact-finding oriented support provided by current tools . we describe a number of strategies that experts have developed to overcome the inadequacies of their tools . finally , based on the analysis , we derive general trends of cultural-heritage-experts ' information-seeking needs and discuss our preliminary experiences with potential solutions .
