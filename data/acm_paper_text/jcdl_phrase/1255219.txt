flux-cim : flexible unsupervised-extraction of citation metadata in this paper we propose a knowledge-base approach to help extracting the correct components of citations in any given format . differently from related approaches that rely on manually built knowledge-bases (kbs) for recognizing the components of a citation , in our case , such a kb is automatically constructed from an existing set of sample metadata records from a given area (e.g. , computer-science or health sciences) . our approach does not rely on patterns encoding specific delimitators of a particular citation style . it is also unsupervised , in the sense that it does not rely on a learning-method that requires a training-phase . these features assign to our technique a high degree of automation and flexibility . to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed approach we have run experiments in which we applied it to extract information from citations in papers of two different domains . results of these experiments indicate precision-and-recall levels above 94 \ % and perfect extraction for the large majority of citations tested .
