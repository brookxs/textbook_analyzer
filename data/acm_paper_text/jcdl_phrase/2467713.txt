charting the digital library evaluation domain with a semantically enhanced mining methodology the digital library evaluation field has an evolving nature and it is characterized by a noteworthy proclivity to enfold various methodological orientations . given the fact that the scientific-literature in the specific domain is vast , researchers require tools that will exhibit either commonly acceptable practices , or areas for further investigation . in this paper , a data-mining methodology is proposed to identify prominent patterns in the evaluation of digital-libraries . using machine-learning-techniques , all papers presented in the ecdl and jcdl conferences between the years 2001 and 2011 were categorized as relevant or non-relevant to the dl evaluation domain . then , the relevant papers were semantically annotated according to the digital library evaluation ontology (dileo) vocabulary . the produced set of annotations was clustered to evaluation patterns for the most frequently used tools , methods and goals of the domain . our findings highlight the expressive nature of dileo , place emphasis on semantic-annotation as a necessary step in handling domain-centric corpora and underline the potential of the proposed methodology in the profiling of evaluation activities .
