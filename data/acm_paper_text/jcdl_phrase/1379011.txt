a unique insight into department-of-energy research accomplishments : a special-collection this poster describes online-access to a unique collection of department-of-energy (doe) research-and-development (r&d) accomplishments . the collection features research of doe and its predecessor agencies , the energy-research-and-development-administration (erda) and the atomic-energy-commission (aec) . this special-collection contains historically significant government-documents , including items from the manhattan-project era , that have been specially selected and digitized to make them accessible via the-web . landmark documents in the collection include the eightfold way : a theory of strong interaction symmetry (authored by nobel-prize winner murray gell-mann) and the first weighing of plutonium (authored by nobel-prize winner glenn seaborg) . in addition to a database of approximately 250 specially-selected documents , all related aspects of the collection (documents , research areas , and/or nobel laureate information) are combined in feature topic-pages for the added-value of a single point of access to each compilation . over sixty (60) feature topic-pages include diverse topics such as `` video-games - did they begin at brookhaven ? '' and `` human-genome research : decoding dna '' . this collection features a large number of doe-associated nobel laureates , including enrico fermi , winner of the 1938 nobel-prize in physics , and george smoot , winner of the 2006 nobel-prize in physics , and showcases a diversity in doe research areas , including solar-energy (with related educational materials) and radioisotope-thermoelectric-generators (rtgs) that are used to power spacecraft . easy access to this unique collection is provided via doe r&d accomplishments at http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments . this special-collection is continually growing , with additional nobel laureate and/or research-topic documents and features being added on a regular basis .
