automated text classification using a multi-agent framework automatic-text-classification is an important operational problem in digital-library practice . most text-classification efforts so far concentrated on developing centralized solutions . however , centralized classification approaches often are limited due to constraints on knowledge and computing-resources . in addition , centralized approaches are more vulnerable to attacks or system failures and less robust in dealing with them . we present a de-centralized approach and system-implementation (named macci) for text-classification using a multi-agent framework . experiments are conducted to compare our multi-agent approach with a centralized approach . the results show multi-agent classification can achieve promising classification results while maintaining its other advantages .
