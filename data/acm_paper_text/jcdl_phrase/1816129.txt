scholarly paper recommendation via user 's recent research interests we examine the effect of modeling a researcher 's past works in recommending scholarly papers to the researcher . our hypothesis is that an author 's published works constitute a clean signal of the latent interests of a researcher . a key part of our model is to enhance the profile derived directly from past works with information coming from the past works ' referenced papers as well as papers that cite the work . in our experiments , we differentiate between junior researchers that have only published one paper and senior researchers that have multiple publications . we show that filtering these sources-of-information is advantageous -- when we additionally prune noisy citations , referenced papers and publication history , we achieve statistically significant higher levels of recommendation-accuracy .
