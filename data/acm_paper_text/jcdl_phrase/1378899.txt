a longitudinal-study of exploratory and keyword-search digital-libraries are concerned with improving the access to collections to make their service more effective and valuable to users . in this paper , we present the results of a four-week longitudinal-study investigating the use of both exploratory and keyword forms of search within an online-video archive , where both forms of search were available concurrently in a single user interface . while we expected early use to be more exploratory and subsequent use to be directed , over the whole period there was a balance of exploratory and keyword searches and they were often used together . further , to support the notion that facets support exploration , there were more than five times as many facet clicks than more complex forms of keyword-search (boolean and advanced) . from these results , we can conclude that there is real-value in investing in exploratory-search support , which was shown to be both popular and useful for extended use of the system .
