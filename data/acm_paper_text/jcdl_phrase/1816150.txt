supporting document-triage via annotation-based multi-application visualizations for open-ended information-tasks , users must sift through many potentially relevant documents , a practice we refer to as document-triage . normally , people perform triage using multiple-applications in concert : a search-engine interface presents lists of potentially relevant documents ; a document reader displays their contents ; and a third tool -- a text-editor or personal-information-management application -- is used to record notes and assessments . to support document-triage , we have developed an extensible multi-application architecture that initially includes an information-workspace and a document reader . an interest profile manager infers users ' interests from their interactions with the triage applications , coupled with the characteristics of the documents they are interacting with . the resulting interest profile is used to generate visualizations that direct users ' attention to documents or parts of documents that match their inferred interests . the novelty of our approach lies in the aggregation of activity records across applications to generate fine-grained models-of-user interest .
