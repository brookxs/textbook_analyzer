cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and social-sciences : advancing the humanities-research agenda in 2006 the american council of learned societies (acls) released our cultural commonwealth , the final report of the commission on cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and social-sciences . the report , based on a study funded by the mellon foundation , explored how research environments might be created for the humanities and social-sciences to complement those being developed to support scientific-research . the report includes key recommendations addressed to universities , funding agencies , scholarly societies , academic-libraries , publishers , congress , state legislatures , and others . implementation of the recommendations could potentially transform scholarship and exponentially increase access to resources and new scholarship in the humanities and social-sciences . but the report has not been universally embraced . how will humanities scholarship be advanced by new-technologies and research practices , and how will the academic community recognize new forms of scholarship ? how will funding agencies respond to the challenges and issues raised ? what does cyberinfrastructure mean for different domains within the humanities ? these questions will be addressed by panelists and discussed by participants .
