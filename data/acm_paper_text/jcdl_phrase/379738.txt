dynamic digital libraries for children the majority of current digital-libraries (dls) are not designed for children . for dls to be popular with children , they need to be fun , easy-to-use and empower them , whether as readers or authors . this paper describes a new childrens dl emphasizing its design-and-evaluation , working with the children (11-14 year olds) as design-partners-and-testers . a truly participatory process was used , and observational-study was used as a means of refinement to the initial design of the dl prototype . in contrast with current dls , the childrens dl provides both a static as well as a dynamic-environment to encourage active engagement of children in using it . design , implementation and security issues are also raised .
