two supervised-learning approaches for name-disambiguation in author citations due to name abbreviations , identical names , name misspellings , and pseudonyms inpublications or bibliographies (citations) , an author may have multiple names and multiple authors may share the same name . such name-ambiguity affects the performance of document-retrieval , web-search , database-integration , and may cause improper attribution to authors . this paper investigates two supervised-learning approaches to disambiguate authors in the citations . one approach uses the naive-bayes probability-model , a generative-model ; the other uses support-vector-machines (svms) and the vector-space-representation of citations , a discriminative-model . both approaches utilize three types of citation attributes : co-author names , the title of the paper , and the title of the journal or proceeding . we illustrate these two approaches on two types of data , one collected from the-web , mainly publication lists from homepages , the other collected from the dblpcitation databases .
