scalable integrated region-based-image-retrieval using irm and statistical-clustering statistical-clustering is critical in designing scalable image retriev al systems . in this paper , we present a scalable-algorithm for indexing and retrieving images based on region-segmentation . the method uses statistical-clustering on region features and irm (integrated-region-matching) , a measure developed to evaluate overall similarity between images that incorporates properties of all the regions in the images by a region-matching scheme . compared with retrieval based on individual regions , our overall similarity approach (a) reduces the influence of inaccurate segmentation , (b) helps to clarify the semantics of a particular region , and (c) enables a simple querying interface for region-based-image-retrieval systems . the algorithm has been implemented as a part of our experimental simplicity image-retrieval-system and tested on large-scale image databases of both general-purpose images and pathology slides . experiments have demonstrated that this technique maintains the accuracy and robustness of the original system while reducing the matching time significantly .
