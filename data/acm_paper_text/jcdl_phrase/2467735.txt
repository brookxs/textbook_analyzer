first steps in archiving the mobile-web : automated discovery of mobile websites smartphones and tablets are increasingly used to access the-web , and many websites now provide alternative sites tailored specifically for these mobile-devices . web archivists are in need of tools to aid in archiving this equally ephemeral mobile-web . we present findmobile , a tool for automating the discovery of mobile websites . we tested our tool in an experiment examining 10k popular websites and found that the most frequently used technique used by popular websites to direct mobile-users to mobile sites was by automated client and server-side redirection . we found that nearly half of mobile-web pages differ dramatically from their stationary web counterparts and that the most popular websites are those most likely to have mobile-specific pages .
