annotating historical archives of images recent initiatives like the million book project and google print library project have already archived several million books in digital format , and within a few years a significant fraction of world 's books will be online . while the majority of the data will naturally be text , there will also be tens of millions of pages of images . many of these images will defy automation annotation for the foreseeable future , but a considerable fraction of the images may be amiable to automatic-annotation by algorithms that can link the historical image with a modern contemporary , with its attendant metatags . in order to perform this linking we must have a suitable distance-measure which appropriately combines the relevant features of shape , color , texture and text . however the best combination of these features will vary from application to application and even from one manuscript to another . in this work we propose a simple technique to learn the distance-measure by perturbing the training-set in a principled way . we show the utility of our ideas on archives of manuscripts containing images from natural history and cultural-artifacts .
