improving a hybrid literary book recommendation-system through author-ranking literary reading is an important activity for individuals and can be a long-term commitment , making book choice an important task for book lovers and public-library users . in this paper , we present a hybrid-recommendation system to help readers decide which book to read next . we study book and author recommendations in a hybrid-recommendation setting and test our algorithm on the litrec data-set . our hybrid-method combines two item-based-collaborative-filtering algorithms to predict books and authors that the user will like . author predictions are expanded into a booklist that is subsequently aggregated with the former book predictions . finally , the resulting booklist is used to yield the top-n book recommendations . by means of various experiments , we demonstrate that author recommendation can improve overall book recommendation .
