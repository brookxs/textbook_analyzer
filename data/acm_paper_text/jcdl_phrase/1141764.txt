probabilistic , object-oriented logics for annotation-based-retrieval in digital-libraries in this paper we introduce polar , a probabilistic object-oriented logical-framework for annotation-based information-retrieval . in polar , the knowledge about digital-objects , annotations and their relationships in a-digital library repository can be modelled considering certain characteristics of annotations and annotated objects . insights about these characteristics are gained by an analysis of the annotation models behind existing systems and a discussion of an object-oriented , logical view on relevant objects in a-digital library . retrieval-methods applied in a-digital library should take annotations into account to satisfy users ' information-needs . polar thus supports a wide range of flexible and powerful annotation-based fact and content queries by making use of knowledge and relevance augmentation . an evaluation of our approach on email discussions shows performance-improvements when annotation characteristics are considered .
