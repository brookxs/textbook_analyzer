crf-based authors ' name-tagging for scanned-documents authors ' names are a critical bibliographic element when searching or browsing academic articles stored in digital-libraries . therefore , those creating metadata for digital-libraries would appreciate an automatic-method to extract such bibliographic-data from printed documents . in this paper , we describe an automatic author name tagger for academic articles scanned with optical-character-recognition (ocr) mark-up . the method uses conditional-random-fields (crf) for labeling the unsegmented character strings in authors ' blocks as those of either an author or a delimiter . we applied the tagger to japanese academic articles . the results of the experiments showed that it correctly labeled more than 99 \ % of the author name strings , which compares favorably with the under 96 \ % correct rate of our previous tagger based on a hidden-markov-model (hmm) .
