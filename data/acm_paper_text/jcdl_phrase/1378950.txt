autotagging to improve text-search for 3d-models text-search on libraries of 3d-models has traditionally worked poorly , as text-annotations on 3d-models are often unreliable or incomplete . we attempt to improve the recall of text-search by automatically assigning appropriate tags to models . our algorithm finds relevant tags by appealing to a large-corpus of partially labeled example models , which does not have to be preclassified or otherwise prepared . for this purpose we use a copy of google 3dwarehouse , a library of user contributed models which is publicly available on the internet . given a model to tag , we find geometrically similar models in the corpus , based on distances in a reduced dimensional space derived from zernike descriptors . the labels of these neighbors are used as tag candidates for the model with probabilities proportional to the degree of geometric similarity . we show experimentally that text_based search for 3d-models using our computed tags can approach the quality of geometry_based search . finally , we describe our 3d-model-search engine that uses this algorithm .
