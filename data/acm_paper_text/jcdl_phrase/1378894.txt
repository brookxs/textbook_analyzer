unsupervised semantic-markup of literature for biodiversity digital-libraries this paper reports the further development of machine-learning-techniques for semantic-markup of biodiversity literature , especially morphological descriptions of living organisms such as those hosted at efloras.org and algaebase.org . syntactic-parsing and supervised-machine-learning techniques have been explored by earlier research . limitations of these techniques promoted our investigation of an unsupervised-learning approach that combines the strength of earlier techniques and avoids the limitations . semantic-markup at the organ and character levels is discussed . research on semantic-markup of natural-heritage-literature has direct impact on the development of semantic-based access in biodiversity digital-libraries .
