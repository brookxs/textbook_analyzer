link-prediction approach to collaborative-filtering recommender-systems can provide valuable services in a-digital library environment , as demonstrated by its commercial success in book , movie , and music industries . one of the most commonly-used and successful recommendation-algorithms is collaborative-filtering , which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer user-interests and preferences . however , the recommendation quality of collaborative-filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data-sparsity problem . to alleviate this problem we have previously proposed graph-based-algorithms to explore transitive user-item associations . in this paper , we extend the idea of analyzing user-item interactions as graphs and employ link-prediction approaches proposed in the recent network-modeling literature for making collaborative-filtering recommendations . we have adapted a wide range of linkage measures for making recommendations . our preliminary experimental-results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these measures achieved significantly better performance than standard collaborative-filtering algorithms .
