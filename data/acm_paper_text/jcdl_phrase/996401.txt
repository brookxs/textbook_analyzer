sharing encountered-information : digital-libraries get a social-life as part of a more extensive study of reading-related practices , we have explored how people share information they encounter in their everyday reading as a complement to the more traditional digital-library focus on sharing intentionally retrieved materials . in twenty contextual-interviews in home and work place settings , we investigated how people encounter and save published material in the form of paper and electronic clippings . we found that sharing forms a significant use for encountered materials . furthermore , the function of these clippings extends far beyond a simple exchange of content to inform the recipient ; in fact , the content itself may have little immediate value to the recipient . we also found the practice to be ubiquitous : all of our participants had both shared clippings with others and received them themselves . specifically , this paper reports on : (1) how sharing encountered items fits into the broader spectrum of clipping practices ; (2) the function and value of the shared information ; and (3) the social-role of sharing the encountered-information we conclude that from a technological standpoint , we should think beyond an email model for sharing encountered-information and , from a social perspective , we should attend to how sharing this sort of material contributes to the strength of social-ties outside of a traditional information-needs framework .
