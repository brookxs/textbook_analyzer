exploring a-digital library through key ideas key ideas is a technique for exploring digital-libraries by navigating passages that repeat across multiple books . from these popular passages emerge quotations that authors have copied from book to book because they capture an idea particularly well : jefferson on liberty ; stanton on women 's rights ; and gibson on cyberpunk . we augment popular passages by extracting key terms from the surrounding context and computing sets of related key terms . we then create an interaction-model where readers fluidly explore the library by viewing popular quotations on a particular key-term , and follow links to quotations on related key terms . in this paper we describe our vision and motivation for key ideas , present an implementation running over a massive , real-world digital-library consisting of over a million scanned-books , and describe some of the technical and design-challenges . the principal contribution of this paper is the interaction-model and prototype-system for browsing digital-libraries of books using key terms extracted from the aggregate context of popularly quoted passages .
