tacit user and developer frames in user-led collection-development : the case of the digital water education library this paper discusses the impact that developers ' and users ' tacit understandings can have on digital-library development . it draws on three years of ethnographic-research with the digital water education library (dwel) that focused on the observation , collection , and analysis of the project 's face-to-face and electronic organizational-communication . the dwel project involved formal and informal educators in the development of its collection , and experienced problems at the start of the project with getting these educators to complete their cataloguing tasks . the research showed that despite having spent several days in face-to-face workshops , the project 's pis and the educators had different tacit understandings of what digital-libraries were , that were impeding the project 's organizational-communication and workflow . i describe how these differences were identified and analyzed , and subsequently addressed and mediated through the design and development of online-tools that acted as boundary-objects between the pis and the educators .
