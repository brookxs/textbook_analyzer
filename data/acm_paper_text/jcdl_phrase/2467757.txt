a figure search-engine-architecture for a chemistry digital-library academic-papers contain multiple figures representing important findings and experimental-results ; we present a search-engine specifically focused on figures in academic documents . this search-engine allows users to search on figures in approximately 150,000 chemistry journal-articles though the method is easily extendable to other domains . our system indexes figure caption and mentions extracted from the pdf in documents using a custom built extractor . recall and precision performance of extracted figures is in the 80 to 90 % range . we give the frame work for the extraction-algorithm , architecture and ranking-function .
