aggregating productivity indices for ranking researchers across multiple areas the impact of scientific-research has traditionally been quantified using productivity indices such as the well-known h-index . on the other hand , different research fields -- in fact , even different research areas within a single field -- may have very different publishing patterns , which may not be well described by a single , global index . in this paper , we argue that productivity indices should account for the singularities of the publication patterns of different research areas , in order to produce an unbiased assessment of the impact of scientific-research . inspired by ranking-aggregation approaches in distributed-information-retrieval , we propose a novel approach for ranking researchers across multiple research areas . our approach is generic and produces cross-area versions of any global productivity index , such as the volume of publications , citation count and even the h-index . our thorough evaluation considering multiple areas within the broad field of computer-science shows that our cross-area indices outperform their global counterparts when assessed against the official ranking produced by cnpq , the brazilian national research council for scientific and technological development . as a result , this paper contributes a valuable mechanism to support the decisions of funding bodies and research agencies , for example , in any research-assessment effort .
