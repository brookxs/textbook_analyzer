multi-modal classification in digital-news libraries this paper describes a comprehensive-approach to construct robust multi-modal video classification on a specific digital source , broadcast-news . broadcast-news has a very stable structure and every segment has its specific purpose . video-classification can support fundamental understanding of the structure of the video and the content . the variety of video-content makes it hard to classify ; however , it also provides multimodal-information our approach tries to solve two important issues of multimodal-classification . the first one is to select few discriminative-features from many raw features and the second one is to efficiently combine multiple sources . we applied fisher 's linear-discriminant (fld) for feature-selection and concatenated the projections into a single synthesized feature-vector as the combination strategy . experimental-results on the 2003 trecvid news-video archive show that our approach achieves very robust and accurate performance .
