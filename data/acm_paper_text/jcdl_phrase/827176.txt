how fast is too fast ? : evaluating fast-forward surrogates for digital-video to support effective-browsing , interfaces to digital-video-libraries should include video-surrogates (i.e. , smaller objects that can stand in for the videos in the collection , analogous to abstracts standing in for documents) . the current study investigated four variations (i.e. , speeds) of one form of video-surrogate : a fast-forward created by selecting every nth frame from the full video . in addition , it tested the validity of six measures of user-performance when interacting with video-surrogates . forty-five study participants interacted with all four versions of the fast-forward surrogate , and completed all six performance tasks with each . surrogate speed affected performance on four of the measures : object-recognition (graphical) , action-recognition , linguistic gist comprehension (full text) , and visual gist comprehension . based on these results , we recommend a fast-forward default speed of 1:64 of the original video-keyframes . in addition , users should control the choice of fast-forward speed to adjust for content characteristics and personal-preferences .
