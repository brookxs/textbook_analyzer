an architecture for the aggregation and analysis of scholarly usage-data although recording of usage-data is common in scholarly information services , its exploitation for the creation of value-added-services remains limited due to concerns regarding , among others , user-privacy , data validity , and the lack of accepted standards for the representation , sharing and aggregation of usage-data . this paper presents a technical , standards-based architecture for sharing usage information , which we have designed and implemented . in this architecture , openurl-compliant linking servers aggregate usage information of a specific user-community as it navigates the distributed-information-environment that it has access to . this usage information is made oai-pmh harvestable so that usage information exposed by many linking servers can be aggregated to facilitate the creation of value-added-services with a reach beyond that of a single community or a single information-service . this paper also discusses issues that were encountered when implementing the proposed approach , and it presents preliminary results obtained from analyzing a usage-data set containing about 3,500,000 requests aggregated by a federation of linking servers at the california state university system over a 20 month period .
