machine-learning for information architecture in a large governmental website this paper describes ongoing research into the application of machine-learning-techniques for improving access to governmental information in complex digital libraries . under the auspices of the govstat project , our goal is to identify a small number of semantically valid concepts that adequately spans the intellectual domain of a collection . the goal of this discovery is twofold . first we desire a practical aid for information architects . second , automatically derived document-concept relationships are a necessary precondition for real-world-deployment of many dynamic-interfaces . the current study compares concept-learning strategies based on three document representations : keywords , titles , and full-text . in statistical and user-based studies , human-created keywords provide significant improvements in concept-learning over both title-only and full-text representations .
