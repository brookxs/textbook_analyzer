social-network document-ranking in search-engines , ranking-algorithms measure the importance and relevance of documents mainly based on the contents and relationships between documents . user-attributes are usually not considered in ranking . this user-neutral approach , however , may not meet the diverse interests of users , who may demand different documents even with the same queries . to satisfy this need for more personalized-ranking , we propose a ranking framework . social-network document-rank (sndocrank) , that considers both document contents and the relationship between a searched and document owners in a social-network . this method combined the traditional tf-idf ranking for document contents with out multi-level actor similarity (mas) algorithm to measure to what extent document owners and the searcher are structurally similar in a social-network . we implemented our ranking-method in simulated video social network based on data extracted from youtube and tested its effectiveness on video-search . the results show that compared with the traditional ranking-method like tf-idfs the sndocrank algorithm returns more relevant documents . more specifically , a searcher can get significantly better results be being in a larger social-network , having more friends , and being associated with larger local communities in a social-network .
