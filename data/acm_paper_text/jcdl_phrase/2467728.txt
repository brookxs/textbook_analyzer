instrument distribution and music-notation search for enhancing bibliographic music score retrieval because of the unique characteristics of music-scores , searching bibliographical music collections using traditional library systems can be a challenge . in this paper , we present two specific search functionalities added to the swiss rism data-base and describe how they improve the user-experience . the first is a search functionality for instrument and vocal part distribution that leverages coded information available in the marcxml records of the database . it enables scores for precise ensemble distribution to be retrieved . the second is a search functionality of music-notation excerpts transcribed from the beginning of the pieces , known as music incipits . the incipit search is achieved using a well-known music-information-retrieval (mir) tool , themefinder . a novelty of our implementation is that it can operate at three different levels (pitch , duration and metric) , singularly or combined , and that it is performed through a specifically-developed intuitive graphical-interface for note input and parameter-selection . the two additions illustrate why it is important to take into consideration the particularities of music-scores when designing a search-system and how mir tools can be beneficially integrated into existing heterogeneous bibliographic score collections .
