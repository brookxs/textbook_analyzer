sentiment-based search in digital-libraries several researchers have developed tools for classifying / clustering web-search-results into different topic areas (such as sports , movies , travel , etc.) , and to help users identify relevant results quickly in the area-of-interest . this study follows a similar approach , but is in the area of sentiment-classification -- automatically classifying on-line review documents according to the overall sentiment expressed in them . this paper presents a prototype-system that has been developed to perform sentiment categorization of web-search-results . it assists users to quickly focus on recommended (or non-recommended) information by classifying web-search-results into four categories : positive , negative , neutral , and non-review documents , by using an automatic classifier based on a supervised-machine-learning algorithm , support-vector-machine (svm) .
