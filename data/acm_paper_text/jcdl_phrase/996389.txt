digital-libraries and educational practice : a case for new models educational-digital-libraries can benefit from theoretical and methodological approaches that enable lessons-learned from design-and-evaluation projects performed in one particular setting to be applied to other settings within the library network . three promising advances in design-theory are reviewed - reference tasks , design-experiments , and design-genres . each approach advocates the creation of ` intermediate ' constructs as vehicles for knowledge-building and knowledge-sharing across design and research projects . one purpose of an intermediate construct is to formulate finer-grained models that describe and explain the relationship between key design-features and the cognitive and social-dimensions of the context-of-use . three models are proposed and used as thought experiments to analyze the utility of these approaches to educational-digital-library design-and-evaluation : digital-libraries as cognitive-tools , component-repositories , and knowledge-networks .
