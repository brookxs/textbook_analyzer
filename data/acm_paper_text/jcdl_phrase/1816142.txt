spatiotemporal mapping of wikipedia concepts space and time are important dimensions in the representation of a large number of concepts . however there exists no available resource that provides spatiotemporal mappings of generic concepts . here we present a link-analysis_based method for extracting the main locations and periods associated to all wikipedia concepts . relevant locations are selected from a set of geotagged articles , while relevant periods are discovered using a list of people with associated life periods . we analyze article versions over multiple languages and consider the strength of a spatial/temporal reference to be proportional to the number of languages in which it appears . to illustrate the utility of the spatiotemporal mapping of wikipedia concepts , we present an analysis of cultural-interactions and a temporal-analysis of two domains . the wikipedia mapping can also be used to perform rich spatiotemporal document-indexing by extracting implicit spatial and temporal references from texts .
