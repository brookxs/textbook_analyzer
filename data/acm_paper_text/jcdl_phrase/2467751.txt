arclink : optimization-techniques to build and retrieve the temporal web graph we present arclink , a proof-of-concept system that complements open-source wayback-machine installations by optimizing the construction , storage , and access to the temporal web graph . we divide the-web graph-construction into four stages (filtering , extraction , storage , and access) and explore optimization for each stage . arclink extends the current web archive interfaces to return content and structural-metadata for each uri .
