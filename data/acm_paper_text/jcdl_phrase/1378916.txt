harvana : harvesting community tags to enrich collection metadata collaborative , social-tagging and annotation systems have exploded on the internet as part of the-web 2.0 phenomenon . systems such as flickr , del.icio.us , technorati , connotea and librarything , provide a community-driven approach to classifying information and resources on the web , so that they can be browsed , discovered and re-used . although social-tagging sites provide simple , user-relevant tags , there are issues associated with the quality of the metadata and the scalability compared with conventional indexing-systems . in this paper we propose a hybrid-approach that enables authoritative metadata generated by traditional cataloguing methods to be merged with community annotations and tags . the harvana (harvesting and aggregating networked annotations) system uses a standardized but extensible rdf model for representing the annotations/tags and oai-pmh to harvest the annotations/tags from distributed-community servers . the harvested annotations are aggregated with the authoritative metadata in a centralized metadata store . this streamlined , interoperable , scalable approach enables libraries , archives and repositories to leverage community enthusiasm for tagging and annotation , augment their metadata and enhance their discovery-services . this paper describes the harvana system and its evaluation through a collaborative testbed with the national library of australia using architectural images from pictureaustralia .
