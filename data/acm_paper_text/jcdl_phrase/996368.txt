a query-interface for an event gazetteer we introduce an event gazetteer which stores and presents `` locations in time '' . each event is coded with attributes of event type , location , actor , and beginning and ending times . events can also contain sets of other events . this paper reports the development of an-interface for generating searches to these `` part-of '' relationships . for instance , we can search for all named battles in the event database which occurred during the civil war . ultimately , we envision a flexible , broad-based service that is a resource for users ranging from students to genealogists and researchers interested in historical events .
