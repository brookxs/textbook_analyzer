tagging of name records for genealogical data-browsing in this paper we present a method of parsing unstructured textual records briefly describing a person and their direct relatives , which we use in the construction of a browsing tool for genealogical data . the records have been created by researchers who are currently digitising a collection of historical archives stored at the abbaye de saint-maurice , switzerland . the string ` beatrix , daughter of johannes trona , of saillon ' is a typical example of a record . we wish to annotate every term (word and symbol) in our records with a label which describes whether the term is a name (e.g. ` beatrix ') , a place (e.g. ` saillon ') , or a relationship (e.g. ` daughter ') . using this information , we are able to derive both a canonical-form for each name (e.g. ` beatrix trona ') , and the relationships between people . we build upon work developed for the cleaning and standardization of names for record-linkage corpora , adding several enhancements to deal with our more difficult data , which contains common name structures of french , italian and latin , over hundreds of years . we present an approach to this problem that works interactively with a user to annotate the data-set accurately , greatly reducing the human effort required . we do this by learning a hidden-markov-model representing a record structure , and finding structural patterns in new records . finally , we present a brief overview of a tool we are developing to help genealogical researchers browse and search the data .
