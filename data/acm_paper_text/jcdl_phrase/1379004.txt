early returns on an institutional-repository : an exploration of the validity and functionality of pocketknowledge this poster presentation will reflect qualitatively on the challenges and opportunities of pocketknowledge (http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php) as an institutional-repository . the main question explored is whether such repositories are best understood as new competitors in the academic-publishing world or as on-going documentations of the larger intellectual life of the institution . the early experience of one such repository , pocketknowledge - a social-archive developed and implemented by edlab , a research unit of the gottesman libraries , teachers college columbia university - reveals that users are motivated not only to participate in an institutional-repository , but also to document their intellectual life understood more broadly than publication . this suggests that the latter understanding of an institutional-repository is a more reasonable , incremental expectation in what is surely an uphill battle against the long-established prestige of publishing in printed academic-journals , and that institutional-repositories such as pocketknowledge should consider the strategic addition of functionalities that can highlight the intellectual life of the institution , not simply the intellectual production of its members .
