the dspace repository : can multiple institutions live in one space ? a different approach in late 2006 , nitle launched a pilot program for managed institutional-repository services designed for smaller colleges-and-universities and the non-profit-organizations that serve them . twenty-six participating institutions helped pioneer this pilot effort , which laid the foundation for the development of production-level dspace services . these dspace services allowed campuses to start and grow their digital-repositories with a minimal level of investment , with no hardware to purchase and very little application-support expertise to develop . campuses were able to focus on the work of building digital-repositories within the context of a-community of campuses sharing ideas and best-practices . lessons-learned and next steps will be discussed .
