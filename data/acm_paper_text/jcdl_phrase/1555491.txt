toward automatic-generation of image-text document surrogates to optimize cognition the representation of information collections needs to be optimized for human-cognition . growing information collections play a crucial role in human experiences . while documents often include rich visual-components , collections , including personal-collections and those generated by search-engines , are typically represented lists of text-only surrogates . by concurrently invoking complementary components of human-cognition , combined image-text surrogates help people to more effectively see , understand , think about , and remember information collection . this research develops algorithmic methods that use the structural context of images in html-documents to associate meaningful-text and thus derive combined image-text surrogates .
