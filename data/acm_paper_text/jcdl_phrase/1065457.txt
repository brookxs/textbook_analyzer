resolving the unencoded character problem for chinese digital-libraries constructing a chinese digital-library , especially for a historical article archiving , is often bothered by the small character-sets supported by the current computer-systems . this paper is aimed at resolving the unencoded character problem with a practical and composite approach for chinese digital-libraries . the proposed approach consists of the glyph-expression model , the glyph structure database , and supporting-tools . with this approach , the following problems can be resolved . first , the extensibility of chinese-characters can be preserved . second , it would be as easy to generate , input , display , and search unencoded characters as existing ones . third , it is compatible with existing encoding-schemes that most computers use.this approach has been utilized by organizations and projects in various application-domains including archeology , linguistics , ancient texts , calligraphy and paintings , and stone and bronze rubbings . for example , in academia sinica , a very-large full-text database of ancient texts called scripta sinica has been created using this approach . the union catalog of national digital archives project (ndap) dealt with the unencoded characters encountered when merging the metadata of 12 different thematic domains from various organizations . also , in bronze inscriptions research team (birt) of academia sinica , 3,459 bronze inscriptions were added , which is very helpful to the education and research in historic linguistics .
