the fused library : integrating digital and physical libraries with location-aware sensors this paper reports an investigation into the connection of the workspace of physical libraries with digital-library services . using simple sensor-technology , we provide focused access to digital-resources on the basis of the user 's physical-context , including the topic of the stacks they are next to , and the content of books on their reading desks . our research developed the technological infrastructure to support this fused interaction , investigated current patron behavior in physical libraries , and evaluated our system in a user-centred pilot-study . the outcome of this research demonstrates the potential utility of the fused library , and provides a starting point for future exploitation .
