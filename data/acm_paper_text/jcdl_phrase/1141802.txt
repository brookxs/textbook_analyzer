a comprehensive comparison-study of document-clustering for a biomedical digital-library medline document-clustering has been used for better document-retrieval , document-browsing , and text-mining in digital-library . in this paper , we perform a comprehensive comparison-study of various document-clustering approaches such as three hierarchical methods (single-link , complete-link , and complete link) , bisecting k-means , k-means , and suffix-tree clustering in terms of the efficiency , the effectiveness , and the scalability . in addition , we apply a domain-ontology to document-clustering to investigate if the ontology such as mesh improves clustering qualify for medline articles . because an ontology is a formal , explicit specification of a shared conceptualization for a domain of interest , the use of ontologies is a natural way to solve traditional information-retrieval problems such as synonym/hypernym / hyponym problems . we conducted fairly extensive experiments based on different evaluation-metrics such as misclassification index , f-measure , cluster purity , and entropy on very-large article sets from medline , the largest biomedical digital-library in biomedicine .
