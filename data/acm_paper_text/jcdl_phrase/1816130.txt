effective self-training author-name-disambiguation in scholarly digital libraries name-ambiguity in the context of bibliographic-citation records is a hard problem that affects the quality-of-services and content in digital-libraries and similar systems . supervised methods that exploit training-examples in order to distinguish ambiguous author-names are among the most effective solutions for the problem , but they require skilled human-annotators in a laborious and continuous process of manually labeling citations in order to provide enough training-examples . thus , addressing the issues of (i) automatic acquisition of examples and (ii) highly effective disambiguation even when only few examples are available , are the need of the hour for such systems . in this paper , we propose a novel two-step disambiguation-method , sand (self-training associative name disambiguator) , that deals with these two issues . the first step eliminates the need of any manual labeling effort by automatically acquiring examples using a clustering-method that groups citation records based on the similarity among coauthor names . the second step uses a supervised-disambiguation method that is able to detect unseen authors not included in any of the given training-examples . experiments conducted with standard public collections , using the minimum set of attributes present in a citation (i.e. , author-names , work title and publication-venue) , demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms representative unsupervised-disambiguation methods that exploit similarities between citation records and is as effective as , and in some cases superior to , supervised ones , without manually labeling any training-example .
