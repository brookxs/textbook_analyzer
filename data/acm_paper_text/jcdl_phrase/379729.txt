cost-driven design for archival repositories designing an archival repository is a complex task because there are many alternative configurations , each with different reliability levels and costs . in this paper we study the costs involved in an archival repository and we introduce a design-framework for evaluating alternatives and choosing the best configuration in terms of reliability and cost . we also present a new version of our simulation-tool , archsim/c that aids in the decision-process . the design framework and the usage of archsim/c are illustrated with a case-study of a hypothetical (yet realistic) archival repository shared between two universities .
