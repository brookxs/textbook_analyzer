a hybrid two-stage approach for discipline-independent canonical-representation extraction from references in education and research , references play a key role . however , extracting and parsing references are difficult problems . one concern is that there are many styles of references ; hence , given a surface-form , identifying what style was employed is problematic , especially in heterogeneous collections of theses and dissertations , which cover many fields and disciplines , and where different styles may be used even in the same publication . we address these problems by drawing upon suitable knowledge found in the www . in particular , we research a two-stage classifier approach , involving multi-class-classification with respect to reference styles , and partially solve the problem of parsing surface-representations of references . we describe empirical evidence for the effectiveness of our approach and plans for improvement of our methods .
