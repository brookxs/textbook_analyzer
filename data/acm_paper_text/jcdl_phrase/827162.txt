acquisition , representation , query and analysis of spatial-data : a demonstration 3d digital library the increasing power of techniques to model complex geometry and extract meaning from 3d information create complex-data that must be described , stored , and displayed to be useful to researchers . responding to the limitations of two-dimensional (2d) data-representations perceived by discipline scientists , the partnership for research in spatial-modeling (prism) project at arizona-state-university (asu) developed modeling and analytic-tools that raise the level of abstraction and add semantic-value to 3d-data . the goals are to improve scientific-communication , and to assist in generating new knowledge , particularly for natural objects whose asymmetry limit study using 2d representations . the tools simplify analysis of surface and volume using curvature and topology to help researchers understand and interact with 3d-data . the tools produced automatically extract information about features and regions-of-interest to researchers , calculate quantifiable , replicable metric-data , and generate metadata about the object being studied . to help researchers interact with the information , the project developed prototype interactive , sketch-based-interfaces that permit researchers to remotely search , identify and interact with the detailed , highly accurate 3d-models of the objects . the results support comparative-analysis of contextual and spatial-information , and extend research about asymmetric manmade and natural objects .
