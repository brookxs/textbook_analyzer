warcreate : create wayback-consumable warc files from any webpage the-internet archive 's wayback-machine is the most common way that typical users interact with web-archives . the-internet archive uses the heritrix web-crawler to transform pages on the publicly available web into web-archive (warc) files , which can then be accessed using the wayback-machine . because heritrix can only access the publicly available web , many personal pages (e.g. password-protected pages , social-media pages) can not be easily archived into the standard warc format . we have created a google chrome extension , warcreate , that allows a user to create a warc file from any webpage . using this tool , content that might have been otherwise lost in time can be archived in a-standard-format by any user . this tool provides a way for casual users to easily create archives of personal online-content . this is one of the first steps in resolving issues of `` long-term storage , maintenance , and access of personal digital assets that have emotional , intellectual , and historical value to individuals '' .
