annotating illuminated-manuscripts : an effective tool for research and education the aim of this paper is to report the research results of an ongoing project that deals with the exploitation of a-digital archive of drawings and illustrations of historic-documents for research and educational purposes . according to the results on a study of user-requirements , we have designed tools to provide researchers with innovative ways for accessing the digital manuscripts , sharing , and transferring knowledge in a collaborative-environment . we have found that the results of scientific-research on the relationships between images of manuscripts produced over the centuries can be rendered explicit by using annotations . for this purpose , a taxonomy for linking annotation is introduced , together with a conceptual-schema which represents annotations and links them to digital-objects .
