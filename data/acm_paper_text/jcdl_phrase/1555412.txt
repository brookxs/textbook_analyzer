cebbip : a parser of bibliographic-information in chinese electronic books bibliographic-information is essential for many digital-library-applications , such as citation-analysis , academic searching and topic-discovery . and bibliographic-data extraction has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years . in this paper , we address the problem of automatic-extraction of bibliographic-data in chinese-electronic-book and propose a tool called cebbip * for the task , which includes three main systems : data-preprocessing , data parsing and data postprocessing . in the data-preprocessing system , the tool adopts a rules-based method to locate citation data in a book and to segment citation data into citation strings of individual referencing literature . and a learning-based approach , conditional-random-fields (crf) , is employed to parse citation strings in the data parsing-system . finally , the tool takes advantage of document intrinsic local format consistency to enhance citation data-segmentation and parsing through clustering-techniques . cebbip has been used in a commercial e-book production-system . experimental-results show that cebbip 's precision rate is very high . more specially , adopting the document intrinsic local format consistency obviously improves the citation data segmenting and parsing-accuracy .
