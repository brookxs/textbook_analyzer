is it time to change the oer repositories role ? the growing number of digital-libraries providing open-educational-resources (oer) requires effective resource-discovery mechanisms to optimally exploit the benefits of their openness . this paper discusses the oer repositories role and presents a study aimed at understanding how educators find oer by seeking answers to questions such as : what proportion of users seeking oer go directly to oer repositories and what proportion uses search-engines or some other means and why . understanding how and with what tools users discover and access resources can have an impact on the oer repositories strategic development .
