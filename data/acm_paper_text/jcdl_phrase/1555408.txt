disambiguating authors in academic publications using random-forests users of digital-libraries usually want to know the exact author or authors of an article . but different authors may share the same names , either as full names or as initials and last names (complete name change examples are not considered here) . in such a case , the user would like the digital library to differentiate among these authors . name-disambiguation can help in many cases ; one being a user in a search of all articles written by a particular author . disambiguation also enables better bibliometric-analysis by allowing a more accurate counting and grouping of publications and citations . in this paper , we describe an algorithm for pair-wise disambiguation of author-names based on a machine-learning-classification algorithm , random-forests . we define a set of similarity profile features to assist in author-disambiguation . our experiments on the medline database show that the random-forest model outperforms other previously proposed techniques such as those using support-vector machines (svm) . in addition , we demonstrate that the variable-importance produced by the random-forest model can be used in feature-selection with little degradation in the disambiguation accuracy . in particular , the inverse-document-frequency of author last name and the middle name 's similarity alone achieves an accuracy of almost 90 \ % .
