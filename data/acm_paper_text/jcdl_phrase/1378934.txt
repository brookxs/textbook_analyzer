user-assisted ink-bleed correction for handwritten-documents we describe a user-assisted framework for correcting ink-bleed in old handwritten-documents housed at the national archives of singapore (nas) . our approach departs from traditional correction techniques that strive for full automation . fully-automated approaches make assumptions about ink-bleed characteristics that are not valid for all inputs . furthermore , fully-automated approaches often have to set algorithmic parameters that have no meaning for the end-user . in our system , the user-needs only to provide simple examples of ink-bleed , foreground ink , and background . these training-examples are used to classify the remaining pixels in the document to produce a computer-generated result that is equal to or better than existing fully-automated approaches . to offer a complete system , we also provide tools that allow any errors in the computer-generated results to be quickly `` cleaned up '' by the user . the initial training markup , together with the computer-generated results , and manual edits are all recorded with the final output , allowing subsequent viewers to see how a corrected document was created and to make changes or updates . while an ongoing project , our feedback from the nas staff has been overwhelmingly positive that this user-assisted framework is a practical way to address the ink-bleed problem .
