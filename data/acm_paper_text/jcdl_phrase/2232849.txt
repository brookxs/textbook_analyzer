similar researcher search in academic-environments entity-search is an emerging ir and nlp-task that involves the retrieval of entities of a specific type in response to a query . we address the similar researcher search '' or the `` researcher recommendation '' problem , an instance of similar entity-search '' for the academic domain . in response to a researcher name ' query , the goal of a researcher recommender-system is to output the list of researchers that have similar expertise as that of the queried researcher . we propose models for computing similarity between researchers based on expertise profiles extracted from their publications and academic homepages . we provide results of our models for the recommendation task on two publicly-available datasets . to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to address content-based researcher recommendation in an academic setting and demonstrate it for computer-science via our system , scholarsearch .
