transforming japanese archives into accessible digital-books digitized physical books offer access to tremendous amounts of knowledge , even for people with print-related disabilities . various projects and standard activities are underway to make all of our past and present books accessible . however digitizing books requires extensive human efforts such as correcting the results of ocr (optical-character-recognition) and adding structural-information such as headings . some asian-languages need extra efforts for the ocr-errors because of their many and varied character-sets . japanese has used more than 10,000 characters compared with a few hundred in english . this heavy workload is inhibiting the creation of accessible digital-books . to facilitate digitization , we are developing a new system for processing physical books . we reduce and disperse the human efforts and accelerate conversions by combining automatic-inference and human capabilities . our system preserves the original page images for the entire digitization process to support gradual refinement and distributes the work as micro-tasks . we conducted trials with the japanese national diet library (ndl) to evaluate the required effort for digitizing books with a variety of layouts and years of publication . the results showed old japanese books had specific problems when correcting the ocr-errors and adding structures . drawing on our results , we discuss further workload reductions and future-directions for international digitization systems .
