content access characterization in digital-libraries to support non-trivial clients , such as data-exploration and analysis environments , digital-libraries must be able to describe the access modes that their contents support . we present a simple scheme that distinguishes four content-accessibility classes : download (byte-stream retrieval) , service (api) , web-interface (interactive) , and offline . these access modes may recursively nest in alternative (semantically equivalent) or multipart (component) hierarchies . this scheme is simple enough to be easily supported by dl content-providers , yet rich enough to allow programmatic clients to automatically identify appropriate access-point (s) .
