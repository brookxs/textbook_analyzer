collaborative classifier agents : studying the impact of learning in distributed document-classification we developed a multi-agent framework where agents had limited/distributed knowledge for document-classification and collaborated with each other to overcome the knowledge distribution . each agent was equipped with a certain learning-algorithm for predicting potential collaborators , or helping agents . we conducted experimental-research on a standard news-corpus to examine the impact of two learning-algorithms : pursuit learning and nearest centroid learning . for a fundamental retrieval operation , namely classification , both algorithms achieved competitive classification effectiveness and efficiency . subsequently , the impact of the learning exploration rate and the maximum collaboration range on classification effectiveness and efficiency were examined . close investigation of agent-learning dynamics revealed increasing and stabilizing patterns that were enhanced by the learning-algorithms .
