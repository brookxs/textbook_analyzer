cross-disciplinary molecular science-education in introductory-science-courses : an nsdl matdl collection this paper discusses a-digital library designed to help undergraduate-students draw connections across disciplines , beginning with introductory discipline-specific science courses (including chemistry , materials-science , and biophysics) . the collection serves as the basis for a design-experiment for interdisciplinary educational libraries and is discussed in terms of the three models proposed by sumner and marlino . as a cognitive-tool , the library is organized around recurring patterns in molecular science , with one such pattern being developed for this initial design-experiment . as a component repository , the library-resources support learning of these patterns and how they appear in different disciplines . as a knowledge-network , the library integrates design with use and assessment .
