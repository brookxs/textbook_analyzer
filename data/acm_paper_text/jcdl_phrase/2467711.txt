identification of useful user-comments in social-media : a case-study on flickr commons cultural-institutions are increasingly opening up their repositories and contribute digital-objects to social-media platforms such as flickr . in return they often receive user-comments containing information that could be incorporated in their catalog records . since judging the usefulness of a large number of user-comments is a labor-intensive task , our aim is to provide automated-support for filtering potentially useful social-media comments on digital-objects . in this paper , we discuss the notion of usefulness in the context of social-media comments and compare it from end-users as well as expertusers perspectives . then we present a machine-learning approach to automatically classify comments according to their usefulness . our approach makes use of syntactic and semantic comment features and also considers user-context . we present the results of an experiment we did on user-comments received in six different flickr commons collections . they show that a few relatively straightforward features can be used to infer useful comments with up to 89 % accuracy .
