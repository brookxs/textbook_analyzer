the interactive shared educational environment : user-interface , system-architecture and field-study the user-interface and system-architecture of a novel interactive shared educational environment (isee) are presented . based on a lightweight infrastructure , isee enables relatively low-bandwidth network users to share videos as well as text-messages . smartlink is a new concept introduced in this paper . individual-information presentation components , like the video-player and text-chat room , are `` smartly '' linked together through video timestamps and hyperlinks . a field-study related to children book selections using isee was conducted . the results indicated that the combination of three information-presentation components , including video-player with storyboard , shared browser , and text-chat room , provided an effective and more comfortable collaboration-and-learning-environment for the given tasks than text reviews or text-chat alone or in combination . the video-player was the most preferred information component . text comments in the chat room that did not synchronize with the video-content distracted some participants due to limited cognitive capacity . using smartlink to synchronize various information components or `` channels '' is our attempt to reduce the user 's working-memory-load in information enriched distance-learning environments made possible by digital-libraries .
