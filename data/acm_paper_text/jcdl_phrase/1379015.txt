automatic-extraction of morphological-information from botanical-collections specific morphological-information is often used by users to search botanical-collections . however , traditional systems based on statistical-models are often not effective for such search . this study automatically extracts morphological-information from botanical-collections using an adapted and enhanced information-extraction-system . experimental-results indicate this approach is promising . this study also indicates that this approach is generalizable to similar collections in the same domain and even to different domains with adaptation of the pattern-recognition and knowledge-base in the new domain .
