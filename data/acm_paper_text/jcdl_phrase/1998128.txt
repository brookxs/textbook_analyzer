world vs. method : educational standard formulation impacts document-retrieval although initiatives are underway in the educational-community to consolidate disparate collections of educational-standards , little has been done to explore the impact of educational standard formulation on information-retrieval . recent research contrasts two categories of educational-standards : ` world ' (topical domain-related concepts) and ` method ' (investigative and epistemological principles) . this paper explores the information-retrieval implications of the world vs. method distinction . we find that experts are more likely to agree about which educational-resources align with a method standard but that a typical automatic standard-assignment tool is more likely to assign a world standard to an educational resource . further , a text-based-information-retrieval system is more likely to be accurate in retrieving documents relevant to a world standard as compared to a method standard . these findings have implications both for educational standard formulation (combining world and method-components in a standard may improve retrieval) and for digital-library builders who want to help teachers identify useful , standards-aligned learning-objects .
