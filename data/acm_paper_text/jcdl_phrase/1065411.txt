integrating digital-libraries and electronic publishing in the dart project the digital anthropology resources for teaching (dart) project integrates the content-acquisition and cataloging initiatives of a federated digital repository with the development of scholarly-publications and the creation of digital-tools to facilitate classroom teaching . the project 's technical architecture and unique publishing model create a teaching context where students move easily between primary and secondary source material and between authored environments and independent research , and raise specific issues with regard to metadata , object referral , rights , and exporting content . the model also addresses the loss of provenance and catalog information for digital-objects embedded in `` born-digital '' publications . the dart project presents a practical methodology to combine repository and publication that is both exportable and discipline-neutral .
