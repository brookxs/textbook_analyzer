formal-foundations for systematic digital-library generation many digital-library-design , development , and deployment processes are not based on systematic generation activities . the utilization of generation processes enables the precise definition of digital-libraries , identification of existing software-components , co-generation of multiple digital-libraries , and evaluation of a-digital library 's coverage and completeness . the foundation of a-digital library-generation process is in the formal-framework in which it is described . two notable formal frameworks have previously been proposed for describing digital-libraries and their content , architecture , functionality , and related societies . these two frameworks are merged in this effort to provide the foundation for a generation-framework in support of an emerging class of scientific digital-libraries .
