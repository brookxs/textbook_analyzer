workshop 1 : visual-interfaces to digital-libraries - its past , present , and future the design of easy-to-use and informative visual-interfaces to digital-libraries is an integral part to the advances of digital-libraries . a wide range of approaches have been developed from a diverse spectrum of perspectives that focus on users and tasks to be supported , data to be modeled , and the efficiency of algorithms . information-visualization aims to exploit the human visual information-processing system , especially with non-spatial data (such as documents and images typically found in digital-libraries) . generally , information-visualization examines semantic-relationships intrinsic to an abstract information-space and how they can be spatially navigated and memorized using similar cognitive-processes to those that would apply during interactions with the real-world . this workshop promotes the convergence of information-visualization and digital-libraries . it brings together researchers and practitioners in the areas of information-visualization , digital-libraries , human-computer-interaction , library-and-information-science , and computer-science to identify the most important issues in the past and the present , and what should be done in the future .
