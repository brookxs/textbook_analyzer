perception-oriented online-news extraction a novel online-news extraction approach based on human-perception is presented in this paper . the approach simulates how a human perceives and identifies online-news content . it first detects news areas based on content-function , space continuity , and formatting continuity of news information . it further identifies detailed news content-based on the position , format , and semantic of detected news areas . experiment results show that our approach achieves much better performance (in average more than 99 \ % in terms of f1 value) compared to previous approaches such as tree-edit-distance and visual wrapper_based approaches . furthermore , our approach does not assume the existence of web templates in the tested web-pages as required by tree-edit-distance_based approach , nor does it need training-sets as required in visual wrapper_based approach . the success of our approach demonstrates the strength of the perception-oriented web-information-extraction methodology and represents a promising approach for automatic-information-extraction from sources with presentation-design for humans .
