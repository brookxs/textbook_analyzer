a semi-automated digital-preservation system based on semantic-web-services this paper describes a web-services-based system which we have developed to enable organizations to semi-automatically preserve their digital-collections by dynamically discovering and invoking the most appropriate preservation service , as it is required . by periodically comparing preservation metadata for digital-objects in a collection with a software version registry , potential object obsolescence can be detected and a notification-message sent to the relevant agent . by making preservation software-modules available as web-services and describing them semantically using a machine-processable ontology (owl-s) , the most appropriate preservation service (s) for each object can then be automatically discovered , composed and invoked by software-agents (with optional human input at critical decision-making steps) . we believe that this approach represents a significant advance towards providing a viable , cost-effective solution to the long term preservation of large-scale collections of digital-objects .
