assembling and enriching digital-library-collections people who create digital-libraries need to gather together the raw material , add metadata as necessary , and design and build new collections . this paper sets out the requirements for these tasks and describes a new tool that supports them interactively , making it easy for users to create their own collections from electronic files of all types . the process involves selecting documents for inclusion , coming up with a suitable metadata set , assigning metadata to each document or group of documents , designing the form of the collection in terms of document-formats , searchable indexes , and browsing facilities , building the necessary indexes and data-structures , and putting the collection in place for others to use . moreover , different situations require different workflows , and the system must be flexible enough to cope with these demands . although the tool is specific to the greenstone-digital-library-software , the underlying ideas should prove useful in more general contexts .
