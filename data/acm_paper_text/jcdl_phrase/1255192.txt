slideseer : a-digital library of aligned-document and presentation pairs research findings are often transmitted both as written documents and narrated slide-presentations . as these two forms of media contain both unique and replicated information , it is useful to combine and align these two views to create a single synchronized medium . we introduce slideseer , a-digital library that discovers , aligns and presents such presentation and document pairs . we discuss the three major system-components of the slideseer dl : 1) the resource-discovery , 2) the fine-grained-alignment and 3) the user-interface . for resource-discovery , we have bootstrapped our collection-building process using metadata from dblp and citeseer . for alignment , we modify maximum-similarity alignment to favor monotonic alignments and incorporate a classifier to handle slides which should not be aligned . for the user-interface , we allow the user to seamlessly switch between four carefully motivated views of the resulting synchronized-media pairs .
