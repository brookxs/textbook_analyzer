towards a virtual-organization for data cyberinfrastructure we report on the exploratory stages of multi-university , multi-research-site , multi-year effort to investigate and compare data-practices in multiple cyberinfrastructure projects and their emerging virtual-organizations . our long-term goal is to understand the data-practices and data-management requirements of virtual-organizations and their implications for the design and development of data digital-libraries . we have constructed our own virtual-organization as a participant-observer approach to the research . results to date suggest that collaborative-technologies are emergent and that defining and scoping the data products of collaborations continues to be problematic .
