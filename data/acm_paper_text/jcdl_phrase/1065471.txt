a signal/semantic framework for image-retrieval this poster presents an approach for integrating perceptual signal features (i.e. color and texture) and semantic-information within an integrated-architecture for image-retrieval . it relies on an expressive knowledge-representation formalism handling high-level image-descriptions and a full-text query framework . it consequently brings the level of image-retrieval closer to users ' needs by translating low-level signal features to high-level data and coupling it with semantics within index and query structures .
