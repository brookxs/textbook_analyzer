name-disambiguation in author citations using a k-way spectral-clustering method an author may have multiple names and multiple authors may share the same name simply due to name abbreviations , identical names , or name misspellings in publications or bibliographies 1 . this can produce name-ambiguity which can affect the performance of document-retrieval , web-search , and database-integration , and may cause improper attribution of credit . proposed here is an unsupervised-learning approach using k - way spectral-clustering that disambiguates authors in citations . the approach utilizes three types of citation attributes : co-author names , paper titles , and publication-venue titles 2 . the approach is illustrated with 16 name datasets with citations collected from the dblp database bibliography and author home-pages and shows that name-disambiguation can be achieved using these citation attributes .
