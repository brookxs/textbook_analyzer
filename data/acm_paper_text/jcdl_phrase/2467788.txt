greenbug : a hybrid web-inspector , debugger and design editor for greenstone in this paper we present greenbug : a hybrid web inspector , debugger and design editor developed for use with the open-source digital-library software greenstone 3 . inspired by the-web development-tool firebug , greenbug is more tightly-coupled with the underlying (digital-library) server than that provided by firebug ; for example , greenbug has a fine-grained knowledge of the connection between the underlying file-system and the rendered web-content , and also provides the ability to commit any changes made through the-web interface back to the underlying file-system . moreover , because web-page production in greenstone 3 is the result of an xslt processing-pipeline , the necessarily well-formed hierarchical xml content can be manipulated into a graphical-representation , which can then be manipulated directly through a visual-interface supplied by greenbug . we showcase the interface in use , provide a brief overview of implementation details , and conclude with a discussion on how the approach can be adapted to other xslt transformation-based content-management-systems , such as dspace .
