how to turn the page can digital-libraries provide a reading-experience that more closely resembles a real book than a scrolled or paginated electronic display ? this paper describes a prototype page-turning system that realistically animates full three-dimensional page-turns . the dynamic-behavior is generated by a mass-spring-model defined on a rectangular grid of particles . the prototype takes a pdf or e-book file , renders it into a sequence of png images representing individual pages , and animates the pageturns under user-control . the simulation behaves fairly naturally , although more computer-graphics work is required to perfect it .
