dynamically generating conceptual browsing interfaces for digital-libraries a system is described that supports the dynamic-generation of conceptual browsing interfaces . these interfaces are comprised of interacting visual-components that contain different views onto a concept-space that can be modeled as nodes and links . this algorithm uses a combined approach of tree -- based processing with a grid -- based drawing-system to automatically generate the visual-components . this algorithm is part of a larger digital-library service , the nsdl strand map service , which aims to provide educators and learners with conceptual browsing interfaces that help them to locate and use learning-resources in educational-digital-libraries .
