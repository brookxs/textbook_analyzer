processtron : efficient semi-automated markup generation for scientific documents digitizing legacy documents and marking them up with xml is important for many scientific domains . however , creating comprehensive semantic-markup of high quality is challenging . respective processes consist of many steps , with automated markup generation and intermediate manual correction . these corrections are extremely laborious . to reduce this effort , this paper makes two contributions : first , it proposes processtron , a lightweight markup-process-control mechanism . processtron assists users in two ways : it ensures that the steps are executed in the appropriate order , and it points the user to possible errors during manual correction . second , processtron has been deployed in real-world-projects , and this paper reports on our experiences . a core observation is that processtron more than halves the time users need to mark up a document . results from laboratory-experiments , which we have conducted as well , confirm this finding .
