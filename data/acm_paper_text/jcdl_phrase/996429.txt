ontology-acquisition and semantic-retrieval from semantic annotated chinese poetry this research aims to utilize semantic-web [1] . technology to the semantic annotation of classical chinese poetry . we investigate the feasibilities and advantages of semantic-retrieval and automated ontology acquisition from semantically annotated poems based on a chinese thesaurus . we have induced a set of semantic-composition rules for pair-wise character (word) patterns that can be used to parse the poem sentences and recursively generate rdf [2] . triple relations among the pair of characters (words) . we have also defined a scoring-scheme to assess semantic-similarity for semantic-retrieval . we showed that the semantic retrieval-method significantly outperformed the keyword-based-retrieval method .
