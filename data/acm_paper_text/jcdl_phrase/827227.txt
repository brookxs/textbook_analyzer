contribution and collaboration strategies for the national-science-digital-library (nsdl.org) : investigating technological solutions to facilitate social evolution of a collaborative-infrastructure the nsdl community consists of large , discipline diverse , and decentralized user-groups made up of collaborator communities who create , aggregate , and contribute digital-resources to the nsdl . nsdl core integration provides `` wholesale '' services to nsdl collaborator communities who may `` retail '' those services through their own portals , perhaps packaged with additional-content selected to meet their specialized users ' needs . nsdl `` wholesale '' services will support rich representations of complex-data relation-ships . nsdl will distribute access to aggregations and annotations stored in the nsdl metadata-repository that have been harvested , normalized (based on the scaleable library production model in use at nsdl.org) , and exposed for re-harvest . `` retailers '' may use the open-archives-initiative (oai) for metadata-harvesting-protocol to harvest these structured-data relationships and make them available for use in other library-services .
