workshop 3 : classification crosswalks mapping between/among classification-schemes is beneficial within an organization that has a number of implicit schemes , between organizations seeking to exchange information , and in a-digital library context where collections are organized by different classifications . this cross scheme mapping could be done manually , but if many schemes are to be mapped , it may be desirable to provide automated-tools and techniques to support the process . this workshop will present research and projects that identify the state-of-the-practice and outline the research-agenda . in addition to the educational part of the program , the afternoon will be devoted to ongoing nkos activities related to a vocabulary mark-up-language , mechanisms for search-and-retrieval of online knowledge-organization sources , and a typology for describing knowledge-organization sources that supports the development of knowledge-organization services-on-the-web . the program is available from the nkos web-site at http://nkos.slis.kent.edu .
