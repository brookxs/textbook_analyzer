evaluating the contributions of video-representation for a life oral-history collection a-digital video-library of over 900 hours of video and 18000 stories from the historymakers is used to investigate the role of motion-video for users of recorded life oral-histories . stories in the library are presented in one of two ways in two within-subjects experiments : either as audio accompanied by a single still photographic image per story , or as the same audio within a motion-video of the interviewee speaking . twenty-four participants given a treasure-hunt fact-finding task , i.e. , very directed-search , showed no significant preference for either the still or video treatment , and no difference in task-performance . fourteen participants in a second study worked on an exploratory task in the same within-subjects experimental framework , and showed a significant preference for video . for exploratory work , video has a positive effect on user-satisfaction . implications for use-of-video in collecting and accessing recorded life oral-histories , in student-assignments and more generally , are discussed , along with reflections on long-term user studies to complement the ones presented here .
