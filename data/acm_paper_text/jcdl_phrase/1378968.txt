an application for semantic-markup of biodiversity documents we would like to demonstrate a machine-learning_based semantic-markup system that may be used to reformat free-text biodiversity documents in xml-format for digital-libraries . we named the system martt ii . it is built on the martt engine described in [1] , but with new components for example a parallel markup engine using the unsupervised-learning-algorithm described in [2] . the double is in the name stand for intuitive-interaction , which is our goal to make the system truly easy to use . they also mean the system supports two different automated markup engines , allowing the user to choose either one to use and make comparisons between the two .
