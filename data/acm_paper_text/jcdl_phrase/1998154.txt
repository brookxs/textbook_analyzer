towards a model of the e-science data environment building digital-libraries for preserving scientific digital-data , ensuring its continued access , has emerged as a major initiative for funding agencies and academic institutions . understanding the environments in which data is created , quality is assessed , and data is managed is a necessary antecedent to developing appropriate-technologies to support the preservation and ongoing access to data . this paper reports on a study of 11 laboratories and research centers at three u.s. universities . using the grounded-theory-methodology , this paper develops a new , generalized view of the e-science data that attempts to explain the environment in which data is created , managed , documented , and preserved .
