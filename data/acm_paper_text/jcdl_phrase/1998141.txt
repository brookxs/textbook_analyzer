event-detection with spatial latent-dirichlet-allocation a large number of news-articles are generated every day on the web . automatically identifying events from a large-document-collection is a challenging problem . in this paper , we propose two event-detection approaches using generative-models . we combine the popular lda model with temporal-segmentation and spatial-clustering . in addition , we adapt an image-segmentation model , slda , for spatial-temporal event-detection on text . the results of our experiments show that both approaches outperform the traditional content-based clustering approaches on our datasets .
