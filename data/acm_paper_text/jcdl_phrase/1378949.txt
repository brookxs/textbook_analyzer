slab : smart labeling of family photos through an interactive-interface a novel technique for semi-automatic photo-annotation is proposed and evaluated . the technique , slab , uses face processing-algorithms and a simplified user-interface for labeling family photos . a user-study compared our system with two others . one was adobe photoshop element . the other was an in-house implementation of a face-clustering interface recently proposed in the research-community . nine participants performed an annotation-task with each system on faces extracted from a set of 150 images from their own family photo albums . as the faces were all well known to participants , accuracy was near perfect with all three systems . on annotation time , slab was 25 \ % faster than photoshop element and 16 \ % faster than the face-clustering interface .
