real-time-collaboration through visual-search and voice-over-ip numerous digital-libraries (dls) , electronic archives (eas) and portal services have been developed . these services allow online structured access to digitised information , facilitating remote-access for educators and students . often , dl users and information are remotely located - so too are their users . the authors can envision numerous circumstances where two remotely located parties may wish to opportunistically examine an online resource - e-learning-environments for example . we are particularly interested in assisting users whose collaboration resolves around discussion of a common visual resource (documents and collections of documents in the case under discussion) . by providing a single tool for information-seeking and multi-user-collaboration , we believe that the amount of preparation required for an online session is reduced , while the flexibility allowed to parties to conduct ad-hoc examinations of a resource is increased . this paper proposes a framework to address this functionality deficit by describing a document foraging tool that provides facilities for both visual-exploration of a document-set and voiceover-ip (voip) based collaborative features .
