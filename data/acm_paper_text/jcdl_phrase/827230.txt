finding and using data in educational-digital-libraries thredds (thematic real-time earth distributed-data servers) services catalog geophysical data and other data-services to support discovery and use by researchers . thredds , however , does n't support data-discovery and use by learners and educators (i.e. novices) . educational-digital-libraries , like dlese (digital-library for earth system eduation) provide rich metadata descriptions that are effective in helping novices locate and use most types of learning-resources . dlese , however , does n't provide a way for novices to discover geophysical data in immediately usable forms . the vgee (visual geophysical exploration environment) supports novices ' discovery and use of geophysical data by linking thredds services with educational curricula and learner-centered data tools . the curricula are cataloged in dlese and so can be discovered in educational settings . these curricula then guide novices to the appropriate tools and illustrate meaningful-use of the data . more generally , by coupling data to curricular documents , text-based discovery-tools (e.g. search-engines) can be extended to data .
