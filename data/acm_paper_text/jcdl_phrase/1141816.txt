measuring inter-indexer-consistency using a thesaurus when professional indexers independently assign terms to a given document , the term sets generally differ between indexers . studies of inter-indexer-consistency measure the percentage of matching index-terms , but none of them consider the semantic relationships that exist amongst these terms . we propose to represent multiple-indexers data in a vector-space and use the cosine metric as a new consistency measure that can be extended by semantic-relations between index-terms . we believe that this new measure is more accurate and realistic than existing ones and therefore more suitable for evaluation of automatically extracted index-terms .
