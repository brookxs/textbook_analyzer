assessing tools for use with webcasts this research assessed the effectiveness of selected interface-tools in helping people respond to classic information-tasks with webcasts . rather than focus on a classic search/browse task to locate an appropriate webcast to view , our work takes place at the level of an individual webcast to assess interactivity within the contents of a single webcast . the questions guiding our work are : 1) which tool (s) are the most effective in achieving the best-response ? 2) how do users use those tools for task-completion ? in this study , 16 participants responded to a standard set of information-tasks using epresence , a webcasting system that handles both live and stored video , and provides multiple techniques for accessing content . using questionnaires , screen-capture and interviews , we evaluated the interaction , assessed the tools , and based on our results , make suggestions for improving access to the content of stored webcasts .
