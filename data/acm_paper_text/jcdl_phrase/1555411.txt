finding topic trends in digital-libraries we propose a generative-model based on latent-dirichlet-allocation for mining distinct topics in document-collections by integrating the temporal-ordering of documents into the generative process . the document collection is divided into time segments where the discovered topics in each segment is propagated to influence the topic-discovery in the subsequent time segments . we conduct experiments on the collection of academic-papers from citeseer repository . we augment the text-corpus with the addition of user queries and tags and integrate the citation-graph to boost the weight of the topical terms . the experiment results show that segmented topic-model can effectively detect distinct topics and their evolution over time .
