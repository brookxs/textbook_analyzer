personalized spiders for web-search and analysis searching for useful information on the world-wide-web has become incr easingly difficult . while internet-search-engines have been helping people to search on the web , low recall rate and outdated indexes have become more and more problematic as the-web grows . in addition , search-tools usually present to the user only a list of search-results , failing to provide further personalized analysis which could help users identify useful information and comprehend these results . to alleviate these problems , we propose a client-based architecture that incorporates noun phrasing and self-organizing-map techniques . two systems , namely ci spider and meta spider , have been built based on this architecture . user-evaluation studies have been conducted and the findings suggest that the proposed architecture can effectively facilitate web-search and analysis .
