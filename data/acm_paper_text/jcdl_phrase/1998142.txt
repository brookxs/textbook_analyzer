a new video-text-detection method nowadays , digital-libraries contain more and more videos in them , and how to organize and retrieve those videos effectively has become very urgent . text in videos is a very meaningful clue for video semantic understanding , and it can be used for video-organization and retrieval . however , existing text recognizing methods can not deal with multilingual texts or texts embedded in a complex-background very well . in this paper , we propose a novel video-text-detection method . edge-detection and candidate region-extraction are firstly used to obtain all rough candidate text regions , and then region refinement is used to obtain the accurate location of each region . based on our observation that a real text region has a uniform-distribution with its non-zero pixels in its binary-image , an entropy filter is used to remove non-text regions . experiments on various videos show that our method is effective and robust against different languages , background complexities and font styles .
