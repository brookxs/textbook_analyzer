effects of structure and interaction-style on distinct search-tasks in this paper we present the results of a study that investigates the relationships between search-tasks , information-architecture , and interaction style . three kinds of search-tasks (simple lookup , complex lookup and exploratory) were performed using three different user-interfaces (standard web-site , hierarchical text-based faceted interface , and dynamic-query faceted interface) for a large-scale public corpus containing semi-structured statistical-data and reports . twenty-eight people conducted the three kinds of searches in a between-subjects study and twelve others conducted the three kinds of searches on all three systems in a within-subjects study . quantitative results demonstrate that the alternative general-purpose user-interfaces that accept automated structuring of data offer comparable effectiveness , efficiency , and aesthetics to manually constructed architectures . qualitative results demonstrate the manual architectures are favored .
