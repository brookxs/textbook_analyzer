to better stand on the shoulder of giants usually scientists breed research ideas inspired by previous publications , but they are unlikely to follow all publications in the unbounded literature collection . the volume of literature keeps on expanding extremely fast , whilst not all papers contribute equal impact to the academic society . being aware of potentially influential literature would put one in an advanced position in choosing important research references . hence , estimation of potential-influence is of great significance . we study a challenging problem of identifying potentially influential literature . we examine a set of hypotheses on what are the fundamental characteristics for highly cited papers and find some interesting patterns . based on these observations , we learn to identify potentially influential literature via future influence prediction (fip) , which aims to estimate the-future influence of literature . the system takes a series of features of a particular publication as input and produces as output the estimated citation counts of that article after a given time period . we consider several regression-models to formulate the learning-process and evaluate their performance based on the coefficient-of-determination (r2) . experimental-results on a real-large data-set show a mean average predictive performance of 83.6 % measured in r ^ 2 . we apply the learned model to the application of bibliography recommendation and obtain prominent performance-improvement in terms of mean-average-precision (map) .
