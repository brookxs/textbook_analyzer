comparative-evaluation of text - and citation-based-plagiarism-detection approaches using guttenplag various approaches for plagiarism-detection exist . all are based on more or less sophisticated text-analysis methods such as string-matching , fingerprinting or style comparison . in this paper a new approach called citation-based-plagiarism-detection is evaluated using a doctoral thesis , in which a volunteer crowd-sourcing project called guttenplag identified substantial amounts of plagiarism through careful manual inspection . this new approach is able to identify similar and plagiarized documents based on the citations used in the text . it is shown that citation-based-plagiarism-detection performs significantly better than text-based procedures in identifying strong paraphrasing , translation and some idea plagiarism . detection rates can be improved by combining citation-based with text-based plagiarism-detection .
