a metadata-generation system for scanned scientific volumes large-scale digitization projects have been conducted at digital-libraries to preserve cultural-artifacts and to provide permanent-access . the increasing amount of digitized resources , including scanned-books and scientific publications , requires development of tools-and-methods that will efficiently analyze and manage large-collections of digitized resources . in this work , we tackle the problem of extracting metadata from scanned volumes of journals . our goal is to extract information describing internal structures and content of scanned volumes , which is necessary for providing effective content access functionalities to digital-library users . we propose methods for automatically generating volume level , issue level , and article level metadata based on format and text-features extracted from ocred text . we show the performance of our system on scanned bound historical-documents nearly two centuries old . we have developed the system and integrated it into an operational digital-library , the-internet archive , for real-world usage .
