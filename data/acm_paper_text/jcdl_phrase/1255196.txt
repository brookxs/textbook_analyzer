mining a-digital library for influential authors when browsing a-digital library of research papers , it is natural to ask which authors are most influential in a particular topic . we present a probabilistic-model that ranks authors based on their influence in particular areas of scientific-research . this model combines several sources-of-information : citation-information between documents as represented by pagerank scores , authorship data gathered through automatic-information-extraction , and the words in paper abstracts . we compare the performance of a topic-model versus a smoothed language-model by assessing the number of major award winners in the resulting ranked list of researchers .
