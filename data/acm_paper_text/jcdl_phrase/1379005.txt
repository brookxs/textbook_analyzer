harvesting needed to maintain scientific-literature online millions of scientific articles are accessible freely on the web . while some of them are stored in institutional-repositories many are made available on personal pages which are exposed to the net 's transience . we found that nearly 11 \ % of urls of pdf-documents containing references to life-science publications were not accessible within 5 months after being harvested using a search-engine 's (se) api . for most of them (8.4 \ %) no se cache backup could be found . although we have yet to estimate the exact rate at which the scientific-literature disappears and the duration of its disappearance the results so far are a clear indicator that web-harvesting is needed to preserve the online scientific-literature .
