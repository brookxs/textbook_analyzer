linked active content : a service for digital-libraries for education a service is described to help enable digital-libraries for education , such as the nsdl , to serve as collaboration spaces for the creation , modification and use of active-learning experiences . the goal is to redefine the line between those activities that fall within the domain of computer-programming and those that fall within the domain of content-authoring . the current location of this line , as defined by web-technologies , is such that far too much of the design and development-process is in the domain of software creation . this paper explores the definition and use of linked active content , which builds on the hypertext paradigm by extending it to support active content . this concept has community-development advantages , since it provides an authoring paradigm that supports contributions from a more diverse audience , including especially those who have substantial classroom and pedagogical expertise but lack programming expertise . it also promotes the extraction of content from software so that collections may be better organized and more easily repurposed to meet the needs of a diverse audience of educators and students .
