teacher sociality and information diffusion in educational-digital-libraries understanding the social-aspects of digital-resource utilization is an area of active research . in this study , we examine the digital library resource-utilization and social-behaviors of middle and high-school earth-science teachers of a large united-states urban school-district . we present the results of three analysis based on teachers using an online-curriculum planning tool called the curriculum customization service (ccs) , and examine the social-networks that emerge among the participating teachers . we explore these networks in the context of the digital library-resources that were part of the ccs and the use of socio-centric features around those resources . our initial findings show promise toward developing a broader understanding of the social-networks of teachers , their behaviors around and usage of digital-library-resources , as well as the diffusion of information through those networks .
