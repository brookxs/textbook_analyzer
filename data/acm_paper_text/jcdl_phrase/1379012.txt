the ncsu catalog research testbed : a tool for evaluating faceted library-catalog interfaces many libraries have recently been devoting significant efforts to modernizing their library-catalog web-interfaces . one popular approach is to create a faceted-search interface to the library-catalog . faceted-search interfaces can be complex , requiring designers to make many decisions about the placement and display of faceted-search design elements on the page . unfortunately little empirical-research exists on how to optimize faceted-search interfaces for library catalogs . to facilitate research in this area , the ncsu libraries has developed the ncsu catalog research testbed , a tool for developing and evaluating faceted library-catalog interfaces .
