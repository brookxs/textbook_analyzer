an alignment_based system for chord sequence retrieval music-retrieval systems for western tonal-music digital ibraries have to consider rhythmic , timbral , melodic and harmonic information . most existing retrieval-systems only take into account melodies . melody comparison may induce errors since two musical pieces can be very similar whereas their melodies may differ in a significant way . in this paper , we propose to investigate and experiment a retrieval-system based on the comparison of chord progressions . the definition of chords may be ambiguous but their properties can be precisely described and represented . we detail the adaptations of alignment algorithms , successfully applied for the estimation of symbolic melodic-similarity , for chord-progression retrieval . several experiments , performed on symbolic databases , show that the system described is robust to variations and outperforms a recent chord retrieval-system .
