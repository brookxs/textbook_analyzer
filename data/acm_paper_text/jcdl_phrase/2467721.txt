reading the correct history ? : modeling temporal intention in resource-sharing the-web is trapped in the `` perpetual now '' , and when users traverse from page to page , they are seeing the state of the web-resource (i.e. , the page) as it exists at the time of the click and not necessarily at the time when the link was made . thus , a temporal discrepancy can arise between the resource at the time the page author created a link to it and the time when a reader follows the link . this is especially important in the context of social-media : the ease of sharing links in a tweet or facebook post allows many people to author web-content , but the space constraints combined with poor awareness by authors often prevents sufficient context from being generated to determine the intent of the post . if the links are clicked as soon as they are shared , the temporal-distance between sharing and clicking is so small that there is little to no difference in content . however , not all clicks occur immediately , and a delay of days or even hours can result in reading something other than what the author intended . we introduce the concept of a user 's temporal intention upon publishing a link in social-media . we investigate the features that could be extracted from the post , the linked resource , and the patterns of social dissemination to model this user-intention . finally , we analyze the historical integrity of the shared-resources in social-media across time . in other words , how much is the knowledge of the author 's intent beneficial in maintaining the consistency of the story being told through social posts and in enriching the archived content-coverage and depth of vulnerable resources ?
