refactoring hubzero for linked-data the hubzero cyberinfrastructure provides a virtual-research-environment that includes a set of tools for web-based , scientific-collaboration and a platform for publishing and using resources such as executable software , source-code , images , learning-modules , videos , documents , and datasets . released as open-source in 2010 , hubzero has been implemented on a typical lamp stack (linux , apache , mysql , and php) and utilizes the joomla ! content-management-system . this paper describes the subsequent refactoring of hubzero to produce and expose linked-data from its backend , relational-database , altering the external expression of the data without changing its internal-structure . the open-archives-initiative object-reuse-and-exchange (oai-ore) specification is applied to model the basic structural semantics of hubzero resources as nested aggregations , and data-and-metadata are mapped to vocabularies such as dublin-core and published within the-web representations of the resources using rdfa . resource maps can be harvested using an rdf crawler or an oai-pmh data-provider that were bundled for demonstration purposes . a visualization was produced to browse and navigate the relations among data-and-metadata from an example hub .
