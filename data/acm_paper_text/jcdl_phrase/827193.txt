utility of an oai service-provider search portal the open-archives-initiative (oai) protocol for metadata-harvesting (pmh) facilitates efficient interoperability between digital-collections , in particular by enabling service-providers to construct , with relatively modest effort , search portals that present aggregated metadata to specific communities . this paper describes the experiences of the university of illinois at urbana-champaign library as an oai service-provider . we discuss the creation of a search portal to an aggregation of metadata describing cultural-heritage resources . we examine several key challenges posed by the aggregated metadata and present preliminary findings of a pilot-study of the utility of the portal for a specific community (student teachers) . we also comment briefly on the potential for using text-analysis tools to uncover themes and relationships within the aggregated metadata .
