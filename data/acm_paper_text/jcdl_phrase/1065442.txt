an initial evaluation of automated organization for digital-library browsing in this article we present an evaluation of text-clustering and classification-methods for creating digital-library browse interfaces , focusing on the particular case of collections made up of heterogeneous metadata records . this situation is common in `` portal '' style digital-libraries , which are built by harvesting content from many disparate sources , typically using the open-archives protocol for metadata-harvesting (oai-pmh) . by studying the activity of users in an experimental-system , we find that taxonomies built or populated using machine-learning (or `` ai '') techniques provide a potentially useful avenue for browsing in this digital-library scenario .
