the resultsspace collaborative-search environment the resultsspace collaborative-search environment is a tool to support asynchronous collaborative information-retrieval among a small group of collaborators . it is designed to promote awareness of collaborators ' searches and the documents they have rated . awareness is supported through several mechanisms : an area that shows a history of queries , a summary display of collaborators ' ratings next to each search result , and changes in the visual-salience of search-results based on their aggregate rating from all collaborators . faceted controls allow users to filter results based on specific ratings (relevant , not relevant , and maybe) and on specific collaborator (s) who have rated an item . we describe features of the system , how they are implemented , and give insights into the design rationale .
