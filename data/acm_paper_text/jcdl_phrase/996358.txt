integration of biomedical-text and sequence oai repositories archived biomedical-literature and sequence-data are growing rapidly . the open-archives-initiative 's protocol for metadata-harvesting (oai-pmh) [1] . provides a convenient way for data-sharing but it has not been tested in the biomedical-domain , especially in dealing with different types of data , such as protein , and gene sequences . we built four individual oai -- pmh repositories based on different biomedical resources . using the harvested data from the four repositories we created an integrated oai-pmh repository , which hosts the linked literature and sequence-data in a single place .
