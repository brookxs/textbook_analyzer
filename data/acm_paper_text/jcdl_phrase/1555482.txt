scientific digital-libraries , interoperability , and ontologies scientific digital-libraries serve complex and evolving research-communities . justifications for the development of scientific digital-libraries include the desire to preserve science-data and the promises of information interconnectedness , correlative science , and system-interoperability . research [1] suggests single shared ontologies are fundamental to fulfilling these promises . we present a tool-framework , a set of principles , and a real-world case-study where shared ontologies are used to develop and manage science-information models and subsequently guide the implementation of scientific digital-libraries . the tool-framework , based on an ontology-modeling tool as illustrated in figure 1 , was configured to develop , manage , and keep shared ontologies relevant within changing domains and to promote the interoperability , interconnectedness , and correlation desired by scientists .
