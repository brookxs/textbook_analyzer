content-based layouts for exploratory metadata-search in scientific-research data today 's digital-libraries (dls) archive vast amounts of information in the form of text , videos , images , data measurements , etc. . user-access to dl content can rely on similarity between metadata elements , or similarity between the data itself (content-based-similarity) . we consider the problem of exploratory-search in large dls of time-oriented data . we propose a novel approach for overview-first exploration-of-data collections based on user-selected metadata properties . in a 2d-layout representing entities of the selected property are laid out based on their similarity with respect to the underlying data content . the display is enhanced by compact summarizations of underlying data elements , and forms the basis for exploratory navigation of users in the data-space . the approach is proposed as an-interface for visual-exploration , leading the user to discover interesting relationships between data items relying on content-based-similarity between data items and their respective metadata labels . we apply the method on real-data sets from the earth-observation community , showing its applicability and usefulness .
