automated semantic annotation and retrieval based on sharable-ontology and case-based-learning techniques effective information-retrieval (ir) using domain-knowledge and semantics is one of the major challenges in ir . in this paper we propose a framework that can facilitate image-retrieval based on a sharable domain-ontology and thesaurus . in particular , case-based-learning (cbl) using a natural-language phrase parser is proposed to convert a natural-language-query into resource-description-framework (rdf) format , a semantic-web standard of metadata-description that supports machine readable semantic-representation . this same parser also is extended to perform semantic-annotation on the descriptive-metadata of images and convert metadata automatically into the same rdf representation . the retrieval of images then can be conducted by matching the semantic and structural descriptions of the user-query with those of the annotated descriptive-metadata of images . we tested in our problem-domain by retrieving the historical and cultural images taken from dr. ching-chih chen 's `` first emperor of china '' cd-rom [25] as part of our productive international digital library collaboration . we have constructed and implemented the domain-ontology , a mandarin-chinese thesaurus , as well as the similarity-match and retrieval algorithms in order to test our proposed framework . our experiments have shown the feasibility and usability of these approaches .
