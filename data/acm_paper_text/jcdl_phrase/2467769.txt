streamlining user-interaction in tag-based conversational navigation of knowledge-resource libraries this paper presents an approach for helping users more quickly discover relevant-information resources in a tag_based system , where each resource is associated with a number of descriptive meta-data tags . our approach builds an adaptive conversational decision-tree structure to minimize the number of interactive cues required to help a user navigate to resources of interest . initial experiments demonstrate the potential of the approach , with shallower decision-trees supporting better overall interaction performance .
