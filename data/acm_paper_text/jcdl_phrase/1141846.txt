creating a multi disciplinary digital-library in the 5s framework this study identifies (1) the steps involved in framing a multi disciplinary digital-library to the 5s-model , a formal-model for digital-libraries . (2) the major benefits the 5s-model delivers toward simplifying a-digital library 's resource info structure ; including the creation of simplified resource-classification trees and development of a user-interface which interacts with such trees to enable the best in browse ability.this poster presents a graphical mapping of how individual naming functions of the spatial temporal-organization (fnodes) are mapped to the user-interface . more so , the poser will display the importance of the examples of how the spaces element is used to create `` html helpers '' which eventually result in the ultimate in ease of usability on the user end . the blending of these components to suffice for all disciplines of a-digital library are the fundamental ingredients to creating an established online repository .
