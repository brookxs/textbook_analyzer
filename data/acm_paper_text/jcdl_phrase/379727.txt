creating trading-networks of digital-archives digital-archives can best survive failures if they have made several c opies of their collections at remote sites . in this paper , we discuss how autonomous sites can cooperate to provide preservation by trading data . we examine the decisions that an archive must make when forming trading-networks , such as the amount of storage space to provide and the best number of partner sites . we also deal with the fact that some sites may be more reliable than others . experimental-results from a data-trading simulator illustrate which policies are most reliable . our techniques focus on preserving the `` bits '' of digital-collections ; other services that focus on other archiving concerns (such as preserving meaningful metadata) can be built on top of the system we describe here .
