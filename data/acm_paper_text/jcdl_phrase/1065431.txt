meaningful presentations of photo-libraries : rationale and applications of bi-level radial quantum layouts searching photo-libraries can be made more satisfying and successful if search-results are presented in a way that allows users to gain an overview of the photo categories . since photo layouts on computer displays are the primary way that users get an overview , we propose a novel approach to show more photos in meaningful groupings . photo layouts can be linear strips , or zoomable three-dimensional arrangements , but the most common form is the two-dimensional grid . this paper introduces a novel bi-level hierarchical layout with motivating examples . in a bi-level hierarchy , one region is designated for primary content - an image , text , or combination . adjacent to that region , groups of photos are placed radially in an ordered fashion , such that the relationship of the single primary region to its many secondary regions is apparent . a compelling aspect is the interactive-experience in which the layout is dynamically resized , allowing users to rapidly , incrementally , and reversibly alter the dimensions and content . it can accommodate hundreds of photos in dozens of regions , can be customized in a corner or center layout , and can scale from an element on a web-page to a large poster size . on typical displays (1024 x 1280 or 1200 x 1600 pixels) , bi-level radial quantum layouts can conveniently accommodate 2-20 regions with tens or hundreds of photos per region .
