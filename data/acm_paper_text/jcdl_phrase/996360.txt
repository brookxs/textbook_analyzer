analytical usability-evaluation for digital-libraries : a case-study there are two main kinds of approach to considering usability of any system : empirical and analytical . empirical techniques involve testing systems with users , whereas analytical techniques involve usability personnel assessing systems using established theories and methods . we report here on a set of studies in which four different techniques were applied to various digital-libraries , focusing on the strengths , limitations and scope of each approach . two of the techniques , heuristic-evaluation and cognitive-walkthrough , were applied in text-book fashion , because there was no obvious way to contextualize them to the digital libraries (dl) domain . for the third , claims-analysis , it was possible to develop a set of re-usable scenarios and personas that relate the approach specifically to dl development . the fourth technique , cassm , relates explicitly to the dl domain by combining empirical-data with an analytical approach . we have found that heuristic-evaluation and cognitive-walkthrough only address superficial aspects of interface-design (but are good for that) , whereas claims-analysis and cassm can help identify deeper conceptual difficulties (but demand greater skill of the analyst) . however , none fit seamlessly with existing digital-library development-practices , highlighting an important area for further work to support improved usability .
