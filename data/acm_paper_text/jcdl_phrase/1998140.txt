a metadata geoparsing system for place-name-recognition and resolution in metadata records this paper describes an approach for performing recognition and resolution of place names mentioned over the descriptive-metadata records of typical digital-libraries . our approach exploits evidence provided by the existing structured attributes within the metadata records to support the place-name-recognition and resolution , in order to achieve better results than by just using lexical-evidence from the textual values of these attributes . in metadata records , lexical-evidence is very often insufficient for this task , since short sentences and simple expressions are predominant . our implementation uses a dictionary_based technique for recognition of place names (with names provided by geonames) , and machine-learning for reasoning on the evidences and choosing a possible resolution candidate . the evaluation of our approach was performed in data-sets with a metadata-schema rich in dublin-core elements . two evaluation-methods were used . first , we used cross-validation , which showed that our solution is able to achieve a very high precision of 0,99 at 0,55 recall , or a recall of 0,79 at 0,86 precision . second , we used a comparative-evaluation with an existing commercial service , where our solution performed better on any confidence level (p
