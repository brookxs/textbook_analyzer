measuring the user 's experience with digital-libraries in this paper , we propose a method for assessing user-experience . normally evaluation is based on usability or on the efficiency of or effectiveness of focused information-search tasks . yet all experiences with libraries (whether physical or virtual) need not be for the explicit purpose of finding , acquiring and using information . the experience and its playfulness and pleasure have equal value . to assess this experience , we modified a experiential-value-scale developed for online-shopping and have tested it in the context of culture and heritage websites .
