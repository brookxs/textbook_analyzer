identification of works of manga using lod resources : an experimental frbrization of bibliographic-data of comic-books manga -- a japanese term meaning graphic novel or comic -- has been globally accepted . in japan , there are a huge number of monographs and magazines of manga published . the work entity defined in functional-requirements of bibliographic-records (frbr) is useful to identify and find manga . this paper examines how to identify manga works in a set of bibliographic-records maintained by kyoto international manga museum . it is known that authority data is useful to identify works from the bibliographic-records . however , the authority data of manga is not rich , because manga has been recognized as a sub-culture resource and is generally not included in library collections . in this study , we used dbpedia , which is a large linked open-data (lod) resource created from wikipedia , to identify frbr manga entities in bibliographic-records . the results of this study show that using lod resources is a reasonable way to identify works from bibliographic-records . it also shows the accuracy and efficiency of work identification depending on the quality of the lod resources used .
