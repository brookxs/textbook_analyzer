leveraging context to resolve identity in photo-albums our system suggests likely identity labels for photographs in a personal-photo-collection . instead of using face-recognition techniques , the system leverages automatically available context , like the time and location where the photos were taken.based on time and location , the system automatically computes event and location groupings of photos . as the user annotates some of the identities of people in their collection , patterns of re-occurrence and co-occurrence of different people in different locations and events emerge . the system uses these patterns to generate label suggestions for identities that were not yet annotated . these suggestions can greatly accelerate the process of manual-annotation and improve the quality of retrieval from the collection.we obtained ground-truth identity annotation for four different photo-albums , and used them to test our system . the system proved effective , making very accurate label suggestions , even when the number of suggestions for each photo was limited to five names , and even when only a small subset of the photos was annotated .
