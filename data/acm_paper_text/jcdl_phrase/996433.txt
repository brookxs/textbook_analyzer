supporting personal-collections across digital-libraries in spatial-hypertext creating , maintaining , or using a-digital library requires the manipulation of digital-documents . information-workspaces provide a visual-representation allowing users to collect , organize , annotate , and author information . the visual-knowledge-builder (vkb) helps users access , collect , annotate , and combine materials from digital-libraries and other sources into a personal-information workspace vkb has been enhanced to include direct-search interfaces for nsdl and google . users create a visualization of search-results while selecting and organizing materials for their current activity . additionally , metadata applicators have been added to vkb . this interface allows the rapid addition of metadata to documents and aids the user in the extraction of existing metadata for application to other documents . a study was performed to compare the selection and organization of documents in vkb to the commonly used tools ofa web-browser and a word-processor . this study shows the value of visual-workspaces for such effort but points to the need for subdocument level objects , ephemeral visualizations , and support for moving from visual-representations to metadata .
