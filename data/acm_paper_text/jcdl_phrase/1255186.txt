document-clustering using small-world communities words in natural-language documents exhibit a small-world-network structure . thus the physics community provides us with an extensive supply of algorithms for extracting community-structure . we present a novel method for semantically clustering a large-collection of documents using small-world communities . this method combines modified physics algorithms with traditional information-retrieval-techniques . a term-network is generated from the document collection , the terms are clustered into small-world communities , the semantic term clusters are used to generate overlapping document clusters . the algorithm combines the speed of single link with the quality of complete link . clustering takes place in nearly real-time and the results are judged to be coherent by expert-users . our algorithm occupies a middle ground between speed and-quality of document-clustering .
