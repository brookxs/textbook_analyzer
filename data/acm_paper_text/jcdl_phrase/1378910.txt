personal & soho archiving digital-objects require appropriate measures for digital-preservation to ensure that they can be accessed and used in the near and far future . while heritage institutions have been addressing the challenges posed by digital-preservation needs for some time , private users and sohos (small office/home office) are less prepared to handle these challenges . yet , both have increasing amounts of data that represent considerable value , be it office-documents or family photographs . backup , common practice of home-users , avoids the physical loss of data , but it does not prevent the loss of the ability to render and use the data in the long-term . research-and-development in the area of digital-preservation is driven by memory institutions and large businesses . the available tools , services and models are developed to meet the demands of these professional settings . this paper analyses the requirements and challenges of preservation solutions for private users and sohos . based on the requirements and supported by available tools and services , we are designing and implementing a home-archiving system to provide digital-preservation solutions specifically for digital holdings in the small office and home environment . it hides the technical complexity of digital-preservation challenges and provides simple and automated services based on established best-practice examples . the system combines bit preservation and logical preservation-strategies to avoid loss of data and the ability to access and use them . a first software prototype , called hoppla , is presented in this paper .
