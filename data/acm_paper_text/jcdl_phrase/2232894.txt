comparison of three digital-library-interfaces : open library , google-books , and hathi trust digital-libraries often require very specialized interfaces in order to present various types of digital-content . it is therefore critical to create interfaces that improve presentation of digital-information and maximize user-experience with digital-collections . in this respect , this research aims to examine interfaces of three digital-libraries that provide collections of digital text . the three digital-libraries include open library , google-books , and hathi trust . an evaluation matrix was developed to measure usability , aesthetics and interface-components . the overall findings of the study showed that the majority of the participants preferred the open library-interface followed by google-books . the statistical-analysis indicated that open library is significantly better than google-books and hathi trust in terms of usability , aesthetics , and interface-components . the preference for the open library stemmed largely from aesthetic choices . participants also appreciated the use of elements that are analogous to their physical counterparts .
