addressing diverse corpora with cluster-based term-weighting highly heterogeneous collections present difficulties to term-weighting models that are informed by corpus-level frequencies . collections which span multiple languages or large time periods do not provide realistic statistics on which words are interesting to a system . this paper presents a case where diverse corpora can frustrate term-weighting and proposes a modification that weighs documents according to their class or cluster within the collection . in cases of diverse corpora , the proposed modification better represents the intuitions behind corpus-level document frequencies .
