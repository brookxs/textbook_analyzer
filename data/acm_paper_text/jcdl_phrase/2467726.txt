interactive-search result-clustering : a study of user-behavior and retrieval-effectiveness scatter/gather is a document-browsing and information-retrieval method based on document-clustering . it is designed to facilitate user articulation of information-needs through iterative-clustering and interactive-browsing . this paper reports on a study that investigated the effectiveness of scatter/gather browsing for information-retrieval . we conducted a within-subject user-study of 24 college-students to investigate the utility of a scatter/gather system , to examine its strengths and weaknesses , and to receive feedback from users on the system . results show that the clustering-based scatter/gather method was more difficult to use than the classic information-retrieval-systems in terms of user-perception . however , clustering helped the subjects accomplish the tasks more efficiently . scatter/gather clustering was particularly useful in helping users finish tasks that they were less familiar with and allowed them to search with fewer words . scatter/gather tended to be more useful when it was more difficult for the user to do query-specification for an information-need . topic-familiarity and specificity had significant influences on user perceived retrieval-effectiveness . the influences appeared to be greater with the scatter/gather system compared to a classic search-system . topic-familiarity also had significant influences on query-formulation .
