an experimental framework for comparative digital-library evaluation : the logging scheme evaluation of digital-libraries assesses their effectiveness , quality and overall impact . in this paper we present a novel , multi-level logging framework that will provide complete coverage of the different aspects of dl usage for user-system interactions . based on this framework , we can analyse for various dl stakeholders the logging data according to their specific interests . in addition , analysis-tools and a freely accessible log-data repository will yield synergies and sustainability in dl evaluation and encourage a-community for dl evaluation by providing for discussion on a common-ground .
