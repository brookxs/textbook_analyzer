finding authoritative people from the-web today 's web is so huge and diverse that it arguably reflects the real-world . for this reason , searching the-web is a promising approach to find things in the real-world . this paper presents nexas , an extension to web-search-engines that attempts to find real-worldentities relevant to a topic . its basic idea is to extract proper-names from the-web pages retrieved for the topic . a main advantage of this approach is that users can query any topic and learn about relevant real-world entities without dedicated databases for the topic . in particular , we focus on an application for finding authoritative people from the-web . this application is practically important because once personal-names are obtained , they can lead-users from the-web to managed information stored in digital-libraries . to explore effective ways of finding people , we first examine the distribution of japanese personal-names by analyzing about 50 million japanese web-pages . we observe that personal-names appear frequently on the web , but the distribution is highly influenced by automatically generated texts . to remedy the bias and find widely acknowledged people accurately , we utilize the number of web-servers containing a name instead of the number of web-pages . we show its effectiveness by an experiment covering a wide range oftopics . finally , we demonstrate several examples and suggest possible applications .
