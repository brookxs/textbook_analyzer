discovery of retrograde and inverted themes for indexing musical scores this paper describes extensions to a musical score indexing program that enable it to discover sequences of notes that appear in retrograde and/or inverted form . the program was tested over a set of 50 orchestral movements by several composers of the baroque , classical , and romantic periods . the retrograde and inversion discovery algorithm added an average of 3.76 patterns per movement to the index , increasing the number of notes in the index by 6.5 \ % , and the number of entries by 8.2 \ % . among the patterns added to the index were variations of 3 themes in retrograde , 5 themes in inversion , and 3 themes in retrograde inversion .
