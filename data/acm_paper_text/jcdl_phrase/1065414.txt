a generic alerting service for digital-libraries users of modern digital-libraries (dls) can keep themselves up-to-date by searching and browsing their favorite collections , or more conveniently by resorting to an alerting service . the alerting service notifies its clients about new or changed documents . proprietary and mediating alerting services fail to fluidly integrate information from differing collections . this paper analyses the conceptual requirements of this much-sought after service for digital-libraries . we demonstrate that the differing concepts of digital-libraries and its underlying technical-design has extensive influence (a) the expectations , needs and interests of users regarding an alerting service , and (b) on the technical possibilities of the implementation of the service . our findings will show that the range of issues surrounding alerting services for digital-libraries , their design and use is greater than one may anticipate . we also show that , conversely , the requirements for an alerting service have considerable impact on the concepts of dl design . our findings should be of interest for librarians as well as system designers . we highlight and discuss the far-reaching implications for the design of , and interaction with , libraries . this paper discusses the lessons-learned from building such a distributed alerting service . we present our prototype-implementation as a proof-of-concept for an alerting service for open dl software .
