the landscape of information-science : 1996-2008 we propose a methodology combining symbolic and numeric information to map the structure of research in information-science between 1996-2008 . the visualization of the resulting maps showed that while the two-camp structure of information-science observed in previous studies is still valid , other research poles like web and user-oriented studies are building bridges between the two hitherto isolated poles .
