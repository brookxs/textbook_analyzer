tableseer : automatic table metadata-extraction and searching in digital-libraries tables are ubiquitous in digital-libraries . in scientific documents , tables are widely used to present experimental-results or statistical-data in a condensed fashion . however , current search-engines do not support table-search . the difficulty of automatic extracting tables from un-tagged documents , the lack of a universal table-metadata specification , and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make table-search problem challenging . in this paper , we describe tableseer , a search-engine for tables . tableseer crawls digital-libraries , detects tables from documents , extracts tables metadata , indexes and ranks tables , and provides a user-friendly search-interface . we propose an extensive set of medium-independent metadata for tables that scientists and other users can adopt for representing table-information . in addition , we devise a novel page box-cutting method to improve the performance of the table-detection . given a query , tableseer ranks the matched tables using an innovative ranking-algorithm - tablerank . tablerank rates each ? query , table ? pair with a tailored vector-space-model and a specific term-weighting-scheme . overall , tableseer eliminates the burden of manually extract table data from digital-libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables . we demonstrate the value of tableseer with empirical-studies on scientific documents .
