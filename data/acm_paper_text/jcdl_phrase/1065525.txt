evaluating digital-libraries `` so far , evaluation has not kept pace with efforts in digital-libraries (or with digital-libraries themselves) , has not become part of their integral activity , and has not been even specified as to what it means , and how to do it . '' - [1] conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a-digital library requires a `` triangulation '' approach including multiple-models , procedures , and tools . carrying out valid evaluations of digital-libraries in a timely and efficient manner is the focus of this tutorial . why is-evaluation of digital-libraries so important ? each year sees the introduction of new digital-libraries promoted as valuable resources for education and other needs . yet systematic evaluation of the implementation and efficacy of these digital-library-systems is often lacking . this tutorial is specifically designed to establish evaluation as a key strategy throughout the design , development , and implementation of digital-libraries . the tutorial focuses on a decision-oriented model for evaluating digital-libraries using multiple methods such as : service-evaluation , usability-evaluation , information-retrieval , biometrics evaluation , transaction-log-analysis survey-methods , interviews and focus-groups , observations , and experimental-methods . participants in this tutorial will learn how to implement models and procedures for evaluating digital-libraries at all levels of education . the tutorial includes presentations with actual case-studies that are focused on a variety of digital-library evaluation-strategies . participants will also receive a copy of evaluating digital-libraries : a user-friendly guide .
