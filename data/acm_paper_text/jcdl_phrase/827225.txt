modularization framework for digital-museum exhibition conventionally , digital-museum online exhibitions are constructed using handcrafted html pages which require tedious hypermedia composing . this paper proposes a sophisticated modularization framework for exhibition website construction by integrating xml and flash mx . a typical exhibition page is differentiated into several `` layers '' containing specific types of `` media elements '' . several categories of modularized flash-based `` mediah-andlers '' are used to process and present the layers containing media elements . a complete set of media-handlers presenting the content are then integrated together to give the final page presentation . based on this modularization framework , the workflow for exhibition construction and management are significant improved .
