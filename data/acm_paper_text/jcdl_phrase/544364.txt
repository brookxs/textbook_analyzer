thesauri and ontologies in digital-libraries : 1 . structure and use in knowledge-based assistance to users this introductory-tutorial is intended for anyone concerned with subject access to digital-libraries . it provides a bridge by presenting methods of subject access as treated in an information-studies program for those coming to digital-libraries from other fields . it will elucidate through examples the conceptual and vocabulary problems users face when searching digital-libraries . it will then show how a well-structured thesaurus / ontology can be used as the knowledge-base for an-interface that can assist users with search topic clarification (for example through browsing well-structured hierarchies and guided facet-analysis) and with finding good search-terms (through query-term mapping and query-term expansion - synonyms and hierarchic inclusion) . it will touch on cross-database and cross-language searching as natural extensions of these functions . the workshop will cover the thesaurus structure needed to support these functions : concept-term relationships for vocabulary control and synonym-expansion , conceptual-structure (semantic-analysis , facets , and hierarchy) for topic clarification and hierarchic query-term expansion) . it will introduce a few sample thesauri and some thesaurus-supported digital-libraries and web-sites to illustrate these principles .
