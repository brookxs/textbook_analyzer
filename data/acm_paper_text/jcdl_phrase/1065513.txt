processing xml-documents with overlapping-hierarchies the problem of overlapping-markup hierarchies , first mentioned in the context of sgml , often occurs in xml text encoding applications for humanities . previous solutions to the problem rely on manual maintenance of the markup and address only the problem of representing overlapping features in xml , leaving the issues of automated maintenance and querying open . as a consequence , traditional xml tools are of little practical use when dealing with overlapping-markup . in this work we demonstrate the implementation of our framework for management of concurrent-xml hierarchies from a computer science perspective . we propose an underlying model , data-structures , apis , and algorithms so that the most of the burden of managing concurrent-xml hierarchies would be born by the software .
