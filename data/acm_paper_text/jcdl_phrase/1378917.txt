semi automated metadata-extraction for preprints-archives in this paper we present a system called paperbase that aids users in entering metadata for preprints . paperbase extracts metadata from the preprint . using a dublin-core_based rest api , third-party repository software populates a web-form that the user can then proofread and complete . paperbase also predicts likely key-words for the preprints , based on a controlled-vocabulary of keywords that the archive uses and a bayesian-classifier . we have tested the system on 12 individuals , and measured the time that it took them to enter data , and the accuracy of the entered metadata . we find that our system appears to be faster than manual entry , but a larger sample needs to be tested before it can be deemed statistically significant . all but two participants perceived it to be faster . some metadata , in particular the title of preprints , contains significantly fewer mistakes when entered automatically ; even though the automatic-system is not perfect , people tend to correct mistakes that paperbase makes , but would leave their own mistakes in place .
