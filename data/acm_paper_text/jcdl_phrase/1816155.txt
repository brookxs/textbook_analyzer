domain-specific iterative readability computation we present a new algorithm to measure domain-specific readability . it iteratively computes the readability of domain-specific resources based on the difficulty of domain-specific concepts and vice versa , in a style reminiscent of other bipartite-graph algorithms such as hyperlink-induced topic search (hits) and the stochastic approach for link-structure analysis (salsa) . while simple , our algorithm outperforms standard heuristic measures and remains competitive among supervised-learning approaches . moreover , it is less domain-dependent and portable across domains as it does not rely on an annotated-corpus or expensive expert-knowledge that supervised or domain-specific methods require .
