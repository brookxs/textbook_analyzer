ranking authors in digital-libraries searching for people with expertise on a particular topic also known as expert-search is a common task in digital-libraries . most models for this task use only documents as evidence for expertise while ranking people . in digital-libraries , other sources of evidence are available such as a document 's association with venues and citation links with other documents . we propose graph-based models that accommodate multiple sources of evidence in a pagerank-like algorithm for ranking experts . our studies on two publicly-available datasets indicate that our model despite being general enough to be directly useful for ranking other types of objects performs on par with probabilistic-models commonly used for expert-ranking .
