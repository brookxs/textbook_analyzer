exploiting potential citation papers in scholarly paper recommendation to help generate relevant suggestions for researchers , recommendation-systems have started to leverage the latent interests in the publication profiles of the researchers themselves . while using such a publication citation-network has been shown to enhance performance , the network is often sparse , making recommendation difficult . to alleviate this sparsity , we identify `` potential citation papers '' through the use of collaborative-filtering . also , as different logical sections of a paper have different significance , as a secondary contribution , we investigate which sections of papers can be leveraged to represent papers effectively . on a scholarly paper recommendation dataset , we show that recommendation-accuracy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines as measured by ndcg and mrr , when we discover potential citation papers using imputed similarities via collaborative-filtering and represent candidate papers using both the full text and assigning more weight to the conclusion sections .
