sdlip + starts = sdarts a protocol and toolkit for metasearching in this paper we describe how we combined sdlip and starts , two comple mentary protocols for searching over distributed document-collections . the resulting protocol , which we call sdarts , is simple yet expressible enough to enable building sophisticated metasearch engines . sdarts can be viewed as an instantiation of sdlip with metasearch-specific elements from starts . we also report on our experience building three sdarts-compliant wrappers : for locally available plain-text document-collections , for locally available xml-document collections , and for external web-accessible collections . these wrappers were developed to be easily customizable for new collections . our work was developed as part of columbia university 's digital-libraries initiative -- phase 2 (dli2) project , which involves the departments of computer-science , medical-informatics , and electrical-engineering , the columbia university libraries , and a large number of industrial partners . the main goal of the project is to provide personalized-access to a distributed patient-care digital-library .
