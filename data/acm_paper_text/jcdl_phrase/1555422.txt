generalized formal-models for faceted user-interfaces faceted-metadata and navigation have become major topics in library-science , information-retrieval and human-computer-interaction (hci) . this work surveys a range of extant approaches in this design-space , classifying systems along several relevant dimensions . we use that survey to analyze the organization of data and its querying within faceted-browsing systems . we contribute formal entity-relationship (er) and relational-data models that explain that organization and relational-query models that explain systems ' browsing functionality . we use these types of models since they are widely used to conceptualize data and to model back-end data stores . their structured nature also suggests ways in which both the models and faceted systems might be extended .
