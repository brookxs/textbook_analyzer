preparing resource-discovery for digitized music : an analysis of an australian application this paper examines procedures for the creation and delivery of digital-music that are being undertaken by contributors to the national library of australia 's federated music gateway musicaustralia . the case-study discusses access to and preservation of digital material as key drivers of the digitization movement , and compares projects being undertaken worldwide . also analyzed are the underlying digitization principles and standards , and metadata-schemas for the description and exchange of digital-objects which facilitate record exchange and improve audience reach . the paper provides an overview of some individual contributing institutions , however particular focus is placed on the state library of queensland 's (slq) approach to preparing its unique queensland music collection for digital-resource discovery in musicaustralia . a detailed analysis of slq 's strategy is presented , including its risk-management-approach to copyright implications , and consideration of infrastructure issues affecting the creation , preservation and online delivery of its digital-music objects . whilst slq 's current digital-music collection is relatively small , it has become core business of slq 's arts and humanities branch , and the collection will expand with the continued incorporation of music material unique to queensland into the collection . slq has developed a sound foundation for digitization based on widely endorsed principles and standards which should allow this to effectively occur .
