structure-extraction from pdf-based book documents nowadays pdf-documents have become a dominating knowledge-repository for both the academia and industry largely because they are very convenient to print and exchange . however , the methods of automated structure-information extraction are yet to be fully explored and the lack of effective methods hinders the information-reuse of the pdf-documents . to enhance the usability for pdf-formatted electronic-books , we propose a novel computational-framework to analyze the underlying physical-structure and logical-structure . the analysis is conducted at both page level and document level , including global typographies , reading order , logical elements , chapter/section hierarchy and metadata . moreover , two characteristics of pdf-based books , i.e. , style consistency in the whole book document and natural rendering order of pdf-files , are fully exploited in this paper to improve the conventional image-based structure-extraction methods . this paper employs the bipartite-graph as a common structure for modeling various tasks , including reading order recovery , figure and caption association , and metadata-extraction . based on the graph-representation , the optimal-matching (om) method is utilized to find the global optima in those tasks . extensive benchmarking using real-world-data validates the high efficiency and discrimination ability of the proposed method .
