ncore : architecture and implementation of a flexible , collaborative digital library ncore is an open-source architecture and software-platform for creating flexible , collaborative digital libraries . ncore was developed by the national-science-digital-library (nsdl) project , and it serves as the central technical-infrastructure for nsdl . ncore consists of a central fedora-based digital-repository , a specific data-model , an api , and a set of backend services and frontend tools that create a new model for collaborative , contributory digital-libraries . this paper describes ncore , presents and analyzes its architecture , tools and services ; and reports on the experience of nsdl in building and operating a major digital-library on it over the past year and the experience of the digital library for earth systems-education in porting their existing digital-library and tools to the ncore platform .
