ca n't see the forest for the trees ? : a citation-recommendation system scientists continue to find challenges in the ever increasing amount of information that has been produced on a world wide scale , during the last decades . when writing a paper , an author searches for the most relevant citations that started or were the foundation of a particular topic , which would very likely explain the thinking or algorithms that are employed . the search is usually done using specific keywords submitted to literature-search engines such as google-scholar and citeseer . however , finding relevant citations is distinctive from producing articles that are only topically similar to an author 's proposal . in this paper , we address the problem of citation-recommendation using a singular-value-decomposition approach . the models are trained and evaluated on the citeseer digital-library . the results of our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves significant success when compared with collaborative-filtering methods on the citation-recommendation task .
