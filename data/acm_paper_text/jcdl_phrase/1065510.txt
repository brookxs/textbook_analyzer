building image-based-electronic-editions using the edition production technology we demonstrate the edition production technology (ept) , an integrated-development-environment for building image-based-electronic-editions (ibee) . ept is developed in java on top of eclipse-platform and benefits from the openness of eclipse 's plugin-architecture and its portability (currently ept runs on windows-xp , linux , and mac-os-x) . ept provides software-support for building image-based digital-libraries of historic-documents . starting with high-resolution-images of manuscripts and transcriptions of them , ept tools provide support for creating xml encoding of the electronic edition , searching the electronic edition , linking text and images , and publishing the electronic edition (using filters and xslt) .
