a framework for collaborative information environments and unified access to distributed digital content in this demo , we will present two prototypes of digital-information portals developed using a new common framework : the high-performance-computing virtual consultant and the tsunami-digital-library . this framework supports the creation of digital-library portals that include not only local data but distributed-content that is not under the control of the portal maintainers , such as remote web-sites . the framework provides a common user interface across all resources , even if the resources are served by a remote web-site . furthermore , the framework contains features that support effective low maintenance operation and intelligent learning search and layout-algorithms .
