ranking experts using author-document-topic graphs expert-search or recommendation involves the retrieval of people (experts) in response to a query and on occasion , a given set of constraints . in this paper , we address expert-recommendation in academic domains that are different from web and intranet environments studied in trec . we propose and study graph-based models for expertise-retrieval with the objective of enabling search using either a topic (e.g. `` information-extraction '') or a name (e.g. `` bruce croft '') . we show that graph-based-ranking schemes despite being `` generic '' perform on par with expert-ranking models specific to topic-based and name-based querying .
