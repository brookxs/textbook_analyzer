preserving digital-data in heterogeneous-environments digital-preservation aims at maintaining digital-objects accessible over a long period of time , regardless of the challenges of organizational or technological changes or failures . in particular , data produced in e-science domains could be reliably stored in today 's data-grids , taking advantage of the natural properties of this kind of infrastructure to support redundancy . however , to achieve reliability we must take into account failure interdependency . taking into account the fact that correlated failures can affect multiple components and potentially cause complete loss of data , we propose a solution to evaluate redundancy-strategies in the context of heterogeneous-environments such as data-grids . this solution is based on a simulation-engine that can be used not only to support the process of designing the preservation environment and related policies , but also later on to observe and control the deployed system .
