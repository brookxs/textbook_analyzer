digital facsimile editions and on-line-editing digitizing a large-collection of books is an expensive and time-consum ing task-but there may be volunteers all over the world who are willing to do a small portion of the task . this poster describes a system for making digital facsimile editions-e-books consisting of page images and ocred but uncorrected text . the user can choose to view low or high-resolution page images or text for each page or search the text . authenticated users with little or no training can correct the text on-line , and the corrections are incorporated in the document . source-code is available for the described implementation , which is a part of the christian classics ethereal library (http://www.ccel.org) .
