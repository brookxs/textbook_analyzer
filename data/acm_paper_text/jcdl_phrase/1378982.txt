data-visualization applications in virtual globe software focusing on the intersection of visual-data mapping and virtual globe software , this application is part digital-library and part analytical tool . it combines data-sets into a collaborative database and visualizes the information through google-earth overlays . this user-centered interface makes previously hard-to-use public-information (e.g. census-data) accessible and easily interpretable . we are presenting an interactive-application named geodatum that allows users to upload their databases and display this information through a number of visualization-tools , either individually or comparatively . the software is an open-source web-application with multiple goals . primarily , it is a central repository for both geographic boundaries and the data related to those boundaries . in addition , it gives users the ability to create dynamic-visualizations viewable in google-earth 's extensible kml environment , complete with full 3d renderings and animations . the trade-off is that anyone who wants to use the application to generate visualizations will leave their data for public-use . the software 's core functionality is to allow users to import their own shapefiles as well as csvs containing data about the geographic areas . shapefiles are an industry standard gis format supported by numerous software applications including arcgis . this software will convert this information into kml files and google-earth overlays . while it can display publicly available data-sets , it also allows a user to include their own information , thus making it a useful internal analytic tool for private interests as well . we will present a case-study done with the brooklyn public-library that utilizes this tool in the service of a project on urban-planning and analysis .
