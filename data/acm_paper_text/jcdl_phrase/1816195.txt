a-digital library architecture supporting massive small files and efficient replica maintenance in this paper , we presented a service-infrastructure based on distributed-file-system for massive-storage in digital-library . in addition , we addressed the small-file problem by merging small files into big ones , and proposed a novel dynamic replica number adjustment scheme to ensure the maximal availability and reliability in a limited storage space .
