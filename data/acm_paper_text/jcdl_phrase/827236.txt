palau community college-belau national museum image archives digitization and access project this poster presentation will describe a collaboration project between the palau community-college (pcc) library and the belau national museum (bnm) . the project , funded by a two-year u.s. institute-of-museum-and-library-services (imls) national leadership grant , will enhance access to the bnm media-collection . the media-collection is in great demand , and the pressures of human use exacerbate an already tenuous situation for the long-term-preservation of the images . while digitization is not viewed as the preservation solution , it will assist the museum to lessen the impact of human handling . by making the media-collection more accessible through integration of the pcc library 's online catalog , a much wider audience will be reached , and mishandling of the original images will be significantly reduced.the pcc website , currently under final development will link the library webcollection plus which will contain digitized images selected from the extensive photo archives , as well as digitized images of the ethnographic and other objects in the museum 's collection , including contemporary-art . this poster session will enable viewers to see the range of images included in the project.this poster presentation will enable researchers to learn how this project will support scholarly research .
