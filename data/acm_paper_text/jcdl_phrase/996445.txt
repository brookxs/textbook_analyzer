capturing content for virtual-museums : from pieces to exhibits virtual-museums provide ways to capture the content of a real museum in a-digital (electronic) form and make this digital form more universally available . this poster describes a novel method for digitally recording not only individual museum pieces , but entire museum exhibits (consisting of one or more rooms or spaces) . the methodology allows anyone with access to the-internet or a pc to experience anywhere , anytime , any part of the museum 's collection or exhibits (past , present and future) . users can explore the museum exhibits in a virtual-reality that is both spatially accurate and visually compelling . all objects and 3d scenes are seen in precise full color photographic quality detail . the scene and objects are polygonal-meshes representing the surfaces of objects . this permits making measurements directly on the scene with millimeter precision . the methodology , its application to capturing museum exhibits , and examples of exhibits recorded using this technique are described . this work is part of the virseum project (http://ils unc edu/bmh/virseum) at the school of information and library-science at the university of north carolina at chapel hill (unc) . in addition to the standard capture of items and exhibits for virtual access , this methodology opens the door for many other applications , including the design of virtual (never physically implemented) exhibits and pieces .
