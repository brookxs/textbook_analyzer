improving optical-character-recognition through efficient multiple system alignment individual optical-character-recognition (ocr) engines vary in the types of errors they commit in recognizing text , particularly poor quality text . by aligning the output of multiple ocr engines and taking advantage of the differences between them , the error-rate based on the aligned lattice of recognized words is significantly lower than the individual ocr word-error-rates . this lattice error-rate constitutes a lower-bound among aligned alternatives from the ocr output . results from a collection of poor quality mid-twentieth century typewritten documents demonstrate an average reduction of 55.0 \ % in the error-rate of the lattice of alternatives and a realized word-error-rate (wer) reduction of 35.8 \ % in a dictionary-based selection-process . as an important precursor , an innovative admissible heuristic for the a * algorithm is developed , which results in a significant reduction in state-space-exploration to identify all optimal-alignments of the ocr text output , a necessary step toward the construction of the word hypothesis lattice . on average 0.0079 \ % of the state space is explored to identify all optimal-alignments of the documents .
