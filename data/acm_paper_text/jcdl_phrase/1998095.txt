classification of user-interest patterns using a virtual folksonomy user-interest in topics and resources is known to be recurrent and to follow specific patterns , depending on the type of topic or resource . traditional methods for predicting reoccurring patterns are based on ranking and associative models . in this paper we identify several ` canonical ' patterns by clustering keywords related to visited resources , making use of a large repository of web-usage data . the keywords are derived from a ` virtual ' folksonomy of tags assigned to these resources using a collaborative bookmarking system .
