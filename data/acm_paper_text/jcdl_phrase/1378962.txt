a fedora librarian interface the fedora content-management-system embodies a powerful and flexible digital-object model . this paper describes a new open-source-software front-end that enables end-user librarians to transfer documents and metadata in a variety of formats into a fedora repository . the main graphical facility that fedora itself provides for this task operates on one document at a time and is not librarian-friendly . a batch driven alternative is possible , but requires documents to be converted beforehand into the xml-format used by the repository , necessitating a need for programming-skills . in contrast , our new scheme allows arbitrary collections of documents residing on the user 's computer (or the-web at large) to be ingested into a fedora repository in one operation , without a need for programming expertise . provision is also made for editing existing documents and metadata , and adding new ones . the documents can be in a wide variety of different formats , and the user-interface is suitable for practicing librarians . the design capitalizes on our experience in building the greenstone librarian interface and participating in dozens of workshops with librarians worldwide .
