the effectiveness of automatically structured-queries in digital-libraries structured or fielded metadata is the basis for many digital-library services , including searching and browsing . yet , little is known about the impact of using structure on the effectiveness of such services . in this paper , we investigate a key research question : do structured-queries improve effectiveness in dl searching ? to answer this question , we empirically compared the use of unstructured queries to the use of structured-queries . we then tested the capability of a simple bayesian-network system , built on top of a dl retrieval-engine , to infer the best structured-queries from the keywords entered by the user . experiments performed with 20 subjects working with a dl containing a large-collection of computer-science literature clearly indicate that structured-queries , either manually constructed or automatically generated , perform better than their unstructured counterparts , in the majority of cases . also , automatic structuring of queries appears to be an effectiveand viable alternative to manual structuring that may significantly reduce the burden on users .
