visual-interfaces for stimulating exploratory-search exploration is an activity that people undertake to broaden their knowledge on a certain topic . in contrast to regular search , which is typically aimed at obtaining a specific answer to a specific question , exploratory-search should give a more complete overview of a topic . further it should enable the discovery of related aspects , such as people , places , times and locations . exploration demands more time , effort and creativity from the user , but rewards the user with deeper knowledge . therefore , users need to be stimulated to bring exploration in regular goal-directed-search activities . in this paper we present a user-study in which we investigate different kinds of exploratory-behavior and goals , as well as different kinds of visualizations to support exploration .
