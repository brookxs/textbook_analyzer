world explorer : visualizing aggregate data from unstructured-text in geo-referenced collections the availability of map interfaces and location-aware devices makes a growing amount of unstructured , geo-referenced-information available on the web . this type of information can be valuable not only for browsing , finding and making sense of individual items , but also in aggregate form to help understand data trends and features . in particular , over twenty million geo-referenced-photos are now available on flickr , a photo-sharing website - the first major collection of its kind . these photos are often associated with user-entered unstructured-text labels (i.e. , tags) . we show how we analyze the tags associated with the geo-referenced flickr images to generate aggregate knowledge in the form of `` representative tags '' for arbitrary areas in the world . we use these tags to create a visualization-tool , world explorer , tha tcan help expose the content of the data , using a map-interface to display the derived tags and the original photo items . we perform a qualitative-evaluation of world explorer that outlines the visualization 's benefits in browsing this type of content . we provide insights regarding the aggregate versus individual-item requirements in browsing digital geo-referenced material .
