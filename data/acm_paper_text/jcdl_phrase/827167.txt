learning digital-library technology across borders this paper describes the background context and initial findings from an ongoing case-study of an electronic-theses-and-dissertations (etd) digital-library (dl) project in brazil . the specific focus of the case-study centers on the activities of a brazilian government-agency acting as a mediator between software-developers - primarily academic institutions in the united-states - and university clients in brazil . the authors highlight the loosely integrated nature of the dl technology , and the uncertain relationship between developers and users in terms of support . these circumstances reinforce a view of technology-transfer as a process of organizational-learning . as a consequence , the mediating institution in the study is viewed as assuming multiple roles in advancing the project .
