multimodal alignment of scholarly documents and their presentations we present a multimodal-system for aligning scholarly docu - ments to corresponding presentations in a fine-grained man - ner (i.e. , per presentation slide and per paper section) . our method improves upon a state-of-the-art baseline that em - ploys only textual-similarity . based on an analysis of base - line errors , we propose a three-pronged alignment-system that combines textual , image , and ordering information to establish alignment . our results show a statistically sig - nificant improvement of 25 % , confirming the importance of visual-content in improving alignment-accuracy .
