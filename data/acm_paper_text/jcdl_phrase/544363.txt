introduction to the open-archives-initiative protocol for metadata-harvesting the open-archives-initiative protocol for metadata-harvesting (oai-pmh) [1] is a relatively new interoperability standard that is gaining much attention from existing and new digital-libraries . it is currently advocated by many communities (including ndltd , ncstrl , and nsdl) to fulfill their metadata-interoperability requirements.this tutorial is aimed at introducing individuals to the concepts underlying the oai and the harvesting protocol , as well as providing sufficient information to allow attendees to almost immediately implement the current standard (oai-pmh v2 .0) on their own archives or in their own communities . attendees will be introduced to both organizational and technical issues that need to be addressed when building new systems or extending existing systems , either in the capacity of being providers of data , users of data , or both . wherever appropriate , references will be made to best-practices that have emerged in the community of oai implementers since the initial release of the protocol . attendees will also be familiarized with tools developed within the oai community to support the implementation of the protocol .
