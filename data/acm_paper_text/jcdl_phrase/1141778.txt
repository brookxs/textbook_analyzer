automatic-categorization of figures in scientific documents figures are very important non-textual information contained in scientific documents . current digital-libraries do not provide users tools to retrieve documents based on the information available within the figures . we propose an architecture for retrieving documents by integrating figures and other information . the initial step in enabling integrated document-search is to categorize figures into a set of pre-defined types . we propose several categories of figures based on their functionalities in scholarly-articles . we have developed a machine-learning-based approach for automatic-categorization of figures . both global-features , such as texture , and part features , such as lines , are utilized in the architecture for discriminating among figure categories . the proposed approach has been evaluated on a testbed document-set collected from the citeseer scientific-literature digital-library . experimental-evaluation has demonstrated that our algorithms can produce acceptable results for realworld use . our tools will be integrated into a scientific document digital-library .
