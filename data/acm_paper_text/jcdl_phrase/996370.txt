etana-dl : a-digital library for integrated handling of heterogeneous archaeological data archaeologists have to deal with vast quantities of information , generated both in the field and laboratory . that information is heterogeneous in nature , and different projects have their own systems to store and use it . this adds to the challenges regarding collaborative-research between such projects as well as information-retrieval for other more general purposes . this paper describes our approach towards creating etana -- dl , a-digital library (dl) to help manage these vast quantities of information and to provide various kinds of services . the 5s framework for modeling a dl gives us an edge in understanding this vast and complex-information space , as well as in designing and prototyping a dl to satisfy information-needs of archaeologists and other user-communities .
