a search-engine approach to estimating temporal-changes in gender orientation of first names this paper presents an approach for predicting the gender orientation of any given first name over time based on a set of search-engine-queries with the name prefixed by masculine and feminine markers (e.g. , `` uncle taylor '') . we hypothesize that these markers can capture the great majority of variability in gender orientation , including temporal-changes . to test this hypothesis , we train a logistic-regression-model , with time-varying marker weights , using marker counts from bing.com to predict male/female counts for 85,406 names in us social-security administration (ssa) data during 1880-2008 . the model misclassifies 2.25 % of the people in the ssa dataset (slightly worse than the 1.74 % pure error-rate) and provides accurate predictions for names beyond the ssa . the misclassification rate is higher in recent years (due to increasing name diversity) , for general english words (e.g. , will) , for names from certain countries (e.g. , china) , and for rare names . however , the model tends to err on the side of caution by predicting neutral/unknown rather than false-positive . as hypothesized , the markers also capture temporal-patterns of androgyny . for example , daughter is a stronger female predictor for recent years while grandfather is a stronger male predictor around the turn of the 20th century . the model has been implemented as a web-tool called genni (available via http://abel.lis.illinois.edu/) that displays the predicted proportion of females vs. males over time for any given name . this should be a valuable resource for those who utilize names in order to discern gender on a large-scale , e.g. , to study the roles of gender-and-diversity in scholarly-work based on digital-libraries and bibliographic-databases where the authors ? names are listed .
