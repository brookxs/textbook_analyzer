modeling search-assistance mechanisms within web-scale discovery systems the university of illinois library has been conducting transaction log analyses to model user-search-behaviors within our library gateway . these analyses have informed the development and implementation of various search-assistance mechanisms designed to facilitate search-strategy modification and enhance user-search navigation methods . this paper discusses the efforts to effectively overlay search-assistance mechanisms into the web-scale discovery-system environment . these search-assistance mechanisms seek to meet user-search needs and to address known issues with web-scale systems . this paper describes an evolving search-assistance model being deployed in a web-scale environment and reports our findings from transaction log studies and user-surveys .
