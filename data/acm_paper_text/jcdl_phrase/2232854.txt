learning topics and related passages in books the number of books available online is increasing , but user-interfaces may not be taking full advantage of advances in machine-learning-techniques that could help users navigate , explore , discover and understand interesting and useful content in books . using a group of ten students and over one thousand crowdsourced judgments , we conducted multiple user studies to evaluate topics and related passages in books , all learned by topic-modeling . using ten books , selected from humanities (e.g. plato 's republic) , social-sciences (e.g. marx 's capital) and sciences (e.g. einstein 's relativity) , and four different evaluation experiments , we show that users agree that the learned topics are coherent and important to the book , and related to the automatically generated passages . we show how crowdsourced evaluations are useful , and can complement more focused evaluations using students who have studied the texts . this work provides a framework for (1) learning topics and related passages in books , and (2) evaluating those learned topics and passages , and moves one step toward automatic-annotation to support topic navigation of books .
