following bibliometric footprints : the acm digital-library and the evolution of computer-science using bibliometric methods , this exploratory work shows evidence of transitions in the field of computer-science since the emergence of hci as a distinct sub-discipline . we mined the acm digital-library in order to expose relationships between sub-disciplines in computer-science , focusing in particular on the transformational nature of the sig computer-human-interaction (chi) in relation to other sigs . our results suggest shifts in the field due to broader social , economic and political changes in computing research and are intended as a prolegomena to further investigations .
