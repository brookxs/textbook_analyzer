designing a language for creating conceptual browsing interfaces for digital-libraries conceptual browsing interfaces can help educators and learners to locate and use learning-resources in educational-digital-libraries ; in particular , resources that are aligned with nationally-recognized learning goals . towards this end , we are developing a strand map library service , based on the maps published by the american association for the advancement of science (aaas) . this service includes two public-interfaces : (1) a graphical-user-interface for use by teachers and learners and (2) a programmatic-interface that enables developers to construct conceptual browsing interfaces using dynamically generated components . here , we describe our iterative , rapid-prototyping design methodology , and the initial round of language-type components that have been implemented and evaluated .
