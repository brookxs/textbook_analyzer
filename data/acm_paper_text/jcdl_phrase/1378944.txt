acceptance and use of electronic library-services in ugandan universities university libraries in developing-countries (dcs) , hampered by developmental problems , find it hard to provide electronic-services . donor communities have come in to bridge this technology gap by providing funds to university libraries for information-technology infrastructure , enabling these university libraries to provide electronic library-services to patrons . however , for these services to be utilized effectively , library end-users must accept and use them . to investigate this process in uganda , this study modifies `` the unified-theory-of-acceptance-and-use-of-technology '' (utaut) by replacing `` effort-expectancy '' and `` voluntariness '' with `` relevancy '' , `` awareness '' and `` benefits '' factors . in so doing , we developed the service-oriented utaut (soutaut) model whose dependent constructs predict 133 \ % of the variances in user-acceptance and use of e-library services . the study revealed that relevancy moderated by awareness plays a major factor in acceptance and use of e-library services in dcs .
