building a research-library for the history-of-the-web this paper describes the building of a research-library for studying the-web , especially research on how the structure-and-content of the-web change over time . the library is particularly aimed at supporting social-scientists for whom the-web is both a fascinating social phenomenon and a mirror on society.the library is built on the collections of the-internet archive , which has been preserving a crawl of the-web every two months since 1996 . the technical challenges in organizing this data for research fall into two categories : high-performance-computing to transfer and manage the very-large amounts of data , and human-computer-interfaces that empower research by non-computer specialists .
