segregating and extracting overlapping data points in two-dimensional plots most search-engines index the textual content of documents in digital-libraries . however , scholarly-articles frequently report important findings in figures for visual impact and the contents of these figures are not indexed . these contents are often invaluable to the researcher in various fields , for the purposes of direct comparison with their own work . therefore , searching for figures and extracting figure data are important problems . to the best of our knowledge , there exists no tool to automatically extract data from figures in digital-documents . if we can extract data from these images automatically and store them in a database , an end-user can query and combine data from multiple digital-documents simultaneously and efficiently . we propose a framework based on image-analysis and machine-learning to extract information from 2-d plot images and store them in a database . the proposed algorithm identifies a 2-d plot and extracts the axis labels , legend and the data points from the 2-d plot . we also segregate overlapping shapes that correspond to different data points . we demonstrate performance of individual algorithms , using a combination of generated and real-life images .
