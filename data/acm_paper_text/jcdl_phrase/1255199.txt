task-based interaction with an integrated multilingual , multimedia-information-system : a formative-evaluation this paper describes a formative-evaluation of an integrated multilingual , multimedia-information-system , a series of user-studies designed to guide system-development . the system includes automatic-speech-recognition for english , chinese , and arabic , automatic-translation from chinese and arabic into english , and query-based and profile-based search options . the study-design emphasizes repeated evaluation with the same (increasingly experienced) participants , exploration of alternative task designs , rich qualitative and quantitative data-collection , and rapid analysis to provide the timely-feedback needed to support iterative and responsive development . results indicate that users presented with materials in a language that they do not know can generate remarkably useful work products , but that integration of transcription , translation , search and profile-management poses challenges that would be less evident were each technology to be evaluated in isolation .
