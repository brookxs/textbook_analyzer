what humanists want : how scholars use source materials despite the growing prominence of digital-libraries as tools to support humanities scholars , little is known about the work-practices and needs of these scholars as they pertain to working with source-documents . in this paper we present our findings from a formative user-study consisting of semi-structured-interviews with eight scholars . we find that the use of source materials (by which we mean the original physical-documents or digital-facsimiles with minimal editorial intervention) in scholarship is not a simple , straight-forward examination of a document in isolation . instead , scholars study source materials as an integral part of a complex ecosystem of inquiry that seeks to understand both the text being studied and the context in which that text was created , transmitted and used . drawing examples from our interviews , we address critical questions of why scholars use source-documents and what information they hope to gain by studying them . we also briefly summarize key note-taking practices as a means for assessing the potential to design user-interfaces that support scholarly work-practices .
