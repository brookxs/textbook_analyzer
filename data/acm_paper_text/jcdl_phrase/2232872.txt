web-based citation parsing , correction and augmentation considering the tremendous value of citation metadata , many methods have been proposed to automate citation metadata-extraction (cme) . the existing methods primarily rely on the content-analysis of citation text . however , the results from such content-based methods are often unreliable . moreover , the extracted citation metadata is only a small part of the relevant metadata that spreads across the-internet . as opposed to the content-based cme methods , this paper proposes a web-based cme approach and a citation enriching system , called as biball , which is capable of correcting the parsing results of content-based cme methods and augmenting citation metadata by leveraging relevant bibliographic-data from digital-repositories and cited-by publications on the web . biball consists of four main components : citation parsing , web-based bibliographic-data retrieval , irrelevant bibliographic-data filtering , and relevant bibliographic-data integration . the system has been tested on the publicly available flux-cim dataset . experimental-results show that biball significantly improves the citation parsing-accuracy and augments the metadata of the original citation .
