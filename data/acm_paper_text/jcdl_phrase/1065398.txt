information-synthesis : a new approach to explore secondary information in scientific-literature advances in both technology and publishing practices continue to increase the quantity of scientific-literature that is available electronically . in this paper , we introduce the information-synthesis process , a new approach that enables scientists to visualize , explore , and resolve contradictory findings that are inevitable when multiple empirical-studies explore the same natural-phenomena . central to the information-synthesis approach is a cyber-infrastructure that provides a scientist with both primary and secondary information from an article and structured-information resources . to demonstrate this approach , we have developed the multi-user , information-extraction for information-synthesis (metis) system . metis is an interactive-system that automates critical tasks within the information-synthesis process . we provide two case-studies that demonstrate the utility of the information-synthesis approach .
