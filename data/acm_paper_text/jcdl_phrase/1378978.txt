digmap : a service for searching and browsing old maps digmap aims to become the main international resource-discovery service for digitized old maps existing in libraries . the service reuses metadata from european national libraries and other relevant third party metadata sources . the gathered metadata is enhanced locally with geographical indexing and with record linking/clustering , leveraging on geographic gazetteers and authority-files . when available , the images of the maps are also processed to extract potentially relevant features . this made it possible to develop a rich integrated-environment for searching and browsing services with four perspectives : image 's features , textual , geographic and temporal information .
