xml semantics and digital-libraries the lack of a standard formalism for expressing the semantics of an xml vocabulary is a major obstacle to the development of high-function interoperable-digital-libraries . xml-document type definitions (dtds) provide a mechanism for specifying the syntax of an xml vocabulary , but there is no comparable mechanism for specifying the semantics of that vocabulary -- where semantics simply means the basic facts and relationships represented by the occurrence of xml constructs . a substantial loss of functionality and interoperability in digital-libraries results from not having a common machine-readable formalism for expressing these relationships for the xml vocabularies currently being used to encode content . recently a number of projects and standards have begun taking up related topics . we describe the problem and our own project .
