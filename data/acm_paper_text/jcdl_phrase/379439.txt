integrating automatic genre analysis into digital-libraries with the number and types of documents in digital-library-systems incr easing , tools for automatically organizing and presenting the content have to be found . while many approaches focus on topic-based organization and structuring , hardly any system incorporates automatic structural-analysis and representation . yet , genre information (unconsciously) forms one of the most distinguishing features in conventional libraries and in information searches . in this paper we present an approach to automatically analyze the structure-of-documents and to integrate this information into an automatically created content-based organization . in the resulting visualization , documents on similar topics , yet representing different genres , are depicted as books in differing colors . this representation supports users intuitively in locating relevant-information presented in a relevant form .
