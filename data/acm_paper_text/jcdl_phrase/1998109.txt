using national-bibliographies for rights clearance in the process of digitizing a book , a library needs to clear the rights associated with it . rights clearance is a time consuming process , and possibly , with higher costs than the actual digitization . to analyze the rights situation , a range of information is required , which is distributed across several national-databases hosted in national libraries , publishers and collective rights organizations . national-bibliographies are key-data sources in these processes , as they are the only source to identify all the publications of a specific intellectual work per country . however , national-bibliographies are not built for rights clearance purposes . the information in bibliographic-records results from cataloguing practices with users and library-management in mind , and links between different publications of a single intellectual work are not available . this paper presents a study on the implications of data-quality problems of national-bibliographies for the identification of all publications of a work . it also presents an approach for work data-extraction and matching based on similarity of the most discriminatory attributes of works . evaluation has shown that the data-quality problems are difficult to overcome , as our best approach achieved an f0,5-measure of 0,91 . these results help to speed up the process of discovering all relevant publications per work significantly , with sufficient recall .
