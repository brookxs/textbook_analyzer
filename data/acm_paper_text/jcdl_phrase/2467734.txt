semiautomatic recognition and georeferencing of places in early maps early maps are a valuable resource for historical-research , this is why digital-libraries for early maps become a necessary tool for research-support in the age of information . in this article we introduce the referencing and annotation-tool (rat) , designed to extract information about all places displayed in a map and link them to a place on a modern map . rat automatically recognizes place markers in an early map according to a template specified by the user and estimates the position of the annotated place in the modern map , thus making georeferencing easier . after a brief summary on related projects , we describe the functionality of the system . we discuss the most important implementation details and factors influencing recognition-accuracy and performance . the advantages of our semiautomatic approach are high accuracy and a significant decrease of the user 's cognitive-load .
