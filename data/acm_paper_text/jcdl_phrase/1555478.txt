building a thailand researcher network based on a bibliographic database among many practical and domain-specific tasks , expertise-retrieval (er) has recently gained increasing attention in the information-retrieval and knowledge-management communities . this paper describes our ongoing project to design and implement an expert-retrieval system with the scope on researchers who work in thailand . in our current system-prototype , we assume that the areas of expertise among researchers can be extracted from bibliographic-databases . we use the science citation-index (sci) database to provide the information for representing the expert-profiles . from the sci database , we queried and retrieved publications covering from the year 2001 to 2008 by specifying the affiliation equal to `` thailand '' . the results contain a set of approximately 23,000 publications . we downloaded and extracted four related fields including authors (denoted by au) , controlled terms (denoted by id) , keywords (denoted by de) and subject category (denoted by sc) . to build a researcher network , we consider two types of relationships : direct and indirect . the direct (or social) relationship is defined as the co-authoring degree between one researcher to others . the co-authoring degree between two researchers , co-authoring (a , b) , can be calculated based on the co-occurrence-frequency between a and b found in the field au of 23,000 retrieved records . the indirect (or topical relationship is defined when two researchers have publications under the same topics . the topical degree between two researchers , topical (a , b) , can be calculated based on the similarity-measure between two sets of extracted keywords , keyword (a) and keyword (b) , representing researcher a and b , respectively . the keyword set can be extracted from the fields id , de and sc . an author with high frequencies on particular keywords is considered an expert in the corresponding research topics .
