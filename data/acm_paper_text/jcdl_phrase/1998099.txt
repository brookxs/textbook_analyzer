on identifying academic homepages for digital-libraries academic homepages are rich sources-of-information on scientific-research and researchers . most researchers provide information about themselves and links to their research-publications on their homepages . in this study , we address the following questions related to academic homepages : (1) how many academic homepages are there on the web ? (2) can we accurately discriminate between academic homepages and other webpages ? and (3) what information can be extracted about researchers from their homepages ? for addressing the first question , we use mark-recapture-techniques commonly employed in biometrics to estimate animal population sizes . our results indicate that academic homepages comprise a small fraction of the-web making automatic methods for discriminating them crucial . we study the performance of content-based features for classifying webpages . we propose the use of topic-models for identifying content-based features for classification and show that a small set of lda-based features out-perform term features selected using traditional techniques such as aggregate term frequencies or mutual-information . finally , we deal with the extraction of name and research interests information from an academic homepage . term-topic associations obtained from topic-models are used to design a novel , unsupervised-technique to identify short segments corresponding to research interests of the researchers specified in academic homepages . we show the efficacy of our proposed methods on all the three tasks by experimentally evaluating them on multiple publicly-available datasets .
