multi-view of the acm-classification system the acm computing classification system (ccs) is a hierarchical-classification system used to index and classify all the published literature of acm . they reflect major areas and topics of the computing field and they often serve as an overview and navigational guide to the field . however , similar to all the traditional classification-systems and subject domain thesauri , such an overview and navigational guide is static and sketchy , representing only a top-down representation of a domain . in this paper , we look into a 10-year period of acm literature and examine how the ccs terms are actually used in the acm digital-library and how the patterns of term usages show different term-relationships than those defined in the ccs . by comparing the dynamic statistical patterns of term usage with the static hierarchical-structures of the terms , we show that much can be gained by integrating both of them into an interactive-interface to provide better overview maps and navigational guides to the domain of computing .
