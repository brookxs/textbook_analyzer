a competitive environment for exploratory-query expansion most information-workers query digital-libraries many times a day . yet people have little opportunity to hone their skills in a controlled environment , or compare their performance with others in an objective way . conversely , although search-engine-logs record how users evolve queries , they lack crucial information about the user 's intent . this paper describes an environment for exploratory-query expansion that pits users against each other and lets them compete , and practice , in their own time and on their own workstation . the system captures query evolution behavior on predetermined information-seeking tasks . it is publicly available , and the code is open-source so that others can set up their own competitive environments .
