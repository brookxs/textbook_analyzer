an ethnographic-study of technical-support workers : why we did n't build a tech-support digital-library in this paper we describe the results of an ethnographic-study of the information behaviourss of university technical-support workers and their information-needs . the study looked at how the group identified , located and used information from a variety of sources to solve problems arising in the course of their work . the results of the investigation are discussed in the context of the feasibility of developing a potential information base that could be used by all members of the group . whilst a number of their requirements would easily be fulfilled by the use of a-digital library , other requirements would not . the paper illustrates the limitations of a-digital library with respect to the information behaviourss of this group of subjects and focuses on why a-digital library would not appear to be the ideal support-tool for their work .
