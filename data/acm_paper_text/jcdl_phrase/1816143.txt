crowdsourcing the assembly of concept-hierarchies the `` wisdom-of-crowds '' is accomplishing tasks that are cumbersome for individuals yet can not be fully automated by means of specialized computer algorithms . one such task is the construction of thesauri and other types of concept-hierarchies . human expert feedback on the relatedness and relative generality of terms , however , can be aggregated to dynamically construct evolving concept-hierarchies . the inpho (indiana philosophy ontology) project bootstraps feedback from volunteer users unskilled in ontology-design into a precise representation of a specific domain . the approach combines statistical text processing methods with expert feedback and logic-programming to create a dynamic semantic-representation of the discipline of philosophy . in this paper , we show that results of comparable quality can be achieved by leveraging the workforce of crowdsourcing services such as the amazon-mechanical-turk (amt) . in an extensive empirical-study , we compare the feedback obtained from amt 's workers with that from the inpho volunteer users providing an insight into qualitative differences of the two groups . furthermore , we present a set of strategies for assessing the quality of different users when gold standards are missing . we finally use these methods to construct a concept-hierarchy based on the feedback acquired from amt workers .
