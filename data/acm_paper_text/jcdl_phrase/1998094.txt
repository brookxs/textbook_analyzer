detecting and exploiting stability in evolving heterogeneous-information spaces individuals contribute content on the web at an unprecedented rate , accumulating immense quantities of (semi -) structured-data . wisdom of the crowds theory advocates that such information (or parts of it) is constantly overwritten , updated , or even deleted by other users , with the goal of rendering it more accurate , or up-to-date . this is particularly true for the collaboratively edited , semi-structured-data of entity repositories , whose entity profiles are consistently kept fresh . therefore , their core information that remain stable with the passage of time , despite being reviewed by numerous users , are particularly useful for the description of an entity . based on the above hypothesis , we introduce a classification-scheme that predicts , on the basis of statistical and content patterns , whether an attribute (i.e. , name-value pair) is going to be modified in the future . we apply our scheme on a large , real-world , versioned dataset and verify its effectiveness . our thorough experimental-study also suggests that reducing entity profiles to their stable parts conveys significant benefits to two common tasks in computer-science : information-retrieval and information-integration .
