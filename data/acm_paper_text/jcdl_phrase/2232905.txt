introducing high-performance-computing in digital-library processing workflows as larger collections need to be processed for digital-library projects , libraries have to adopt technologies of scale . we present a case that involved creating image derivatives using high-performance-computing (hpc) resources . this experience opens up possibilities to conduct various processing-tasks effectively and in reasonable time frames . most importantly , it enables library it-staff access to cyberinfrastructure that can address the computing challenges of large-scale digital-library projects .
