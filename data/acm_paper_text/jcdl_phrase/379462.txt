videograph : a new tool for video-mining and classification this paper introduces videograph , a new tool for video-mining and visu alizing the structure of the plot of a video-sequence . the main idea is to & lquo ; stitch & rquo ; together similar scenes which are apart in time . we give a fast-algorithm to do stitching and we show case-studies , where our approach (a) gives good features for classification (91 \ \ % accuracy) , and (b) results in videographs which reveal the logical-structure of the plot of the video-clips .
