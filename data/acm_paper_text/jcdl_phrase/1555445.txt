cost-and-benefit-analysis of mediated enterprise-search the utility of an enterprise-search system is determined by three key players : the information-retrieval (ir) system (the search-engine) , the enterprise users , and the service-provider who delivers the tailored ir service to its designated enterprise users . currently , evaluations of enterprise-search have been focused largely on the ir-system effectiveness and efficiency , only a relatively small amount of effort on the user 's involvement , and hardly any effort on the service-provider 's role . this paper will investigate the role of the service-provider . we propose a method that evaluates the cost and benefit for a service-provider of using a mediated-search engine - in particular , where domain-experts intervene on the ranking of the search-results from a search-engine . we test our cost and benefit evaluation-method in a case-study and conduct user-experiments to demonstrate it . our study shows that : 1) by making use of domain-experts ' relevance-assessments in search-result-ranking , the precision and the discount cumulated-gain of ranked-lists have been improved significantly (144 \ % and 40 \ % respectively) ; 2) the service-provider gains substantial return-on-investment and higher search-success rate by investing in domain-experts ' relevance-assessments ; and 3) the cost and benefit evaluation also indicates the type of queries to be selected from a query-log for evaluating an enterprise-search engine .
