a component repository for learning-objects : a progress report we believe that an important category of smet digital-library content will be highly interactive , explorable microworlds for teaching science , mathematics , and engineering concepts . such environments have proved extraordinarily time-consuming and difficult to produce , however , threatening the goals of widespread creation and use . one proposed solution for accelerating production has been the creation of repositories of reusable-software components or learning-objects . programmers would use such components to rapidly assemble larger-scale environments . although many agree on the value of this approach , few repositories of such components have been successfully created . we suggest some reasons for the lack of expected results and propose two strategies for developing such repositories . we report on a case-study that provides a proof-of-concept of these strategies . repositories . we report on a case-study that provides a proof-of-concept of these strategies . contributions from a more diverse audience , including especially those who have substantial classroom and pedagogical expertise but lack programming expertise . it also promotes the extraction of content from software so that collections may be better organized and more easily repurposed to meet the needs of a diverse audience of educators and students .
