search-behaviors in different task-types personalization of information-retrieval tailors search towards individual users to meet their particular information-needs by taking into account information about users and their contexts , often through implicit sources of evidence such as user-behaviors . task-types have been shown to influence search-behaviors including usefulness judgments . this paper reports on an investigation of user-behaviors associated with different task-types . twenty-two undergraduate journalism students participated in a controlled lab experiment , each searching on four tasks which varied on four dimensions : complexity , task product , task goal and task level . results indicate regular differences associated with different task-characteristics in several search-behaviors , including task-completion-time , decision-time (the time taken to decide whether a document is useful or not) , and eye-fixations , etc. . we suggest these behaviors can be used as implicit indicators of the user 's task-type .
