the multi-faceted use of the oai-pmh in the lanl repository this paper focuses on the multifaceted use of the oai-pmh in a repository architecture designed to store digital-assets at the research-library of the los alamos national laboratory (lanl) , and to make the stored assets available in a uniform way to various downstream applications . in the architecture , the mpeg-21-digital-item-declaration language is used as the xml-based format to represent complex digital objects . upon ingestion , these objects are stored in a multitude of autonomous oai-pmh repositories an oai -- pmh compliant repository index keeps track of the creation and location of all those repositories , whereas an identifier resolver keeps track of the location of individual objects . an oai-pmh federator is introduced as a single-point-of-access to downstream harvesters . it hides the complexity of the environment to those harvesters , and allows them to obtain transformations of stored objects while the proposed architecture is described in the context of the lanl library , the paper will also touch on its more general applicability .
