electronic-records processing : it 's a cinch ! in august 2011 , five project partners (the state library of north carolina , the north carolina state archives , north carolina libraries for virtual-education , elon university , and the university of north carolina at charlotte) began a collaboration to develop a computer application that collects , ingests , and authenticates the electronic-records that libraries and archives are often mandated to maintain . the application , called `` cinch , '' incorporates existing digital-curation technologies , but adds to their functionality by creating a pull-down (or capture) utility to gather content available from the-internet . the final product will be a lightweight , open-source-software tool that institutions required to collect and authenticate records on ingest can employ to retrieve and process their digital-content .
