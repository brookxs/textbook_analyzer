document-search interface-design for large-scale collections and intelligent-access as the universe of documents has enlarged from those available via the online catalog to a larger cluster of databases and web-accessible resources , interfaces are being created that can search multiple document collections simultaneously . also , searching for document surrogates is losing favor as more documents are digitized and distributed in full-text form . availability of full-text makes it possible for document-components such as tables , illustrations , citations , and references -- components that traditionally remained outside the scope of document searching -- to be considered and exploited by search-interface designers . additionally , due to the popularity of web-hyperlinking people are beginning to expect linking of documents across different collections based on common semantic or non-semantic attributes . increased research activity on artificial-intelligence techniques for document access is leading to more fundamental changes in document searching . it is now possible to delegate 100 \ % of the search effort to online-search agents . agents have been also created for performing tasks such as selecting appropriate collections , refining queries , and sorting results to assist with searches conducted in distributed-environments . the broad scope of the workshop is on the impact of above technological changes on search-interface design .
