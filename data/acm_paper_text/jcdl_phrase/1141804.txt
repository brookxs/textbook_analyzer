metadata-aggregation and automated digital-libraries : a retrospective on the nsdl experience over three years ago , the core integration team of the national-science-digital-library (nsdl) implemented a-digital library based on metadata-aggregation using dublin-core and oai-pmh . the initial expectation was that such low-barrier technologies would be relatively easy to automate and administer . while this architectural choice permitted rapid-deployment of a production nsdl , our three years of experience have contradicted our original expectations of easy automation and low people cost . we have learned that alleged `` low-barrier '' standards are often harder to deploy than expected . in this paper we report on this experience and comment on the general cost , the functionality , and the ultimate effectiveness of this architecture .
