enabling exploration : travelers in the middle-east archive in this paper , we describe the travelers in the middle-east archive (timea) , a-digital archive focused on western explorations in the middle-east between the 18th and early 20th centuries 7 . timea brings together tei-encoded texts and digital-images stored in dspace , research and teaching-materials in connexions , and gis maps made available online through arcims . by using the functionality of three distinct systems , timea enables users to more fully understand the materials , place them in context , and conduct queries . we outline the rationale for this architecture , the challenges it presents , and our approach to providing an integrated-user-experience .
