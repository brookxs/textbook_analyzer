supporting analysis of future-related-information in news archives and the-web a lot of future-related-information is available in news-articles or web-pages . this information can however differ to large extent and may fluctuate over time . it is therefore difficult for users to manually compare and aggregate it , and to re-construct the most probable course of future-events . in this paper we approach a problem of automatically generating summaries of future-events related to queries using data obtained from news-archive collections or from the-web . we propose two methods , explicit and implicit future-related-information detection . the former is based on analyzing the context of future temporal-expressions in documents , while the latter relies on detecting periodical patterns in historical document collections . we present a graph-based-visualization of future-related-information and demonstrate its usefulness through several examples .
