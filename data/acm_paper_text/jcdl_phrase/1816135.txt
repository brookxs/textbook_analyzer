exploiting time-based synonyms in searching document-archives query-expansion of named-entities can be employed in order to increase the retrieval-effectiveness . a peculiarity of named-entities compared to other vocabulary terms is that they are very dynamic in appearance , and synonym relationships between terms change with time . in this paper , we present an approach to extracting synonyms of named-entities over time from the whole history of wikipedia . in addition , we will use their temporal-patterns as a feature in ranking and classifying them into two types , i.e. , time-independent or time-dependent . time-independent synonyms are invariant to time , while time-dependent synonyms are relevant to a particular time period , i.e. , the synonym relationships change over time . further , we describe how to make use of both types of synonyms to increase the retrieval-effectiveness , i.e. , query-expansion with time-independent synonyms for an ordinary search , and query-expansion with time-dependent synonyms for a search wrt . temporal criteria . finally , through an evaluation based on trec collections , we demonstrate how retrieval-performance of queries consisting of named-entities can be improved using our approach .
