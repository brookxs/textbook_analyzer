a study of automation from seed url generation to focused web archive development : the ctrnet context in the event of emergencies and disasters , massive amounts of web-resources are generated and shared . due to the rapidly changing nature of those resources , it is important to start archiving them as soon as a disaster occurs . this led us to develop a prototype-system for constructing archives with minimum human-intervention using the seed urls extracted from tweet collections . we present the details of our prototype-system . we applied it to five tweet collections that had been developed in advance , for evaluation . we also identify five categories of non - relevant files and conclude with a discussion of findings from the evaluation .
