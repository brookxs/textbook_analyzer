chinese calligraphy specific-style-rendering system manifesting the handwriting characters with the specific style of a famous artwork is fascinating . in this paper , a system is built to render the user 's handwriting characters with a specific style . a stroke database is established firstly . when rendering a character , the strokes are extracted and recognized , then proper radicals and strokes are filtered , finally these strokes are deformed and the result is generated . the special-nine-grid (sng) is presented to help recognize radicals and strokes . the rule-base-stroke-deformation algorithm (rsda) is proposed to deform the original strokes according to the handwriting strokes . the rendering result manifests the specific style with high quality . it is feasible for people to generate the tablet or other artworks with the proposed system .
