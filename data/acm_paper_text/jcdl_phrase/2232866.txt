investigating keyphrase indexing with text denoising in this paper , we report on indexing performance by a state-of-the-art keyphrase indexer , maui , when paired with a text-extraction procedure called text denoising . text denoising is a method that extracts the denoised text , comprising the content-rich sentences , from full texts . the performance of the keyphrase indexer is demonstrated on three standard corpora collected from three domains , namely food and agriculture , high-energy-physics , and biomedical science . maui is trained using the full texts and denoised texts . the indexer , using its trained models , then extracts keyphrases from test-sets comprising full texts , and their denoised and noise parts (i.e. , the part of texts that remains after denoising) . experimental findings show that against a gold-standard , the denoised-text-trained indexer indexing full texts , performs either better than or as good as its benchmark performance produced by a full-text-trained indexer indexing full texts .
