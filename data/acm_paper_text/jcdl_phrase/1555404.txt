helping students with information-fragmentation , assimilation and notetaking the problem of information-fragmentation is especially acute for today 's college-students who manage and assimilate information in various forms while completing many of their academic tasks , and who must do so within the confines of standard software applications . the goal of this research is to provide students with a novel information-assimilation and notetaking tool that helps them more efficiently manage their electronic-information and overcome some of the fragmentation challenges they routinely experience . our global information gatherer prototype allows students to view , edit and store files of different types from within a single interface , and provides an integrated web-browser and notetaking functionality .
