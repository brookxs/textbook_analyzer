social-reference : aggregating online usage of scientific-literature in citeulike for clustering academic resources citation-based methods have been widely studied and employed for clustering academic resources and mapping science . although effective , these methods suffer from citation delay . in this study , we extend reference and citation-analysis to a broader notion from social perspective . we coin the term `` social-reference '' to refer to the references of literatures in social academic web environment . we propose clustering-methods using social-reference information from citeulike . we experiment for journal clustering and author clustering using social-reference and compare with citation-based methods . our experiments indicate : first , social-reference implies connections among literatures which are as effective as citation in clustering academic resources ; second , in practical settings , social reference-based clustering-methods are not as effective as citation-based ones due to the sparseness of social-reference data , but they can outperform in clustering new resources that have few citation .
