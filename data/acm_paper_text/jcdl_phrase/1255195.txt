retrieval-effectiveness of table-of-contents and subject-headings the effectiveness of two modes of subject representation - table-of-contents (toc) and subject-headings - in subject-searching in an online public access catalog (opac) system was investigated . the retrieval difference between toc and the library-of-congress subject-headings (lcsh) was statistically significant ; the effect of subject domain was not statistically significant ; users had better success matching their keywords to toc than to lcsh ; but their keywords often failed to retrieve items similar to the target items . these findings underscore the need to bridge user keywords to both toc and lcsh .
