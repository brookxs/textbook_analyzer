persistent annotations deserve new uris some digital-libraries support annotations , but sharing these annotations with other systems or across the-web is difficult because of the need of special applications to read and decode these annotations . due to the frequent change of web-resources , the annotation 's meaning can change if the underlying resources change . this project concentrates on minting a new uri for every annotation and creating a persistent and independent archived version of all resources . users should be able to select a segment of an image or a video to be part of the annotation . the media fragment uris described in the open annotation collaboration data-model can be used , but in practice they have limits , and they face the lack of support by the browsers . so in this project the segments of images , and videos can be used in the annotations without using media fragment uris .
