the adept digital-library architecture the alexandria digital earth prototype (adept) architecture is a framework for building distributed-digital-libraries of georeferenced-information . an adept system comprises one or more autonomous libraries , each of which provides a uniform-interface to one or more collections , each of which manages metadata for one or more items . the primary standard on which the architecture is based is the adept bucket-framework , which defines uniform client-level metadata query services that are compatible with heterogeneous underlying collections . adept functionality strikes a balance between the simplicity of web-document delivery and the richness of z39 .50 . the current adept implementation runs as servlet-based middleware and supports collections housed in arbitrary relational-databases .
