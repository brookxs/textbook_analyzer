an analysis of the named-entity-recognition problem in digital-library metadata information resources in digital-libraries are usually described , along with their context , by structured-data records , commonly referred as metadata . those records often contain unstructured-information in natural-language-text , since they typically follow a data-model which defines generic semantics for its data elements , or includes data elements modeled to contain free-text . the information contained in these data elements , although machine readable , resides in unstructured natural-language-texts that are difficult to process by computers . this paper addresses a particular task of information-extraction , typically called named-entity-recognition , which deals with the references to entities made by names occurring in the texts . this paper presents the results of a study of how the named-entity-recognition problem manifests itself in digital-library metadata . in particular , we present the main differences between performing named-entity-recognition in natural-language and in the text within metadata . the paper finalizes with a novel approach for named-entity-recognition in metadata .
