finding a catalog : generating analytical catalog records from well-structured digital texts one of the criticisms library users often make of catalogs is that they rarely include information below the bibliographic level . it is generally impossible to search a catalog for the titles and subjects of particular chapters or volumes . there has been no way to add this information to catalog records without exponentially increasing the workload of catalogers . at the same time , well-structured full-text xml transcriptions of printed works are becoming increasingly available . this paper describes how existing investments in full text digitization and structural markup combined with current named-entity-extraction technology can efficiently generate the detailed level of catalog data that users want , at no significant additional cost . this system is demonstrated on an existing digital-collection within the perseus digital-library .
