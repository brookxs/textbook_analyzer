how geography professors select materials for classroom lectures : implications for the design of digital-libraries a goal of the alexandria digital earth prototype (adept) project is to make primary-resources in geography useful for undergraduate instruction in ways that will promote inquiry-learning . the adept education and evaluation team interviewed professors about their use of geography information as they prepare for class lectures , as compared to their research activities . we found that professors desired the ability to search by concept (erosion , continental-drift , etc) as well as geographic-location , and that personal research collections were an important source of instructional-materials . resources in geo-spatial digital-libraries are typically described by location , but are rarely described by concept or educational-application . this paper presents implications for the design of an educational-digital-library from our observations of the lecture preparation process . findings include functionality requirements for digital-libraries and implications for the notion of digital-libraries as a shared information environment . the functional-requirements include definitions and enhancements of searching capabilities , the ability to contribute and to share personal-collections of resources , and the capability to manipulate data and images .
