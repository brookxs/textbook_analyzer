exposing the hidden-web for chemical-digital-libraries in recent years , the vast amount of digitally available content has lead to the creation of many topic-centered digital-libraries . also in the domain of chemistry more and more digital-collections are available , but the complex-query formulation still hampers their intuitive adoption . this is because information-seeking in chemical documents is focused on chemical entities , for which current standard search relies on complex structures which are hard to extract from documents . moreover , although simple keyword searches would often be sufficient , current collections simply can not be indexed by web-search providers due to the ambiguity of chemical substance names . in this paper we present a framework for automatically generating metadata-enriched index pages for all documents in a given chemical collection . all information is then linked to the respective documents and thus provides an easy to crawl metadata-repository promising to open up digital chemical libraries . our experiments , indexing an open-access journal , show that not only the documents can be found using a simple google search via the automatically created index pages , but also that the quality of the search is much more efficient than fulltext indexing in terms of both precision/recall and performance . finally , we compare our indexing against a classical structure-search and figured out that keyword-based-search can indeed solve at least some of the daily tasks in chemical workflows . to use our framework thus promises to expose a large part of the currently still hidden chemical web , making the techniques employed interesting for chemical-information providers like digital-libraries and open-access journals .
