building metadata-based navigation using semantic-web-standards : the dublin-core 2003 conference-proceedings one of the touted benefits of the-semantic-web is that it will make searches more precise and efficient by leveraging metadata about web -- delivered content . faceted-metadata retrieval is an approach to providing users access to large-collections of semi -- structured-data and content that promises an improvement in usability over that available using more traditional search-methods . in this demonstration we illustrate how the on -- line proceedings for the 2003 dublin-core conference were implemented by combining traditional and innovative knowledge-organization techniques . the 2003 dublin-core conference-proceedings served as a test -- bed for generating a faceted-metadata retrieval interface from instance metadata , ontologies , and controlled-vocabularies expressed in rdf and rdf schema . we share lessons-learned in the design-and-implementation of the proceedings , and in particular focus on emerging best-practices for representing and sharing metadata using dublin-core metadata recommendations , new interpretations of traditional library-and-information-science information-retrieval-techniques , and implementations of semantic-web-standards .
