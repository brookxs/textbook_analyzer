semantically augmented annotations in digitized map collections historic maps are valuable scholarly resources that record information often retained by no other written source . with the yuma map annotation-tool we want to facilitate collaborative-annotation for scholars studying historic maps , and allow for semantic-augmentation of annotations with structured , contextually relevant-information retrieved from linked-open-data sources . we believe that the integration of web-resource linkage into the scholarly annotation-process is not only relevant for collaborative-research , but can also be exploited to improve search-and-retrieval . in this paper , we introduce the compass experiment , an ongoing crowdsourcing effort in which we are collecting data that can serve as a basis for evaluating our assumption . we discuss the scope and setup of the experiment-framework and report on lessons-learned from the data collected so far .
