core : aggregation use-cases for open-access the push for free online availability of research outputs promoted by the open-access (oa) movement is undoubtedly transforming the publishing industry . however , the mere availability of research outputs is insufficient . to exploit the full potential of oa , it must be possible to search , discover , mine , analyse , etc. this content . to achieve this , it is essential to improve the existing oa technical-infrastructure to effectively support these functionalities . many of the vital benefits of oa are expected to come with the ability to reuse oa content in unanticipated ways . access to the oa content must therefore be flexible , yet practical , content-based and not just metadata based . in this demonstration , we present the core-system , which aggregates millions of oa resources from hundreds of oa repositories and journals . we discuss the use-cases aggregations should support and demonstrate how the core-system addresses them , including searching , discovering , mining and analyzing content . we also show how aggregated oa content can be reused to build new-applications on top of core 's functionality .
