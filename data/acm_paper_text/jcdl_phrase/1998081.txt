phrases as subtopical concepts in scholarly text-retrieval of subtopical concepts from scholarly-communication systems is now possible through a combination of text and metadata-analysis , augmented by user-search queries and click-logs . here we investigate how a `` phrase '' , defined as a variable-length sequence of vocabulary words , can be used to represent a concept . we present a method to extract such phrases from a text-corpus , and rank them using a citation-network measure , the compensated normalized link count (cnlc) , which measures the extent to which they are propagated along the citation structure of articles . we validate the ranking with actively and passively determined metrics : comparison with human-assigned keywords , and comparison with passively harvested terms from search-query-logs . this method is demonstrated on full texts and abstracts from 7 years of high-energy-physics articles from the arxiv preprint database .
