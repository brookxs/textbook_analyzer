vigor : a grouping oriented interface for search-and-retrieval in video-libraries in this paper , we present vigor (video-grouping , organisation and retrieval) a video-retrieval-system that allows users to group videos in order to facilitate video-retrieval tasks . in this way users are able to visualise and conceptualise many aspects of their search-tasks and carry out a localised search in order to solve a more global-search problem . the main objective of this work is to aid users while carrying out explorative video-retrieval tasks ; these tasks can be often ambiguous and multi-faceted . two user-evaluations were carried out in order to evaluate the usefulness of this grouping paradigm for assisting users . the first evaluation involved users carrying out broad tasks on youtube , and gave insights into the application of our interface to a vast online-video collection . the second evaluation involved users carrying out focused tasks on the trecvid-2007 video collection , allowing a comparison over a local collection , on which we could extract a number of content-based features . the results of our evaluations show that the use of the vigor system results in an increase in user-performance and user-satisfaction , showing the potential of a grouping paradigm for video-search for various tasks in a variety of diverse video collections .
