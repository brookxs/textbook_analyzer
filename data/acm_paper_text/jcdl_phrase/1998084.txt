that 's ' ' not ' ' ' ? ' or ' ? ' : a user-driven context-aware approach to erroneous metadata in digital-libraries in this paper we present a novel system for user-driven integration of name variants when interacting with web-based-information-systems . the growth and diversity of online-information means that many users experience disambiguation and collocation-errors in their information-searching . we approach these issues via a client-side javascript browser-extension that can reorganise web-content and also integrate remote-data sources . the system is illustrated through three worked-examples using existing digital-libraries .
