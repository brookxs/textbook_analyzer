searchgen : a synthetic-workload generator for scientific-literature digital-libraries and search-engines due to the popularity of web-applications and their heavy usage , it is important to obtain a good understanding of their workloads in order to improve performance of search-services . existing works have typically focused on generic web workloads without putting emphasis on specific domains . in this paper , we analyze the usage-logs of citeseer , a scientific-literature digital-library and search-engine , to characterize workloads for both robots and users . essential ingredients that contribute to workloads are proposed . among them we find the access intervals show high variance , and thus can not be predicted well with time-series models . on the other hand , client visiting path and semantics can be well captured with probabilistic-models and zipf-law . based on the findings , we propose searchgen , a synthetic-workload generator to output traces for scientific-literature digital-libraries and search-engines . a comparison between synthetic-workloads and actual logged traces suggests that the synthetic-workload fits well .
