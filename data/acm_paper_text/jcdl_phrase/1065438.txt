turning the page on navigation in this paper , we discuss the findings of an in-depth observational-study of reading and within-document navigation and add to these findings the results of a second analysis of how people read comparable digital-materials on the screen , given limited navigational functionality . we chose periodicals as our initial foil since they represent a type of material that invites many different kinds of reading and strategies for navigation . using multiple sources of evidence from the data , we first characterize readers ' navigation-strategies and specific practices as they make their way through the magazines . we then focus on two observed phenomena that occur when people read paper magazines , but are absent in their digital equivalents : the lightweight navigation that readers use unselfconsciously when they are reading a particular article and the approximate navigation readers engage in when they flip multiple pages at a time . because page-turning is so basic and seems deceptively simple , we dissect the turn of a page , and use it to illustrate the importance and invisibility of lightweight navigation . finally , we explore the significance of our results for navigational interfaces to digital-library materials .
