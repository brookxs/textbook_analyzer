rediscovering missing web-pages using link-neighborhood lexical-signatures for discovering the new uri of a missing web-page , lexical-signatures , which consist of a small number of words chosen to represent the `` aboutness '' of a page , have been previously proposed . however , prior methods relied on computing the lexical-signature before the page was lost , or using cached or archived versions of the page to calculate a lexical-signature . we demonstrate a system of constructing a lexical-signature for a page from its link-neighborhood , that is the `` backlinks '' , or pages that link to the missing page . after testing various methods , we show that one can construct a lexical-signature for a missing web-page using only ten backlink pages . further , we show that only the first level of backlinks are useful in this effort . the text that the backlinks use to point to the missing page is used as input for the creation of a four-word lexical-signature . that lexical-signature is shown to successfully find the target uri in more than half of the test-cases .
