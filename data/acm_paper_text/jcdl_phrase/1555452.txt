what do exploratory searchers look at in a faceted-search interface ? this study examined how searchers interacted with a web-based , faceted library-catalog when conducting exploratory searches . it applied eye-tracking , stimulated recall interviews , and direct observation to investigate important aspects of gaze-behavior in a faceted-search interface : what components of the interface searchers looked at , for how long , and in what order . it yielded empirical-data that will be useful for both practitioners (e.g. , for improving search-interface designs) , and researchers (e.g. , to inform models of search-behavior) . results of the study show that participants spent about 50 seconds per task looking at (fixating on) the results , about 25 seconds looking at the facets , and only about 6 seconds looking at the query itself . these findings suggest that facets played an important role in the exploratory-search process .
