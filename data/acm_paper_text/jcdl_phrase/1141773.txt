document level interoperability for collection creators digital-library-interoperability for both documents and metadata is a critical and complex issue . although many relevant standards have been developed , and continue to evolve , in practice things are not quite so easy as they seem . we have built a software-environment called the exchange center that helps digital-librarians manage the process of sourcing documents and metadata from various repositories , adding local-content where necessary , and exporting the resulting collection into formats that are suitable for digital-library repositories . this paper describes the software , which is built on greenstone but does not require its use as the final digital-library server .
