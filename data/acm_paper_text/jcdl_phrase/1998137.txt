taking chemistry to the task : personalized queries for chemical-digital-libraries nowadays , the information-access is conducted almost exclusively using the-web . simple keyword_based web-search-engines , e.g. google or yahoo! , offer suitable retrieval and ranking-features . in contrast , for highly specialized domains , represented by digital-libraries , these features are insufficient . considering the domain of chemistry , where searching for relevant literature is essentially centered on chemical entities . beside commercial information providers such as chemical abstract service (cas) numerous groups are working on building free chemical search-engines to overcome the expensive access to chemical literature . however , due to the nature of chemical queries these are often overspecialized . often we need meaningful similarity-measures for chemical entities for query-relaxation . in chemistry , the similarity-measures are vast ; more than 40 similarity-measures are available and focus on different aspects of chemical entities . this vast number of similarity-measures is obvious , because the desired search-results highly depend on the working field of the chemist . in this paper we present a personalized-retrieval system for chemical documents taking into account the background-knowledge of the individual chemist . this is done by a query-relaxation for chemical entities using similar substances . we evaluate our approach extensively by analyzing the correlation of commonly used chemical similarity-measures and fingerprint representations . all uncorrelated measures are finally used by our feedback-engine to learn preferred similarity-measures for each user . we also conducted a user-study with domain-experts showing that our system can assign a unique similarity-measure for 75 \ % of the users after only 10 feedback cycles .
