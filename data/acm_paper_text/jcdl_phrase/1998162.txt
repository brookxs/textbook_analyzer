improving scalability by self-archiving the newer generation of web browsers supports the client-side database , making it possible to run the full web-application stacks entirely in the web clients . still , the server side database is indispensable as the central hub for exchanging persistent data between the-web clients . assuming this characterization , we propose a novel web-application framework in which the server archives its database states at predefined periods then makes them available on the web . the clients then use these archives to synchronize their local databases . although the main purpose is to reduce the database-scalability bottleneck , this approach also promotes self-archiving and can be used for time-traveling . we discuss the consistency properties provided by this framework , as well as the tradeoffs imposed .
