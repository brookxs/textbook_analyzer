modeling personal and social-network context for event-annotation in images this paper describes a framework to annotate images using personal and social-network contexts . the problem is important as the correct context reduces the number of image-annotation choices . . social-network context is useful as real-world activities of members of the social-network are often correlated within a specific context . the correlation can serve as a powerful resource to effectively increase the ground-truth available for annotation . there are three main contributions of this paper : (a) development of an event-context framework and definition of quantitative measures for contextual correlations based on concept similarity in each facet of event-context ; (b) recommendation-algorithms based on spreading activations that exploit personal context as well as social-network context ; (c) experiments on real-world , everyday images that verified both the existence of inter-user semantic disagreement and the improvement in annotation when incorporating both the user and social-network context . we have conducted two user-studies , and our quantitative-and-qualitative results indicate that context (both personal and social) facilitates effective image-annotation .
