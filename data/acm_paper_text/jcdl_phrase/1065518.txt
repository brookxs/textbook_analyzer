schema mapper : a visualization-tool for dl-integration schema-mapping is a challenging problem . it has come to the fore in recent years ; there are important applications like database-schema-integration and , more recently , digital-library merging of heterogeneous-data . previous studies have approached the schema-mapping process either from algorithmic or visualization perspectives , with few integrating both . with schema mapper we demonstrate a semi-automatic tool for schema-integration that combines a novel visual-interface with an algorithm-based recommendation engine . schemas are visualized as hyperbolic-trees (see fig. 1) , thus allowing more schema nodes to be displayed at one time . matches to selections are recommended to the user , which makes the mapping operation easier and faster .
