everlast : a distributed-architecture for preserving the-web the world-wide-web has become a key source of knowledge pertaining to almost every walk of life . unfortunately , much of data on the web is highly ephemeral in nature , with more than 50-80 \ % of content estimated to be changing within a short time . continuing the pioneering efforts of many national (digital) libraries , organizations such as the international internet preservation consortium (iipc) , the-internet archive (ia) and the european archive (ea) have been tirelessly working towards preserving the ever changing web . however , while these web-archiving efforts have paid significant attention towards long-term preservation of web-data , they have paid little attention to developing an global-scale infrastructure for collecting , archiving , and performing historical analyzes on the collected data . based on insights from our recent work on building text-analytics for web-archives , we propose everlast , a scalable distributed framework for next generation web-archival and temporal text analytics over the archive . our system is built on a loosely-coupled distributed-architecture that can be deployed over large-scale peer-to-peer-networks . in this way , we allow the integration of many archival efforts taken mainly at a national level by national digital libraries . key features of everlast include support of time-based text-search & analysis and the use of human-assisted archive gathering . in this paper , we outline the overall architecture of everlast , and present some promising preliminary results .
