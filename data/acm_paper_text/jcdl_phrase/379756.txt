building a hypertextual digital-library in the humanities : a case-study on london this paper describes the creation of a new humanities digital library collection : 11,000,000 words and 10,000 images representing books , images and maps on pre-twentieth century london and its environs . the london collection contained far more dense and precise information than the materials from the greco-roman world on which we had previously concentrated . the london collection thus allowed us to explore new problems of data-structure , manipulation , and visualization . this paper contrasts our model for how humanities-digital-libraries are best used with the assumptions that underlie many academic digital-libraries on the one hand and more literary-hypertexts on the other . since encoding guidelines such as those from the tei provide collection designers with far more options than any one project can realize , this paper describes what structures we used to organize the collection and why . we particularly emphasize the importance of mining historical authority lists (encyclopedias , gazetteers , etc.) and then generating automatic span-to-span links within the collection .
