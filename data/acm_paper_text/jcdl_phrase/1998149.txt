a very efficient approach to news title and content-extraction on the web we consider the problem of efficient and template-independent news extraction on the web . the popular news extraction methods are based on visual-information , and they can achieve good accuracy performance , but the computational-efficiency is poor , because it is very time-consuming to render web-page to obtain visual-information . in this paper we propose an efficient and effective news extraction approach based on novel features . our approach neither needs training nor needs visual-information , so it is simple and very efficient . and it can extract news information from various news sites without using templates . in our experiments , the proposed approach achieves 99 \ % accuracy over 5,671 news pages from 20 different news sites . and the efficiency is much faster than the baseline machine-learning method using visual-information .
