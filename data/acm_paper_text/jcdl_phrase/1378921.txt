math-information-retrieval : user-requirements and prototype-implementation we report on the user-requirements study and preliminary implementation phases in creating a-digital library that indexes and retrieves educational materials on math . we first review the current approaches and resources for math retrieval , then report on the interviews of a small group of potential users to properly ascertain their needs . while preliminary , the results suggest that meta-search and resource categorization are two basic requirements for a math-search engine . in addition , we implement a prototype categorization system and show that the generic features work well in identifying the math contents from the webpage but perform less well at categorizing them . we discuss our long-term goals , where we plan to investigate how math expressions and text-search may be best integrated .
