exploring content-actor paired network-data using iterative-query-refinement with netlens networks have remained a challenge for information-retrieval and visualization because of the rich set of tasks that users want to accomplish . this paper demonstrates a tool , netlens , to explore a content-actor paired network-data-model . the netlens interface was designed to allow users to pose a series of elementary queries and iteratively refine visual overviews and sorted lists . this enables the support of complex-queries that are traditionally hard to specify in node-link visualizations . netlens is general and scalable in that it applies to any dataset that can be represented with our abstract content-actor data-model
