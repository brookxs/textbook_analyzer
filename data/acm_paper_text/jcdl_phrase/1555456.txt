a framework for describing web-repositories in prior work we have demonstrated that search-engine-caches and archiving projects like the-internet archive 's wayback-machine can be used to `` lazily preserve '' website and reconstruct them when they are lost . we use the term `` web-repositories '' for collections of automatically refreshed and migrated content , and collectively we refer to these repositories as the `` web infrastructure '' . in this paper we present a framework for describing web-repositories and the status of web-resources in them . this includes an abstract-api for web repository interaction , the concepts of deep vs. flat and light/dark/grey repositories and terminology of describing the recoverability of a web-resource . our api may serve as a foundation for future web repository interfaces .
