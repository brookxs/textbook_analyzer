visualizing aggregated biological-pathway-relations the genescene development-team has constructed an aggregation interface for automatically-extracted biomedical pathway relations that is intended to help researchers identify and process relevant-information from the vast digital-library of abstracts found in the national-library-of-medicine 's pubmed collection . users view extracted relations at various levels of relational granularity in an interactive and visual node-link interface . anecdotal feedback reported here suggests that this multi-granular visual-paradigm aligns well with various research tasks , helping users find relevant articles and discover new information .
