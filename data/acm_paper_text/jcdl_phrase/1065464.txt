on assigning place names to geography related web pages in this paper , we attempt to give spatial semantics to web-pages by assigning them place names . the entire assignment task is divided into three sub-problems , namely place-name-extraction , place-name-disambiguation and place-name-assignment . we propose our approaches to address these sub-problems . in particular , we have modified gate , a well-known named-entity-extraction software , to perform place-name-extraction using a us census gazetteer . a rule-based place-name-disambiguation method and a place-name-assignment method capable of assigning place names to web-page segments have also been proposed . we have evaluated our proposed disambiguation and assignment methods on a web-page-collection referenced by the dlese metadata-collection . the results returned by our methods are compared with manually disambiguated place names and place-name-assignment . it is shown that our proposed place-name-disambiguation method works well for geo/geo ambiguities . the preliminary results of our place-name-assignment method indicate promising results given the existence of geo/non-geo ambiguities among place names .
