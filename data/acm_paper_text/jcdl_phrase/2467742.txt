local histories in global digital libraries : identifying demand and evaluating coverage digital-collections of primary source materials have potential to change how citizen historians and scholars research and engage with local history . the problem at the heart of this study is how to evaluate local history coverage , particularly among large-scale , distributed-collections and aggregations . as part of an effort to holistically evaluate one such national aggregation , the institute-of-museum-and-library-services (imls) digital-collections and content (dcc) , we conducted a national survey of reference service-providers at academic and public-libraries throughout the united-states . in this paper , we report the results of this survey that appear relevant to local history and collection evaluation , and consider the implications for scalable evaluation of local history coverage in massive , aggregative digital-libraries .
