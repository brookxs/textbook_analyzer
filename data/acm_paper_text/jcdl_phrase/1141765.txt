bibliometric impact measures leveraging topic-analysis measurements of the impact and history of research-literature provide a useful complement to scientific digital-library-collections . bibliometric indicators have been extensively studied , mostly in the context of journals . however , journal-based metrics poorly capture topical distinctions in fast-moving fields , and are increasingly problematic with the rise of open-access publishing . recent developments in latent-topic-models have produced promising results for automatic sub-field discovery . the fine-grained , faceted topics produced by such models provide a clearer view of the topical divisions of a body of research-literature and the interactions between those divisions . we demonstrate the usefulness of topic-models in measuring impact by applying a new phrase-based topic-discovery model to a collection of 300,000 computer-science publications , collected by the rexa automatic citation-indexing system .
