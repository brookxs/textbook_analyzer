a hierarchical , hmm-based automatic-evaluation of ocr accuracy for a-digital library of books a number of projects are creating searchable digital-libraries of printed books . these include the million book project , the google book project and similar efforts from yahoo and microsoft . content-based on line book-retrieval usually requires first converting printed text into machine readable (e.g. ascii) text using an optical-character-recognition (ocr) engine and then doing full-text-search on the results . many of these books are old and there are a variety of processing steps that are required to create an end to end system . changing any step (including the scanning process) can affect ocr-performance and hence a good automatic statistical-evaluation of ocr-performance on book length material is needed . evaluating ocr-performance on the entire book is non-trivial . the only easily obtainable ground-truth (the gutenberg e-texts) must be automatically aligned with the ocr output over the entire length of a book . this may be viewed as equivalent to the problem of aligning two large (easily a million long) sequences . the problem is further complicated by ocr-errors as well as the possibility of large chunks of missing material in one of the sequences . we propose a hidden-markov-model (hmm) based hierarchical-alignment algorithm to align ocr output and the ground-truth for books . we believe this is the first work to automatically align a whole book without using any book structure-information . the alignment-process works by breaking up the problem of aligning two long-sequences into the problem of aligning many smaller subsequences . this can be rapidly and effectively done . experimental-results show that our hierarchical-alignment approach works very well even if ocr output has a high recognition-error-rate . finally , we evaluate the performance of a commercial ocr engine over a large dataset of books based on the alignment results .
