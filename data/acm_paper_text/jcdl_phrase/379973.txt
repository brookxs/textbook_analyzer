managing-change on the web increasingly , digital-libraries are being defined that collect pointers to world-wide-web_based resources rather than hold the resources themselves . maintaining these collections is challenging due to distributed document ownership and high fluidity . typically a collections maintainer has to assess the relevance of changes with little system aid . in this paper , we describe the waldens paths path manager , which assists a maintainer in discovering when relevant changes occur to linked resources . the approach and system-design was informed by a study of how humans perceive changes of web-pages . the study indicated that structural changes are key in determining the overall change and that presentation changes are considered irrelevant .
