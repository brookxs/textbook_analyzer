a new generation of textual-corpora : mining corpora from very-large collections while digital-libraries based on page images and automatically generated text have made possible massive projects such as the million book library , open-content alliance , google , and others , humanists still depend upon textual-corpora expensively produced with labor-intensive methods such as double-keyboarding and manual correction . this paper reports the results from an analysis of ocr-generated text for classical greek source texts . classicists have depended upon specialized manual keyboarding that costs two or more times as much as keyboarding of english both for accuracy and because classical greek ocr produced no usable results . we found that we could produce texts by ocr that , in some cases , approached the 99.95 \ % professional data-entry accuracy rate . in most cases , ocr-generated text yielded results that , by including the variant readings that digital corpora traditionally have left out , provide better recall and , we argue , can better serve many scholarly needs than the expensive corpora upon which classicists have relied for a generation . as digital-collections expand , we will be able to collate multiple editions against each other , identify quotations of primary sources , and provide a new generation of services .
