evaluation of definder : a system to mine definitions from consumer-oriented medical-text in this paper we present definder , a rule-based-system that mines cons umer-oriented full text articles in order to extract definitions and the terms they define . this research is part of digital-library project at columbia university , entitled persival (personalized-retrieval and summarization of image , video and language-resources) [5] . one goal of the project is to present information to patients in language they can understand . a key component of this stage is to provide accurate and readable lay definitions for technical-terms , which may be present in articles of intermediate complexity . the focus of this short paper is on quantitative-and-qualitative evaluation of the definder system [3] . our basis for comparison was definitions from unified-medical-language-system (umls) , on-line medical-dictionary (omd) and glossary of popular and technical medical-terms (gptmt) . quantitative evaluations show that definder obtained 87 \ % precision and 75 \ % recall and reveal the incompleteness of existing resources and the ability of definder to address gaps . qualitative-evaluation shows that the definitions extracted by our system are ranked higher in terms of user-based criteria of usability and readability than definitions from on-line specialized dictionaries . thus the output of definder can be used to enhance existing specialized dictionaries , and also as a key feature in summarizing technical articles for non-specialist users .
