publishing earthquake engineering research data earthquake engineering brings together researchers from seismology , structural , mechanical , and geotechnical engineering whose research results in saving lives and protecting property during earthquakes and tsunamis . such diversity poses unique challenges for data-management , data-archiving , preservation , and data-publication . the poster demonstrates new innovative approaches to curation , visualization , and publishing of earthquake engineering research data in the neeshub , a collaborative-platform that provides a combined virtual-research-environment and data-repository to researchers participating in the network for earthquake engineering simulations (nees) and to the earthquake engineering-community in general . the poster provides graphical depictions demonstrating the curation workflows established in nees , the progression of data from unprocessed sensor measurements to datasets that can be analyzed by a variety of analytical and visualization-tools , and finally their transformation into a citable published product . it documents ways in which neeshub exposes research data and facilitates collaboration and sharing , as well as re-use and repurposing of the datasets . furthermore , the poster illustrates some of the successes of the neeshub in its four years of existence including continuous growth in uploaded files , users , number of downloaded files , curated projects , and published datasets .
