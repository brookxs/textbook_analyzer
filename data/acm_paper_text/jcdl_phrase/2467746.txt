a comparative-study of academic and wikipedia ranking in addition to its broad popularity wikipedia is also widely used for scholarly purposes . many wikipedia pages pertain to academic-papers , scholars and topics providing a rich ecology for scholarly uses . scholarly references and mentions on wikipedia may thus shape the `` societal-impact '' of a certain scholarly-communication item , but it is not clear whether they shape actual `` academic impact '' . in this paper we compare the impact of papers , scholars , and topics according to two different measures , namely scholarly citations and wikipedia mentions . our results show that academic and wikipedia impact are positively correlated . papers , authors , and topics that are mentioned on wikipedia have higher academic impact than those are not mentioned . our findings validate the hypothesis that wikipedia can help assess the impact of scholarly-publications and underpin relevance indicators for scholarly retrieval or recommendation-systems .
