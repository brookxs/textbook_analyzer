ipkb : a-digital library for invertebrate paleontology in this paper , we present the invertebrate paleontology knowledgebase (ipkb) , an effort to digitize and share the treatise on invertebrate paleontology . the treatise is the most authoritative compilation of invertebrate fossil records . unfortunately , the pdf version is simply a clone of paper publications and the content is in no way organized to facilitate search and knowledge-discovery . we extracted texts and images from the treatise , stored them in a database , and built a system for efficient browsing and searching . for image-processing in particular , we segmented fossil photos from figures , recognized the embedded labels , and linked the images to the corresponding data entries . the detailed information of each genus , including fossil images , is delivered to users through a web-access module . some external applications (e.g. google-earth) are acquired through web-services apis to improve user-experience . given the rich information in the treatise , analyzing , modeling and understanding paleontological data are significant in many areas , such as : understanding evolution ; understanding climate-change ; finding fossil fuels , etc. . ipkb builds a general-framework that aims to facilitate knowledge-discovery activities in invertebrate paleontology , and provides a solid foundation for future explorations . in this article , we report our initial accomplishments . the specific techniques we employed in the project , such as those involved in text-parsing , image-label association and meta-data extraction , can be insightful and serve as examples for other researchers .
