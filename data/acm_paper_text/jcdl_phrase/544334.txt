virtual oregon : seamless access to distributed environmental information virtual oregon is a new data-coordination center established at oregon state university (osu) in order to : (1) archive environmental and other place-based data on oregon and associated areas ; (2) make those data accessible to a broad spectrum of agencies and individuals via innovative web-interfaces ; (3) identify key-data sets that are not yet available and encourage their collection and dissemination ; and (4) facilitate development of statewide standards for archiving , documenting , and disseminating data . rather than co-locating researchers and data in a physical center , virtual oregon employs a distributed-architecture that occupies multiple locations while users are presented with the illusion of a single , centralized facility . this approach was selected not just to maximize the impact on campus students , faculty , and staff but also toservice broader interactions with extension agents and other members of osu 's statewide community.virtual oregon builds on regional gis centers and databanks in a wide range of disciplines , providing decades of research data on topics as varied as climate , biodiversity , land ownership , water-quality , wildfire , and agricultural production . our proximity to agencies such as the oregon climate service , oregon natural heritage program , oregon flora project , osu herbarium , epa , and forest service adds breadth to data-type and availability . designed as a distributed-architecture , virtual oregon has four nodes , each of which serves as a center and clearinghouse for distinct types of information and services : department of geosciences (college of science) : geospatial coverages , digital aerial and orthoimagery and associated base data forestry sciences laboratory (usda-forest-service and college of forestry) : ecological and resource-management databases ; data analyses ; data from computational simulations northwest alliance for computational-science-and-engineering (nacse) : databases based on specimen collections , field-observation , images , or analysis of historical-documents ; user-interface-design valley library : published maps , books and archival publications , gray literature , photographs and video . data are harvested from a variety of individuals and research centers and maintained in the distributed nodes using enterprise rdbms products (oracle , sybase , and microsoft-sql-server) residing on unix and windows platforms . query markup-language (qml , a middleware product developed at nacse) supports database-to-web interactions by transparently performing queries across multiple rdbmss and displaying the results as though from a single-source . web-based mapping interfaces (powered by esri 's internet map server and spatial-database engine products) can also be used to explore data visually.as the demonstration will show , users currently have the option of beginning with either the `` thematic '' or `` place-based '' interfaces . ultimately , users will be able to move freely back and forth between the two paradigms , for example initially narrowing the scope of inquiry based on discipline or attributes , moving to the visual-interface to refine the search-based on location or some set of geospatial characteristics , then moving back to query-based exploration to delve to fine levels-of-detail . usability-engineering methodologies are being applied so that all navigation and query mechanisms are both maximally productive and easily learned by novices .
