enhancing access to research data : the challenge of crystallography this paper describes an ongoing collaborative effort across digital-library and scientific communities in the uk to improve access to research data . a prototype demonstrator service supporting the discovery and retrieval of detailed results of crystallography experiments has been deployed within an open-archives digital-library service model . early challenges include the understanding of requirements in this specialized area of chemistry and reaching consensus on the design of a metadata model and schema . future plans encompass the exploration of commonality and overlap with other schemas and across disciplines , working with publishers to develop mutually beneficial service-models , and investigation of the pedagogical benefits . the potential improved access to experimental-data to enrich scholarly-communication from the perspective of both research and learning provides the driving force to continue exploring these issues .
