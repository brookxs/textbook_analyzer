an iterative reliability measure for semi-anonymous annotators this study addresses problems of reliability in the creation of tagged-corpora by self-selected semi-anonymous raters . in order to account for both strong and weak raters , this paper contributes a recursive technique for scoring rater reliability . by assigning raters trust scores in the proposed method , candidate labels can be weighted by a confidence-score and low-confidence ratings can be routed to an expert rater or additional amateur raters for further action .
