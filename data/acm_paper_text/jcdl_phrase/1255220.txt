measuring conference quality by mining program-committee characteristics bibliometrics are important measures for venue quality in digital-libraries . impacts of venues are usually the major consideration for subscription decision-making , and for ranking and recommending high-quality venues and documents . for digital-libraries in the computer-science literature domain , conferences play a major role as an important publication and dissemination outlet . however , with a recent profusion of conferences and rapidly expanding fields , it is increasingly challenging for researchers and librarians to assess the quality of conferences . we propose a set of novel heuristics to automatically discover prestigious (and low-quality) conferences by mining the characteristics of program-committee members . we examine the proposed cues both in isolation and combination under a classification-scheme . evaluation on a collection of 2,979 conferences and 16,147 pc members shows that our heuristics , when combined , correctly classify about 92 \ % of the conferences , with a low false positive rate of 0.035 and a recall of more than 73 \ % for identifying reputable conferences . furthermore , we demonstrate empirically that our heuristics can also effectively detect a set of low-quality conferences , with a false-positive-rate of merely 0.002 . we also report our experience of detecting two previously unknown low-quality conferences . finally , we apply the proposed techniques to the entire quality spectrum by ranking conferences in the collection .
