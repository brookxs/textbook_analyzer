toward information-retrieval web-services for digital-libraries information-retrieval (ir) functions serve a critical role in many digital-library-systems . there are numerous mature ir algorithms that have been implemented and it will be a waste of resources and time to re-implement them . the implemented ir algorithms can be distributed or their functions made available through the framework of web-services . web-services in the ir domain have not been widely tested . concept-extraction is an important area in traditional ir . we demonstrated that it can be easily adopted as ir web-services and can be accessed in multiple ways . for the ir web-services , we take advantage of a term-representation database which was created as a result of a previous digital-library project containing 31 , 928 , 892 terms found on 49 , 602 , 191 pages of the-web .
