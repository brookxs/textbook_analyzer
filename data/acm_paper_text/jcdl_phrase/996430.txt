web-question-answering through automatically learned patterns while being successful in providing keyword based access to web-pages , commercial search portals , such as google , yahoo , altavista , and aol , still lack the ability to answer questions expressed in a natural-language . we explore the feasibility of a completely trainable-approach to the automated-question-answering on the web or large-scale digital-libraries . by using the inherent redundancy of large-scale collections , each candidate-answer found by the system is triangulated (confirmed or disconfirmed) against other possible answers . since our approach is entirely self-learning and does not involve any linguistic-resources it can be easily implemented within digital-libraries or web-search portals .
