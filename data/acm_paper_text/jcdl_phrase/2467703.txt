extracting and matching authors and affiliations in scholarly documents we introduce enlil , an information-extraction-system that discovers the institutional affiliations of authors in scholarly papers . enlil consists of two steps : one that first identifies authors and affiliations using a conditional-random-field ; and a second support-vector-machine that connects authors to their affiliations . we benchmark enlil in three separate experiments drawn from three different sources : the acl anthology corpus , the acm digital-library , and a set of cross-disciplinary scientific journal-articles acquired by querying google-scholar . against a state-of-the-art production baseline , enlil reports a statistically significant improvement in f_1 of nearly 10 % (p we have deployed enlil in a case-study involving asian genomics research-publication patterns to understand how government sponsored collaborative links evolve . enlil has enabled our team to construct and validate new metrics to quantify the facilitation of research as opposed to direct publication .
