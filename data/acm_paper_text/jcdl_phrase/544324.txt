reprocessing paper-based reference materials for the digital environment one of the primary challenges for the creation of digital-libraries is to enhance the value of paper-based publications by providing digital access to the materials . simple full-text searching is just a first step in this process . better functionality may be gained by exploiting the natural structure within text . the following paper describes the process of digital-conversion and integration of encyclopedic publications , glossaries and thesauri . the biological-information browsing (http://www.biobrowser.org) team developed text-processing tools , and an information-retrieval and visualization-environment that provides greater functionality for these traditionally paper-based publications [1] . the process includes automatic text segmentation and structuring , automated xml-markup , structure-based indexing , automatic-thesaurus-extraction for query-expansion and on-line definitions . very few other information-systems provide complete services for publishing , indexing , xml-query and retrieving documents .
