users ' adjustments to unsuccessful queries in biomedical-search biomedical-researchers depend on on-line databases and digital-libraries for up to date information . we introduce a pilot project aimed at characterizing adjustments made to biomedical queries that improve search-results . specifically we focus on queries submitted to pubmed , a large sophisticated search-engine that facilitates web-access to abstracts of articles in over 5,200 biomedical journals . on average 2 million users search pubmed each day . during their search , nearly 20 \ % will experience a result page from one of their queries that has zero results . in some cases there really is no document or abstract that will satisfy a particular query . however , in analyzing one month of queries submitted to pubmed , we find that more often than not , queries that retrieved no results are queries that would retrieve something relevant if they were constructed differently . this paper describes a new effort to identify some of the characteristics of a query that produces zero results , and the changes that users most often apply in constructing new , `` corrected '' queries . zero-result queries afford us an opportunity to examine changes made to queries that we know did not return relevant data , because they did not return any data . an investigation of the changes users make under these circumstances can yield insight into users ' search processes .
