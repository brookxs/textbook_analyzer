cybersecurity considerations for digital-libraries in an era of pervasive-computing information-technology is becoming pervasive in our society ; soon , its absence will be more noticeable than its presence , and for most people it will be an unavoidable part of everyday-life . this talk will trace this evolution to the present day and make projections to an era later this decade when the prevailing system-architecture may consist of information utilities accessed intuitively through a wide variety of specialized information-appliances , many of them mobile . principal among the challenges still impeding this emerging popular view of the-future are the reliability and security of such global systems.digital libraries , already playing an essential role in today 's information-rich world , will assume central positions of even more significance in such pervasive-systems not only will they serve as repositories of knowledge and information , and as the primary mechanism for its retrieval and distribution , but they will be the focal-point for the integration of information and scholarship across all boundaries of application , language , and media since they will also inevitably become the target of malicious-attack by people seeking unauthorized information , and by terrorists seeking to disrupt the global information infrastructure and the physical infrastructures built upon it , it is both timely and essential to study the cybersecurity characteristics future digital-libraries will have to support .
