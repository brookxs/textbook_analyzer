digital restoration using volumetric-scanning in this paper we present a new , nondestructive method for revealing inaccessible text buried within damaged books and scrolls . the method is based on volumetric-scanning followed by data-modeling and physically-based-simulation . we show by experiment that it is possible to recover readable text from objects without physically opening or damaging them . in handling damaged collections , conservators often face a choice between two frustrating alternatives : indefinite preservation without analysis , or irreversible physical harm for the sake of potential discovery . we believe that this work creates a new opportunity that embraces both the need to preserve and the possibility for complete analysis .
