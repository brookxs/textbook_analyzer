interpretation of web-page-layouts by blind-users digital-libraries must support assistive-technologies that allow people-with-disabilities such as blindness to use , navigate and understand their documents . increasingly , many documents are web-based and present their contents using complex layouts . however , approaches that translate two-dimensional layouts to one-dimensional speech produce a very different user-experience and loss of information . to address this issue , we conducted a study of how blind-people navigate and interpret layouts of news and shopping web-pages using current assistive-technology . the study revealed that blind-people do not parse web-pages fully during their first visit , and that they can miss important parts . the study also provided insights for improving assistive-technologies .
