first class objects and indexes for chant manuscripts we discuss a crucial part of infrastructure for the web-delivery of medieval chant resources . although widely accepted by software-professionals , the distributed-content model is sharply opposed by some chant scholars . we advocate for a paradigm of the-web as a massive database where each `` first class object '' acts like a record ; metadata about , and links to such objects are compiled in virtual-libraries . scholarly-edited indexes determine which objects are in libraries , and unreliable content is excluded . special metadata ontologies can be defined without modifying the primary content .
