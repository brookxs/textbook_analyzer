design-principles for the information-architecture of a smet-education digital-library this implementation paper introduces principles for the information-architecture of an educational-digital-library , principles that address the distinction between designing digital-libraries for education and designing digital-libraries for information-retrieval in general . design is a key element of any successful product . good designers and their designs , put technology into the hands of the user , making the products focus comprehensible and tangible through design . as straightforward as this may appear , the design of learning-technologies is often masked by the enabling technology . in fact , they often lack an explicitly stated instructional-design methodology . while the technologies are important hurdles to overcome , we advocate learning-systems that empower education-driven \ experiences rather than technology-driven experiences . this work describes a concept for a-digital library for science , mathematics , engineering and technology-education (smete) , a library with an information-architecture designed to meet learners and educators needs . utilizing a constructivist model of learning , the authors present practical approaches to implementing the information-architecture and its technology underpinnings . the authors propose the specifications for the information-architecture and a visual-design of a-digital library for communicating learning to the audience . the design methodology indicates that a scenario-driven design technique sensitive to the contextual nature of learning offers a useful framework for tailoring technologies that help empower , not hinder , the educational sector .
