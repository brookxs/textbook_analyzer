ember : a case-study of a-digital memorial museum of born-digital artifacts this paper discusses the creation of ember , a collection of borndigital artifacts generated in the aftermath of the 1999 aggie bonfire collapse . ember is an example of a previously unexamined class of cultural-heritage digital-libraries , which we describe as a-digital memorial museum . ember 's artifacts consist of emails , photos , documents , and web-pages that the communities surrounding the tragedy created . due to the community investment and the personal nature of the artifacts , concerns arise on how the collection should be properly handled , which leads us to propose `` sensitivity '' as an addition to the 5s-model . initially , we are focusing on the email portion of the collection , which can be viewed as the basis of an emerging oral tradition surrounding the bonfire tragedy .
