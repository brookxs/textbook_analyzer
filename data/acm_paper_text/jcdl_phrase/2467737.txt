modeling heterogeneous-data-resources for social-ecological research : a data-centric perspective digital-repositories are grappling with an influx of scientific-data brought about by the well publicized `` data-deluge '' in science , business , and society . one particularly perplexing problem is the long-term archival and reuse of complex-data sets . this paper presents an integrated-approach to data-discovery over heterogeneous-data-resources in social-ecological systems-research . social-ecological systems data is complex because the research draws from both social and natural sciences . using a sample set of data resources from the domain , we explore an approach to discovery and representation of this data . specifically , we develop an ontology-based process of organization and visualization from a data-centric perspective . we define data resources broadly and identify six key categories of resources that include data collected from site-visits to shared ecological resources , the structure of research-instruments , domain-concepts , research designs , publications , theories and models . we identify the underlying relationships and construct an ontology that captures these relationships using semantic-web languages . the ontology and a nosql data store at the back end store the data resource instances . these are integrated into a portal architecture we refer to as the integrated visualization of social-ecological resources (iviser) that allows users to both browse the relationships captured in the ontology and easily visualize the granular details of data resources .
