whetting the appetite of scientists : producing summaries tailored to the citation context the amount of scientific material available electronically is forever increasing . this makes reading the published literature , whether to stay up-to-date on a topic or to get up to speed on a new topic , a difficult task . yet , this is an activity in which all researchers must be engaged on a regular basis . based on a user-requirements-analysis , we developed a new research-tool , called the citation-sensitive in-browser summariser (csibs) , which supports researchers in this browsing task . csibs enables readers to obtain information about a citation at the point at which they encounter it . this information is aimed at enabling the reader to determine whether or not to invest the time in exploring the cited article further , thus alleviating information-overload . csibs builds a summary of the cited document , bringing together meta-data about the document and a citation-sensitive preview that exploits the citation context to retrieve the sentences from the cited document that are relevant at this point . this paper briefly presents our user-requirements-analysis , then describes the system and , finally , discusses the observations from an initial pilot-study . we found that csibs facilitates the relevancy judgment task , by increasing the users ' self-reported confidence in making such judgements .
