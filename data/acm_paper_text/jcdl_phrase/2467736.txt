ifme : information-filtering by multiple examples with under-sampling in a-digital library environment with the amount of digitalized documents increasing exponentially , it is more difficult for users to keep up to date with the knowledge in their domain . in this paper , we present a framework named ifme (information-filtering by multiple examples) in a-digital library environment to help users identify the literature related to their interests by leveraging the positive unlabeled learning (pu-learning) . using a few relevant documents provided by a user and considering the documents in an online-database as unlabeled-data (called u) , it ranks the documents in u using a pu-learning algorithm . from the experimental-results , we found that while the approach performed well when a large set of relevant-feedback documents were available , it performed relatively poor when the relevant-feedback documents were few . we improved ifme by combining pu-learning with under-sampling to tune the performance . using mean-average-precision (map) , our experimental-results indicated that with under-sampling , the performance improved significantly even when the size of p was small . we believe the pu-learning_based ifme framework brings insights to develop more effective digital-library-systems .
