comparative appraisal : systematic assessment of expressive qualities clifford lynch describes the value of digital-libraries as adding interpretive layers to collections of cultural-heritage materials . however , standard forms of evaluation , which focus on the degree to which a system solves problems , are insufficient assessments of the expressive qualities that distinguish such interpretive content . this paper describes a form of comparative , structured appraisal that supplements the existing repertoire of assessment-techniques . comparative appraisal uses a situationally defined set of procedures to be followed by multiple assessors in examining a group of artifacts . while this approach aims for a goal of systematic comparison based on selected dimensions , it is grounded in the recognition that expressive qualities are not conventionally measurable and that absolute agreement between assessors is neither possible nor desirable . the conceptual basis for this comparative method is drawn from the literature of writing assessment .
