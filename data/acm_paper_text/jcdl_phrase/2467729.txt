a scalable , distributed and dynamic workflow-system for digitization processes creating digital representations of ancient manuscripts , prints and maps is a challenging task due to the sources ' fragile and heterogeneous natures . digitization requires a very specialized set of scanning hardware in order to cover the sources ' diversity . the central task is obtaining the maximum reproduction quality while minimizing the error-rate , which is difficult to achieve due to the large amounts of image-data resulting from digitization , putting huge computational loads on image-processing modules , error-detection and information retrieval-heuristics . as digital copies initially do not contain any information about their sources ' semantics , additional efforts have to be made to extract semantic metadata . this is an error-prone , time-consuming manual process , which calls for automated mechanisms to support the user . this paper introduces a decentralized , event-driven workflow-system designed to overcome the above mentioned challenges . it leverages dynamic-routing between workflow components , thus being able to quickly adapt to the sources ' unique requirements . it provides a scalable approach to soften out high computational loads on single units by using distributed-computing and provides modules for automated image pre - / post-processing , error-detection heuristics , data-mining , semantic-analysis , metadata augmentation , quality-assurance and an export functionality to established publishing platforms or long-term-storage facilites .
