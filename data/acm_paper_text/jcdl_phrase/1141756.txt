combinformation : a mixed-initiative-system for representing collections as compositions of image-and-text surrogates people need to find , work with , and put together information . diverse activities , such as scholarly research , comparison-shopping , and entertainment involve collecting and connecting information-resources . we need to represent collections in ways that promote understanding of individual-information resources and also their relationships . representing individual resources with images as well as text makes good use of human cognitive facilities . composition , an alternative to lists , means putting representations of elements in a collection together using design-principles to form a connected whole.we develop combinformation , a mixed-initiative-system for representing collections as compositions of image-and-text surrogates . the system provides a set of direct-manipulation facilities for forming , editing , organizing , and distributing collections as compositions . additionally , to assist users in sifting through the vast expanse of potentially relevant-information resources , the system also includes a generative agent that can proactively engage in processes of collecting information-resources and forming image-and-text surrogates . a generative temporal visual composition agent develops the collection and its visual-representation over time , enabling users to see more possibilities . to keep the user in control , we develop interactive-techniques that enable the user to direct the agent.for evaluation , we conducted a field-study in an undergraduate general-education course offered in the architecture department . alternating groups of students used combinformation as an aid in preparing one of two major assignments involving information-discovery to support processes of invention . the students that used combinformation were found to perform better .
