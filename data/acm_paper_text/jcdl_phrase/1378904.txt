curriculum overlay-model for embedding digital-resources this paper describes the design and implementation of a curriculum overlay-model for the representation of adaptable curriculum using educational-digital-library resources . we focus on representing curriculum to enable the incorporation of digital-resources into curriculum and curriculum sharing and customization by educators . we defined this model as a result of longitudinal-studies on educators ' development and customization of curriculum and user-interface-design studies of prototypes representing curriculum . like overlay journals or the information-network overlay-model , our curriculum overlay-model defines curriculum as a compound object with internal semantic-relationships and relationships to digital-library metadata describing resources . we validated this model by instantiating the model using science-curriculum which uses digital-library-resources and using this instantiation within an application that , built on fedora , supports curriculum customization . findings from this work can support the design of digital-library services for customizing curriculum which embeds digital-resources .
