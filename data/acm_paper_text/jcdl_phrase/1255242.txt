retrieval in text-collections with historic spelling using linguistic and spelling-variants we present a new approach for the retrieval of texts with non-standard spelling , which is important for historic texts e.g. in english or german . in this paper , we describe the overall architecture of our system , followed by its evaluation . given a search-term as lemma , we use a dictionary of contemporary german for finding all inflected and derived forms of the lemma . then we apply transformation-rules (derived from training-data) for generating historic spelling-variants . for the evaluation , we regard the resulting retrieval quality . the experimental-results show that we can improve the retrieval quality for historic collections substantially .
