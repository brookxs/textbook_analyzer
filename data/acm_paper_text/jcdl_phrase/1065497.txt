creating the infrastructure for collaboration between digital-reference services and researchers : the digital reference electronic warehouse (drew) project the digital reference electronic warehouse (drew) project is a collection of digital-reference transactions from different services and different communication-channels that live in a single space . reference-services work with drew to submit transactions using the drew schema , which is conceptually similar to the marc record format for bibliographic materials . researchers can then receive records from drew to improve our knowledge of digital-reference . these researchers then use the results of their research to create tools , reports , and models based on the drew schema , and place those items into a management-information-system (mis) . the services can then access the mis and apply those tools to their own archives . the result is that services can benefit directly and rapidly from research , and are then more likely to continue their involvement with the project . this infrastructure creates a collaborative space where researchers and practitioners can benefit from the work of each other and aid us in advancing the field of digital-reference .
