retrieving attributes using web-tables in this paper we propose an attribute-retrieval approach which extracts and ranks attributes from web-tables . we combine simple heuristics to filter out improbable attributes and we rank attributes based on frequencies and a table match score . ranking is reinforced with external evidence from web-search , dbpedia and wikipedia . our approach can be applied to whatever instance (e.g. canada) to retrieve its attributes (capital , gdp) . it is shown it has a much higher recall than dbpedia and wikipedia and that it works better than lexico-syntactic rules for the same purpose .
