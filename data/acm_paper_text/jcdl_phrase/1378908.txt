socialtrust : tamper-resilient trust-establishment in online-communities web-2.0 promises rich opportunities for information-sharing , electronic-commerce , and new modes of social-interaction , all centered around the `` social-web '' of user-contributed-content , social-annotations , and person-to-person social connections . but the increasing reliance on this `` social-web '' also places individuals and their computer-systems at risk , creating opportunities for malicious participants to exploit the tight social fabric of these networks . with these problems in mind , we propose the socialtrust framework for tamper-resilient trust-establishment in online-communities . socialtrust provides community users with dynamic trust values by (i) distinguishing relationship quality from trust ; (ii) incorporating a personalized feedback-mechanism for adapting as the community evolves ; and (iii) tracking user-behavior . we experimentally evaluate the socialtrust framework using real online-social-networking data consisting of millions of myspace profiles and relationships . we find that socialtrust supports robust trust establishment even in the presence of large-scale collusion by malicious participants .
