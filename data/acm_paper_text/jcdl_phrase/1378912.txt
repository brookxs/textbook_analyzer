a data-model and architecture for long-term-preservation the national geospatial digital archive , one of eight initial projects funded under the library-of-congress 's ndiipp program , has been researching how geospatial-data can be preserved on a national scale and be made available to future generations . in this paper we describe an archive architecture that provides a minimal approach to the long-term-preservation of digital-objects based on co-archiving of object semantics , uniform representation of objects and semantics , explicit storage of all objects and semantics as files , and abstraction of the underlying storage-system . this architecture ensures that digital-objects can be easily migrated from archive to archive over time and that the objects can , in principle , be made usable again at any point in the future ; its primary benefit is that it serves as a fallback strategy against , and as a foundation for , more sophisticated (and costly) preservation-strategies . we describe an implementation of this architecture in a protoype archive running at ucsb that also incorporates a suite of ingest and access components .
