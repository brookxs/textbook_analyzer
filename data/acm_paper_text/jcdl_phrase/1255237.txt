agreeing-to-disagree : search-engines and their public-interfaces google , yahoo and msn all provide both web-user-interfaces (wuis) and application programming-interfaces (apis) to their collections . whether building collections of resources or studying the search-engines themselves , the search-engines request that researchers use their apis and not `` scrape '' the wuis . however , anecdotal-evidence suggests the interfaces produce different results . we provide the first in depth quantitative-analysis of the results produced by the google , msn and yahoo api and wui interfaces . we have queried both interfaces for five months and found significant discrepancies between the interfaces in several categories . in general , we found msn to produce the most consistent results between their two interfaces . our findings suggest that the api indexes are not older , but they are probably smaller for google and yahoo . we also examined how search-results decay over time and built predictive-models based on the observed decay rates . based on our findings , it can take over a year for half of the top 10 results to a popular query to be replaced in google and yahoo ; for msn it may take only 2-3 months .
