a web-service framework for embedding discovery-services in distributed library interfaces significant barriers deter web-page designers and developers from incorporating dynamic-content from web-services into their page designs . web-services typically require designers to learn service-protocols and have access to and knowledge of dynamic application servers or cgi in order to incorporate dynamic-content into their pages . this paper describes a framework for embedding discovery-services in distributed-interfaces that seeks to simplify this process and eliminate these barriers , making the use of the dynamic-content available to a wider audience and increasing its potential for adoption and use in educational design .
