adding content-based-searching to a traditional-music library-catalogue server most online-music library-catalogues can only be searched by textual m etadata . whilst highly effective - since the rules for maintaining consistency have been refined over many years - this does not allow searching by musical content . many music librarians are familiar with users humming their enquiries . most systems providing a query-by-humming & r dquo ; interface tend to run independently of music library-catalogue systems and not offer similar textual-metadata searching . this paper discusses the ongoing investigative work on integrating these two types of system conducted as part of the nsf/jisc funded omras project (http://www.omras.org) .
