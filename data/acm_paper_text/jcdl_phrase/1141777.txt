combining dom-tree and geometric-layout analysis for online medical journal article segmentation we describe an html web-page-segmentation algorithm , which is applied to segment online medical journal-articles (regular html and pdf-converted-html files) . the-web page content is modeled by a zone tree-structure based primarily on the geometric-layout of the-web page . for a given journal article , a zone tree is generated by combining dom-tree analysis and recursive x-y cut algorithm . combining with other visual-cues , such as background color , font-size , font color and so on , the page is segmented into homogeneous regions . evaluation is conducted with 104 articles from 11 journals . out of 9726 ground-truth zones , 9376 zones are correctly segmented , for an accuracy of 96.40 \ % . segmenting the entire web-page into zones can significantly expedite and increase the accuracy of the subsequent information-retrieval steps .
