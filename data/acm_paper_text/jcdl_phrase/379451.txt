arc : an oai service-provider for cross-archive searching the usefulness of the many on-line journals and scientific digital lib raries that exist today is limited by the lack of a service that can federate them through a unified interface . the open-archive-initiative (oai) is one major effort to address technical interoperability among distributed archives . the objective of oai is to develop a framework to facilitate the discovery of content in distributed archives . in this paper , we describe our experience-and-lessons-learned in building arc , the first federated-searching service based on the oai protocol . arc harvests metadata from several oai compliant archives , normalizes them , and stores them in a search-service based on a relational-database (mysql or oracle) . at present we have over 165k metadata records from 16 data providers from various domains .
