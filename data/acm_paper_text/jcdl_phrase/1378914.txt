shakespeare , god , and lonely hearts : transforming data-access with many eyes data-visualization has historically been accessible only to the technological elite . it is , after all , `` serious '' technology done by experts for experts . but recent web-based visualizations - ranging from political art projects to news stories - have reached millions . unfortunately , while lay users can view sophisticated visualizations , they have few ways to create them . in order to `` democratize '' visualization , we have built many eyes , a web-site where people may upload their own data , create interactive-visualizations , and carry on conversations . by making these tools available to anyone on the web , the site fosters a social style of data-analysis that empowers users to engage with public data through discussion and collaboration . political discussions , citizen activism , religious conversations , game-playing , and educational exchanges are all happening on many eyes . the public nature of these visualizations provides users with a transformative path to information-literacy .
