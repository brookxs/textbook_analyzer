database-selection for processing k-nearest-neighbors queries in distributed-environments we consider the processing of digital-library queries , consisting of a text component and a structured component in distributed-environments . the text component can be processed using techniques given in previous papers such as [7 , 8 , 11] . in this paper , we concentrate on the processing of the structured component of a distributed-query . histograms are constructed and algorithms are given to provide estimates of the desirabilities of the databases with respect to the given query . databases are selected in descending order of desirability . an algorithm is also given to select tuples from the selected databases . experimental-results are given to show that the techniques provided here are effective and efficient .
