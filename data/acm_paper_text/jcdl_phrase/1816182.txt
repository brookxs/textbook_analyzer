emulation_based services in digital-preservation the creation of most digital-objects occurs solely in interactive graphical user-interfaces which were available at the particular time period . archiving and preservation organizations are posed with large amounts of such objects of various types . at some point they will need to process these automatically to make them available to their users or convert them to a commonly used format . a substantial problem is to provide a wide range of different users with access to ancient environments and to allow using the original environment for a given object . we propose an abstract architecture for emulation services in digital-preservation to provide remote user interfaces to emulation over computer-networks without the need to install additional software-components . furthermore , we describe how these ideas can be integrated in a framework of web-services for common preservation tasks like viewing or migrating digital-objects .
