flexible access to photo-libraries via time , place , tags , and visual-features photo-libraries are growing in quantity and size , requiring better support for locating desired photographs . mediaglow is an interactive visual workspace designed to address this concern . it uses attributes such as visual appearance , gps locations , user-assigned tags , and dates to filter and group photos . an automatic-layout algorithm positions photos with similar attributes near each other to support users in serendipitously finding multiple relevant photos . in addition , the system can explicitly select photos similar to specified photos . we conducted a user-evaluation to determine the benefit provided by similarity layout and the relative advantages offered by the different layout similarity-criteria and attribute filters . study participants had to locate photos matching probe statements . in some tasks , participants were restricted to a single layout similarity criterion and filter option . participants used multiple attributes to filter photos . layout by similarity without additional filters turned out to be one of the most used strategies and was especially beneficial for geographical similarity . lastly , the relative appropriateness of the single similarity criterion to the probe significantly affected retrieval-performance .
