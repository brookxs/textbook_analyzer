the digital atheneum : new approaches for preserving , restoring and analyzing damaged manuscripts this paper presents research focused on developing new techniques and algorithms for the digital acquisition , restoration , and study of damaged manuscripts . we present results from an acquisition effort in partnership with the british library , funded through the nsf dli-2 program , designed to capture 3-d-models of old and damaged manuscripts . we show how these 3-d facsimiles can be analyzed and manipulated in ways that are tedious or even impossible if confined to the physical manuscript . in particular , we present results from a restoration framework we have developed for `` flattening '' the 3-d representation of badly warped manuscripts . we expect these research-directions to give scholars more sophisticated methods to preserve , restore , and better understand the physical objects they study .
