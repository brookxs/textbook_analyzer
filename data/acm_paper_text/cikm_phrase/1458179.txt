simultaneous multilingual search for translingual information-retrieval we consider the problem of translingual information-retrieval , where monolingual searchers issue queries in a different language than the document language (s) and the results must be returned in the language they know , the query-language . we present a framework for translingual ir that integrates document-translation and query-translation into the retrieval-model . the corpus is represented as an aligned , jointly indexed `` pseudo-parallel '' corpus , where each document contains the text of the document along with its translation into the query-language . the queries are formulated as multilingual structured-queries , where each query-term and its translations into the document language (s) are treated as synonym sets . this model leverages simultaneous search in multiple languages against jointly indexed documents to improve the accuracy of results over search using document-translation or query-translation alone . for query-translation , we compared a statistical machine-translation (smt) approach to a dictionary-based approach . we found that using a wikipedia-derived dictionary for named-entities combined with an smt-based dictionary worked better than smt alone . simultaneous multilingual search also has other important features suited to translingual search , since it can provide an indication of poor document-translation when a match with the source document is found . we show how close integration of clir and smt allows us to improve result translation in addition to ir results .
