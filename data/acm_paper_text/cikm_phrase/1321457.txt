just-in-time indexing for up to the second search e-commerce and intranet-search systems require newly arriving content to be indexed and made available for search within minutes or hours of arrival . applications such as file-system and email-search demand even faster turnaround from search systems , requiring new content to become available for search almost instantaneously . however , incrementally updating inverted-indices , which are the predominant datastructure used in search-engines , is an expensive operation that most systems avoid performing at high rates . we present jiti , a just-in-time indexing component that allows searching over incoming content (nearly) as soon as that content reaches the system . jiti 's main idea is to invest less in the preprocessing of arriving data , at the expense of a tolerable latency in query response-time . it is designed for deployment in search systems that maintain a large main index and that rebuild smaller stop-press indices once or twice an hour . jiti augments such systems with instant retrieval capabilities over content arriving in between the stop-press builds . a main design point is for jiti to demand few computational-resources , in particular ram and i/o . our experiments consisted of injecting several documents and queries per second concurrently into the system over half-hour long periods . we believe that there are search-applications for which the combination of the workloads we experimented with and the response-times we measured present a viable solution to a pressing problem .
