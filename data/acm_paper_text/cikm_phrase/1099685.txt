a new approach to intranet-search based on information-extraction this paper is concerned with ` intranet-search ' . by intranet-search , we mean searching for information on an intranet within an organization . we have found that search needs on an intranet can be categorized into types , through an analysis of survey-results and an analysis of search-log data . the types include searching for definitions , persons , experts , and homepages . traditional information-retrieval only focuses on search of relevant documents , but not on search of special types of information . we propose a new approach to intranet-search in which we search for information in each of the special types , in addition to the traditional relevance search . information-extraction technologies can play key roles in such kind of ` search by type ' approach , because we must first extract from the documents the necessary information in each type . we have developed an intranet-search system called ` information desk ' . in the system , we try to address the most important types of search first - finding term definitions , homepages of groups or topics , employees ' personal-information and experts on topics . for each type of search , we use information-extraction technologies to extract , fuse , and summarize information in advance . the system is in operation on the intranet of microsoft and receives accesses from about 500 employees per month . feedbacks from users and system-logs show that users consider the approach useful and the system can really help people to find information . this paper describes the architecture , features , component-technologies , and evaluation results of the system .
