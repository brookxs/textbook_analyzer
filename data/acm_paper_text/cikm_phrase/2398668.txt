on active-learning in hierarchical-classification most of the existing active-learning algorithms assume all the category labels as independent or consider them in a `` flat '' structure . however , in reality , there are many applications in which the set of possible labels are often organized in a hierarchical-structure . in this paper , we consider the problem of active-learning when the categories are represented as a tree . our goal is to exploit the structure-information of the label tree in active-learning to select the most informative samples to be labeled . we propose an algorithm that estimates the semantic space , embedding the category-hierarchy . in this space , each category-label is represented as a prototype and the uncertainty is measured using a variance-based fashion . we also demonstrate notable performance-improvement with the proposed approach on synthetic and real datasets .
