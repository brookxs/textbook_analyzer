semantic-caching via query-matching for web sources a semantic-caching scheme suitable for wrappers wrapping web sources is presented . since the-web sources have typically weaker querying capabilities than conventional databases , existing semantic-caching schemes can not be applied directly . a seamlessly integrated query-translation and capability mapping between the wrappers and web sources in semantic-caching is described . in addition , an analysis on the match types between the user 's input query and cached queries is presented . semantic-knowledge acquired from the data can be used to avoid unnecessary access to the-web sources by transforming the cache-miss to the cache hit . a polynomial-time-algorithm based on the proposed query-matching technique is presented to find the best matched query in the cache . experimental-results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed semantic-caching scheme .
