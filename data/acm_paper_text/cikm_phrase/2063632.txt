statistical source expansion for question-answering a source expansion algorithm automatically extends a given text-corpus with related-content from large external-sources such as the-web . the expanded corpus is not intended for human consumption but can be used in question-answering (qa) and other information-retrieval or extraction tasks to find more relevant-information and supporting-evidence . we propose an algorithm that extends a corpus of seed documents with web-content , using a statistical model to select text passages that are both relevant to the topics of the seeds and complement existing information . in an evaluation on 1,500 hand-labeled web-pages , our algorithm ranked text passages by relevance with 81 \ % map , compared to 43 \ % when relying on web-search-engine ranks alone and 75 \ % when using a multi-document-summarization algorithm . applied to qa , the proposed method yields consistent and significant performance gains . we evaluated the impact of source expansion on over 6,000 questions from the jeopardy! quiz show and trec evaluations using watson , a state-of-the-art qa-system . accuracy increased from 66 \ % to 71 \ % on jeopardy! questions and from 59 \ % to 64 \ % on trec questions .
