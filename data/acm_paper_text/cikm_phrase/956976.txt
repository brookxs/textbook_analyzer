an evaluation of the incorporation of a semantic-network into a multidimensional retrieval-engine this paper describes a new method for incorporating a hierarchical category dimension into an information-retrieval-framework . the approach is to use the synonym sets and the hyponym (`` is-a '') relations defined within wordnet in order to derive a conceptual hierarchical category dimension . the hierarchical nature of a category dimension not only provides an overview of a set of documents but also facilitates the effectiveness and the efficiency of searching documents . an evaluation is performed on two different types of models and the multidimensional approach shows a significant reduction in the number of page accesses over a large-document-collection .
