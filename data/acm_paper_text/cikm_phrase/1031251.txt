associative-document-retrieval by query-subtopic-analysis and its application to invalidity-patent-search we propose an associative-document-retrieval method , in which a document is used as a query to search for other similar documents . because a long document usually includes more than one topic , we first analyze a query document to extract multiple subtopics . for each subtopic element , a sub-query is produced and similar documents are retrieved with a relevance score . the relevance-scores are weighted by the importance of each subtopic element and are integrated to determine the final relevant documents . in the calculation of the subtopic importance , the specificity of a query-term is evaluated using entropy , which is the deviation degree of the appearances of the term in each subtopic element . we apply this method to an invalidity-patent-search . by exploiting certain unique features of japanese patent-claims , we use-features distinguishing the preamble and the essential portion in a query patent claim . to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method , we experimentally evaluated our associative-document-retrieval method on five years of patent documents .
