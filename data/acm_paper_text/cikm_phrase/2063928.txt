kleap : an efficient cleaning method to remove cross-reads in rfid streams recently , the rfid-technology has been widely used in many kinds of applications . however , because of the interference from environmental factors and limitations of the radio-frequency technology , the data-streams collected by the rfid readers are usually contain a lot of cross-reads . to address this issue , we propose a kernel density-based probability cleaning method (kleap) to remove cross-reads within a sliding-window . the method estimates the density of each tag using a kernel-based function . the reader corresponding to the micro-cluster with the largest density will be regarded as the position that the tagged-object should locate in current window , and the readings derived from other readers will be treated as the cross-reads . experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method .
