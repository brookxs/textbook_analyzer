scaling up duplicate-detection in graph-data duplicate-detection determines different representations of real-world-objects in a database . recent research has considered the use of relationships among object-representations to improve duplicate-detection . in the general case where relationships form a graph , research has mainly focused on duplicate-detection quality/effectiveness . scalability has been neglected so far , even though it is crucial for large real-world duplicate-detection tasks . we scale up duplicate-detection in graph-data (ddg) to large amounts of data using the support of a relational-database system . we first generalize the process of ddg and then present how to scale ddg in space (amount of data processed with limited main-memory) and in time . finally , we explore how complex similarity-computation can be performed efficiently . experiments on data an order of magnitude larger than data considered so far in ddg clearly show that our methods scale to large amounts of data .
