a compact and efficient image-retrieval approach based on border/interior pixel-classification this paper presents \ bic (b order / i nterior pixel c lassification) , a compact and efficient cbir approach suitable for broad image domains . it has three main components : (1) a simple and powerful image analysis-algorithm that classifies image pixels as either border or interior , (2) a new logarithmic distance (dlog) for comparing histograms , and (3) a compact-representation for the visual-features extracted from images . experimental-results show that the bic approach is consistently more compact , more efficient and more effective than state-of-the-art cbir approaches based on sophisticated image-analysis algorithms and complex distance-functions . it was also observed that the dlog distance-function has two main advantages over vectorial distances (e.g. , l 1) : (1) it is able to increase substantially the effectiveness of (several) histogram-based cbir approaches and , at the same time , (2) it reduces by 50 \ % the space requirement to represent a histogram .
