text-classification in a hierarchical-mixture-model for small training sets documents are commonly categorized into hierarchies of topics , such as the ones maintained by yahoo! and the open-directory-project , in order to facilitate browsing and other interactive forms of information-retrieval . in addition , topic-hierarchies can be utilized to overcome the sparseness-problem in text-categorization with a large number of categories , which is the main focus of this paper . this paper presents a hierarchical-mixture-model which extends the standard naive-bayes-classifier and previous hierarchical approaches . improved estimates of the term distributions are made by differentiation of words in the hierarchy according to their level of generality/specificity . experiments on the newsgroups and the reuters-21578 dataset indicate improved performance of the proposed classifier in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods on datasets with a small number of positive examples .
