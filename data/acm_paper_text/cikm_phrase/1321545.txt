efficient on-line-index-maintenance for dynamic-text-collections by using dynamic balancing tree previous on-line-index-maintenance strategies are mainly designed for document insertions without considering document deletions . in a truly dynamic search environment , however , documents may be added to and removed from the collection at any point in time . in this paper , we examine issues of on-line-index-maintenance with support for instantaneous document deletions and insertions . we present a dbt merge strategy that can dynamically adjust the sequence of sub-index merge operations during index-construction , and offers better query-processing performance than previous methods , while providing an equivalent level of index-maintenance performance when document insertions and deletions exist in parallel . using experiments on 426 gb of web-data we demonstrate the efficiency of our method in practice , showing that on-line-index construction for dynamic-text-collections can be performed efficiently and almost as fast as for growing text-collections .
