question-answer topic-model for question-retrieval in community-question-answering the major challenge for question-retrieval (qr) in community-question-answering (cqa) is the lexical gap between the queried question and the historical questions . this paper proposes a novel question-answer topic-model (qatm) to learn the latent topics aligned across the question-answer pairs to alleviate the lexical gap problem , with the assumption that a question and its paired answer share the same topic distribution . experiments conducted on a real-world cqa dataset from yahoo!-answers show that combining both parts properly can get more knowledge than each part or both parts in a simple mixing way and combining our qatm with the state-of-the-art translation-based language-model , where the topic and translation information is learned from the question-answer pairs at two different grained semantic levels respectively , can significantly improve the qr performance .
