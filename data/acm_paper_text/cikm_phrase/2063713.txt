semi-supervised-multi-task-learning of structured-prediction models for web-information-extraction extracting information from web-pages is an important problem ; it has several applications such as providing improved-search results and construction of databases to serve user queries . in this paper we propose a novel structured-prediction method to address two important aspects of the extraction-problem : (1) labeled-data is available only for a small number of sites and (2) a machine learned global-model does not generalize adequately well across many websites . for this purpose , we propose a weight-space_based graph-regularization method . this method has several advantages . first , it can use unlabeled-data to address the limited labeled-data problem and falls in the class of graph-regularization_based semi-supervised-learning approaches . second , to address the generalization inadequacy of a global-model , this method builds a local model for each website . viewing the problem of building a local model for each website as a task , we learn the models for a collection of sites jointly ; thus our method can also be seen as a graph-regularization_based multi-task-learning approach . learning the models jointly with the proposed method is very useful in two ways : (1) learning a local model for a website can be effectively influenced by labeled and unlabeled-data from other websites ; and (2) even for a website with only unlabeled-examples it is possible to learn a decent local model . we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on several real-life data ; experimental-results show that significant performance-improvement can be obtained by combining semi-supervised and multi-task-learning in a single framework .
