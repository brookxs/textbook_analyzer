enhancing accessibility of microblogging messages using semantic-knowledge the volume of microblogging messages is increasing exponentially with the popularity of microblogging-services . with a large number of messages appearing in user-interfaces , it hinders user accessibility to useful information buried in disorganized , incomplete , and unstructured-text messages . in order to enhance user accessibility , we propose to aggregate related microblogging messages into clusters and automatically assign them semantically meaningful labels . however , a distinctive feature of microblogging messages is that they are much shorter than conventional text-documents . these messages provide inadequate term co occurrence information for capturing semantic-associations . to address this problem , we propose a novel framework for organizing unstructured microblogging messages by transforming them to a semantically structured-representation . the proposed framework first captures informative tree fragments by analyzing a parse-tree of the message , and then exploits external-knowledge bases (wikipedia and wordnet) to enhance their semantic-information . empirical-evaluation on a twitter dataset shows that our framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods .
