a unified-model for metasearch , pooling , and system-evaluation we present a unified-model which , given the ranked-lists of documents returned by multiple retrieval-systems in response to a given query , simultaneously solves the problems of (1) fusing the ranked-lists of documents in order to obtain a high-quality combined list (metasearch) ; (2) generating document-collections likely to contain large fractions of relevant documents (pooling) ; and (3) accurately evaluating the underlying retrieval-systems with small numbers of relevance-judgments (efficient system assessment) . our approach is based on the hedge algorithm for on-line-learning . in effect , our proposed system `` learns '' which documents are likely to be relevant from a sequence of on-line relevance-judgments . in experiments using trec-data , our methodology is shown to outperform standard methods for metasearch , pooling , and system-evaluation , often remarkably so .
