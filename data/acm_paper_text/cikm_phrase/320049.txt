a comparison of alternative continuous display-techniques with heterogeneous multi-zone disks a number of recent technological trends have made data-intensive-applications such as continuous-media (audio and video) servers a reality . these servers are expected to play an important role in applications such as video-on-demand , digital-library , news-on-demand , distance-learning , etc. . continuous-media applications are data-intensive and might require storage subsystems that consist of hundreds of (multi-zone) disk-drives . with the current technological trends , a homogeneous disk-subsystem might evolve to consist of a heterogeneous collection of disk-drives . given such a storage-subsystem , the system must continue to support a hiccup-free display of audio and video clips . this study describes extensions of four continuous display-techniques for multi-zone disk-drives to a heterogeneous-platform . these techniques include ibm 's logical track [21] , hp 's track pairing [4] , and usc 's fixb [9] and deadline driven techniques [10] . we quantify the performance-tradeoff associated with these techniques using analytical-models and simulation-studies . the obtained results demonstrate tradeoffs between the cost per simultaneous stream supported by a technique , the wasted disk space , and the incurred startup latency .
