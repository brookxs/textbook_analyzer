exploiting co-occurrence and information quality-metrics to recommend tags in web-2.0-applications this work addresses the task of recommending high quality tags by exploiting not only previously assigned tags , but also terms extracted from other textual-features (e.g. , title and description) associated with the target object.to estimate the quality of a candidate tag-recommendation , we use several metrics related to both tag-co-occurrence and information quality . we also propose a heuristic function to combine the metrics to produce a final ranking of the recommended tags . we evaluate our heuristic function in various scenarios , for three popular web-2.0-applications . our experimental-results indicate that our heuristic function significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art tag-recommendation algorithms .
