reconciling ontologies and the-web of data to integrate linked-open-data , which originates from various and heterogeneous-sources , the use of well-defined ontologies is essential . however , oftentimes the utilization of these ontologies by data publishers differs from the intended application envisioned by ontology engineers . this may lead to unspecified properties being used ad-hoc as predicates in rdf-triples or it may result in infrequent usage of specified properties . these mismatches impede the goals and propagation of the-web of data as data consumers face difficulties when trying to discover and integrate domain-specific-information . in this work , we identify and classify common misusage patterns by employing frequency-analysis and rule-mining . based on this analysis , we introduce an algorithm to propose suggestions for a data-driven ontology re-engineering workflow , which we evaluate on two large-scale rdf datasets .
