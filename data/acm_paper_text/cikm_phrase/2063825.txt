context-based entity description rule for entity-resolution in this paper , we consider the entity-resolution (er) problem , which is to identify objects referring to the same real-world entity . prior work of er involves expensive similarity comparison and clustering approaches . additionally , the quality of entity-resolution may be low due to insufficient information . to address these problems , by adopting context-information of data objects , we present a novel framework of entity-resolution , context-based entity description (ced) , to make context-information help entity-resolution . in our framework , each entity is described by a set of ceds . during entity-resolution , objects are only compared with ceds to determine its corresponding entity . additionally , we propose efficient-algorithms for ced discovery and ced-based entity-resolution . we experimentally evaluated our ced-based er algorithm on the real dblp datasets , and the experimental-results show that our algorithm can achieve both high precision and recall as well as outperform existing methods .
