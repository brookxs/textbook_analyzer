a local-search mechanism for peer-to-peer-networks one important problem in peer-to-peer (p2p) networks is searching and retrieving the correct information . however , existing searching mechanisms in pure peer-to-peer-networks are inefficient due to the decentralized nature of such networks . we propose two mechanisms for information-retrieval in pure peer-to-peer-networks . the first , the modified breadth-first-search (bfs) mechanism , is an extension of the current gnuttela protocol , allows searching with keywords , and is designed to minimize the number of messages that are needed to search the network . the second , the intelligent-search mechanism , uses the past behavior of the p2p-network to further improve the scalability of the search-procedure . in this algorithm , each peer autonomously decides which of its peers are most likely to answer a given query . the algorithm is entirely distributed , and therefore scales well with the size of the network . we implemented our mechanisms as middleware-platforms . to show the advantages of our mechanisms we present experimental-results using the middleware implementation .
