adaptive co-training svm for sentiment-classification on tweets sentiment-classification is an important problem in tweets mining . there lack labeled-data and rating mechanism for generating them in twitter service . and topics in twitter are more diverse while sentiment classifiers always dedicate themselves to a specific domain or topic . thus it is a challenge to make sentiment-classification adaptive to diverse topics without sufficient labeled-data . therefore we formally propose an adaptive multiclass svm-model which transfers an initial common sentiment classifier to a topic-adaptive one . to tackle the tweet sparsity , non-text features are explored besides the conventional text-features , which are intuitively split into two views . an iterative-algorithm is proposed for solving this model by alternating among three steps : optimization , unlabeled-data selection and adaptive feature expansion steps . the algorithm alternatively minimizes the margins of two independent objectives on different views to learn coefficient matrices , which are collaboratively used for unlabeled tweets selection from the topic that the algorithm is adapting to . and then topic-adaptive sentiment words are expended based on the above selection , in turn to help the first two steps find more confident and unlabeled tweets and boost the final performance . comparing with the well-known supervised sentiment classifiers and semi-supervised approaches , our algorithm achieves promising increases in accuracy averagely on the 6 topics from public tweet corpus .
