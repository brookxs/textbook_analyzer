combining machine-learning and human-judgment in author-disambiguation author-disambiguation in digital-libraries becomes increasingly difficult as the number of publications and consequently the number of ambiguous author-names keep growing . the fully automatic author-disambiguation approach could not give satisfactory results due to the lack of signals in many cases . furthermore , human-judgment on the basis of automatic algorithms is also not suitable because the automatically disambiguated results are often mixed and not understandable for humans . in this paper , we propose a labeling oriented author-disambiguation approach , called load , to combine machine-learning and human-judgment together in author-disambiguation . load exploits a framework which consists of high precision clustering , high recall clustering , and top dissimilar clusters selection and ranking . in the framework , supervised-learning algorithms are used to train the similarity-functions between publications and a clustering-algorithm is further applied to generate clusters . to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed load approach , comprehensive experiments are conducted . comparing to conventional author-disambiguation algorithms , the load yields much more accurate results to assist human labeling . further experiments show that the load approach can save labeling time dramatically .
