constrained subspace skyline computation in this paper we introduce the problem of constrained subspace skyline-queries . this class of queries can be thought of as a generalization of subspace skyline-queries using range constraints . although both constrained skyline-queries and subspace skyline-queries have been addressed previously , the implications of constrained subspace skyline-queries has not been examined so far . constrained skyline-queries are usually more expensive than regular skylines . in case of constrained subspace skyline-queries additional performance-degradation is caused through the projection . in order to support constrained skylines for arbitrary subspaces , we present approaches exploiting multiple low-dimensional indexes instead of relying on a single high-dimensional-index . effective pruning strategies are applied to discard points from dominated regions . an important ingredient of our approach is the workload-adaptive strategy for determining the number of indexes and the assignment of dimensions to the indexes . extensive performance-evaluation shows the superiority of our proposed technique compared to its most related competitors .
