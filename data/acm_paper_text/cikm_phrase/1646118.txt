incident-threading for news passages with an overwhelming volume of news reports currently available , there is an increasing need for automatic techniques to analyze and present news to a general reader in a meaningful and efficient manner . we explore incident-threading as a possible solution to this problem . all text that describes the occurrence of a real-world happening is merged into a news incident , and incidents are organized in a network with dependencies of predefined types . earlier attempts at this problem have assumed that a news story covers a single topic . we move beyond that limitation to introduce passage-threading , which processes news at the passage level . first we develop a new testbed for this research and extend the evaluation-methods to address new granularity issues . then a three-stage algorithm is described that identifies on-subject passages , groups them into incidents , and establishes links between related incidents . finally , we observe significant improvement over earlier work when we optimize the harmonic mean of the appropriate evaluation-measures . the resulting performance exceeds the level that a calibration study shows is necessary to support a reading-comprehension task .
