an on-line interactive-method for finding association-rules data-streams in order to trace the changes of association-rules over an online data-stream efficiently , this paper proposes two different methods of generating all association-rules directly over the changing set of currently frequent-itemsets . while all of the currently frequent-itemsets are monitored by the estdec method , all the association-rules of every frequent-itemset in the prefix-tree of the estdec method are generated . for this purpose , a traversal stack is introduced to efficiently enumerate all association-rules . these online methods can avoid the drawbacks of the conventional two-step approach . in an on-line environment , a user may be interested in finding those association-rules whose antecedents or consequents are fixed to be a specific itemset . since generating all the association-rules may take too long to produce them timely , two additional methods , namely assoc-x and assoc-y , are introduced . finally , the proposed methods are compared by a series of experiments to identify their various characteristics .
