spam-filtering for short messages we consider the problem of content-based spam-filtering for short-text messages that arise in three contexts : mobile (sms) communication , blog comments , and email summary information such as might be displayed by a low-bandwidth client . short messages often consist of only a few words , and therefore present a challenge to traditional bag-of-words_based spam-filters . using three corpora of short messages and message fields derived from real sms , blog , and spam messages , we evaluate feature-based and compression-model-based spam-filters . we observe that bag-of-words filters can be improved substantially using different features , while compression-model filters perform quite well as-is . we conclude that content-filtering for short messages is surprisingly effective .
