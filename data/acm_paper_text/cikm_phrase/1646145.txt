label correspondence learning for part-of-speech-annotation transformation the performance of machine-learning-methods heavily depends on the volume of used training-data . for the purpose of dataset enlargement , it is of interest to study the problem of unifying multiple labeled datasets with different annotation standards . in this paper , we focus on the case of unifying datasets for sequence-labeling problems with natural-language part-of-speech (pos) tagging as an examplar application . to this end , we propose a probabilistic-approach to transforming the annotations of one dataset to the standard specified by another dataset . the key component of the approach , named as label correspondence learning , serves as a bridge of annotations from the datasets . two methods designed from distinct perspectives are proposed to attack this sub-problem . experiments on two large-scale part-of-speech datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the transformation and label correspondence learning-methods .
