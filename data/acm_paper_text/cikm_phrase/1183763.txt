practical private-data matching deterrent to spoofing attacks private-data matching between the data-sets of two potentially distrusted parties has a wide range of applications . however , existing solutions have substantial weaknesses and do not meet the needs of many practical application-scenarios . in particular , practical private-data matching applications often require discouraging the matching parties from spoofing their private inputs . in this paper , we address this challenge by forcing the matching parties to `` escrow '' the data they use for matching to an auditorial agent , and in the `` after-the-fact '' period , they undertake the liability to attest the genuineness of the escrowed data .
