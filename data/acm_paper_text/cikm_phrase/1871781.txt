spac : a distributed , peer-to-peer , secure and privacy-aware social-space to support privacy-aware management of data in social-spaces , the user personal-data needs to be stored at each user device , and shared only with a trusted subset of other users . to date , social-spaces only have fairly limited access-control capabilities , that do not protect the possibly sensitive-data of the users . in this demonstration , we showcase our sp ac system , a distributed , peer-to-peer , secure and privacy-aware social-space system . sp ac is equipped with : (i) an sql-based declarative distributed-query language to specify which data to share and whom to share with . such a language guarantees the fine-grained access to the data , (ii) a fully-decentralized authorization that relies on classic cryptographic-protocols to provide robust and resilient key-based encryption for access-control-enforcement , and (iii) an update-friendly access-control mechanism , that also addresses the updates on both the network and the access-control-policies .
