a probabilistic-relevance-propagation model for hypertext retrieval a major challenge in developing models for hypertext retrieval is to effectively combine content information with the link-structure available in hypertext-collections . although several link-based-ranking methods have been developed to improve retrieval results , none of them can fully exploit the discrimination power of contents as well as fully exploit all useful link-structures . in this paper , we propose a general relevance-propagation framework for combining content and link information . the framework gives a probabilistic score to each document defined based on a probabilistic surfing model . two main characteristics of our framework are our probabilistic view on the relevance-propagation model and propagation through multiple sets of neighbors . we compare eight different models derived from the probabilistic-relevance-propagation framework on two standard trec web-test-collections . our results show that all the eight relevance-propagation models can outperform the baseline content only ranking-method for a wide range of parameter-values , indicating that the relevance-propagation framework provides a general , effective and robust way of exploiting link information . our experiments also show that using multiple neighbor sets outperforms using just one type of neighbors significantly and taking a probabilistic view of propagation provides guidance on setting propagation parameters .
