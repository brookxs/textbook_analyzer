more than relevance : high utility query-recommendation by mining users ' search-behaviors query-recommendation plays a critical role in helping users ' search . most existing approaches on query-recommendation aim to recommend relevant queries . however , the ultimate goal of query-recommendation is to assist users to reformulate queries so that they can accomplish their search-task successfully and quickly . only considering relevance in query-recommendation is apparently not directly toward this goal . in this paper , we argue that it is more important to directly recommend queries with high utility , i.e. , queries that can better satisfy users ' information-needs . for this purpose , we propose a novel generative-model , referred to as query utility-model (qum) , to capture query utility by simultaneously modeling users ' reformulation and click behaviors . the experimental-results on a publicly released query-log show that , our approach is more effective in helping users find relevant search-results and thus satisfying their information-needs .
