rule-based query-optimization , revisited we present the architecture and a performance-assessment of an extensible query optimizer written in venus . venus is a general-purpose active-database rule-language embedded in c++ . following the developments in extensible database query optimizers , first in rule-based form , followed by optimizers written as object-oriented-programs , the venus-based optimizer avails to the advantages of both . venus ' modular structure allows us to go a step further and provide extensibility in search by defining parameterized search components in a declarative form that has the additional effect of integrating heuristic and cost-based-optimization . we compare optimizers developed with volcano , opt + + and venus . venus ' optimizing-compiler yields code whose performance is comparable with volcano and opt + + on smaller queries . the ability to introduce additional pruning heuristics yields better scalability on larger queries . evaluation of the system using quantitative software-metrics supports a claim that the venus-based optimizer is more easily maintained and extended than are its predecessors .
