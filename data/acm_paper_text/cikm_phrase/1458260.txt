road : an efficient framework for location dependentspatial queries on road-networks in this research , we develop road , a system framework for processing location-dependent spatial-queries (ldsqs) that search for spatial-objects of interest on road-networks . by exploiting search-space-pruning , road is very efficient and flexible for various ldsqs on different types of objects over large-scale-networks . in road , a large road-network is organized as a set of interconnected regional sub-networks (called rnets) augmented with 1) shortcuts for accelerating search traversals ; and 2) object abstracts for guiding object-search . in this poster , we outline this framework and explain how it can support efficient location-dependent nearest-neighbor-search .
