hierarchical document categorization with support-vector-machines automatically categorizing documents into pre-defined topic-hierarchies or taxonomies is a crucial step in knowledge and content-management . standard machine-learning-techniques like support-vector-machines and related large-margin methods have been successfully applied for this task , albeit the fact that they ignore the inter-class relationships . in this paper , we propose a novel hierarchical-classification method that generalizes support-vector-machine learning and that is based on discriminant-functions that are structured in a way that mirrors the class-hierarchy . our method can work with arbitrary , not necessarily singly connected taxonomies and can deal with task-specific loss-functions . all parameters are learned jointly by optimizing a common objective-function corresponding to a regularized upper-bound on the empirical loss . we present experimental-results on the wipo-alpha patent collection to show the competitiveness of our approach .
