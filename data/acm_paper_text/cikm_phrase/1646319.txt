a flexible simulation-environment for flash-aware algorithms in this paper , we present a flexible simulation-environment for the performance-evaluation of flash-aware algorithms , which is called flash-dbsim . the main purpose of flash-dbsim is to provide a configurable virtual flash-disk for upper systems , such as file-system and dbms , so that the algorithms in those systems can be easily evaluated on different types of flash-disks . moreover , it also offers a prototyping environment for those algorithms inside flash-disk , e.g. the algorithms for garbage-collection or wear-leveling . after an overview of the general-features of flash-dbsim , we discuss the architecture of flash-dbsim . and finally , a case-study of flash-dbsim 's demonstration is presented .
