integrating a part relationship into an open oodb system using metaclasses the part-whole semantic-relationship (the part relationship , for short) is an important modeling primitive in many advanced application-domains such as manufacturing , design , and document-processing . in this paper , we examine the problem of integrating such a construct into an oodb system . specifically , two questions are addressed in this regard . this first is : can a part relationship be made an intrinsic construct of an existing oodb system without having to rewrite a substantial portion of the system ? the second : can an open oodb system which claims to support such an integration really do so , and , more specifically , can the integration be done using a metaclass mechanism which purports to bring extensibility to the vodak model language (vml) ? to demonstrate that both questions can be answered yes , we introduce and discuss the details of a custom vml metaclass the holonymicmeronymic metaclass which we have built . this metaclass comprises two items , an instance type and an instance-instance type . together , the two endow the classes of a part hierarchy and their instances with structure and behavior consistent with our comprehensive part relationship model and the notions of part and whole . complete descriptions of each of these two aspects of the metaclass are presented and their effect on schema construction and database usage is discussed .
