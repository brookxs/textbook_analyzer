casino : towards conformity-aware social-influence-analysis in online-social-networks social-influence-analysis in online-social-networks is the study of people 's influence by analyzing the social-interactions between individuals . there have been increasing research efforts to understand the influence propagation phenomenon due to its importance to information-dissemination among others . despite the progress achieved by state-of-the-art social-influence-analysis techniques , a key limitation of these techniques is that they only utilize positive interactions (e.g. , agreement , trust) between individuals , ignoring two equally important factors , namely , negative relationships (e.g. , distrust , disagreement) between individuals and conformity of people , which refers to a person 's inclination to be influenced . in this paper , we propose a novel algorithm casino (conformity-aware social-influence computation) to study the interplay between influence and conformity of each individual . given a social-network , casino first extracts a set of topic-based-subgraphs where each subgraph depicts the social-interactions associated with a specific topic . then it optionally labels the edges (relationships) between individuals with positive or negative signs . finally , it computes the influence and conformity indices of each individual in each signed topic-based subgraph . our empirical-study with several real-world social-networks demonstrates superior effectiveness and accuracy of casino compared to state-of-the-art methods . furthermore , we revealed several interesting characteristics of `` influentials '' and `` conformers '' in these networks .
