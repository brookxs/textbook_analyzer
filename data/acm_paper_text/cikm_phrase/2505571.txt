personalized influence-maximization on social-networks in this paper , we study a new problem on social-network influence-maximization . the problem is defined as , given a target user $ w $ , finding the top-k most influential nodes for the user . different from existing influence-maximization works which aim to find a small subset of nodes to maximize the spread of influence over the entire network (i.e. , global optima) , our problem aims to find a small subset of nodes which can maximize the influence spread to a given target user (i.e. , local-optima) . the solution is critical for personalized-services on social-networks , where fully understanding of each specific user is essential . although some global influence-maximization models can be narrowed down as the solution , these methods often bias to the target node itself . to this end , in this paper we present a local influence-maximization solution . we first provide a random function , with low variance guarantee , to randomly simulate the objective-function of local influence-maximization . then , we present efficient-algorithms with approximation guarantee . for online-social-network applications , we also present a scalable approximate-algorithm by exploring the local cascade structure of the target user . we test the proposed algorithms on several real-world social-networks . experimental-results validate the performance of the proposed algorithms .
