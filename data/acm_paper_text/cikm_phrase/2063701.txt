learning conditional-random-fields with latent sparse features for acronym-expansion finding the ever increasing usage of acronyms in many kinds of documents , including web-pages , is becoming an obstacle for average readers . this paper studies the task of finding expansions in documents for a given set of acronyms . we cast the expansion-finding problem as a sequence-labeling task and adapt conditional-random-fields (crf) to solve it . while adapting crfs , we enhance the performance from two aspects . first , we introduce nonlinear hidden layers to learn better representations of the input data . second , we design simple and effective features . we create a hand labeled evaluation-data based on wikipedia.org and web-crawling . we evaluate the effectiveness of several algorithms in solving the expansion-finding problem . the experimental-results demonstrate that the new method achieves performs better than support-vector-machine and standard conditional-random-fields .
