matchsim : a novel neighbor-based similarity-measure with maximum neighborhood-matching the problem of measuring similarity between web-pages arises in many important web-applications , such as search-engines and web-directories . in this paper , we propose a novel neighbor-based similarity-measure called matchsim , which uses only the neighborhood-structure of web-pages . technically , matchsim recursively defines similarity between web-pages by the average similarity of the maximum-matching between their neighbors . our method extends the traditional methods which simply count the numbers of common and/or different neighbors . it also successfully overcomes a severe counterintuitive loophole in simrank , due to its strict consistency with the intuitions of similarity . we give the computational-complexity of matchsim iteration . the accuracy of matchsim is compared against others on two real datasets . the results show that our method performs best in most cases .
