fast multi-task-learning for query-spelling correction in this paper , we explore the use of a novel online multi-task-learning framework for the task of search-query spelling-correction . in our procedure , correction candidates are initially generated by a ranker-based system and then re-ranked by our multi-task-learning algorithm . with the proposed multi-task-learning method , we are able to effectively transfer information from different and highly biased training datasets , for improving spelling-correction on all datasets . our experiments are conducted on three query-spelling correction datasets including the well-known trec benchmark-dataset . the experimental-results demonstrate that our proposed method considerably outperforms the existing baseline systems in terms of accuracy . importantly , the proposed method is about one order of magnitude faster than baseline systems in terms of training speed . compared to the commonly used online-learning methods which typically require more than (e.g. ,) 60 training passes , our proposed method is able to closely reach the empirical optimum in about 5 passes .
