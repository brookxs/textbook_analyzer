construction of a sentimental-word-dictionary the-web has plenty of reviews , comments and reports about products , services , government policies , institutions , etc. . the opinions expressed in these reviews influence how people regard these entities . for example , a product with consistently good reviews is likely to sell well , while a product with numerous bad reviews is likely to sell poorly . our aim is to build a sentimental-word-dictionary , which is larger than existing sentimental word dictionaries and has high accuracy . we introduce rules for deduction , which take words with known polarities as input and produce synsets (a set of synonyms with a definition) with polarities . the synsets with deduced polarities can then be used to further deduce the polarities of other words . experimental-results show that for a given sentimental-word-dictionary with d words , approximately an additional 50 \ % of d words with polarities can be deduced . an experiment is conducted to find the accuracy of a random-sample of the deduced words . it is found that the accuracy is about the same as that of comparing the judgment of one human with that of another .
