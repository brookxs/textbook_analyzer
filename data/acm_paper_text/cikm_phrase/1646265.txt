collaborative resource-discovery in social-tagging systems social-tagging systems which allow users to create , edit and share collections of internet resources associated with tags in a collaborative fashion are growing in popularity in recent years . the rapidly growing amount of shared data in these folksonomies , i.e. , taxonomies created by the folk , presents new technical challenges involved with discovering resources which are likely of interest to the user . social-tags which reflect the meaning of resources from the user 's points of view provide an opportunity to enhance the quality of retrieval . in this paper , we introduce a novel framework to search relevant resources to the user-query by incorporating information obtained from folksonomies ' underlying data-structures consisting of a set of user/tag/resource triplets . in contrast to traditional retrieval and recommendation techniques which represent a collection by a matrix , we represent our data as a third-order tensor on which a novel cube latent-semantic-indexing (cubelsi) technique is proposed to capture latent-semantic associations between tags . with the latent-semantic representation we show how to rank relevant resources according to their relevance to user queries . the excellent performance of the method is demonstrated by an experimental-evaluation on the deli.cio.us dataset .
