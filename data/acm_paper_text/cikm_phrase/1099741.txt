optimizing cursor-movement in holistic-twig-joins holistic-twig-join algorithms represent the-state-of-the-art for evaluating path-expressions in xml-queries . using inverted-indexes on xml elements , holistic-twig-joins move a set of index cursors in a coordinated way to quickly find structural matches . because each cursor move can trigger i/o , the performance of a holistic-twig-join is largely determined by how many cursor moves it makes , yet , surprisingly , existing join-algorithms have not been optimized along these lines . in this paper , we describe twigoptimal , a new holistic-twig-join algorithm with optimal cursor-movement . we sketch the proof of twigoptimal 's optimality , and describe how twigoptimal can use information in the return clause of xquery to boost its performance . finally , experimental-results are presented , showing twigoptimal 's superiority over existing holistic-twig-join algorithms .
