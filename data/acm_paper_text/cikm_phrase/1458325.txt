collaborative partitioning with maximum user-satisfaction our collaborative partitioning model posits a bicriteria objective in which we seek the best item clustering that satisfies the most users at the highest level of satisfaction . we consider two basic methods for determining user-satisfaction . the first method is based on how well each user 's preferences match a given partition , and the second method is based on average correlation scores taken over sufficiently large subpopulations of users . we show these problems are np-hard and develop a set of heuristic approaches for solving them . we provide lower-bounds on the satisfaction level on random-data , and error-bounds in the planted partition model , which provide confidence levels for our heuristic-methods . finally , we present experiments on several real examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework .
