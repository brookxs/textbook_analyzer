on the complexity of schema-inference from web-pages in the presence of nullable data attributes an increasingly large number of web-pages are machine-generated by filling in templates with data stored in backend databases . these templates can be viewed as the implicit schemas of those web-pages . the ability to infer the implicit schema from a collection of web-pages is important for scalable data extraction , since the inferred schema can be used to automatically identify schema attributes that are `` encoded '' in web pages.however , the task of inferring a `` good '' schema is complicated due to the existence of nullable (missing) data attributes . usually if an attribute contains a null-value , then it will be omitted in the generated web-page , giving rise to different variations and permutations of layout structures in web-pages that are generated from the same template.in this paper we investigate the complexity of schema-inference from web-pages in the presence of nullable data attributes . we introduce the notion of unambiguity as a quality-measure for inferred schemas and prove that the problem of inferring `` good '' (unambiguous) schemas is np-complete . our complexity-results imply that ambiguity-resolution is one of the root-causes of the computational difficulty underlying schema-inference from web-pages .
