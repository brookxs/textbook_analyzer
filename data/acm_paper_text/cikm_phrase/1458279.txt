siphon + + : a hidden-webcrawler for keyword-based interfaces the hidden-web consists of data that is generally hidden behind form interfaces , and as such , it is out of reach for traditional search-engines . with the goal of leveraging the high-quality information in this largely unexplored portion of the-web , in this paper , we propose a new strategy for automatically retrieving data hidden behind keyword-based form interfaces . unlike previous approaches to this problem , our strategy adapts the query-generation and selection by detecting features of the index . we describe an extensive experimental-evaluation which shows that : our strategy is able to derive appropriate queries to obtain high-coverage while , at the same time , avoiding the retrieval of redundant data ; and it obtains higher coverage and is more efficient approaches that use a fixed-strategy for query-generation .
