summa : subgraph-matching in massive graphs graphs can represent a large number of data-types , e.g. , online-social-networks , internet links , procedure dependency-graphs , etc. . the need for indexing massive graphs is an urgent research problem of great practical importance . the main challenge is the size . each graph may contain at least tens of millions vertices . the working-memory may not be able to store the database graph due to its large size , which increases the processing-time significantly . we propose a novel index_based subgraph-matching scheme , namely summa , for graph-querying in massive graphs . we devise two novel indices which capture both local and global information of the database graph . summa is further optimized by the use of a matching scheme to reduce redundant calculations and disk accesses . last but not least , a number of synthetic datasets are used to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of our proposed method .
