digrank : using global degree to facilitate ranking in an incomplete-graph pagerank has been broadly applied to get credible rank sequences of nodes in many networks such as the-web , citation-networks , or online-social-networks . however , in the real-world , it is usually hard to ascertain a complete structure of a network , particularly a large-scale one . some researchers have begun to explore how to get a relatively accurate rank more efficiently . they have proposed some local-approximation methods , which are especially designed for quickly estimating the pagerank value of a new node , after it is just added to the network . yet , these local-approximation methods rely on the link-server too much , and it is difficult to use them to estimate rank sequences of nodes in a group . so we propose a new method called digrank , which uses global degree to facilitate ranking in an incomplete-graph and which takes into account the frequent need for applications to rank users in a-community , retrieve pages in a particular area , or mine nodes in a fractional or limited network . based on experiments in small-world and scale-free-networks generated by models , the digrank method performs better than other local-estimation methods on ranking nodes in a given subgraph . in the models , it tends to perform best in graphs that have low average shortest-path length , high average degree , or weak community-structure . besides , compared with an local pagerank and an advanced local-approximation method , it significantly reduces the computational cost and error-rate .
