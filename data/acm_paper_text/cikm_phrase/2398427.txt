learning to discover complex mappings from web-forms to ontologies in order to realize the-semantic-web , various structures on the web including web-forms need to be annotated with and mapped to domain-ontologies . we present a machine learning-based automatic approach for discovering complex mappings from web-forms to ontologies . a complex mapping associates a set of semantically related elements on a form to a set of semantically related elements in an ontology . existing schema-mapping solutions mainly rely on integrity-constraints to infer complex schema-mappings . however , it is difficult to extract rich integrity-constraints from forms . we show how machine-learning-techniques can be used to automatically discover complex mappings between web-forms and ontologies . the challenge is how to capture and learn the complicated knowledge encoded in existing complex mappings . we develop an initial solution that takes a naive-bayesian approach . we evaluated the performance of the solution on various domains . our experimental-results show that the solution returns the expected mappings as the top-1 results usually among several hundreds candidate mappings for more than 80 % of the test-cases . furthermore , the expected mappings are always returned as the top-k-results with k
