towards interactive indexing for large chinese-calligraphic-character databases in this paper , based on a novel shape-similarity-based retrieval-method , we propose an interactive partial-distance-map (pdm) - based high-dimensional-indexing scheme to speed up the retrieval-performance of the large chinese-calligraphic-character databases . specifically , we use the approximate minimal bounding hyper - sphere of query character to search the pdm and utilize the users ' relevance-feedback to refine the search-process . we conduct comprehensive experiments to testify the efficiency-and-effectiveness of the proposed method .
