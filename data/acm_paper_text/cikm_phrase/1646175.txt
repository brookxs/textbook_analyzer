effective and efficient structured-retrieval search-engines that support structured-documents typically support-structure created by the author (e.g. , title , section) , and may also support-structure added by an annotation-process (e.g. , part-of-speech , named-entity , semantic-role) . exploiting such structure can be difficult . query-structure may fail to match structure in a relevant-document for a variety of reasons , thus structured-queries , although containing more information than keyword-queries , are often less effective than unstructured queries . this paper studies retrieval of sentences with annotations for a question-answering-task . three problems of structured-retrieval are identified and solutions proposed . structural-mismatch is addressed by query-structure expansion of predicted relevant structures . lack of presence of all key aspects of a question is solved by boolean-filtering of result sentences . the score variations of the annotator generated fields with all the different lengths are accounted for by using field specific smoothing . experiments show that each solution incrementally improves structured-retrieval , and a combination of boolean-filtering , structural expansion , and keyword-queries outperforms keyword and simple structured-retrieval baselines .
