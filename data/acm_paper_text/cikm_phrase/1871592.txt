vsencoding : efficient coding and fast decoding of integer lists via dynamic-programming encoding lists of integers efficiently is important for many applications in different fields . adjacency lists of large-graphs are usually encoded to save space and to improve decoding speed . inverted-indexes of information-retrieval-systems keep the lists of postings compressed in order to exploit the memory-hierarchy . secondary-indexes of dbmss are stored similarly to inverted-indexes in ir systems . in this paper we propose vector of splits encoding (vsencoding) , a novel class of encoders that work by optimally partitioning a list of integers into blocks which are efficiently compressed by using simple encoders . in previous works heuristics were applied during the partitioning step . instead , we find the optimal-solution by using a dynamic-programming-approach . experiments show that our class of encoders outperform all the existing methods in literature by more than 10 \ % (with the exception of binary interpolative coding with which they , roughly , tie) still retaining a very fast decompression algorithm .
