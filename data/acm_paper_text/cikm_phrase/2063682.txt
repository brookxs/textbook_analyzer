assisting web-search users by destination reachability search-engine users are increasingly performing complex-tasks based on the simple keyword-in document-out paradigm . to assist users in accomplishing their tasks effectively , search-engines provide query recommendations based on the user 's current query . these are suggestions for follow-up queries given the user-provided query . a large number of techniques have been proposed in the past on mining such query recommendations which include past user sessions (e.g. , sequence of queries within a specified window of time) to identify most frequently occurring pairs , using click-through graphs (e.g. , a bipartite-graph of queries and the urls on which users clicked) and rank these suggestions using some form of frequency-counts from the past query-logs . given the limited number of queries that are offered (typically 5) it is important to effectively rank them . in this paper , we present a novel approach to ranking query recommendations which not only consider relevance to the original query but also take into account efficiency of a query at accomplishing a user-search task at hand . we formalize the notion of query-efficiency and show how our objective-function effectively captures this as determined by a human-study and eliminates biases introduced by click-through based metrics . to compute this objective-function , we present a pseudosupervised learning-technique where no explicit human experts are required to label samples . in addition , our techniques effectively characterize preferred url destinations and project each query into a higher dimension-space where each sub-spaces represents user-intent using these characteristics . finally , we present an extensive evaluation of our proposed methods against production-systems and show our method to increase task-completion efficiency by 15 \ % .
