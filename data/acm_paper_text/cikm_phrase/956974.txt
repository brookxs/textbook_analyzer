ontology-driven peer profiling in peer-to-peer enabled semantic-web peer-to-peer (p2p) systems and semantic-web are two novel-technologies that face a lot of shortcomings if considered as isolated paradigms . we present an approach that utilizes ontologies to set up a peer-profile containing all the data , necessary for peer-to-peer interoperability . using this profile can help eliminate some major issues persistent in current p2p-networks , such as security , resource-aggregation , group-management . we also consider applications of peer profiling for semantic-web built on p2p-networks , such as an improved semantic-search for resources , not explicitly published on the web , but available in a p2p-system . we develop the ontology-based peer-profile in rdf format and demonstrate its manifold benefits for peer communication and knowledge-discovery in both p2p-networks and semantic-web .
