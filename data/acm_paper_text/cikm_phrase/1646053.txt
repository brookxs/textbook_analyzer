user-induced links in collaborative-tagging-systems collaborative-tagging-systems allow users to use tags to describe their favourite online-documents . two documents that are maintained in the collection of the same user and/or assigned similar sets of tags can be considered as related from the perspective of the user , even though they may not be connected by hyperlinks . we call this kind of implicit relations user-induced links between documents . we consider two methods of identifying user-induced links in collaborative-tagging , and compare these links with existing hyperlinks on the web . our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link-structure of the-web . we also propose to use these links as a basis for predicting how documents would be tagged . our experiments show that they achieve much higher accuracy than existing hyperlinks . this study suggests that by studying the collective-behaviour of users we are able to enhance navigation and organisation of web-documents .
