advertiser-centric approach to understand user click-behavior in sponsored-search sponsored-search is the major business-model of commercial search engines . the number of clicks on ads is a key indicator of success for both advertisers and search-engines , and increasing ad clicks is a goal of both of them . many existing works stand on the view of search-engines concerning how to help-search engines to earn more revenue by accurately predicting ad clicks . unlike the existing works , this paper aims at understanding user-clicks on ads from `` the view of advertisers '' , in order to help advertisers to improve their ad quality and therefore advertising-effectiveness . to do this , a factor-graph model is proposed , which considers two advertiser-controllable factors to understand user click behaviors : the relevance between a query and an ad , which has been well studied in previous literatures , and the `` attractiveness '' of the ad , which is a newly-proposed concept . the proposed model can be used to predict user-clicks and also to mine a set of attractive words that could be leveraged to improve the quality of the ads . we have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world datasets , through quantitative evaluations and informative case-studies .
