efficient safe-region construction for moving top-k spatial-keyword-queries many real-world-applications have requirements to support moving spatial-keyword-queries . for example a tourist looks for top-k `` seafood restaurants '' while walking in a city . she will continuously issue moving queries . however existing spatial keyword search-methods focus on static queries and it calls for new effective techniques to support moving queries efficiently . in this paper we propose an effective method to support moving top-k spatial-keyword-queries . in addition to finding top-k-answers of a moving query , we also calculate a safe region such that if a new query with a location falling in the safe region , we can directly use the answer set to answer the query . to this end , we propose an effective model to represent the safe region and devise efficient search algorithms to compute the safe region . we have implemented our method and experimental-results on real datasets show that our method achieves high efficiency and outperforms existing methods significantly .
