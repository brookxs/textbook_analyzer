semantic-verification in an online fact seeking environment many artificial-intelligence tasks , such as automated-question-answering , reasoning or heterogeneous database integration , involve verification of a semantic-category (e.g. `` coffee '' is a drink , `` red '' is a color , while `` steak '' is not a drink and `` big '' is not a color) . we present a novel algorithm to automatically validate a semantic-category . contrary to the methods suggested earlier , our approach does not rely on any manually codified knowledge but instead capitalizes on the diversity of topics and word-usage on the world-wide-web . we have tested our approach within our online fact-seeking (question-answering) environment . when tested on the trec questions that expect the answer to belong to a specific semantic-category , our approach has improved the accuracy by up to 14 \ % depending on the model and metrics used .
