an automated approach for retrieving hierarchical-data from html tables among the html elements , html tables [rhj98] encapsulate hierarchically structured-data (hierarchical-data in short) in a tabular structure . html tables do not come with a rigid schema and almost any forms of two-dimensional tables are acceptable according to the html grammar . this relaxation complicates the process of retrieving hierarchical-data from html tables . in this paper , we propose an automated approach for retrieving hierarchical-data from html tables . the proposed approach constructs the content tree of an html table , which captures the intended hierarchy of the data content of the table , without requiring the internal-structure of the table to be known beforehand . also , the user of the content tree does not deal with html tags while retrieving the desired data from the content tree . our approach can be employed by (i) a query-language written for retrieving hierarchically structured-data , extracted from either the contents of html tables or other sources , (ii) a processor for converting html tables to xml-documents , and (iii) a data-warehousing repository for collecting hierarchical-data from html tables and storing materialized-views of the tables . the time-complexity of the proposed retrieval approach is proportional to the number of html elements in an html table .
