unsupervised question-answering data-acquisition from local corpora data-driven-approaches in question-answering (qa) are increasingly common . since availability of training-data for such approaches is very limited , we propose an unsupervised-algorithm that generates high quality question-answer pairs from local corpora . the algorithm is ontology independent , requiring very small seed data as its starting point . two alternating views of the data make learning possible : 1) question-types are viewed as relations between entities and 2) question-types are described by their corresponding question-answer pairs . these two aspects of the data allow us to construct an unsupervised-algorithm that acquires high precision question-answer pairs . we show the quality of the acquired data for different question-types and perform a task-based-evaluation . with each iteration , pairs acquired by the unsupervised-algorithm are used as training-data to a simple qa-system . performance increases with the number of question-answer pairs acquired confirming the robustness of the unsupervised-algorithm . we introduce the notion of <i> semantic-drift </i> and show that it is a desirable quality in training-data for question-answering-systems .
