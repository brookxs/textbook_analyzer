multi-dimensional sequential-pattern-mining sequential-pattern-mining , which finds the set of frequent subsequences in sequence-databases , is an important data-mining task and has broad applications . usually , sequence patterns are associated with different circumstances , and such circumstances form a multiple dimensional space . for example , customer purchase sequences are associated with region , time , customer group , and others . it is interesting and useful to mine sequential-patterns associated with multi-dimensional information.in this paper , we propose the theme of multi-dimensional sequential-pattern-mining , which integrates the multidimensional-analysis and sequential-data mining . we also thoroughly explore efficient methods for multi-dimensional sequential-pattern-mining . we examine feasible combinations of efficient sequential-pattern-mining and multi-dimensional analysis-methods , as well as develop uniform methods for high-performance mining . extensive experiments show the advantages as well as limitations of these methods . some recommendations on selecting proper method with respect to data-set properties are drawn .
