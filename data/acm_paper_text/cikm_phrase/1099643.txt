scalable ranking for preference-queries top - k preference-queries with multiple attributes are critical for decision-making applications . previous research has concentrated on improving the computational-efficiency mainly by using novel index-structures and search-strategies . since current applications need to scale to terabytes of data and thousands of users , performance of such systems is strongly impacted by the amount of available memory . this paper proposes a scalable approach for memory-bounded top - k query-processing .
