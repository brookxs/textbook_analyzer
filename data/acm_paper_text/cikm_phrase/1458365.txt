clustering multi-way-data via adaptive subspace iteration clustering multi-way-data is a very important research-topic due to the intrinsic rich structures in real-world datasets . in this paper , we propose the subspace-clustering algorithm on multi-way-data , called asi-t (adaptive subspace iteration on tensor) . asi-t is a special version of high order svd (hosvd) , and it simultaneously performs subspace identification using 2dsvd and data-clustering using k-means . the experimental-results on synthetic-data and real-world-data demonstrate the effectiveness of asi-t .
