order-checking in a cpoe using event analyzer in this paper we present our experience in applying event analyzer , a processing engine we have developed to extract patterns from a sequence of events , in the checking of medical-orders of a cpoe system . we present some extensions we have implemented in event analyzer in order to fulfill the needs of those orders checking , as well as some performance-evaluation results . we also outline some problems we are facing now to adapt event analyzer 's pattern-detection engine to support streaming orders in an on-line cpoe checking system .
