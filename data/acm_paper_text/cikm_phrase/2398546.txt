learning-from-mistakes : towards a correctable learning-algorithm many learning-algorithms generate complex-models that are difficult for a human to interpret , debug , and extend . in this paper , we address this challenge by proposing a new learning-paradigm called correctable learning , where the learning-algorithm receives external feedback about which data-examples are incorrectly learned . we define a set of metrics which measure the correctability of a learning-algorithm . we then propose a simple and efficient correctable learning-algorithm which learns local-models for different regions of the data-space . given an incorrect example , our method samples data in the neighborhood of that example and learns a new , more correct local model over that region . experiments over multiple-classification and ranking datasets show that our correctable learning-algorithm offers significant improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques .
