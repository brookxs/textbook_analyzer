efficient-query-evaluation using a two-level retrieval-process we present an efficient-query-evaluation method based on a two level approach : at the first level , our method iterates in parallel over query-term postings and identifies candidate documents using an approximate evaluation taking into account only partial-information on term occurrences and no query independent factors ; at the second level , promising candidates are fully evaluated and their exact scores are computed . the efficiency of the evaluation-process can be improved significantly using dynamic-pruning techniques with very little cost in effectiveness . the amount of pruning can be controlled by the user as a function of time allocated for query-evaluation . experimentally , using the trec web track data , we have determined that our algorithm significantly reduces the total number of full evaluations by more than 90 \ % , almost without any loss in precision or recall . at the heart of our approach there is an efficient-implementation of a new boolean construct called wand or weak and that might be of independent interest .
