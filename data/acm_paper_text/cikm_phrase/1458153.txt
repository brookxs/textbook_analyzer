some rewrite optimizations of db2 xquery navigation ibm db2 9 is a truly hybrid commercial database system that combines xml and relational data . it provides native support for xml-storage and indexing , and query-evaluation support for xquery . by building a hybrid-system , the designers of db2 9 were able to use the existing sql-query evaluation and optimization-techniques to develop similar methods for xquery . however , sql and xquery are sufficiently different that new optimization-techniques can and are being developed in the new xquery domain . this paper describes a few such techniques , all based on static rewrites of xquery expressions .
