extending dictionary-based entity-extraction to tolerate errors entity-extraction (also known as entity-recognition) extracts entities (e.g. , person-names , locations , companies) from text . approximate (dictionary-based) entity-extraction is a recent trend to improve extraction quality , which extracts substrings in text that approximately match predefined entities in a given dictionary . in this paper , we study the problem of approximate-entity-extraction with edit-distance constraints . a straightforward method first extracts all substrings from the text and then for each substring identifies its similar entities from the dictionary using existing methods for approximate-string-search . however many substrings of the text have overlaps , and we have an opportunity to utilize the shared-computation across the overlaps to avoid unnecessary duplicate computations . to this end , we propose a heap-based framework to efficiently extract entities . we have implemented our techniques , and the experimental-results show that our method achieves high-performance and outperforms existing studies significantly .
