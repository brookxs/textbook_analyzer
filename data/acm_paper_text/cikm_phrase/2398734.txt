mixed-initiative conversational-system using question-answer pairs mined from the-web one of the biggest bottlenecks for conversational-systems is large-scale provision of suitable content . our approach readily provides this without the need for custom-crafting . in this demonstration , we present the use of question-answer (qa) pairs mined from online question-and-answer websites to construct system utterances for a conversational-agent . our system uses qa-pairs to formulate utterances that drive a conversation in addition to the answering of user questions as has been done in previous work . we use a collection of strategies that specify how and when the different parts of our question-answer pairs can be used and augmented with a small number of generic hand-crafted text-snippets to generate natural and coherent system utterances .
