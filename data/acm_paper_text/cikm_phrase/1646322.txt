refmed : relevance-feedback retrieval-system fo pubmed finding related articles from the pubmed (a large biomedical-literature repository) is challenging because it is hard to express the user 's specific relevance in the given query-interface and a keyword-query typically retrieves many results . biomedical-researchers spend a critical amount of time (e.g. , often more than several days) in the literature-search process . this paper proposes refmed , a novel search-system for pubmed , which supports relevance-ranking by enabling relevance-feedback on pubmed . refmed first returns initial result documents for a user 's keyword-query as in pubmed . the user then makes relevance-judgments on some of the resultant documents while browsing them . once the user `` pushes the feedback '' , the system induces a relevance function using ranksvm and ranks the results according to the function . to realize the ad-hoc relevance retrieval on pubmed , refmed `` tightly '' integrates ranksvm within rdbms and runs the rank learning and process on-the-fly with a response-time of a few minutes.our qualitative experiments with biomedical-researchers show that refmed substantially reduces the amount of effort required to search related pubmed articles . refmed is accessible at `` http://dm.postech.ac.kr/refmed '' .
