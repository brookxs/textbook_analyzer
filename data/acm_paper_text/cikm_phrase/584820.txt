efficient synchronization for mobile xml-data many handheld applications receive data from a primary database-server and operate in an intermittently connected environment these days . they maintain data-consistency with data sources through sychronization . in certain applications such as sales force automation , it is highly desirable if updates on the data source can be reflected at the handheld applications immediately . this paper proposes an efficient method to synchronize xml-data on multiple mobile-devices . each device retrieves and caches a local copy of data from the database source based on a regular path expression . these local copies may be overlapping or disjoint with each other . an efficient mechanism is proposed to find all the disjoint copies to avoid unnecessary synchronizations . each update to the data source will then be checked to identify all handheld applications which are affected by the update . communication-costs can be further reduced by eliminating the forwarding of unnecessary operations to groups of mobile-clients .
