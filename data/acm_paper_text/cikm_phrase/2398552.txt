location-sensitive resources recommendation in social-tagging systems in social-tagging systems , resources such as images and videos are annotated with descriptive words called tags . it has been shown that tag-based resource searching and retrieval is much more effective than content-based-retrieval . with the advances in mobile-technology , many resources are also geo-tagged with location-information . we observe that a traditional tag (word) can carry different semantics at different locations . we study how location-information can be used to help distinguish the different semantics of a resource 's tags and thus to improve retrieval-accuracy . given a search-query , we propose a location-partitioning method that partitions all locations into regions such that the user-query carries distinguishing semantics in each region . based on the identified regions , we utilize location-information in estimating the ranking scores of resources for the given query . these ranking scores are learned using the bayesian personalized-ranking (bpr) framework . two algorithms , namely , ltd and lpitf , which apply tucker-decomposition and pairwise interaction tensor-factorization , respectively for modeling the ranking score tensor are proposed . through experiments on real datasets , we show that ltd and lpitf outperform other tag-based resource retrieval-methods .
