mining inter-transaction associations with templates multi-dimensional , inter-transaction association-rules extend the traditional association-rules to describe more general associations among items with multiple properties cross transactions . after mcdonald and burger king open branches , kfc will open a branch two months later and one mile away is an example of such rules . since the number of potential inter-transaction association-rules tends to be extremely large , mining inter-transaction associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than mining intra-transaction associations . in order to make such association-mining truly practical and computationally tractable , in this study , we present a template model to help users declare the interesting inter-transaction associations to be mined . with the guidance of templates , several optimization-techniques are devised to speed up the discovery of inter-transaction association-rules . we show , through a series of experiments , that these optimization-techniques can yield significant performance benefits .
