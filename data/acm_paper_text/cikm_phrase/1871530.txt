facetor : cost-driven exploration of faceted query results faceted-navigation is being increasingly employed as an effective technique for exploring large query results on structured databases . this technique of mitigating information-overload leverages metadata of the query results to provide users with facet conditions that can be used to progressively refine the user 's query and filter the query results . however , the number of facet conditions can be quite large , thereby increasing the burden on the user . we present the facetor system that proposes a cost-based approach to faceted-navigation . at each step of the navigation , the user is presented with a subset of all possible facet conditions that are selected such that the overall expected navigation-cost is minimized and every result is guaranteed to be reachable by a facet condition . we prove that the problem of selecting the optimal facet conditions at each navigation step is np-hard , and subsequently present two intuitive heuristics employed by facetor . our user-study at amazon-mechanical-turk shows that facetor reduces the user-navigation time compared to the cutting edge commercial and academic faceted-search algorithms . the user-study also confirms the validity of our cost-model . we also present the results of an extensive experimental-evaluation on the performance of the proposed approach using two real datasets . facetor is available at http://db.cse.buffalo.edu/facetor/ .
