customizing search-results for non-native-speakers blog posts , news-articles and other webpages are present on the web in multiple languages . standard search-engines evaluate the relevance of the candidate documents to the given query . however , when considering documents with overlapping content , many of them written in a foreign-language other than the user 's own native tongue , it is beneficial to promote documents that are easy enough for the user to read . here , we show how to rank a collection of foreign documents based on both : a) relevance to the query , and b) the comprehension difficulty of the document . we design effective ranking operators that evaluate the difficulty of a foreign document with respect to the user 's native-language . we show that existing search-engines can easily augment their scoring-function by incorporating the proposed comprehensibility metrics . finally , we provide extensive experimental-evidence that the comprehensibility-aware ranking-model significantly improves the standard relevance-based ranking paradigm .
