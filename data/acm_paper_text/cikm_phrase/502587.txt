efficient processing of conical queries conical queries are a novel type of query with an increasing number of applications . traditional index-structures and retrieval mechanisms , in general , have been optimized for rectangular and circular queries , rather than conical queries . in this paper , we focus on conical queries which can be defined as a multi-dimensional cone in a multi-dimensional-data space . we develop a model for expressing such queries and suggest efficient techniques for evaluating them . in particular , we explore the retrieval problem in the context of conical query-processing and develop multi-disk allocation methods specifically for processing conical queries .
