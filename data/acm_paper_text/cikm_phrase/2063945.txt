utility-driven anonymization in data-publishing privacy-preserving data publication has been studied intensely in the past years . still , all existing approaches transform data-values by random-perturbation or generalization . in this paper , we introduce a radically different data-anonymization methodology . our proposal aims to maintain a certain amount of patterns , defined in terms of a set of properties of interest that hold for the original data . such properties are represented as linear-relationships among data points . we present an algorithm that generates a set of anonymized data that strictly preserves these properties , thus maintaining specified patterns in the data . extensive experiments with real and synthetic-data show that our algorithm is efficient , and produces anonymized data that affords high utility in several data-analysis tasks while safeguarding privacy .
