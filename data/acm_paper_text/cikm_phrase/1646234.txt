blogger-centric contextual-advertising this paper addresses the concept of blogger-centric contextual-advertising , which refers to the assignment of personal ads to any blog page , chosen in according to bloggers ' interests . as blogs become a platform for expressing personal opinions , they naturally contain various kinds of statements , including facts , comments and statements about personal interests , of both a positive and negative nature . to extend the concept behind the-long-tail theory in contextual-advertising , we argue that web bloggers , as the constant visitors of their own blog sites , could be potential consumers who will respond to ads on their own blogs . hence , in this paper , we propose using text-mining techniques to discover bloggers ' immediate personal interests in order to improve online contextual-advertising . the proposed bcca (b logger - c entric c ontextual a dvertising) framework aims to combine contextual-advertising matching with text-mining in order to select ads that are related to personal interests as revealed in a blog and rank them according to their relevance . we validate our approach experimentally using a set of data that includes both real ads and actual blog pages . the results indicate that our proposed method could effectively identify those ads that are positively-correlated with a blogger 's personal interests .
