implementation-techniques for large-scale latent-semantic-indexing applications the technique of latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) has wide applicability in information-retrieval and data-mining tasks . to date , however , most applications of lsi have addressed relatively small collections of data . this has been due partly to hardware and software limitations and partly to overly pessimistic estimates of the processing requirements of the singular-value-decomposition (svd) process . in recent years , advances in hardware capabilities and software-implementations have enabled much larger lsi applications . moreover , experience with large lsi indexes has shown that the svd is not the limitation on scalability that it was long thought to be . this paper describes techniques applicable to creating large-scale (multi-million document) lsi indexes . detailed data regarding the lsi index creation process is presented for collections of up to 100 million documents . four key factors are shown to contribute to the scalability of lsi . first , in most situations , the time required for calculation of the singular-value-decomposition (svd) of the term-document-matrix is not the dominant factor determining the overall time required to build an lsi index . second , the time required to calculate the svd in lsi is linear in the number of objects indexed . third , incremental index creation greatly facilitates use of lsi in dynamic-environments . fourth , distributed-query-processing can be employed to support large numbers of users . it is shown that lsi is well-suited for implementation in modern distributed-computing environments . this paper provides the first measurements of the execution-time for large-scale lsi build processes in a cloud environment .
