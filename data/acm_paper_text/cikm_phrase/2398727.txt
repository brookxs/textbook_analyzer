incatomi : integrative causal topic miner between textual and non-textual time-series-data topic-modeling is popular for text-mining tasks . recently , topic-modeling has been combined with time lines when textual data is related to external non-textual time-series-data such as stock prices . however , no previous work has used the external non-textual time-series-data in the process of topic-modeling . in this paper , we describe a novel text-mining-system , integrative causal topic miner (incatomi) that integrates textual and non-textual time-series-data . incatomi automatically finds causal-relationships and topics using text-data and external non-textual time-series-data using granger testing . moreover , incatomi considers the non-textual time-series-data in the topic-modeling process , using the time-series-data to iteratively improve modeling results through interactions between it and the textual data at both topic and word levels .
