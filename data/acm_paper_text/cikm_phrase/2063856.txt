an efficient method for using machine-translation technologies in cross-language patent-search topics in prior-art patent-search are typically full patent applications and relevant items are patents often taken from sources in different languages . cross-language patent-retrieval (clpr) technologies support searching for relevant patents across multiple languages . as such , clpr requires a translation-process between topic and document languages . the most popular method for crossing the language-barrier in cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) in general is machine-translation (mt) . high quality mt-systems are becoming widely available for many language-pairs and generally have higher effectiveness for clir than dictionary_based methods . however for patent-search , using mt for translation of the very long search queries requires significant time and computational-resources . we present a novel mt approach specifically designed for clir in general and clpr in particular . in this method information-retrieval (ir) text-pre-processing in the form of stop word removal and stemming are applied to the mt training-corpus prior to the training-phase of the mt-system . applying this step leads to a significant decrease in the mt computational and resource-requirements in both the training and translation phases . experiments on the clef-ip 2010 clpr task show the new technique to be 5 to 23 times faster than standard mt for query-translation , while maintaining statistically indistinguishable ir effectiveness . furthermore the new method is significantly better than standard mt when only limited translation-training resources are available .
