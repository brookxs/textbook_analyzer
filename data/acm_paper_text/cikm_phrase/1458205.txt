sorec : social-recommendation using probabilistic-matrix-factorization data-sparsity , scalability and prediction-quality have been recognized as the three most crucial challenges that every collaborative-filtering algorithm or recommender-system confronts . many existing approaches to recommender-systems can neither handle very-large datasets nor easily deal with users who have made very few ratings or even none at all . moreover , traditional recommender-systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed ; this assumption ignores the social-interactions or connections among users . in view of the exponential growth of information generated by online-social-networks , social-network-analysis is becoming important for many web-applications . following the intuition that a person 's social-network will affect personal behaviors on the web , this paper proposes a factor-analysis approach based on probabilistic-matrix-factorization to solve the data-sparsity and poor prediction-accuracy problems by employing both users ' social-network information and rating records . the complexity-analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very-large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations , while the experimental-results shows that our method performs much better than the state-of-the-art approaches , especially in the circumstance that users have made few or no ratings .
