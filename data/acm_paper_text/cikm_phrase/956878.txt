efficient region-based-image-retrieval region-based-image-retrieval (rbir) was recently proposed as an extension of content-based-image-retrieval (cbir) . an rbir system automatically segments images into a variable number of regions , and extracts for each region a set-of-features . then , a dissimilarity function determines the distance between a database image and a set of reference regions . unfortunately , the large evaluation costs of the dissimilarity function are restricting rbir to relatively small databases . in this paper , we apply a multi-step approach to enable region-based techniques for large image collections . we provide cheap lower and upper bounding distance-functions for a recently proposed dissimilarity-measure . as our experiments show , these bounding functions are so tight , that we have to evaluate the expensive distance-function for less than 0.5 \ \ % of the images . for a typical image-database with more than 370,000 images , our multi-step approach improved retrieval-performance by a factor of more than5 compared to the currently fastest methods .
