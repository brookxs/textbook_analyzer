incremental encoding of multiple-inheritance hierarchies incremental-updates to multiple-inheritance hierarchies are becoming more prevalent with the increasing number of persistent applications supporting complex-objects , making the efficient-computation of lattice operations such as greatest lower-bound (glb) , least upper-bound (lub) , and subsumption more and more important . general techniques for the compact encoding of a hierarchy are presented . one such method is to plunge the given ordering into a boolean-lattice of binary words , leading to an almost constant-time complexity of the lattice operations . the method is based on an inverted version of the encoding of ait-kaci et al. to allow incremental-update . simple grouping is used to reduce the code space while keeping the lattice operations efficient . comparisons are made to an incremental version of the range-compression scheme of agrawal et al. , where each class is assigned an interval , and relationships are based on containment in the interval . the result is two encoding methods which have their relative merits . the former being better for smaller , more structured hierarchies , and the latter for larger , less organized hierarchies .
