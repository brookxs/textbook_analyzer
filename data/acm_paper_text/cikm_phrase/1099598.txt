processing xpath-queries with xml summaries range labeling and structural-joins are well-studied techniques for efficiently processing xpath-queries . however , when xpath-queries become long , many times of structural-joins are required . to solve this problem , we developed a method to reduce the number of joins and nodes read from the disk using strong dataguides . our method can process single paths without any joins and twig patterns with joins amongst branching nodes and leaves in queries . experimental-results verified that our approach outperforms the best optimization-technique for structural-joins by factors of up to several hundreds of times .
