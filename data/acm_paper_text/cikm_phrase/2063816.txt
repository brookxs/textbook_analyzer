provenance-based refresh in data-oriented workflows we consider a general workflow setting in which input data sets are processed by a graph of transformations to produce output results . our goal is to perform efficient selective refresh of elements in the output data , i.e. , compute the latest values of specific output elements when the input data may have changed . we explore how data-provenance can be used to enable efficient refresh . our approach is based on capturing one-level data-provenance at each transformation when the workflow is run initially . then at refresh time provenance is used to determine (transitively) which input elements are responsible for given output elements , and the workflow is rerun only on that portion of the data needed for refresh . our contributions are to formalize the problem setting and the problem itself , to specify properties of transformations and provenance that are required for efficient refresh , and to provide algorithms that apply to a wide class of transformations and workflows . we have built a prototype-system supporting the features and algorithms presented in the paper . we report preliminary experimental-results on the overhead of provenance capture , and on the crossover-point between selective refresh and full workflow recomputation .
