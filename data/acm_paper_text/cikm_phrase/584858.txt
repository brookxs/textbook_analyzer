an efficient and effective algorithm for density biased-sampling in this paper we describe a new density-biased sampling algorithm . it exploits spatial-indexes and the local density information they preserve , to provide improved quality of sampling result and fast access to elements of the dataset . it attains improved sampling quality , with respect to factors like skew , noise or dimensionality . moreover , it has the advantage of efficiently handling dynamic-updates , and it requires low execution times . the performance of the proposed method is examined experimentally . the comparative results illustrate its superiority over existing methods .
