a general-markov-framework for page-importance computation we propose a general-markov-framework for computing page-importance . under the framework , a markov skeleton process is used to model the random-walk conducted by the-web surfer on a given graph . page-importance is then defined as the product of page reachability and page utility , which can be computed from the transition-probability and the mean staying time of the pages in the markov skeleton process respectively . we show that this general-framework can cover many existing algorithms as its special cases , and that the framework can help us define new algorithms to handle more complex-problems . in particular , we demonstrate the use of the framework with the exploitation of a new process named mirror-semi-markov-process . the experimental-results validate that the mirror-semi-markov-process model is more effective than previous models in several tasks .
