h-db : a hybrid quantitative-structural sql optimizer structural-decomposition-methods are query-optimization methods specifically conceived in the database-theory community to efficiently answer (near -) acyclic queries . we propose to demonstrate h-db , an sql-query optimizer that combines classical quantitative optimization-techniques with such structural-decomposition-methods , which so far have been just analyzed from the theoretical viewpoint . the system provides support to optimizing sql queries with arbitrary output variables , aggregate operators , order by statements , and nested-queries . h-db can be put on top of any existing database-management-system supporting jdbc technology , by transparently interacting/replacing its standard query-optimization module . however , to push at maximum its optimization capabilities , h-db should be coupled with an ad-hoc physical semi-join operator , which (as a relevant example) we implemented and integrated within the postgresql database-management-system .
