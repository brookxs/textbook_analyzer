towards feature-selection in network traditional feature-selection methods assume that the data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) . however , in real-world , there are tremendous amount of data which are distributing in a network . existing features-selection methods are not suited for networked-data because the i.i.d. assumption no longer holds . this motivates us to study feature-selection in a network . in this paper , we present a supervised feature-selection-method based on laplacian-regularized-least-squares (laprls) for networked-data . in detail , we use linear-regression to utilize the content information , and adopt graph-regularization to consider the link-information . the proposed feature-selection-method aims at selecting a subset of features such that the empirical error of laprls is minimized . the resultant optimization-problem is a mixed integer-programming , which is difficult to solve . it is relaxed into a $ l _ {2,1} $ - norm constrained laprls problem and solved by accelerated proximal gradient-descent-algorithm . experiments on benchmark networked-data sets show that the proposed feature-selection-method outperforms traditional feature-selection-method and the-state-of-the-art learning in network approaches .
