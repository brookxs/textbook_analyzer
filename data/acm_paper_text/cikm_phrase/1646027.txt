graph-classification based on pattern-co-occurrence subgraph patterns are widely used in graph-classification , but their effectiveness is often hampered by large number of patterns or lack of discrimination-power among individual patterns . we introduce a novel classification-method based on pattern-co-occurrence to derive graph-classification rules . our method employs a pattern-exploration order such that the complementary discriminative patterns are examined first . patterns are grouped into co-occurrence rules during the pattern-exploration , leading to an integrated process of pattern-mining and classifier-learning . by taking advantage of co-occurrence-information , our method can generate strong features by assembling weak features . unlike previous methods that invoke the pattern-mining process repeatedly , our method only performs pattern-mining once . in addition , our method produces a more interpretable classifier and shows better or competitive classification effectiveness in terms of accuracy and execution-time .
