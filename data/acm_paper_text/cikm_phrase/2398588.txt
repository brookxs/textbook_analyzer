clustering wikipedia infoboxes to discover their types wikipedia has emerged as an important source of structured-information on the web . but while the success of wikipedia can be attributed in part to the simplicity of adding and modifying content , this has also created challenges when it comes to using , querying , and integrating the information . even though authors are encouraged to select appropriate categories and provide infoboxes that follow pre-defined templates , many do not follow the guidelines or follow them loosely . this leads to undesirable effects , such as template duplication , heterogeneity , and schema drift . as a step towards addressing this problem , we propose a new unsupervised-approach for clustering wikipedia infoboxes . instead of relying on manually assigned categories and template labels , we use the structured-information available in infoboxes to group them and infer their entity-types . experiments using over 48,000 infoboxes indicate that our clustering approach is effective and produces high quality clusters .
