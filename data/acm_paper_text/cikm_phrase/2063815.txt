supporting queries spanning across phases of evolving artifacts using steiner forests the problem of managing evolving data has attracted considerable research attention . researchers have focused on the modeling and querying of schema/instance-level structural changes , such as , addition , deletion and modification of attributes . databases with such a functionality are known as temporal-databases . a limitation of the temporal-databases is that they treat changes as independent events , while often the appearance (or elimination) of some structure in the database is the result of an evolution of some existing structure . we claim that maintaining the causal-relationship between the two structures is of major importance since it allows additional reasoning to be performed and answers to be generated for queries that previously had no answers . we present here a novel framework for exploiting the evolution relationships between the structures in the database . in particular , our system combines different structures that are associated through evolution relationships into virtual-structures to be used during query-answering . the virtual-structures define `` possible '' database instances , in a fashion similar to the possible worlds in the probabilistic-databases . the framework includes a query-answering mechanism that allows queries to be answered over these possible databases without materializing them . evaluation of such queries raises many interesting technical challenges , since it requires the discovery of steiner forests on the evolution graphs . on this problem we have designed and implemented a new dynamic-programming-algorithm with exponential-complexity in the size of the input query and polynomial complexity in terms of both the attribute and the evolution data sizes .
