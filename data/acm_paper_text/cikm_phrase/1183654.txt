a fast and robust method for web-page template-detection and removal the widespread use of templates on the web is considered harmful for two main reasons . not only do they compromise the relevance-judgment of many web-ir and web-mining methods such as clustering-and-classification , but they also negatively impact the performance and resource-usage of tools that process web-pages . in this paper we present a new method that efficiently and accurately removes templates found in collections of web-pages . our method works in two steps . first , the costly process of template-detection is performed over a small set of sample pages . then , the derived template is removed from the remaining pages in the collection . this leads to substantial performance gains when compared to previous approaches that combine template-detection and removal . we show , through an experimental-evaluation , that our approach is effective for identifying terms occurring in templates - obtaining f-measure values around 0.9 , and that it also boosts the accuracy of web-page-clustering and classification-methods .
