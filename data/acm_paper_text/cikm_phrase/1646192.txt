exploiting term-relationship to boost text-classification document-classification provides an effective way to handle the explosive online textual data . however , in practical classification settings , we face the so-called feature sparsity-problem caused by a lack of training-documents or the shortness of text to be classified . in this paper , we solve the sparsity-problem by exploiting term-relationships along with naive-bayes-classifiers . the first method is to estimate term-relationships based on the co-occurrence-information of two terms in a certain context . the second method estimates the term-relationships based on the distribution of terms over different hierarchical categories in a publicly available document taxonomy . thereafter , term-relationship is used to augment naive-bayes-classifiers . we test our methods on two open-domain data-sets to demonstrate its advantages . the experimental-results show that our method can significantly improve the classification-performance , especially when we do not have enough training-data or the texts are web-search-queries .
