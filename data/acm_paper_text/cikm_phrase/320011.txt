semql : a semantic-query-language for multidatabase-systems an essential prerequisite to achieving interoperability in multidatabase-systems is to be able to identify semantically equivalent or related data items in component-databases . another problem in multidatabase-systems is allowing users to handle information from different databases that refer to the same realworld entity . in this paper , we provide semantic-networks so that multidatabase-systems can detect and resolve semantic heterogeneities among component-databases . and we provide a semantic-query-language , semql , to capture the concepts about what users want . it enables users to issue queries to a large number of autonomous databases without prior-knowledge of their schemas .
