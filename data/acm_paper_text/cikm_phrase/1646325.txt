mrm : an adaptive-framework for xml searching in order to deal with the diversified nature of xml-documents as well as individual user-preferences , we propose a novel multi-ranker model (mrm) , which is able to abstract a spectrum of important xml properties and adapt the features to different xml-search needs . the model consists of a novel three-level ranking structure and a training module called ranking support-vector-machine in a voting spy na 1ve bayes framework (rssf) . rssf is effective in learning search preference and then ranks the returned results adaptively . in this demonstration , we present our prototype developed from the model , which we call it the mrm xml-search-engine . the mrm engine employs only a list of simple xml tagged keywords as a user-query for searching xml-fragments from a collection of real xml-documents . the demonstration presents an indepth analyses of the effectiveness of adaptive rankers , tailored xml rankers and a spectrum of low level ranking-features .
