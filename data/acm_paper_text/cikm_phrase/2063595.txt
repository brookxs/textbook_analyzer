relevance-weighting using within-document term statistics with the rapid-development of the information-technology , there exists the difficulty in deploying state-of-the-art retrieval-models in environments such as peer-to-peer-networks and pervasive-computing , where it is expensive or even infeasible to maintain the global statistics . to this end , this paper presents an investigation in the validity of different statistical assumptions of term distributions . based on the findings in this investigation , a variety of weighting models , called ng (standing for `` no global statistics '') models , are derived from the divergence-from-randomness framework , in which only the within-document-statistics are used in the relevance-weighting . compared to the state-of-the-art weighting models in extensive experiments on various standard trec test-collections , our proposed ng models can provide acceptable retrieval-performance in ad-hoc search , without the use of global statistics .
