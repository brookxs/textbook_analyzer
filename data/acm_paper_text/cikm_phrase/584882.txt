i/o-efficient techniques for computing pagerank over the last few years , most major search-engines have integrated link-based-ranking techniques in order to provide more accurate search-results . one widely known approach is the pagerank technique , which forms the basis of the google ranking-scheme , and which assigns a global importance measure to each page based on the importance of other pages pointing to it . the main advantage of the pagerank measure is that it is independent of the query posed by a user ; this means that it can be precomputed and then used to optimize the layout of the inverted-index structure accordingly . however , computing the pagerank measure requires implementing an iterative-process on a massive graph corresponding to billions of web-pages and hyperlinks.in this paper , we study i/o-efficient techniques to perform this iterative-computation . we derive two algorithms for pagerank based on techniques proposed for out-of-core graph-algorithms , and compare them to two existing algorithms proposed by haveliwala . we also consider the implementation of a recently proposed topic-sensitive version of pagerank . our experimental-results show that for very-large-data-sets , significant improvements over previous results can be achieved on machines with moderate amounts of memory . on the other hand , at most minor improvements are possible on data-sets that are only moderately larger than memory , which is the case in many practical scenarios .
