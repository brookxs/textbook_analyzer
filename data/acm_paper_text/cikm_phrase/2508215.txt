readfast : high-relevance search-engine for big text-relevance of search-results is a key factor for any search-engine . in order to return and rank the web-pages that are most relevant to the query , contemporary search-engines use complex ranking-functions that depend on hundreds of features . for example , presence or absence of the query keywords on the page , their proximity , frequencies , html markup are just a few to name . additional features might include fonts , tags , hyperlinks , metadata , and parts of the web-page description . all this information is used by the search-engine to rank html web-pages returned to the user , but is unfortunately absent in free-text that has no html markup , tags , hyperlinks , and any other metadata , except implicit natural-language structure . here we demonstrate one of the first big text-search engines that leverages hidden structure of the natural-language-sentences in order to process user queries and return more relevant search-results than a standard keyword-search . it provides a structured index extracted from the text using natural-language-processing (nlp) that can be used to browse and query free-text .
