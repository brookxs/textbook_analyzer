probabilistic-ranking in fuzzy object-databases ranking-queries have been investigated extensively in the past due to their broad range of applications . in this paper , we study this problem in the context of fuzzy objects that have indeterministic boundaries . fuzzy objects play an important role in many areas , such as biomedical image databases and gis . to the best of our knowledge , we present the first efficient approach for similarity ranking in fuzzy object-databases . the main challenge of ranking fuzzy objects is that these objects consist of multiple instances , each associated with a probability . we propose a framework to transform fuzzy objects into probabilistic objects which can then be ranked using existing algorithms for probabilistic objects .
