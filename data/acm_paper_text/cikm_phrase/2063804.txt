multiple keyword-based-queries over xml-streams in this paper , we propose that various keyword-based-queries be processed over xml-streams in a multi-query processing way . our algorithms rely on parsing stacks designed for simultaneously matching terms from several distinct queries and use new query indexes to speed up search operations when processing a large number of queries . besides defining a new problem and novel solutions , we perform experiments in which aspects related to performance-and-scalability are examined .
