speed up semantic-search in p2p-networks peer-to-peer-architectures become popular in modern massively distributed systems , which are often in very-large scale and contain a huge volume of heterogeneous-data . to facilitate the information-retrieval process in p2p-networks , we consider semantic-search approach , where syntax-based queries are shipped to peers based on semantic correlations . motivated by an interesting experience in web-information-retrieval , we propose a novel ontology-based scheme to measure similarity of peer interests accurately and consistently in a decentralized way , and group peers under a scalable hierarchical-overlay network . given queries , our approach either floods them within local peer-groups or guides them towards remote groups based on the similarity of interests . our work overcomes the limitations of the existing p2p hybrid-search approaches by avoiding costly data popularity measurement . performance-evaluation and comparison against baseline algorithms show that our approach provides a better solution for information-retrieval in large-scale p2p-networks .
