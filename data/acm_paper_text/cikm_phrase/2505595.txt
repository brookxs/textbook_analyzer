discovering latent blockmodels in sparse and noisy graphs using non-negative-matrix-factorisation blockmodelling is an important technique in social-network-analysis for discovering the latent structure in graphs . a blockmodel partitions the set of vertices in a graph into groups , where there are either many edges or few edges between any two groups . for example , in the reply graph of a question-and-answer forum , blockmodelling can identify the group of experts by their many replies to questioners , and the group of questioners by their lack of replies among themselves but many replies from experts . non-negative-matrix-factorisation has been successfully applied to many problems , including blockmodelling . however , these existing approaches can fail to discover the true latent structure when the graphs have strong background-noise or are sparse , which is typical of most real graphs . in this paper , we propose a new non-negative-matrix-factorisation approach that can discover blockmodels in sparse and noisy graphs . we use synthetic and real datasets to show that our approaches have much higher accuracy and comparable running times .
