understanding the relationship between searchers ' queries and information goals we describe results from web-search log studies aimed at elucidating user-behaviors associated with queries and destination urls that appear with different frequencies . we note the diversity-of-information goals that searchers have and the differing ways that goals are specified . we examine rare and common information goals that are specified using rare or common queries . we identify several significant differences in user-behavior depending on the rarity of the query and the destination url . we find that searchers are more likely to be successful when the frequencies of the query and destination url are similar . we also establish that the behavioral differences observed for queries and goals of varying rarity persist even after accounting for potential confounding variables , including query-length , search-engine ranking , session duration , and task-difficulty . finally , using an information-theoretic measure of search-difficulty , we show that the benefits obtained by search and navigation actions depend on the frequency of the information-goal .
