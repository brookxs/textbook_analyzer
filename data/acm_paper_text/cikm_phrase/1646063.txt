fast shortest-path distance-estimation in large-networks in this paper we study approximate landmark-based methods for point-to-point distance-estimation in very-large networks . these methods involve selecting a subset of nodes as landmarks and computing offline the distances from each node in the graph to those landmarks . at runtime , when the distance between a pair of nodes is needed , it can be estimated quickly by combining the precomputed distances . we prove that selecting the optimal set of landmarks is an np-hard-problem , and thus heuristic-solutions need to be employed . we therefore explore theoretical insights to devise a variety of simple methods that scale well in very-large networks . the efficiency of the suggested techniques is tested experimentally using five real-world graphs having millions of edges . while theoretical bounds support the claim that random landmarks work well in practice , our extensive experimentation shows that smart landmark-selection can yield dramatically more accurate results : for a given target accuracy , our methods require as much as 250 times less space than selecting landmarks at random . in addition , we demonstrate that at a very small accuracy loss our techniques are several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art exact-methods . finally , we study an application of our methods to the task of social-search in large-graphs .
