named-entity-disambiguation by leveraging wikipedia semantic-knowledge name-ambiguity problem has raised an urgent demand for efficient , high-quality named-entity-disambiguation methods . the key problem of named-entity-disambiguation is to measure the similarity between occurrences of names . the traditional methods measure the similarity using the bag-of-words (bow) model . the bow , however , ignores all the semantic relations such as social relatedness between named-entities , associative relatedness between concepts , polysemy and synonymy between key terms . so the bow can not reflect the actual similarity . some research has investigated social-networks as background-knowledge for disambiguation . social-networks , however , can only capture the social relatedness between named-entities , and often suffer the limited coverage-problem . to overcome the previous methods ' deficiencies , this paper proposes to use wikipedia as the background-knowledge for disambiguation , which surpasses other knowledge-bases by the coverage of concepts , rich semantic-information and up-to-date content . by leveraging wikipedia 's semantic-knowledge like social relatedness between named-entities and associative relatedness between concepts , we can measure the similarity between occurrences of names more accurately . in particular , we construct a large-scale semantic-network from wikipedia , in order that the semantic knowledge can be used efficiently and effectively . based on the constructed semantic-network , a novel similarity-measure is proposed to leverage wikipedia semantic-knowledge for disambiguation . the proposed method has been tested on the standard weps data-sets . empirical-results show that the disambiguation performance of our method gets 10.7 \ % improvement over the traditional bow_based methods and 16.7 \ % improvement over the traditional social-network_based methods .
