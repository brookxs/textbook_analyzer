multi-document topic-segmentation multiple-documents describing the same or closely related sets of events are common and often easy to obtain : for example , consider document clusters on a news-aggregator site or multiple reviews of the same product or service . even though each such document discusses a similar set of topics , they provide alternative-views or complimentary information on each of these topics . we argue that revealing hidden relations by jointly segmenting the documents , or , equivalently , predicting links between topically related segments in different documents would help to visualize documents of interest and construct friendlier user-interfaces . in this paper , we refer to this problem as multi-document topic-segmentation . we propose an unsupervised bayesian model for the considered problem that models both shared and document-specific topics , and utilizes dirichlet-process priors to determine the effective number of topics . we show that topic-segmentation can be inferred efficiently using a simple split-merge sampling algorithm . the resulting method outperforms baseline models on four datasets for multi-document topic-segmentation .
