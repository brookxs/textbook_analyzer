storing hytime documents in an object-oriented-databases an open hypermedia-document storage-system has to meet requirements that are not satisfied by existing systems : it has to support non-generic hypermedia-document types , i.e. document types enriched with application-specific semantics . it has to provide hypermedia-document access-methods . finally , it has to allow the exchange of hypermedia-documents with other systems . on a technical level , an object-oriented database-management system , on a logical level , a well established iso standard , namely hytime , is used to satisfy the requirements mentioned above . by means of the example of documents incorporating hypertext-structures we discuss the impact of taking such an approach on representation and processing within the database-system .
