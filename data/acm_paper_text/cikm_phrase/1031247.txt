processing content-oriented xpath-queries document-centric-xml collections contain text-rich documents , marked up with xml tags that add lightweight-semantics to the text . querying such collections calls for a hybrid-query-language : the text-rich nature of the documents suggests a content-oriented (ir) approach , while the mark-up allows users to add structural constraints to their ir queries . hybrid-queries tend to be more expressive , which should lead -- in principle -- to better retrieval-performance . in practice , the processing of these hybrid-queries within an ir systems turns out to be far from trivial , because a delicate balance between structural and content information-needs to be sought . we propose an approach to processing such hybrid content-and-structure queries that decomposes a query into multiple content-only queries whose results are then combined in ways determined by the structural constraints of the original query . we evaluate our methods using the inex 2003 test-suite , and show (1) that effective ways of processing of content-oriented xpath-queries are non-trivial , (2) that there are differences in the effectiveness for different topics types , but (3) that with appropriate processing methods retrieval-effectiveness can improve .
