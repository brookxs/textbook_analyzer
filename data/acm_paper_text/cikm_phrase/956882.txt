high-dimensional reverse-nearest-neighbor-queries reverse-nearest-neighbor (rnn) queries are of particular interest in a wide range of applications such as decision-support-systems , profile_based marketing , data-streaming , document-databases , and bioinformatics . the earlier approaches to solve this problem mostly deal with two dimensional data . however most of the above applications inherently involve high-dimensions and high-dimensional rnn problem is still unexplored . in this paper , we propose an approximate-solution to answer rnn queries in high-dimensions . our approach is based on the strong correlation in practice between k - nn and rnn . it works in two phases . in the first phase the k - nn of a query point is found and in the next phase they are further analyzed using a novel type of query boolean-range query (brq) . experimental-results show that brq is much more efficient than both nn and range-queries , and can be effectively used to answer rnn queries . performance is further improved by running multiple brq simultaneously . the proposed approach can also be used to answer other variants of rnn queries such as rnn of order k , bichromatic rnn , and matching query which has many applications of its own . our technique can efficiently answer nn , rnn , and its variants with approximately same number of i/o as running a nn query .
