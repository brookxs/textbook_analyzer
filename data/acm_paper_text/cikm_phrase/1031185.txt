using bi-modal alignment and clustering-techniques for documents and speech thematic segmentations in this paper , we describe a new method for a simultaneous thematic-segmentation of the meeting dialogs and the documents discussed or visible throughout the meeting . this bi-modal method is suitable for multimodal-applications that are centered on documents , such as meetings and lectures , where documents can be aligned with meeting dialogs . bringing into play this alignment , our bi-modal segmentation-method first transforms its results into a set of nodes in a 2d graph space , where the two axes represent respectively the document units and the meeting dialogs units . secondly , via a clustering-method , the most connected regions in the constituted bi-graph are detected . finally , the denser clusters are projected on the two axes . the two sequences of segments , obtained on both axes , represent the thematic-structure of the document and of the meeting dialogs respectively . we present in this article this bi-modal segmentation technique and its performance compared with two mono-modal segmentation methods .
