sequential-selection of correlated ads by pomdps online-advertising has become a key source of revenue for both web-search-engines and online publishers . for them , the ability of allocating right ads to right webpages is critical because any mismatched ads would not only harm web users ' satisfactions but also lower the ad income . in this paper , we study how online publishers could optimally select ads to maximize their ad incomes over time . the conventional offline , content-based-matching between webpages and ads is a fine start but can not solve the problem completely because good matching does not necessarily lead to good payoff . moreover , with the limited display impressions , we need to balance the need of selecting ads to learn true ad payoffs (exploration) with that of allocating ads to generate high immediate payoffs based on the current belief (exploitation) . in this paper , we address the problem by employing partially-observable-markov-decision-processes (pomdps) and discuss how to utilize the correlation of ads to improve the efficiency of the exploration and increase ad incomes in a long run . our mathematical derivation shows that the belief states of correlated ads can be naturally updated using a formula similar to collaborative-filtering . to test our model , a real-world ad dataset from a major search-engine is collected and categorized . experimenting over the data , we provide an analyse of the effect of the underlying parameters , and demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform other strong baselines .
