relational computation for mining association-rules from xml-data we develop a fixpoint-operator for computing large item sets and demonstrate three query paradigm solutions for association-rule-mining that use the idea of least fixpoint-computation and indicates some optimisation issues . the results of our research provide theoretical foundation for relational computation of association-rules and its application on xml-mining .
