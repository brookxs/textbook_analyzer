supervised matching of comments with news article segments comments constitute an important part of web-2.0 . in this paper , we consider comments on news-articles . to simplify the task of relating the comment content to the article content the comments are about , we propose the idea of showing comments alongside article segments and explore automatic mapping of comments to article segments . this task is challenging because of the vocabulary mismatch between the articles and the comments . we present supervised and unsupervised techniques for aligning comments to segments the of article the comments are about . more specifically , we provide a novel formulation of supervised alignment problem using the framework of structured-classification . our experimental-results show that structured-classification model performs better than unsupervised matching and binary-classification model .
