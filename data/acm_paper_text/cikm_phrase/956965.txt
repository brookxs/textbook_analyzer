expertise-identification using email-communications a common method for finding information in an organization is to use social-networks -- ask people , following referrals until someone with the right information is found . another way is to automatically mine documents to determine who knows what . email documents seem particularly well suited to this task of `` expertise-location '' , as people routinely communicate what they know . moreover , because people explicitly direct email to one another , social-networks are likely to be contained in the patterns-of-communication . can these patterns be used to discover experts on particular topics ? is this approach better than mining message content alone ? to find answers to these questions , two algorithms for determining expertise from email were compared : a content-based approach that takes account only of email-text , and a graph-based-ranking algorithm (hits) that takes account both of text and communication-patterns . an evaluation was done using email and explicit expertise ratings from two different organizations . the rankings given by each algorithm were compared to the explicit rankings with the precision-and-recall measures commonly used in information-retrieval , as well as the d' measure commonly used in signal-detection theory . results show that the graph-based-algorithm performs better than the content-based algorithm at identifying experts in both cases , demonstrating that the graph-based-algorithm effectively extracts more information than is found in content alone .
