sisp : a new framework for searching the informative subgraph based on pso a significant number of applications on graph require the key relations among a group of query nodes . given a relational graph such as social-network or biochemical interaction , an informative subgraph is urgent , which can best explain the relationships among a group of given query nodes . based on particle-swarm-optimization (pso) , a new framework of sisp (searching the informative subgraph based on pso) is proposed . sisp contains three key stages . in the initialization stage , a random spreading method is proposed , which can effectively guarantee the connectivity of the nodes in each particle ; in the calculating stage of fitness , a fitness-function is designed by incorporating a sign function with the goodness-score ; in the update stage , the intersection-based particle extension method and rule-based particle compression-method are proposed . to evaluate the qualities of returned subgraphs , the appropriate calculating of goodness-score is studied . considering the importance and relevance of a node together , we present the pnr method , which makes the definition of informativeness more reliable and the returned subgraph more satisfying . at last , we present experiments on a real dataset and a synthetic dataset separately . the experimental-results confirm that the proposed methods achieve increased accuracy and are efficient for any query set .
