injecting purpose and trust into data anonymisation most existing works of data anonymisation target at the optimization of the anonymisation metrics to balance the data-utility and privacy , whereas they ignore the effects of a requester 's trust level and application purposes during the data anonymisation . our aim of this paper is to propose a much finer level anonymisation scheme with regard to the data requester 's trust value and specific application purpose . we prioritize the attributes for anonymisation based on how important and critical they are related to the specified application purposes and propose a trust-evaluation strategy to quantify the data requester 's reliability , and further build the projection between the trust value and the degree of data anonymiztion , which intends to determine to what extent the data should be anonymized . the decomposition algorithm is developed to find the desired anonymous solution , which guarantees the uniqueness and correctness .
