exploring categorization property of social-annotations for information-retrieval user generated social-annotations provide extra information for describing document contents . in this paper , we propose an effective method to model the categorization property of social-annotations and explore the potential of combining it with classical language-models for improving retrieval-performance . specifically , a novel tr-lda model is presented to take annotations as an additional source for generating document contents apart from the document itself . we provide strategies for representing and weighting the categorization property and develop an efficient inference-algorithm , where space saving is taken into account . experiments are carried out on synthetic datasets , where documents and queries come from the standard evaluation conference trec and annotations come from the website delicious.com . our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the ad-hoc-retrieval task , which significantly outperforms state-of-art baselines .
