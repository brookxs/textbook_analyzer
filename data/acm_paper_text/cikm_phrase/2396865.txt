predicting query-performance for fusion-based retrieval estimating the effectiveness of a search performed in response to a query in the absence of relevance-judgments is the goal of query-performance-prediction methods . post-retrieval predictors analyze the result list of the most highly ranked documents . we address the prediction challenge for retrieval approaches wherein the final result list is produced by fusing document lists that were retrieved in response to a query . to that end , we present a novel fundamental prediction-framework that accounts for this special characteristics of the fusion setting ; i.e. , the use of intermediate retrieved lists . the framework is based on integrating prediction performed upon the final result list with that performed upon the lists that were fused to create it ; prediction integration is controlled based on inter-list similarities . we empirically demonstrate the merits of various predictors instantiated from the framework . a case in point , their prediction-quality substantially transcends that of applying state-of-the-art predictors upon the final result list .
