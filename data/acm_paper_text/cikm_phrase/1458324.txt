group-based-learning : a boosting approach this paper points out that many machine-learning problems in ir should be and can be formalized in a novel way , referred to as ` group-based-learning ' . in group-based-learning , it is assumed that training-data as well as testing-data consist of groups . the classifier is created and utilized across groups . furthermore , evaluation in testing and also in training are conducted at group level , with the use of evaluation-measures defined on a group . this paper addresses the problem and presents a boosting-algorithm to perform the new learning-task . the algorithm , referred to as adaboost.group , is proved to be able to improve accuracies in terms of group-based measures during training .
