gem-based entity-knowledge maintenance knowledge-bases about entities have become a vital asset for web-search , recommendations , and analytics . examples are freebase being the core of the google knowledge graph and the use of wikipedia for distant supervision in numerous ir and nlp-tasks . however , maintaining the knowledge about not so prominent entities in the long-tail is often a bottleneck as human contributors face the tedious task of continuously identifying and reading relevant-sources . to overcome this limitation and accelerate the maintenance of knowledge-bases , we propose an approach that automatically extracts , from the-web , key contents for given input entities . our method , called gem , generates salient contents about a given entity , using minimal assumptions about the underlying sources , while meeting the constraint that the user is willing to read only a certain amount of information . salient content pieces have variable-length and are computed using a budget-constrained optimization-problem which decides upon which sub-pieces of an input-text should be selected for the final result . gem can be applied to a variety of knowledge-gathering settings including news-streams and speech-input from videos . our experimental-studies show the viability of the approach , and demonstrate improvements over various baselines , in terms of precision-and-recall .
