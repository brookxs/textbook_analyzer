decomposition-by-normalization (dbn) : leveraging approximate-functional-dependencies for efficient tensor-decomposition for many multi-dimensional-data applications , tensor operations as well as relational operations need to be supported throughout the data lifecycle . although tensor-decomposition is shown to be effective for multi-dimensional-data analysis , the cost of tensor-decomposition is often very high . we propose a novel decomposition-by-normalization scheme that first normalizes the given relation into smaller tensors based on the functional-dependencies of the relation and then performs the decomposition using these smaller tensors . the decomposition and recombination steps of the decomposition-by - normalization scheme fit naturally in settings with multiple cores . this leads to a highly efficient , effective , and parallelized decomposition-by-normalization algorithm for both dense and sparse tensors . experiments confirm the efficiency-and-effectiveness of the proposed decomposition-by-normalization scheme compared to the conventional nonnegative cp decomposition-approach .
