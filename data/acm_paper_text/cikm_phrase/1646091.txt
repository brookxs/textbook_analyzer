product-feature-categorization with multilevel latent-semantic-association in recent years , the number of freely available online-reviews is increasing at a high-speed . aspect-based opinion-mining technique has been employed to find out reviewers ' opinions toward different product aspects . such finer-grained opinion-mining is valuable for the potential customers to make their purchase decisions . product-feature extraction and categorization is very important for better mining aspect-oriented opinions . since people usually use different words to describe the same aspect in the reviews , product-feature extraction and categorization becomes more challenging . manually product-feature extraction and categorization is tedious and time consuming , and practically infeasible for the massive amount of products . in this paper , we propose an unsupervised product-feature categorization method with multilevel latent-semantic-association . after extracting product-features from the semi-structured reviews , we construct the first latent-semantic-association (lasa) model to group words into a set of concepts according to their virtual context documents . it generates the latent-semantic structure for each product-feature . the second lasa model is constructed to categorize the product-features according to their latent-semantic structures and context snippets in the reviews . experimental-results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance compared with the existing approaches . moreover , the proposed method is language - and domain-independent .
