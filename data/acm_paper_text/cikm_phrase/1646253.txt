matching person-names through name-transformation matching person-names plays an important role in many applications , including bibliographic-databases and indexing-systems . name variations and spelling errors make exact string-matching problematic ; therefore , it is useful to develop methodologies that can handle variant forms for the same named-entity . in this paper , a novel person-name matching model is presented . common name variations in the english speaking world are formalized , and the concept of name-transformation paths is introduced ; name-similarity is measured after the best transformation path has been selected . supervised techniques are used to learn a similarity-function and a decision-rule . experiments with three datasets show the method to be effective .
