rapid association-rule-mining association-rule-mining is a well-researched area where many algorithms have been proposed to improve the speed of mining . in this paper , we propose an innovative algorithm called rapid association-rule-mining (rarm) to once again break this speed barrier . it uses a versatile tree-structure known as the support-ordered trie itemset (sotrieit) structure to hold pre-processed transactional data . this allows rarm to generate large 1-itemsets and 2-itemsets quickly without scanning the database and without candidate 2-itemset generation . it achieves significant speed-ups because the main bottleneck in association-rule-mining using the apriori property is the generation of candidate 2-itemsets . rarm has been compared with the classical mining algorithm apriori and it is found that it outperforms apriori by up to two orders of magnitude (100 times) , much more than what recent mining algorithms are able to achieve .
