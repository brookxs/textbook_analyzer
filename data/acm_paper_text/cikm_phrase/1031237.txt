localized signature table : fast similarity-search on transaction-data recently , techniques for supporting efficient similarity-search over huge transaction datasets have emerged as an important research area . several indexing schemes have been proposed towards this direction . typically , these schemes provide a tradeoff between searching efficiency and indexing overhead in terms of space . in this paper , we propose a novel indexing-scheme for similarity-search on transaction-data . based on well-studied clustering-techniques , we develop a construction algorithm for the proposed index and a branch-and-bound searching strategy for answering similarity-search . unlike previous techniques , our indexing-scheme exhibits high search efficiency and low space requirements by trading-off the pre-computation time . this behavior is ideal for applications with low update but high read volume <i> e.g. </i> , data-warehousing , collaborative-filtering , <i> etc. </i>) . moreover , our experimental-results illustrate that our method is robust to the varying characteristics of the datasets .
