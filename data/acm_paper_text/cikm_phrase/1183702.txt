describing differences between databases we study the novel problem of efficiently computing the update-distance for a pair of relational-databases . in analogy to the edit-distance of strings , we define the update-distance of two databases as the minimal number of set-oriented insert , delete and modification operations necessary to transform one database into the other . we show how this distance can be computed by traversing a search-space of database instances connected by update-operations . this insight leads to a family of algorithms that compute the update-distance or approximations of it . in our experiments we observed that a simple heuristic performs surprisingly well in most considered cases.our motivation for studying distance-measures for databases stems from the field of scientific-databases . there , replicas of a single database are often maintained at different sites , which typically leads to (accidental or planned) divergence of their content . to re-create a consistent view , these differences must be resolved . such an effort requires an understanding of the process that produced them . we found that minimal update sequences of set-oriented update-operations are a proper and concise representation of systematic errors , thus giving valuable clues to domain-experts responsible for conflict-resolution .
