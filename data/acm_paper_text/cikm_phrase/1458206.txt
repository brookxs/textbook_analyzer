probabilistic-polyadic-factorization and its application to personalized-recommendation multiple-dimensional , i.e. , polyadic , data exist in many applications , such as personalized-recommendation and multiple-dimensional-data summarization . analyzing all the dimensions of polyadic-data in a principled way is a challenging research problem . most existing methods separately analyze the marginal relationships among pairwise dimensions and then combine the results afterwards . motivated by the fact that various dimensions of polyadic-data jointly affect each other , we propose a probabilistic-polyadic-factorization approach to directly model all the dimensions simultaneously in a unified-framework . we then show the connection between the probabilistic-polyadic-factorization and a non-negative version of the tucker tensor-factorization . we provide detailed theoretical-analysis of the new modeling-framework , discuss implementation-techniques for our models , and propose several extensions to the basic framework . we then apply the proposed models to the application of personalized-recommendation . extensive experiments on a social-bookmarking dataset , delicious , and a paper citation dataset , citeseer , demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models .
