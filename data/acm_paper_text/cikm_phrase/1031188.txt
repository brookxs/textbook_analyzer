interval query-indexing for efficient stream-processing a large number of continual range-queries can be issued against a data-stream . usually , a main memory-based query index with a small storage-cost and a fast-search time is needed , especially if the stream is rapid . in this paper , we present a cei-based query index that meets both criteria for efficient processing of continual interval queries in a streaming environment . this new query index is centered around a set of predefined virtual <i> containment-encoded intervals </i> , or ceis . the ceis are used to first decompose query intervals and then perform efficient search operations . the ceis are defined and labeled such that containment relationships among them are encoded in their ids . the containment encoding makes decomposition and search operations efficient because integer additions and logical shifts can be used to carry out most of the operations . simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the cei-based query index and to compare it with alternative approaches . the results show that the cei-based query index significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both storage-cost and search-time .
