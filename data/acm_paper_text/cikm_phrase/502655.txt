powerdb-ir : information-retrieval on top of a database cluster our current concern is a scalable infrastructure for information-retrieval (ir) with up-to-date retrieval results in the presence of frequent , continuous updates . timely processing of updates is important with novel application-domains , e.g. , e-commerce . we want to use off-the-self hardware and software as much as possible . these issues are challenging , given the additional requirement that the resulting system must scale well . we have built powerdb-ir , a system that has the characteristics sought . this paper describes its design , implementation , and evaluation . powerdb-ir is a coordination layer for a database cluster . the rationale behind a database cluster is to ` scale-out ' , i.e. , to add further cluster nodes , whenever necessary for better performance . we build on ir-to-database mappings and service decomposition to support high-level parallelism . we follow a three-tier architecture with the database cluster as the bottom layer for storage-management . the middle-tier provides ir-specific processing and update services . powerdb-ir has the following features : it allows to insert and retrieve documents concurrently , and it ensures freshness with almost no overhead . alternative physical data organization schemes provide adequate performance for different workloads . query-processing techniques for the different data organizations efficiently integrate the ranked-retrieval results from the cluster nodes . we have run extensive experiments with our prototype using commercial database systems and middleware software-products . the main result is that powerdb-ir shows surprisingly ideal scalability and low response-times .
