towards smarter documents document-analysis research typically focuses on document-image-understanding or classic problems in text-classification , clustering , summarization and discovery . while that is an important aspect of document-management , in practice , documents lifecycles are often determined by the context of the business-process that they are relevant to . it therefore becomes necessary for the document analysis-techniques to recognize and leverage the contextual-information provided by a supporting schema and business-process . this paper presents an intelligent document management-framework with relevant-document analysis , metadata-extraction , and business-process association-algorithms and methodology . the architecture supporting this framework seamlessly integrates a runtime-environment with an authoring-environment by combining relational-data modeling-tools with document-classification techniques . the runtime-environment accepts incoming documents , classifies the document , extracts metadata and executes customized business-logic . the authoring-environment supports the association of a class of documents with a relational document schema , identification of attribute values that must be extracted automatically , generation of relevant business-logic , and deployment of authoring artifacts into the runtime-architecture . we demonstrate the use of this framework with representative real-world document transformative applications .
