intelligent caching : selecting , representing , and reusing data in an information server accessing information-sources to retrieve data requested by a user can be expensive , especially when dealing with distributed information sources . one way to reduce this cost is to cache the results of queries , or related classes of data . this paper presents an approach to caching and addresses the issues of which information to cache , how to describe what has been cached , and how to use the cached information to answer future queries . we consider these issues in the context of the sims information server , which is a system for retrieving information from multiple heterogeneous and distributed information sources . the design of this information server is ideal for representing and reusing cached information since each class of cached information is simply viewed as another information-source that is available for answering future queries .
