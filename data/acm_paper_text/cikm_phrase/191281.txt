quasi-dynamic two-phase-locking among the plethora of concurrency-control-algorithms that have been proposed and analyzed , two-phase-locking (2pl) has been adapted as the industry de facto standard concurrency-control . in accord , current-research in concurrency-control is focusing on enhancing the scalability of 2pl performance in highly concurrent and contentious environments . this is especially needed in future on-line transaction-processing-systems , where thousand transaction per second performance will be required . static locking (sl) and dynamic-locking (dl) are two famous adaptations of 2pl that are used under different degrees of data-contention . in this paper , we offer our observation that 2pl is indeed a family of methods , of which sl and dl are extreme case members . further , we argue for and verify the existence of other 2pl member methods that , under variable conditions , outperform sl and dl . we propose two novel schemes which we categorize as quasi-dynamic two-phase-locking on account of their behavior in comparison with dynamic/static two-phase-locking . we present a simulation-study of the performance of the proposed schemes and their comparison to dynamic and static locking methods .
