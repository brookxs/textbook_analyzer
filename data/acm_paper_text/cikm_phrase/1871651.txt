alignment of short length parallel-corpora with an application to web-search with evolving web , short length parallel-corpora is becoming very common and some of these include user queries , web-snippets etc. . this paper concerns situations where short length parallel-corpora has to be analyzed in order to find meaningful unit-alignment . this is similar to dealing with parallel-corpora where a sentence-level-alignment of translations is required , but differs in that the alignment is to be inferred at unit (word or phrase) level . a conditional-random-field (crf) based approach is proposed to discover this unit alignment . given pairs of semantically or syntactically similar entities , the problem is formulated as that of mutual-segmentation and sequence-alignment problem . the mutual-segmentation refers to the process of segmenting the first entity based on units (or labels) in the second entity and vice-versa . the process of optimizing this mutual-segmentation also results in optimal unit alignment . since our training-data is not segmented and unit-aligned , we modify the crf objective-function to accommodate unsupervised data and iterative-learning . we have applied this framework to web-search domain and specifically for query-reformulation task . finally , our experiments suggest that the proposed approach indeed results in meaningful alternatives of the original query .
