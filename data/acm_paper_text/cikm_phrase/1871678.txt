routing questions to appropriate answerers in community-question-answering services community-question-answering (cqa) service provides a platform for increasing number-of-users to ask and answer for their own needs but unanswered questions still exist within a fixed period . to address this , the paper aims to route questions to the right answerers who have a top rank in accordance of their previous answering performance . in order to rank the answerers , we propose a framework called question-routing (qr) which consists of four phases : (1) performance-profiling , (2) expertise-estimation , (3) availability estimation , and (4) answerer ranking . applying the framework , we conduct experiments with yahoo!-answers dataset and the results demonstrate that on average each of 1,713 testing questions obtains at least one answer if it is routed to the top 20 ranked answerers .
