learning-to-rank graphs for online similar graph-search many applications in structure-matching require the ability to search for graphs that are similar to a query-graph , i.e. , similarity-graph queries . prior works , especially in chemoinformatics , have used the maximum common edge subgraph (mceg) to compute the graph-similarity . this approach is prohibitively slow for real-time-queries . in this work , we propose an algorithm that extracts and indexes subgraph features from a graph dataset . it computes the similarity of graphs using a linear graph-kernel based on feature-weights learned offline from a training-set generated using mceg . we show empirically that our proposed algorithm of learning-to-rank graphs can achieve higher normalized-discounted-cumulative-gain compared with existing optimal methods based on mceg . the running-time of our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than these existing methods .
