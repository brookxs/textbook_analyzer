boolean-satisfiability for sequence-mining in this paper , we propose a sat-based encoding for the problem of discovering frequent , closed and maximal patterns in a sequence of items and a sequence of itemsets . our encoding can be seen as an improvement of the approach proposed in [8] for the sequences of items . in this case , we show experimentally on real-world data that our encoding is significantly better . then we introduce a new extension of the problem to enumerate patterns in a sequence of itemsets . thanks to the flexibility and to the declarative aspects of our sat-based approach , an encoding for the sequences of itemsets is obtained by a very slight modification of that for the sequences of items .
