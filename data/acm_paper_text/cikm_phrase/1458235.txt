structural-relevance : a common basis for the evaluation of structured-document-retrieval this paper presents a unified-framework for the evaluation of a range of structured-document-retrieval (sdr) approaches and tasks . the framework is based on a model of tree retrieval , evaluated using a novel extension of the structural elevance (sr) measure . the measure replaces the assumption of independence in traditional information-retrieval (ir) with a notion of redundancy that takes into account the user-navigation inside documents while seeking relevant-information . unlike existing metrics for sdr , our proposed framework does not require the computation of an ideal ranking which has , thus far , prevented the practical application of such measures . instead , sr builds on a markovian-model of user-navigation that can be estimated through the use of structural-summaries . the results of this paper (supported by experimental-validation using inex data) show that sr defined over a tree retrieval-model can provide a common basis for the evaluation of sdr approaches across various structured-search tasks .
