query-expansion using associated queries hundreds of millions of users each day use web-search-engines to meet their information-needs . advances in web-search-effectiveness are therefore perhaps the most significant public outcomes of ir research . query-expansion is one such method for improving the effectiveness of ranked-retrieval by adding additional terms to a query . in previous approaches to query-expansion , the additional terms are selected from highly ranked documents returned from an initial retrieval run . we propose a new method of obtaining expansion terms , based on selecting terms from past user queries that are associated with documents in the collection . our scheme is effective for query-expansion for web-retrieval : our results show relative improvements over unexpanded full-text-retrieval of 26 \ % -- 29 \ % , and 18 \ % -- 20 \ % over an optimised , conventional expansion approach .
