on the relationship between description-logic and predicate-logic queries description languages form the basis of several object-centered knowledge-base-management-systems developed in recent years , including ones in industrial use . originally used for conceptual-modeling (to define views) , dls are seeing increased use as query-languages for retrieving information . this paper , aimed at a general audience that includes database researchers , considers the relationship between the expressive-power of dls and that of query-languages based on predicate-calculus . we show that all descriptions built using constructors currently considered in the literature can be expressed as formulae of the first order predicate calculus (fopc) with at most three variable symbols , though we have to allow numeric quantifiers and infinitary disjunction in order to handle some special constructors . conversely , we show that all first-order queries (formulae with one free variable) built up from unary and binary predicates using at most three variables can be expressed as descriptions . we conclude by exhibiting queries that can not be expressed as dl concepts , and reflecting briefly on consequences .
