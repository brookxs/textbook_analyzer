active caching for similarity-queries based on shared-neighbor information novel applications such as recommender-systems , uncertain-databases , and multimedia-databases are designed to process similarity-queries that produce ranked-lists of objects as their results . similarity-queries typically result in disk access latency and incur a substantial computational cost . in this paper , we propose an ` active caching ' technique for similarity-queries that is capable of synthesizing query results from cached information even when the required result list is not explicitly stored in the cache . our solution , the cache estimated significance (ces) model , is based on shared-neighbor similarity-measures , which assess the strength of the relationship between two objects as a function of the number of other objects in the common intersection of their neighborhoods . the proposed method is general in that it does not require that the features be drawn from a metric-space , nor does it require that the partial-orders induced by the similarity-measure be monotonic . experimental-results on real-data sets show a substantial cache hit rate when compared with traditional caching approaches .
