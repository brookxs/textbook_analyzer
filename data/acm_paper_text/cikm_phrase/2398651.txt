selecting expansion terms as a set via integer-linear-programming pseudo-relevance-feedback via query-expansion has been widely studied from various perspectives in the past decades . its effectiveness in improving retrieval-effectiveness has been shown in many tasks . a variety of criteria were proposed to select additional terms for the original queries . however , most of the existing methods weight and select terms individually and do not consider the impact of term-to-term relationship . in this paper , we first examine the influence of combinations of terms through data-analysis , which demonstrate the significant effect of term-to-term relationship on retrieval-effectiveness . then , to address this problem , we formalize the query-expansion task as an integer-linear-programming (ilp) problem . the model combines the weights learned from a supervised-method for individual terms , and integrates constraints to capture relations between terms . finally , three standard trec collections are used to evaluate the proposed method . experimental-results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the effectiveness of retrieval .
