association thesaurus-construction methods based on link-co-occurrence analysis for wikipedia wikipedia , a huge scale web-based encyclopedia , attracts great attention as an invaluable corpus for knowledge-extraction because it has various impressive characteristics such as a huge number of articles , live updates , a dense link-structure , brief anchor-texts and url identification for concepts . we have already proved that we can use wikipedia to construct a huge scale accurate association thesaurus . the association thesaurus we constructed covers almost 1.3 million concepts and its accuracy is proved in detailed experiments . however , we still need scalable methods to analyze the huge number of web-pages and hyperlinks among articles in the web-based encyclopedia . in this paper , we propose a scalable method for constructing an association thesaurus from wikipedia based on link co-occurrences . link-co-occurrence analysis is more scalable than link-structure-analysis because it is a one-pass process . we also propose integration method of tfidf and link-co-occurrence analysis . experimental-results show that both our proposed methods are more accurate and scalable than conventional methods . furthermore , the integration of tfidf achieved higher accuracy than using only link co-occurrences .
