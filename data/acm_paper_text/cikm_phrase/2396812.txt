location-aware instant search location-based-services (lbs) have been widely accepted by mobile-users recently . existing lbs-based systems require users to type in complete keywords . however for mobile-users it is rather difficult to type in complete keywords on mobile-devices . to alleviate this problem , in this paper we study the location-aware instant search-problem , which returns users location-aware answers as users type in queries letter by letter . the main challenge is to achieve high interactive speed . to address this challenge , in this paper we propose a novel index-structure , prefix-region tree (called pr-tree) , to efficiently support location-aware instant search . pr-tree is a tree-based-index-structure which seamlessly integrates the textual description and spatial-information to index the spatial-data . using the pr-tree , we develop efficient-algorithms to support single prefix queries and multi-keyword queries . experiments show that our method achieves high-performance and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods .
