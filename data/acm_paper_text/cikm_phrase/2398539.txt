towards jointly extracting aspects and aspect-specific sentiment knowledge in this paper , we aim to jointly extract aspects and aspect-specific sentiment knowledge from online-reviews , where the sentiment knowledge refers to the aspect-specific opinion-words along with their aspect-aware sentiment polarities . to this end , we propose a joint aspect/sentiment model (jas) . jas detects aspect-specific opinion-words by integrating opinion-word lexicon knowledge to explicitly separate opinion-words from factual words . more importantly , jas exploits sentiment prior and aspect-contextual sentence-level co-occurrences of opinion-words in reviews to further identify aspect-aware sentiment polarities for the opinion-words . we apply the learned aspect-specific sentiment knowledge to practical aspect-level sentiment-analysis tasks . experimental-results show the effectiveness of jas in learning aspect-specific sentiment knowledge and the practical value of this knowledge when applied to aspect-level sentiment-classification .
