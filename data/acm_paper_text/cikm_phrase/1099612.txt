access-control for xml : a dynamic-query rewriting approach being able to express and enforce role-based-access-control on xml-data is a critical component of xml-data management . however , given the semi-structured nature of xml , this is non-trivial , as access-control can be applied on the values of nodes as well as on the structural relationship between nodes . in this context , we adopt and extend a graph editing language for specifying role-based-access constraints in the form of security views . a security annotated schema (sas) is proposed as the internal-representation for the security views and can be automatically constructed from the original schema and the security-view specification . to enforce the access constraints on user queries , we propose secure query-rewrite (sqr) -- a set of rules that can be used to rewrite a user xpath query on the security-view into an equivalent xquery expression against the original data , with the guarantee that the users only see information in the view but not any data that was blocked . experimental-evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and the expressiveness of our approach .
