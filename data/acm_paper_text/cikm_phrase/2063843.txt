enriching textbooks with images textbooks have a direct bearing on the quality of education imparted to the students . therefore , it is of paramount importance that the educational content of textbooks should provide rich learning-experience to the students . recent studies on understanding learning behavior suggest that the incorporation of digital visual material can greatly enhance learning . however , textbooks used in many developing-regions are largely text-oriented and lack good visual material . we propose techniques for finding images from the-web that are most relevant for augmenting a section of the textbook , while respecting the constraint that the same image is not repeated in different sections of the same chapter . we devise a rigorous formulation of the image assignment-problem and present a polynomial-time-algorithm for solving the problem optimally . we also present two image-mining algorithms that utilize orthogonal signals and hence obtain different sets of relevant images . finally , we provide an ensembling algorithm for combining the assignments . to empirically evaluate our techniques , we use a corpus of high-school textbooks in use in india . our user-study utilizing the amazon-mechanical-turk platform indicates that the proposed techniques are able to obtain images that can help increase the understanding of the textbook material .
