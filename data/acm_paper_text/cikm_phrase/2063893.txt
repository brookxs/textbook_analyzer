context-aware query-recommendation by learning high-order relation in query-logs query-recommendation has been widely used in modern search-engines . recently , several context-aware methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy of recommendation by mining query-sequence patterns from query sessions . however , the existing methods usually do not address the ambiguity of queries explicitly and often suffer from the sparsity of the training-data . in this paper , we propose a novel context-aware query-recommendation approach by modeling the high-order relation between queries and clicks in query-log , which captures users ' latent search-intents . empirical-experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods in providing high quality recommendations for ambiguous-queries .
