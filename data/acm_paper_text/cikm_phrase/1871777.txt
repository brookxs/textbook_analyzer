brown dwarf : a p2p data-warehousing system in this demonstration we present the brown dwarf , a distributed-system designed to efficiently store , query and update multidimensional-data . deployed on any number of commodity nodes , our system manages to distribute large volumes of data over network peers on-the-fly and process queries and updates on-line through cooperating nodes that hold parts of a materialized cube . moreover , it adapts its resources according to demand and hardware failures and is cost-effective both over the required hardware and software components . all the aforementioned functionality will be tested using various datasets and query loads .
