question-answering from the-web using knowledge annotation and knowledge-mining techniques we present a strategy for answering fact-based natural-language questions that is guided by a characterization of real-world user queries . our approach , implemented in a system called aranea , extracts answers from the-web using two different techniques : knowledge annotation and knowledge-mining . knowledge annotation is an approach to answering large-classes of frequently occurring questions by utilizing semi \ - structured and structured web sources . knowledge-mining is a statistical approach that leverages massive amounts of web-data to overcome many natural-language-processing challenges . we have integrated these two different paradigms into a question-answering-system capable of providing users with concise answers that directly address their information-needs .
