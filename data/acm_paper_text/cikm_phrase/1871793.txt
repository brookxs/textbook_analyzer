third workshop on exploiting semantic-annotations in information-retrieval (esair) : cikm 2010 workshop there is an increasing amount of structure on the web as a result of modern web languages , user-tagging and annotation , and emerging robust nlp-tools . these meaningful , semantic , annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information-access , by enhancing the depth of analysis of today 's systems . currently , we have only started exploring the possibilities and only begin to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use . unleashing the potential of semantic-annotations requires us to think outside-the-box , by combining the insights of natural-language-processing (nlp) to go beyond bags of words , the insights of databases (db) to use structure efficiently even when aggregating over millions of records , the insights of information-retrieval (ir) in effective goal-directed-search and evaluation , and the insights of knowledge-management (km) to get grips on the greater whole . the workshop aims to bring together researchers from these different disciplines and work together on one of the greatest challenges in the years to come . the desired result of the workshop will be concrete insight into the potential of semantic-annotations , and in concrete steps to take this research forward ; synchronize related research happening in nlp , db , ir , and km , in ways that combine the strengths of each discipline ; and have a lively , interactive workshop were everyone contributes and that inspires attendees to think `` outside-the-box '' .
