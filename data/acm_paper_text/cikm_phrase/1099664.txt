privacy leakage in multi-relational databases via pattern_based semi-supervised-learning in multi-relational databases , a view , which is a context - and content-dependent subset of one or more tables (or other views) , is often used to preserve privacy by hiding sensitive-information . however , recent developments in data-mining present a new challenge for database-security even when traditional database-security techniques , such as database-access-control , are employed . this paper presents a data-mining-framework using semi-supervised-learning that demonstrates the potential for privacy leakage in multi-relational databases . many different types of semi-supervised-learning techniques , such as the k-nearest-neighbor (knn) method , can be used to demonstrate privacy leakage . however , we also introduce a new approach to semi-supervised-learning , hyperclique pattern_based semi-supervised-learning (hpsl) , which differs from traditional semi-supervised-learning approaches in that it considers the similarity among groups of objects instead of only pairs of objects . our experimental-results show that both the knn and hpsl methods have the ability to compromise database-security , although hpsl is better at this privacy violation than the knn method .
