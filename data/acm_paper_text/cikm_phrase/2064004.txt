coarse-to-fine-classification via parametric and nonparametric-models for computer-aided-diagnosis classification is one of the core problems in computer-aided-diagnosis (cad) , targeting for early cancer detection using 3d medical-imaging interpretation . high detection sensitivity with desirably low false positive (fp) rate is critical for a cad system to be accepted as a valuable or even indispensable tool in radiologists ' workflow . given various spurious imagery noises which cause observation uncertainties , this remains a very challenging task . in this paper , we propose a novel , two-tiered coarse-to-fine (ctf) classification cascade framework to tackle this problem . we first obtain classification-critical data samples (e.g. , implicit samples on the decision-boundary) extracted from the holistic data distributions using a robust parametric-model (e.g. , [13]) ; then we build a graph-embedding based nonparametric classifier on sampled data , which can more accurately preserve or formulate the complex classification boundary . these two steps can also be considered as effective `` sample pruning '' and `` feature pursuing + knn/template matching '' , respectively . our approach is validated comprehensively in colorectal polyp detection and lung-nodule detection cad-systems , as the top two deadly cancers , using hospital scale , multi-site clinical datasets . the results show that our method achieves overall better classification/detection performance than existing state-of-the-art algorithms using single-layer classifiers , such as the support-vector-machine variants [17] , boosting [15] , logistic-regression [11] , relevance-vector-machine [13] , k-nearest-neighbor [9] or spectral-projections on graph [2] .
