high-throughput filtering using fpga-acceleration with the rise in the amount information of being streamed across networks , there is a growing demand to vet the quality , type and content itself for various purposes such as spam , security and search . in this paper , we develop an energy-efficient high-performance information-filtering system that is capable of classifying a stream of incoming document at high-speed . the prototype parses a stream of documents using a multicore cpu and then performs classification using field-programmable-gate-arrays (fpgas) . on a large trec-data collection , we implemented a naive-bayes-classifier on our prototype and compared it to an optimized cpu based-baseline . our empirical-findings show that we can classify documents at 10gb/s which is up to 94 times faster than the cpu baseline (and up to 5 times faster than previous fpga_based implementations) . in future work , we aim to increase the throughput by another order of magnitude by implementing both the parser and filter on the fpga .
