improved query-difficulty-prediction for the-web query-performance-prediction aims to predict whether a query will have a high average-precision given retrieval from a particular collection , or low average-precision . an accurate estimator of the quality of search-engine-results can allow the search-engine to decide to which queries to apply query-expansion , for which queries to suggest alternative search-terms , to adjust the sponsored-results , or to return results from specialized collections . in this paper we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art query-prediction algorithms , both post-retrieval and pre-retrieval and we analyze their sensitivity towards the retrieval algorithm . we evaluate query-difficulty predictors over three widely different collections and query sets and present an analysis of why prediction algorithms perform significantly worse on web-data . finally we introduce improved clarity , and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art predictors on three standard collections , including two large web collections .
