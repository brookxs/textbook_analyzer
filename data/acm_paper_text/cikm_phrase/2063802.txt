continuously monitoring the correlations of massive discrete streams the problem of monitoring the correlations of discrete streams is to continuously monitor the temporal correlations among massive discrete streams . a temporal-correlation of two streams is defined as a tracking behavior , i.e. , the most recent pattern of one stream is very similar to a historical pattern of another stream . the challenge is that both the tracking stream and the tracked stream are evolving , which causes the frequent updates of the correlation-ships . the straightforward way of monitoring correlations by brute-force subsequence-matching will be very expensive for massive streams . we propose techniques that are able to significantly reduce the number of expensive subsequence-matching calls , by continuously pruning and refining the correlated streams . extensive experiments on the streaming trajectories show the significant performance-improvement achieved by the proposed algorithms .
