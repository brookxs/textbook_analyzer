unik : unsupervised social-network spam-detection social-network spam increases explosively with the rapid-development and wide usage of various social-networks on the internet . to timely detect spam in large social-network-sites , it is desirable to discover unsupervised schemes that can save the training cost of supervised schemes . in this work , we first show several limitations of existing unsupervised detection schemes . the main reason behind the limitations is that existing schemes heavily rely on spamming patterns that are constantly changing to avoid detection . motivated by our observations , we first propose a sybil defense_based spam-detection scheme sd2 that remarkably outperforms existing schemes by taking the social-network relationship into consideration . in order to make it highly robust in facing an increased level of spam attacks , we further design an unsupervised spam-detection scheme , called unik . instead of detecting spammers directly , unik works by deliberately removing non-spammers from the network , leveraging both the social-graph and the user-link graph . the underpinning of unik is that while spammers constantly change their patterns to evade detection , non-spammers do not have to do so and thus have a relatively non-volatile pattern . unik has comparable performance to sd2 when it is applied to a large social-network-site , and outperforms sd2 significantly when the level of spam attacks increases . based on detection results of unik , we further analyze several identified spam-campaigns in this social-network-site . the result shows that different spammer clusters demonstrate distinct characteristics , implying the volatility of spamming patterns and the ability of unik to automatically extract spam signatures .
