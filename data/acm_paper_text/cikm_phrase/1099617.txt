a latent-semantic-classification model latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) has been successfully applied to information-retrieval and text-classification . however , when lsi is used in classification , some important features for small classes may be ignored because of their small feature values . to solve this problem , we propose the latent-semantic-classification (lsc) model which extends the lsi model in the following way : the classification information of the training-documents is introduced into the latent-semantic structure via a second set of latent-variables , so that both indexing and classification information can be taken into account during the classification-process . our experiments on reuters show that our new model performs better than the existing classification-methods such as knn and svm .
