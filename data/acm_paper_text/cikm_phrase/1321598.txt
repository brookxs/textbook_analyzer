link-analysis using time-series of web-graphs link-analysis is a key technology in contemporary web-search-engines . most of the previous work on link-analysis only used information from one snapshot of web-graph . since commercial search engines crawl the-web periodically , they will naturally obtain time-series-data of web-graphs . the historical-information contained in the series of web-graphs can be used to improve the performance of link-analysis . in this paper , we argue that page-importance should be a dynamic quantity , and propose defining page-importance as a function of both pagerank of the current web graph and accumulated historical page-importance from previous web-graphs . specifically , a novel algorithm named temporalrank is designed to compute the proposed page-importance . we try to use a kinetic model to interpret this page-importance and show that it can be regarded as the solution to an ordinary-differential-equation . experiments on link-analysis using web-graph data in five snapshots show that the proposed algorithm can outperform pagerank in many measures , and can effectively filter out newly appeared link-spam websites .
