a semi-supervised hybrid-system to enhance the recommendation of channels in terms of campaign roi in domains such as marketing , advertising or even human-resources (sourcing) , decision-makers have to choose the most suitable channels according to their objectives when starting a campaign . in this paper , three recommender-systems providing-channel (`` user '') ranking for a given campaign (`` item '') are introduced . this work refers exclusively to the new-item-problem , which is still a challenging topic in the literature . the first two systems are standard content-based-recommendation approaches , with different rating-estimation techniques (model-based vs heuristic-based) . to overcome the lacks of previous approaches , we introduce a new hybrid-system using a supervised similarity based on pls components . algorithms are compared in a case-study : purpose is to predict the ranking of job boards (job search web-sites) in terms of roi (return-on-investment) per job posting . in this application , the semi-supervised hybrid-system outperforms standard approaches .
