estimating the number of answers with guarantees for structured-queries in p2p databases structured-p2p overlays supporting standard database functionalities are a popular choice for building large-scale distributed data-management-systems . in such systems , estimating the number of answers for structured-queries can help approximating query-completeness , but is especially challenging . in this paper , we propose to use routing graphs in order to achieve this . we introduce the general approach and briefly discuss further aspects like overhead and guarantees .
