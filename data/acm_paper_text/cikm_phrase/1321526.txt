finding dense and isolated submarkets in a sponsored-search spending graph methods for improving sponsored-search revenue are often tested or deployed within a small submarket of the larger marketplace . for many applications , the ideal submarket contains a small number of nodes , a large amount of spending within the submarket , and a small amount of spending leaving the submarket . we introduce an efficient-algorithm for finding submarkets that are optimal for a user-specified tradeoff between these three quantities . we apply our algorithm to find submarkets that are both dense and isolated in a large spending graph from yahoo! sponsored-search .
