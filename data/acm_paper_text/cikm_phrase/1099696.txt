word-sense-disambiguation in queries this paper presents a new approach to determine the senses of words in queries by using wordnet . in our approach , noun-phrases in a query are determined first . for each word in the query , information associated with it , including its synonyms , hyponyms , hypernyms , definitions of its synonyms and hyponyms , and its domains , can be used for word-sense-disambiguation . by comparing these pieces of information associated with the words which form a phrase , it may be possible to assign senses to these words . if the above disambiguation fails , then other query words , if exist , are used , by going through exactly the same process . if the sense of a query word can not be determined in this manner , then a guess of the sense of the word is made , if the guess has at least 50 \ % chance of being correct . if no sense of the word has 50 \ % or higher chance of being used , then we apply a web-search to assist in the word-sense-disambiguation process . experimental-results show that our approach has 100 \ % applicability and 90 \ % accuracy on the most recent robust track of trec collection of 250 queries . we combine this disambiguation-algorithm to our retrieval-system to examine the effect of word-sense-disambiguation in text-retrieval . experimental-results show that the disambiguation-algorithm together with other components of our retrieval-system yield a result which is 13.7 \ % above that produced by the same system but without the disambiguation , and 9.2 \ % above that produced by using lesk 's algorithm . our retrieval-effectiveness is 7 \ % better than the best reported result in the literature .
