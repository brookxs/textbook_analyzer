a linear-time approximation of the earth mover 's distance color descriptors are one of the important features used in content-based-image-retrieval . the dominant-color descriptor (dcd) represents a few perceptually dominant colors in an image through color-quantization . for image-retrieval based on dcd , the earth mover 's distance and the optimal color composition distance are proposed to measure the dissimilarity between two images . although providing good retrieval results , both methods are too time-consuming to be used in a large image database . to solve the problem , we propose a new distance-function that calculates an approximate earth mover 's distance in linear-time . to calculate the dissimilarity in linear-time , the proposed approach employs the space-filling curve for multidimensional color-space . to improve the accuracy , the proposed approach uses multiple curves and adjusts the color positions . as a result , our approach achieves order-of-magnitude time improvement but incurs small errors . we have performed extensive experiments to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach . the results reveal that our approach achieves almost the same results with the emd in linear-time .
