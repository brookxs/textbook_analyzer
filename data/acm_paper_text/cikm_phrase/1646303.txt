m-cope : a multiple continuous-query-processing engine a data-stream-management-system (dsms) should support an efficient evaluation-scheme for long-running continuous-queries over infinite data streams . this demonstration presents a scalable query processing engine , m-cope (multiple continuous-query-processing engine) developed to evaluate multiple continuous-queries efficiently . a multiple-query-optimization scheme implemented in the system generates a single network of operations as an execution-plan for registered queries in order to maximize the reuse of the intermediate results of common sub-expressions in the queries adaptively . in this paper , we describe the overall architecture of m-cope along with its special features . network-traffic flow streams are used to demonstrate the main features of m-cope .
