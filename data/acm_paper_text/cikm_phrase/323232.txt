information-integration with attribution support for corporate profiles the proliferation of electronically available data within large organizations as well as publicly available data (e.g. over the world-wide-web) poses challenges for users who wish to efficiently interact with and integrate multiple heterogeneous sources . this paper presents ci 3 , a corporate information integrator , which applies xml as a tool to facilitate data-mediation and integration amongst heterogeneous-sources in the context of financial analysts creating corporate profiles . sources include lotus-notes , relational-databases , and the world-wide-web . ci 3 applies a unified xml-data model to automate integration . by preserving metadata about the source of each datum in the integrated result-set , ci 3 supports source attribution . users may trace the attribution metadata from the result back to the underlying sources and leverage their expertise in interpreting the data and , if necessary , use their judgment in assessing the authenticity and veracity of results . we present a functional overview of ci 3 , its system-architecture including the xml-data model , and the integration procedures . we conclude by reflecting on lessons-learned .
