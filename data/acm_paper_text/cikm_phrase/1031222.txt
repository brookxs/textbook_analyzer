mrssa : an iterative-algorithm for similarity-spreading over interrelated objects we introduce the multiple relationship similarity-spreading algorithm (mrssa) to enhance ir effectiveness . this method has similarity computed in an iterative `` spreading '' fashion for multiple object types , combining both inter - and intra-object relationships . we demonstrate the value of this approach in the context of the www , where the key objects are web-pages and queries , relationships considered are derived from hyperlinks (in - and out-links) and click-through logs .
