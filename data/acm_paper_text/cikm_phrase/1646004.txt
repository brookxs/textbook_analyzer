generating comparative summaries of contradictory opinions in text this paper presents a study of a novel summarization-problem called contrastive opinion-summarization (cos) . given two sets of positively and negatively opinionated sentences which are often the output of an existing opinion summarizer , cos aims to extract comparable-sentences from each set of opinions and generate a comparative-summary containing a set of contrastive sentence pairs . we formally formulate the problem as an optimization-problem and propose two general methods for generating a comparative-summary using the framework , both of which rely on measuring the content-similarity and contrastive similarity of two sentences . we study several strategies to compute these two similarities . we also create a test-data-set for evaluating such a novel summarization-problem . experiment results on this test-set show that the proposed methods are effective for generating comparative summaries of contradictory opinions .
