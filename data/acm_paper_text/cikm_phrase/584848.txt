on arabic search : improving the retrieval-effectiveness via a light-stemming approach the inflectional structure of a word impacts the retrieval-accuracy of information-retrieval-systems of latin-based languages . we present two stemming algorithms for arabic-information-retrieval systems . we empirically investigate the effectiveness of surface-based retrieval . this approach degrades retrieval-precision since arabic is a highly inflected language . accordingly , we propose root-based retrieval . we notice a statistically significant improvement over the surface-based approach . many variant word-senses are based on an identical root ; thus , the root-based algorithm creates invalid conflation classes that result in an ambiguous-query which degrades the performance by adding extraneous terms . to resolve ambiguity , we propose a novel light-stemming-algorithm for arabic texts . this automatic rule-based stemming algorithm is not as aggressive as the root-extraction algorithm . we show that the light-stemming algorithm significantly outperforms the root-based algorithm . we also show that a significant improvement in retrieval-precision can be achieved with light inflectional analysis of arabic words .
