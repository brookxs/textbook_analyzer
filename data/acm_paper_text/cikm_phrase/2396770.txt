meet : a generalized framework for reciprocal recommender-systems reciprocal recommender-systems refer to systems from which users can obtain recommendations of other individuals by satisfying preferences of both parties being involved . different from the traditional user-item recommendation , reciprocal recommenders focus on the preferences of both parties simultaneously , as well as some special properties in terms of `` reciprocal '' . in this paper , we propose meet -- a generalized framework for reciprocal recommendation , in which we model the correlations of users as a bipartite-graph that maintains both local and global `` reciprocal '' utilities . the local utility captures users ' mutual preferences , whereas the global utility manages the overall quality of the entire reciprocal network . extensive empirical-evaluation on two real-world-data sets (online-dating and online recruiting) demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared with existing recommendation-algorithms . our analysis also provides deep insights into the special aspects of reciprocal recommenders that differentiate them from user-item recommender-systems .
