knowing a web-page by the company it keeps web-page-classification is important to many tasks in information-retrieval and web-mining . however , applying traditional textual classifiers on web-data often produces unsatisfying results . fortunately , hyperlink information provides important clues to the categorization of a web-page . in this paper , an improved method is proposed to enhance web-page-classification by utilizing the class-information from neighboring pages in the link-graph . the categories represented by four kinds of neighbors (parents , children , siblings and spouses) are combined to help with the page in question . in experiments to study the effect of these factors on our algorithm , we find that the method proposed is able to boost the classification-accuracy of common textual classifiers from around 70 \ % to more than 90 \ % on a large dataset of pages from the open-directory-project , and outperforms existing algorithms . unlike prior techniques , our approach utilizes same-host links and can improve classification-accuracy even when neighboring pages are unlabeled . finally , while all neighbor types can contribute , sibling pages are found to be the most important .
