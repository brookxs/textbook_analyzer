compression-schemes for differential categorical stream-clustering stream-data analysis differs significantly from traditional data-processing . to process the data online the algorithm has to work in one pass , incorporating new data into a model maintained in main-memory . storing a model or synopsis of processed data in the memory , which we call `` data-compression '' , is an important technique in both incremental and differential stream-mining . this paper proposes several data-compression schemes in one-pass categorical-data clustering , and demonstrates their performance on synthetic and real-data . our compression-schemes can efficiently generate compact representations of original data , so as to enable the algorithm to process streams at high-speed and detect the changes in underlying data . the example algorithm based on these compression-schemes achieves good accuracy in short execution-time .
