conkar : constraint keyword-based-association-discovery in many domains , such as bioinformatics , cheminformatics , health-informatics and social-networks , data can be represented naturally as labeled graphs . to address the increasing needs in discovering interesting associations between entities in such data-graphs , especially under complicated keyword-based and structural constraints , we introduce conkar (constrained keyword-based-association-discovery) system . conkar is the first system for discovering constrained acyclic paths (cap) in graph-data under keyword-based constraints , with the highlight being the set of quantitative constraint metrics that we proposed , including coverage and relevance . we will demonstrate the key features of conkar : powerful and userfriendly query-specification , efficient-query-evaluation , flexible and on-demand result-ranking , visual result display , as well as an insight tour on our novel cap query-evaluation algorithms .
