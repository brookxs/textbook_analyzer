internet-scale string attribute publish/subscribe data networks with this work we aim to make a three-fold contribution . we first address the issue of supporting efficiently queries over string-attributes involving prefix , suffix , containment , and equality operators in large-scale-data networks . our first design-decision is to employ distributed-hash-tables (dhts) for the data network 's topology , harnessing their desirable properties . our next design-decision is to derive dht-independent solutions , treating dht as a black-box . second , we exploit this infrastructure to develop efficient content-based publish/subscribe-systems . the main contribution here are algorithms for the efficient processing of queries (subscriptions) and events (publications) . specifically , we show that our subscription processing-algorithms require o (logn) messages for a n-node network , and our event-processing algorithms require o (l x logn) messages (with l being the average-string-length) . third , we develop algorithms for optimizing the processing of multi-dimensional events , involving several string attributes . further to our analysis , we provide simulation-based experiments showing promising performance-results in terms of number of messages , required bandwidth , load-balancing , and response-times .
