adapting vector-space-model to ranking-based collaborative-filtering collaborative-filtering (cf) is an effective technique addressing the information-overload problem . recently ranking-based cf methods have shown advantages in recommendation-accuracy , being able to capture the preference similarity between users even if their rating scores differ significantly . in this study , we seek accuracy improvement of ranking-based cf through adaptation of the vector-space-model , where we consider each user as a document and her pairwise relative preferences as terms . we then use a novel degree-specialty weighting-scheme resembling tf-idf to weight the terms . then we use cosine-similarity to select a neighborhood of users for the target user to make recommendations . experiments on benchmarks in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the promise of our approach .
