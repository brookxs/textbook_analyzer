a study of selective collection-enrichment for enterprise-search enterprise intranets are often sparse in nature , with limited use of alternative lexical representations between authors , making query-expansion (qe) ineffective . hence , for some enterprise-search queries , it can be advantageous to instead use the well-known collection-enrichment (ce) method to gather higher quality pseudo-feedback documents from a more diverse external resource . however , it is not always clear for which queries the collection-enrichment technique should be applied . in this paper , we study two different approaches , namely a predictor-based approach and a divergence-based approach , to decide on when to apply ce . we thoroughly evaluate both approaches on the trec enterprise track cerc test-collection and its corresponding topic sets , in combination with three different external resources and nine different query-performance predictors . our results show that both approaches are effective to selectively apply ce for enterprise-search . in particular , the divergence-based approach leads to consistent and marked retrieval improvements over the systematic application of qe or ce on all external resources .
