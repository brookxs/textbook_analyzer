a summarization tool for time-sensitive social-media searching social-content in general and microblogs (aka tweets) in particular has been basic and limited , especially for time-sensitive topics . the currently implemented microblog search on sites such as twitter is based on simple word-matching and retrieves the most recent microblogs that match a given query . furthermore , a user may obtain hundreds or perhaps thousands of microblogs in response to a given query , leading to information-overload . we present a new multidimensional microblog search-tool that generates a comprehensive report from microblogs instead of a flat list of recent/relevant microblogs for a given query . reports may include tag-clouds , topic time-series , and most popular and funny microblogs , etc. . the tool can be configured for monitoring time-sensitive topics using a set of predefined queries . we demonstrate our system on arabic and english microblog collections . additionally , we show a special configuration of the system for monitoring the 2012 egyptian presidential elections .
