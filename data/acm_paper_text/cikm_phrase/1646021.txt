event-detection from flickr data through wavelet-based spatial-analysis detecting events from web-resources has attracted increasing research interests in recent years . our focus in this paper is to detect events from photos on flickr , an internet-image community website . the results can be used to facilitate user searching and browsing photos by events . the problem is challenging considering : (1) flickr data is noisy , because there are photos unrelated to real-world events ; (2) it is not easy to capture the content of photos . this paper presents our effort in detecting events from flickr photos by exploiting the tags supplied by users to annotate photos . in particular , the temporal and locational distributions of tag usage are analyzed in the first place , where a wavelet-transform is employed to suppress noise . then , we identify tags related with events , and further distinguish between tags of aperiodic events and those of periodic events . afterwards , event-related tags are clustered such that each cluster , representing an event , consists of tags with similar temporal and locational distribution-patterns as well as with similar associated photos . finally , for each tag cluster , photos corresponding to the represented event are extracted . we evaluate the performance of our approach using a set of real-data collected from flickr . the experimental-results demonstrate that our approach is effective in detecting events from the flickr photo-collection .
