learning ontology resolution for document-representation and its-applications in text-mining it is well known that synonymous and polysemous terms often bring in some noises when calculating the similarity between documents . existing ontology-based document-representation methods are static , hence , the chosen semantic-concept set for representing a document has a fixed resolution and it is not adaptable to the characteristics of a document-collection and the text-mining problem in hand . we propose an adaptive-concept-resolution (acr) model to overcome this issue . acr can learn a concept border from an ontology taking into consideration of the characteristics of a particular document-collection . then this border can provide a tailor-made semantic-concept representation for a document coming from the same domain . another advantage of acr is that it is applicable in both classification-task where the groups are given in the training-document set , and clustering task where no group information is available . furthermore , the result of this model is not sensitive to the model-parameter . the experimental-results show that acr outperforms an existing static method significantly .
