multi-view-random-walk framework for search-task discovery from click-through log search-engine users often have clear search-tasks hidden behind their queries . inspired by this , the modern search-engines are providing an increasing number of services to help users simplify their key tasks . however , the problem of what are the major user-search tasks with high traffic for which search-engines should design special services is still underexplored . in this paper , we propose a novel multi-view-random-walk (mrw) algorithm to measure the search-task oriented similarity between queries , and then group-search queries with similar tasks so that the major search-tasks of users can be identified from search-engine click-through log . the proposed mrw , which is a general-framework to combine knowledge from different views in a random-walk process , allows the random surfer to walk across different views to integrate information for search-task discovery . experimental-results on click-through log of a commonly used commercial-search-engine show that our proposed mrw algorithm can effectively discover user-search tasks .
