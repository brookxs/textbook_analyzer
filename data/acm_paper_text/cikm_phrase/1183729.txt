amnesic online synopses for moving-objects we present a hierarchical-tree structure for online-maintenance of time-decaying synopses over streaming-data . we exemplify such an amnesic behavior over streams of locations taken from numerous moving-objects in order to obtain reliable trajectory approximations as well as affordable estimates regarding distinct count spatiotemporal-queries .
