anonymizing data with quasi-sensitive attribute values we study the problem of anonymizing data with quasi-sensitive-attributes . quasi-sensitive-attributes are not sensitive by themselves , but certain values or their combinations may be linked to external-knowledge to reveal indirect sensitive-information of an individual . we formalize the notion of l-diversity and t-closeness for quasi-sensitive-attributes , which we call qs l-diversity and qs t-closeness , to prevent indirect sensitive attribute disclosure . we propose a two-phase anonymization algorithm that combines quasi-identifying value generalization and quasi-sensitive value suppression to achieve qs l-diversity and qs t-closeness .
