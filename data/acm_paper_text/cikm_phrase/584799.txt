mining-sequential-patterns with constraints in large-databases constraints are essential for many sequential-pattern-mining applications . however , there is no systematic study on constraint-based sequential-pattern-mining . in this paper , we investigate this issue and point out that the framework developed for constrained frequent-pattern mining does not fit our missions well . an extended framework is developed based on a sequential-pattern growth methodology . our study shows that constraints can be effectively and efficiently pushed deep into sequential-pattern-mining under this new framework . moreover , this framework can be extended to constraint-based structured pattern-mining as well .
