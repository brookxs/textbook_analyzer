one size does not fit all : multi-granularity search of web-forums users rely increasingly on online-forums , blogs , and mailing-lists to exchange information , practical tips , and stories . although this type of social-interaction has become central to our daily lives and decision-making-processes , forums are surprisingly technologically poor : often there is no choice but to browse through massive numbers of posts while looking for specific information . a critical challenge then for forum-search is to provide results that are as complete as possible and that do not miss some relevant-information but that are not too broad . in this paper , we address the problem of presenting textual-search results in a concise manner to answer user-needs . specifically , we propose a new search approach over free-form text in forums that allows for the search-results to be returned at varying granularity-levels . we implement a novel hierarchical-representation and scoring technique for objects at multiple granularities , taking into account the inherent containment relationship provided by the hierarchy . we also present a score optimization-algorithm that efficiently chooses the best k-sized result-set while ensuring no overlap between the results . we evaluate the effectiveness of multi-granularity search by conducting extensive user-studies and show that a mixed granularity set of results is more relevant to users than standard post-only approaches .
