the use of categorization information in language-models for question-retrieval community-question-answering (cqa) has emerged as a popular type of service meeting a wide range of information-needs . such services enable users to ask and answer questions and to access existing question-answer pairs . cqa archives contain very-large volumes of valuable user-generated-content and have become important information-resources on the web . to make the body-of-knowledge accumulated in cqa archives accessible , effective and efficient question-search is required . question-search in a cqa archive aims to retrieve historical questions that are relevant to new questions posed by users . this paper proposes a category-based framework for search in cqa archives . the framework embodies several new techniques that use language-models to exploit categories of questions for improving question-answer search . experiments conducted on real-data from yahoo!-answers demonstrate that the proposed techniques are effective and efficient and are capable of outperforming baseline methods significantly .
