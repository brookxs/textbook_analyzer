closure maintenance in an object-oriented query model an object-algebra is presented as a formal query model for object-oriented data models . the algebra serves not only to access and manipulate the structure and behavior of objects , but it also supports the creation of new objects and the introduction of new relationships into the schema . it provides a more powerful and flexible tool than messages for effectively dealing with complex situations and meeting associative access requirements . operands as well as the results of operations in the proposed algebra are formally characterized as a pair of sets a set of objects capturing the states and a set of message expressions comprised of sequences of messages modeling the object-behavior . the closure property is achieved in a natural way by letting the results of operations possess the same characteristics as the operands in an algebra expression . some operators of the algebra resemble those of the relational-algebra but with different syntax-and-semantics . additional operators are introduced to complement them . a class is shown to posses the properties of an operand by defining a set of objects and deriving a set of message expressions for it . furthermore , the result of an object-algebra-expression is shown to have the characteristics of a class whose superclass/subclass relationships with its operand class (es) can be established providing a mechanism to properly and persistently place it in the class lattice (schema) .
