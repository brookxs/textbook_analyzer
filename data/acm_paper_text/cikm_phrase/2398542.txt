recommending citations : translating papers into references when we write or prepare to write a research-paper , we always have appropriate references in mind . however , there are most likely references we have missed and should have been read and cited . as such a good citation-recommendation system would not only improve our paper but , overall , the efficiency and quality of literature-search . usually , a citation 's context contains explicit words explaining the citation . using this , we propose a method that `` translates '' research papers into references . by considering the citations and their contexts from existing papers as parallel data written in two different `` languages '' , we adopt the translation-model to create a relationship between these two `` vocabularies '' . experiments on both citeseer and citeulike dataset show that our approach outperforms other baseline methods and increase the precision , recall and f-measure by at least 5 % to 10 % , respectively . in addition , our approach runs much faster in the both training and recommending stage , which proves the effectiveness and the scalability of our work .
