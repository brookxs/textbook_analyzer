learning-to-rank results in relational-keyword-search keyword-search within databases has become a hot topic within the research-community as databases store increasing amounts of information . users require an effective method to retrieve information from these databases without learning complex-query languages (viz . sql) . despite the recent research interest , performance and search-effectiveness have not received equal attention , and scoring-functions in particular have become increasingly complex while providing only modest benefits with regards to the quality of search-results . an analysis of the factors appearing in existing scoring-functions suggests that some factors previously deemed critical to search-effectiveness are at best loosely correlated with relevance . we consider a number of these different scoring factors and use machine-learning to create a new scoring-function that provides significantly better results than existing approaches . we simplify our scoring-function by systematically removing the factors with the lowest weight and show that this version still outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in this area .
