acquiring temporal-constraints between relations we consider the problem of automatically acquiring knowledge about the typical temporal orderings among relations (e.g. , actedin (person , film) typically occurs before wonprize (film , award)) , given only a database of known facts (relation instances) without time information , and a large-document-collection . our approach is based on the conjecture that the narrative order of verb mentions within documents correlates with the temporal-order of the relations they represent . we propose a family of algorithms based on this conjecture , utilizing a corpus of 890m dependency parsed sentences to obtain verbs that represent relations of interest , and utilizing wikipedia documents to gather statistics on narrative order of verb mentions . our proposed algorithm , graphorder , is a novel and scalable graph-based label-propagation algorithm that takes transitivity of temporal-order into account , as well as these statistics on narrative order of verb mentions . this algorithm achieves as high as 38.4 % absolute improvement in f1 over a random baseline . finally , we demonstrate the utility of this learned general knowledge about typical temporal orderings among relations , by showing that these temporal-constraints can be successfully used by a joint-inference framework to assign specific temporal scopes to individual facts .
