content-based-filtering for efficient online materialized-view-maintenance real-time materialized-view-maintenance has become increasingly popular , especially in real-time-data-warehousing and data-streaming environments . upon updates to base-relations , maintaining the corresponding materialized-views can bring a heavy burden to the rdbms . a traditional method to mitigate this problem is to use the where clause condition in the materialized-view definition to detect whether an update to a base relation is relevant and can affect the materialized-view . however , this detection-method does not consider the content in the base-relations and hence misses a large number of filtering opportunities . in this paper , we propose a content-based method for detecting irrelevant updates to base-relations of a materialized-view . at the cost of using more space , this method increases the probability of catching irrelevant updates by judiciously designing filtering relations to capture the content in the base-relations . based on the content-based method , a prototype real-time-data-warehouse has been implemented on top of ibm 's system-s using ibm db2 . using an analytical-model and our prototype , we show that the content-based method can catch most (or all) irrelevant updates to base-relations that are missed by the traditional method . thus , when the fraction of irrelevant updates is non-negligible , the load on the rdbms due to materialized-view-maintenance can be significantly reduced .
