towards an effective and unbiased ranking of scientific-literature through mutual-reinforcement it is important to help researchers find valuable scientific papers from a large literature collection containing information of authors , papers and venues . graph-based-algorithms have been proposed to rank papers based on networks formed by citation and co-author relationships . this paper proposes a new graph-based-ranking framework mutualrank that integrates mutual-reinforcement relationships among networks of papers , researchers and venues to achieve a more synthetic , accurate and fair ranking result than previous graph-based methods . mutualrank leverages the network-structure information among papers , authors , and their venues available from a literature collection dataset and sets up a unified mutual-reinforcement model that involves both intra - and inter-network information for ranking papers , authors and venues simultaneously . to evaluate , we collect a set of recommended papers from websites of graduate-level computational-linguistics courses of 15 top universities as the benchmark and apply different methods to estimate paper importance . the results show that mutualrank greatly outperforms the competitors including pag-erank , hits and corank in ranking papers as well as researchers . the experimental-results also demonstrate that venues ranked by mutualrank are reasonable .
