simd-based decoding of posting lists powerful simd-instructions in modern processors offer an opportunity for greater search-performance . in this paper , we apply these instructions to decoding search-engine posting lists . we start by exploring variable-length-integer-encoding formats used to represent postings . we define two properties , byte-oriented and byte-preserving , that characterize many formats of interest . based on their common structure , we define a taxonomy that classifies encodings along three-dimensions , representing the way in which data bits are stored and additional bits are used to describe the data . using this taxonomy , we discover new encoding formats , some of which are particularly amenable to simd-based decoding . we present generic simd algorithms for decoding these formats . we also extend these algorithms to the most common traditional encoding format . our experiments demonstrate that simd-based decoding-algorithms are up to 3 times faster than non-simd algorithms .
