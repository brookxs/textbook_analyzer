texplorer : keyword-based object-search and exploration in multidimensional text-databases we propose a novel system texplorer that integrates keyword-based object-ranking with the aggregation and exploration power of olap in a text-database with rich structured attributes available , e.g. , a product-review database . texplorer can be implemented within a multi-dimensional text-database , where each row is associated with structural dimensions (attributes) and text-data (e.g. , a document) . the system utilizes the text cube data-model , where a cell aggregates a set of documents with matching values in a subset of dimensions . cells in a text cube capture different levels of summarization of the documents , and can represent objects at different conceptual levels . users query the system by submitting a set of keywords . instead of returning a ranked list of all the cells , we propose a keyword-based interactive-exploration framework that could offer flexible olap navigational guides and help users identify the levels and objects they are interested in . a novel significance measure of dimensions is proposed based on the distribution of ir relevance of cells . during each interaction stage , dimensions are ranked according to their significance scores to guide drilling down ; and cells in the same cuboids are ranked according to their relevance to guide exploration . we propose efficient-algorithms and materialization strategies for ranking top-k dimensions and cells . finally , extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our approach .
