predicting document effectiveness in pseudo-relevance-feedback pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) is one of effective practices in information-retrieval . in particular , prf via the relevance-model (rm) has been widely used due to the theoretical soundness and effectiveness . in a prf scenario , an underlying relevance-model is inferred by combining language-models of the top retrieved documents where the contribution of each document is assumed to be proportional to its score for the initial query . however , it is not clear that selecting the top retrieved documents only by the initial retrieval scores is actually the optimal way for query-expansion . we show that the initial score of a document is not a good indicator of its effectiveness in query expansion . our experiments show that if we can estimate the true effectiveness of the top retrieved documents , we can obtain almost 50 \ % improvement over rm . based on this observation , we introduce various document features that can be used to estimate the effectiveness of documents . our experiments on the trec robust collection show that the proposed features make good predictors , and prf using the effectiveness predictors can achieve statistically significant improvements over rm .
