how fresh do you want your search-results ? researchers have recognized the importance of utilizing temporal-features for improving the performance of information-retrieval-systems . specifically , the timeliness of a web-document can be a significant factor for determining whether it is relevant for a search-query . previous works have proposed time-aware retrieval-models with particular focus on news-queries , where recent web-documents related with a real-world event are generally preferable . these queries typically exhibit bursts in the volume of published documents or submitted queries . however , no work has studied the role of time in queries such as `` credit-card overdraft fees '' that have no major spikes in either document or query volumes over time , yet they still favor more recently published documents . in this work , we focus on this class of queries that we refer to as `` timely queries '' . we show that the change in the terms distribution of results of timely queries over time is strongly correlated with the users ' perception-of-time sensitivity . based on this observation , we propose a method to estimate the query timeliness requirements and we propose principled ways to incorporate document freshness into the ranking-model . our study shows that our method yields a more accurate estimation of timeliness compared to volume-based approaches . we experimentally compare our ranking strategy with other time-sensitive and non time-sensitive-ranking algorithms and we show that it improves the results ' retrieval quality for timely queries .
