modeling reformulation using passage-analysis query-reformulation modifies the original query with the aim of better matching the vocabulary of the relevant documents , and consequently improving ranking effectiveness . previous techniques typically generate words and phrases related to the original query , but do not consider how these words and phrases would fit together in new queries . in this paper , we focus on an implementation of an approach that models reformulation as a distribution of queries , where each query is a variation of the original query . this approach considers a query as a basic unit and can capture important dependencies between words and phrases in the query . the implementation discussed here is based on passage-analysis of the target corpus . experiments on the trec collection show that the proposed model for query-reformulation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods .
