fast-query expansion using approximations of relevance-models pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) improves search-quality by expanding the query using terms from high-ranking documents from an initial retrieval . although prf can often result in large gains in effectiveness , running two queries is time consuming , limiting its applicability . we describe a prf method that uses corpus pre-processing to achieve query-time speeds that are near those of the original queries . specifically , relevance-modeling , a language-modeling_based prf method , can be recast to benefit substantially from finding pairwise document-relationships in advance . using the resulting fast relevance-model (fastrm) , we substantially reduce the online retrieval-time and still benefit from expansion . we further explore methods for reducing the preprocessing time and storage requirements of the approach , allowing us to achieve up to a 10 \ % increase in map over unexpanded retrieval , vwhile only requiring 1 \ % of the time of standard expansion .
