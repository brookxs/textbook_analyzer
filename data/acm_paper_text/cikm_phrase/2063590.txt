unsupervised transactional-query classification based on webpage form understanding query-type-classification aims to classify search queries into categories like navigational , informational and transactional , etc. , according to the type of information-need behind the queries . although this problem has drawn many research attentions , previous methods usually require editors to label queries as training-data or need domain-knowledge to edit rules for predicting query type . also , the existing work has been mainly focusing on the classification of informational and navigational-query types . transactional-query classification has not been well addressed . in this work , we propose an unsupervised-approach for transactional-query classification . this method is based on the observation that , after the transactional queries are issued to a search-engine , many users will click the search result pages and then have interactions with web-forms on these pages . the interactions , e.g. , typing in text box , making selections from dropdown list , clicking on a button to execute actions , are used to specify detailed information of the transaction . by mining toolbar search-log data , which records the associations between queries and web-forms clicked by users , we can get a set of good quality transactional queries without using manual labeling efforts . by matching these automatically acquired transactional queries and their associated web-form contents , we can generalize these queries into patterns . these patterns can be used to classify queries which are not covered by search-log . our experiments indicate that transactional queries produced by this method have good quality . the pattern_based classifier achieves 83 \ % f1 classification result . this is very effective considering the fact that we do not adopt any labeling efforts to train the classifier .
