temporal-dynamics and information retrieval many digital-resources , like the-web , are dynamic and ever-changing collections of information . however , most of the tools information-retrieval and management that have been developed for interacting with web-content , such as browsers and search-engines , focus on a single static snapshot of the information . in this talk , i will present analyses of how web-content changes over time , how people re-visit web-pages over time , and how re-visitation patterns are influenced by changes in user-intent and content . these results have implications for many aspects of information-retrieval and management including crawling , ranking and information-extraction algorithms , result-presentation , and evaluation . i will describe a prototype-system that supports people in understanding how the information they interact with changes over time , and a new retrieval-model that incorporates features about the temporal-evolution of content to improve core ranking . finally , i will conclude with an overview of some general challenges that need to be addressed to fully incorporate temporal-dynamics in information-retrieval and information-management-systems .
