patent query-reduction using pseudo-relevance-feedback queries in patent-prior-art-search are full patent applications and much longer than standard ad-hoc search and web-search topics . standard information-retrieval (ir) techniques are not entirely effective for patent-prior-art-search because of ambiguous terms in these massive queries . reducing patent queries by extracting key terms has been shown to be ineffective mainly because it is not clear what the focus of the query is . an optimal query-reduction algorithm must thus seek to retain the useful terms for retrieval favouring recall of relevant patents , but remove terms which impair ir effectiveness . we propose a new query-reduction technique decomposing a patent application into constituent text-segments and computing the language-modeling (lm) similarities by calculating the probability of generating each segment from the top ranked documents . we reduce a patent query by removing the least similar segments from the query , hypothesising that removal of these segments can increase the precision of retrieval , while still retaining the useful context to achieve high recall . experiments on the patent-prior-art-search collection clef-ip 2010 show that the proposed method outperforms standard pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) and a naive method of query-reduction based on removal of unit frequency terms (ufts) .
