the real-time nature and value of homeland-security information ensuring the security of our homeland depends in large measure on two quite distinct factors : having the knowledge necessary to prevent , predict , prepare for , or respond , if necessary , to any manner of terrorist attack or a natural or manmade disaster and collaborating or sharing-knowledge with a broad range of international , federal , state , local , and tribal agencies , as well as other private or public organizations . the essential problem with adequately addressing these factors , despite the many advancements made in the past decade , is twofold . first , it is not so much the mass but rather the diffuse nature and complexity of the data , information , and knowledge required for understanding terrorism and accounting for the manifold consequences of disasters that make possession of the right knowledge difficult . and , second , that diffuseness and complexity is magnified by the extreme diversity and wide-distribution of the many potential homeland-security collaborators . retrospective-analysis , and even knowledge-discovery , is less useful under these conditions than prospective , real-time-synthesis of information for multiple-users . also , privacy is as important as , if not more important than , security . this suggests that database designs and techniques for information-retrieval , and knowledge-management must take advantage of such technologies as semantic-nets , visualization , and discrete-mathematics to build knowledge-systems capable for homeland-security-applications .
