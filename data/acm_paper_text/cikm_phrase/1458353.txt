measuring user-preference changes in digital-libraries much research has been conducted using web-access logs to study implicit-user-feedback and infer user-preferences from clickstreams . however , little research measures the changes of user-preferences of ranking documents over time . we present a study that measures the changes of user-preferences based on an analysis of access logs of a large-scale digital-library over one year . a metric based on the accuracy of predicting future user actions is proposed . the results show that although user-preferences change over time , the majority of user actions should be predictable from previous browsing-behavior in the digital-library .
