modeling document features for expert-finding we argue that expert-finding is sensitive to multiple document features in an organization , and therefore , can benefit from the incorporation of these document features . we propose a unified language-model , which integrates multiple document features , namely , multiple levels of associations , pagerank , indegree , internal document-structure , and url length . our experiments on two trec enterprise track collections , i.e. , the w3c and csiro datasets , demonstrate that the natures of the two organizational intranets and two types of expert-finding tasks , i.e. , key contact finding for csiro and knowledgeable person finding for w3c , influence the effectiveness of different document features . our work provides insights into which document features work for certain types of expert-finding tasks , and helps design expert-finding strategies that are effective for different scenarios .
