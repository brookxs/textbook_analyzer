ensembles in adversarial-classification for spam the standard method for combating spam , either in email or on the web , is to train a classifier on manually labeled-instances . as the spammers change their tactics , the performance of such classifiers tends to decrease over time . gathering and labeling more data to periodically retrain the classifier is expensive . we present a method based on an ensemble-of-classifiers that can detect when its performance might be degrading and retrain itself , all without manual-intervention . experiments with a real-world dataset from the blog domain show that our methods can significantly reduce the number of times classifiers are retrained when compared to a fixed retraining schedule , and they maintain classification-accuracy even in the absence of manually labeled examples .
