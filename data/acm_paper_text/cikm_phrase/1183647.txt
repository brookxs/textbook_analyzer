3dstring : a feature string-kernel for 3d-object-classification on voxelized data-classification of 3d-objects remains an important task in many areas of data-management such as engineering , medicine or biology . as a common preprocessing step in current approaches to classification of voxelized 3d-objects , voxel-representations are transformed into a feature-vector description.in this article , we introduce an approach of transforming 3d-objects into feature strings which represent the distribution of voxels over the voxel grid . attractively , this feature string extraction can be performed in linear runtime with respect to the number of voxels . we define a similarity-measure on these feature strings that counts common k-mers in two input strings , which is referred to as the spectrum-kernel in the field of kernel-methods . we prove that on our feature strings , this similarity-measure can be computed in time linear to the number of different characters in these strings . this linear runtime-behavior makes our kernel attractive even for large-datasets that occur in many application-domains . furthermore , we explain that our similarity-measure induces a metric which allows to combine it with an m-tree for handling of large volumes of data . classification experiments on two published benchmark datasets show that our novel approach is competitive with the best state-of-the-art methods for 3d-object-classification .
