linguistic instruments and qualitative-reasoning for schema-integration two major problems in schema-integration are to identify correspondences between different conceptual-schemas and to verify that the proposed correspondences are consistent with the semantics of the schemas . we propose a heuristic-method , based on the use of galois-lattices , for identifying schema-correspondences . we show how the results of this method can be checked for correctness by introducing a number of necessary conditions for schema mergeability . these conditions are formulated in the context of a semantically rich modelling formalism , the distinguishing feature of which is the use of case-grammar .
