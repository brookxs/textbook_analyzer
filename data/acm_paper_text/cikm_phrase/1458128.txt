spam characterization and detection in peer-to-peer file-sharing systems spam is highly pervasive in p2p file-sharing systems and is difficult to detect automatically before actually downloading a file due to the insufficient and biased description of a file returned to a client as a query result . to alleviate this problem , we first characterize spam and spammers in the p2p file-sharing environment and then describe feature-based techniques for automatically detecting spam in p2p query result sets . experimental-results show that the proposed techniques successfully decrease the amount of spam by 9 \ % in the top-200 results and by 92 \ % in the top-20 results .
