optimized processing of multiple aggregate-continuous-queries data-streams management-systems are designed to support monitoring-applications , which require the processing of hundreds of aggregate-continuous-queries (acqs) . these acqs typically have different time granularities , with possibly different selection predicates and group-by attributes . in order to achieve scalability in the presence of heavy workloads , in this paper , we introduce the concept of ` weaveability ' as an indicator of the potential gains of sharing the processing of acqs . we then propose weave share , a cost-based optimizer that exploits weaveability to optimize the shared-processing of acqs . our experimental-analysis shows that weave share outperforms the alternative sharing-schemes generating up to four orders of magnitude better quality plans . finally , we describe a practical-implementation of the weave share optimizer .
