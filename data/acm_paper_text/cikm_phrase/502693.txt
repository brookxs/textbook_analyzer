real-time user-context modeling for information-retrieval agents the success of personal-information-agents depends on their ability to provide task-relevant information . this paper presents wordsieve , a new algorithm that generates context descriptions to guide document-indexing-and-retrieval . wordsieve exploits information about the sequence of accessed documents to identify words which indicate a shift in context . we have tested wordsieve in a personal-information agent , calvin , which monitors a user 's document access , generates a representation of the user 's task-context , indexes the resources consulted , and presents recommendations for other resources that were consulted in similar prior contexts . in initial experiments , wordsieve outperforms term frequency/inverse document-frequency at matching documents to hand-coded vector-representations of the task contexts in which they were originally consulted , where the task-context representations are term vectors representing a specific search-task given to the user .
