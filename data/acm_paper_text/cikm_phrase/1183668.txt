efficiently clustering transactional data with weighted-coverage-density it is widely recognized that developing efficient and fully automated algorithms for clustering large transactional datasets is a challenging problem . in this paper , we propose a fast , memory-efficient , and scalable clustering-algorithm for analyzing transactional data . our approach has three unique features . first , we use the concept of weighted-coverage-density as a categorical similarity-measure for efficient clustering of transactional datasets . the concept of weighted-coverage-density is intuitive and allows the weight of each item in a cluster to be changed dynamically according to the occurrences of items . second , we develop two transactional data clustering specific evaluation-metrics based on the concept of large transactional items and the coverage density respectively . third , we implement the weighted-coverage-density clustering-algorithm and the two clustering validation metrics using a fully automated transactional clustering-framework , called scale (sampling , clustering structure assessment , clustering and domain-specific evaluation) . the scale framework is designed to combine the weighted-coverage-density measure for clustering over a sample dataset with self-configuring methods that can automatically tune the two important parameters of the clustering algorithms : (1) the candidates of the best number k of clusters ; and (2) the application of two domain-specific cluster-validity measures to find the best result from the set of clustering results . we have conducted experimental-evaluation using both synthetic and real datasets and our results show that the weighted-coverage-density approach powered by the scale framework can efficiently generate high quality clustering results in a fully automated manner .
