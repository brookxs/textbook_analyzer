picasso : automated soundtrack suggestion for multi-modal-data we demonstrate picasso , a novel approach to soundtrack-recommendation . given text , video , or image documents , picasso selects the best fitting music pieces , out of a given set of files , for instance , a user 's personal mp3 collection . this task , commonly referred to as soundtrack suggestion , is non-trivial as it requires a lot of human-attention and a good deal of experience , with master pieces distinguished , e.g. , with the academy award for best original score . we put forward picasso to solve this task in a fully automated way . we address the problem by extracting the required information , in form of music/screenshot samples , from available contemporary movies , making the training-set easily obtainable . the training-set is further extended with information acquired from movie scripts and subtitles , giving us a richer description of the action and atmosphere expressed in a particular movie scene . although the number of applications for this approach is very-large , we focus on two selected applications . first , we consider recommendation of the soundtrack for the slide-show generation based on the given set of images . second , we consider recommending a soundtrack as the background-music for given audio-books .
