protecting location-privacy against location-dependent-attack in mobile-services privacy-preservation has recently received considerable attention for location-based mobile services . in this paper , we present location-dependent-attack resulting from continuous and dependent location updates and propose an incremental clique-based cloaking algorithm , called icliquecloak , to defend against location-dependent-attack . the main idea is to incrementally maintain maximal-cliques for location cloaking in an un-directed graph that takes into consideration the effect of continuous-location-updates .
