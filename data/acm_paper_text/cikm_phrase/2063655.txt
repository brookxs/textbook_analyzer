building directories for social-tagging systems today , a number of algorithms exist for constructing tag hierarchies from social-tagging data . while these algorithms were designed with ontological goals in mind , we know very little about their properties from an information-retrieval perspective , such as whether these tag hierarchies support efficient navigation in social-tagging systems . the aim of this paper is to investigate the usefulness of such tag hierarchies (sometimes also called folksonomies - from folk-generated taxonomy) as directories that aid navigation in social-tagging systems . to this end , we simulate navigation of directories as decentralized-search on a network of tags using kleinberg 's model . in this model , a tag hierarchy can be applied as background-knowledge for decentralized-search . by constraining the visibility of nodes in the directories we aim to mimic typical constraints imposed by a practical-user interface (ui) , such as limiting the number of displayed subcategories or related categories . our experiments on five different social-tagging datasets show that existing tag hierarchy algorithms can support navigation in theory , but our results also demonstrate that they face tremendous challenges when user-interface (ui) restrictions are taken into account . based on this observation , we introduce a new algorithm that constructs efficiently navigable directories on our datasets . the results are relevant for engineers and scientists aiming to improve navigability of social-tagging systems .
