knowledge-discovery from texts : a concept frame graph approach we address the text-content mining problem through a concept_based framework by constructing a conceptual-knowledge base and discovering knowledge therefrom . defining a novel representation called the concept frame graph (cfg) , we propose a learning-algorithm for constructing a cfg knowledge-base from text-documents . an interactive concept map-visualization technique is presented for user-guided knowledge-discovery from the knowledge-base . through experimental-studies on real life documents , we observe that the proposed approach is promising for mining deeper knowledge .
