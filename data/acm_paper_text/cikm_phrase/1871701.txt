identifying new categories in community-question-answering archives : a topic-modeling approach community-question-answering (cqa) services have evolved into a popular way of information-seeking and providing . user-posted questions in cqa are generally organized into hierarchical categories . in this paper , we define and study a novel problem which is referred to as new-category identification (nci) in cqa question archives . new-category identification is primarily concerned with detecting and characterizing new or emerging categories which are not included in the existing category-hierarchy . we define this problem formally , and propose both unsupervised and semi-supervised topic-modeling methods to solve it . experiments with a ground-truth set built from yahoo!-answers show that our methods identify and interpret new categories effectively .
