conet : feature-generation for multi-view semi-supervised-learning with partially observed views multi-view semi-supervised-learning methods try to exploit the combination of multiple views along with large amounts of unlabeled-data in order to learn better predictive functions when limited labeled-data is available . however , lack of complete view data limits the applicability of multi-view semi-supervised-learning to real-world data . commonly , one data view is readily and cheaply available , but additionally views may be costly or only available in some cases . this work aims to make multi-view semi-supervised-learning approaches more applicable to real-world data specifically by addressing the issue of missing views . we introduce conet , a feature-generation method that learns a mapping from one view to another that is specifically designed to produce features that are useful for multi-view semi-supervised-learning algorithms . the mapping is then used to fill in views as pre-processing . our comprehensive experimental-study demonstrates the utility of our method as compared to the state-of-the-art multi-view semi-supervised-learning methods for this scenario of partially observed views .
