termination-analysis of active-rules modular sets this paper presents an algorithm for static termination-analysis of active-rules in a context of modular-design . several recent works have suggested proving termination by using the concept of triggering graph . we propose here an original approach , based on these works , and that allows to guarantee the termination of a set of rules , conceived by several designers , even when none of the designers knows the set of the active-rules . we introduce the notions of private event and of public event , and we refine the notion of triggering graph (by enclosing also events in graphs) . we replace then the notion of cycle (which is no more relevant in a context of modular-design) by the notion of maximal private path preceding a rule . by means of these tools , we show that it is possible to prove termination of active-rules modular sets .
