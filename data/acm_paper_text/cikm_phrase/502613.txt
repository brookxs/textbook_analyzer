structural inference for semistructured-data semistructured-data presents many challenges , mainly due to its lack of a strict schema . these challenges are further magnified when large amounts of data are gathered from heterogeneous-sources . we address this by investigation and development of methods to automatically infer structural-information from example-data . using xml as a reference format , we approach the schema generation problem by application of inductive-inference theory . in doing so , we review and extend results relating to the search-spaces of grammatical inferences . we then adapt a method for evaluating the result of an inference-process from computational-linguistics . further , we combine several inference-algorithms , including both new techniques introduced by us and those from previous work . comprehensive experimentation reveals our new hybrid-method , based upon recently developed optimisation-techniques , to be the most effective .
