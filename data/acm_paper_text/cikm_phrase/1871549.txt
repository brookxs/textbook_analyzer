constructing classification features using minimal predictive patterns choosing good features to represent objects can be crucial to the success of supervised-machine-learning methods . recently , there has been a great interest in applying data-mining-techniques to construct new classification features . the rationale behind this approach is that patterns (feature-value combinations) could capture more underlying semantics than single features . hence the inclusion of some patterns can improve the classification-performance . currently , most methods adopt a two-phases approach by generating all frequent-patterns in the first phase and selecting the discriminative patterns in the second phase . however , this approach has limited success because it is usually very difficult to correctly identify important predictive patterns in a large set of highly correlated frequent-patterns . in this paper , we introduce the minimal predictive patterns framework to directly mine a compact set of highly predictive patterns . the idea is to integrate pattern-mining and feature-selection in order to filter out non-informative and redundant patterns while being generated . we propose some pruning techniques to speed up the mining process . our extensive experimental-evaluation on many datasets demonstrates the advantage of our method by outperforming many well known classifiers .
