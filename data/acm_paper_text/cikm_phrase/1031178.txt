organizing structured web sources by query schemas : a clustering approach in the recent years , the-web has been rapidly `` deepened '' with the prevalence of databases online . on this deep-web , many sources are <i> structured </i> by providing structured-query interfaces and results . organizing such structured sources into a domain hierarchy is one of the critical steps toward the integration of heterogeneous web sources . we observe that , for structured web sources , query schemas <i> ie </i> , attributes in query-interfaces) are discriminative representatives of the sources and thus can be exploited for source characterization . in particular , by viewing query schemas as a type of categorical-data , we abstract the problem of source organization into the clustering of categorical-data . our approach hypothesizes that `` homogeneous sources '' are characterized by the same hidden generative-models for their schemas . to find clusters governed by such statistical-distributions , we propose a new objective-function , <i> model-differentiation </i> , which employs principled hypothesis-testing to maximize statistical heterogeneity among clusters . our evaluation over hundreds of real sources indicates that (1) the schema-based clustering accurately organizes sources by object domains <i> eg </i> , books , movies) , and (2) on clustering web-query schemas , the model-differentiation function outperforms existing ones , such as likelihood , entropy , and context linkages , with the hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering algorithm .
