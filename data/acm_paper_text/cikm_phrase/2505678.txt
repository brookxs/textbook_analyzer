a phased ranking-model for question-answering we describe a general result-ranking approach for multi-phase , multi strategy information-systems , which has been applied to the task of question-answering (qa) . many information-systems incorporate multiple steps and each step or phase may incorporate multiple component algorithms to achieve acceptable robustness and overall performance . such systems may produce and rank a large number of candidate results . prior work includes many models that rank a particular type of information-object (e.g. a retrieved document , a factoid answer) using features specific to that information type , without attempting to make use of other non-local features (e.g. features of the upstream information-source) . we propose an approach that allows each phase in a system to leverage information propagated from preceding phases to inform the ranking decision . this is accomplished by a system object-graph which represents all of the objects created during system execution , object dependencies (e.g. provenance) , and ranking feature values extracted for a specific object . we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking approach in a multi-phase question-answering-system built by recombining pre-existing software-modules . experimental-results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms comparable answer-ranking models .
