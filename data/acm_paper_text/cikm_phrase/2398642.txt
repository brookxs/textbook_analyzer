tweet classification based on their lifetime duration many microblog messages remain useful only within a short time , and users often find such a message after its informational value has vanished . users also sometimes miss old but still useful messages buried among outdated ones . to solve these problems , we develop a method of classifying messages into the following three categories : (1) messages that users should read now because their value will diminish soon , (2) messages that users may read later because their value will not largely change soon , and (3) messages that are not useful anymore because their value has vanished . our method uses an error-correcting output code consisting of binary classifiers each of which determines whether a given message has value at specific time point . our experiments on twitter data confirmed that it outperforms naive methods .
