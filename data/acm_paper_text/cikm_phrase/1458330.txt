detecting significant distinguishing sets among bi-clusters a fundamental task of data-analysis is comprehending what distinguishes clusters found within the data . we present the problem of mining distinguishing sets ; which seeks to find sets of objects or attributes that induce the most incremental change between adjacent bi-clusters of a binary dataset . viewing the lattice of bi-clusters formed within a data-set as a weighted directed-graph , we mine the most significant distinguishing sets by growing a maximal-cost spanning-tree of the lattice .
