efficient evaluation of multiple-queries on streaming-xml data traditionally , xml-documents are processed at where they are stored . this allows the query-processor to exploit pre-computed data-structures (e.g. , index) to retrieve the desired data efficiently . however , this mode of processing is not suitable for many applications where the documents are frequently updated . in such situations , efficient evaluation of multiple-queries over streaming-xml documents becomes important . this paper introduces a new operator , mqx-scan , which efficiently evaluates multiple-queries with a single pass on streaming-xml data . to facilitate matching , mqx-scan utilizes templates containing paths that have been traversed to match regular path expression patterns in a pool of queries . results of the experiments demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the mqx-scan operator .
