mining all maximal frequent word-sequences in a set of sentences we present an efficient-algorithm for finding all maximal frequent word-sequences in a set of sentences . a word-sequence s is considered frequent , if all its words occur in at least ? sentences and the words occur in each of these sentences in the same order as in s , given a frequency threshold ? . hence , the words of a sequence s do not have to occur consecutively in the sentences .
