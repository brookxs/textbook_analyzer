diversification for multi-domain result sets multi-domain-search answers to queries spanning multiple entities , like `` find an affordable house in a city with low criminality index , good schools and medical services '' , by producing ranked sets of entity combinations that maximize relevance , measured by a function expressing the user 's preferences . due to the combinatorial nature of results , good entity-instances (e.g. , inexpensive houses) tend to appear repeatedly in top-ranked combinations . to improve the quality of the result-set , it is important to balance relevance (i.e. , high values of the ranking-function) with diversity , which promotes different , yet almost equally relevant , entities in the top-k combinations . this paper explores two different notions of diversity for multi-domain result sets , compares experimentally alternative algorithms for the trade-off between relevance and diversity , and performs a user-study for evaluating the utility of diversification in multi-domain-queries .
