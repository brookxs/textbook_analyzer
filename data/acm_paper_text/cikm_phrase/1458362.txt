exploiting context to detect sensitive-information in call-center conversations protecting sensitive-information while preserving the share-ability and usability of data is becoming increasingly important . in call-centers a lot of customer related sensitive-information is stored in audio recordings . in this work , we address the problem of protecting sensitive-information in audio recordings and speech-transcripts . we present a semi-supervised method to model sensitive-information as a directed-graph . effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of detecting and locating credit-card transaction in real life conversations between agents and customers in a call-center .
