collaborative-online-learning of user-generated-content we study the problem of online classification of user-generated-content , with the goal of efficiently learning to categorize content generated by individual user . this problem is challenging due to several reasons . first , the huge amount of user-generated-content demands a highly efficient and scalable classification solution . second , the categories are typically highly imbalanced , i.e. , the number of samples from a particular useful class could be far and few between compared to some others (majority class) . in some applications like spam-detection , identification of the minority class often has significantly greater value than that of the majority class . last but not least , when learning a classification-model from a group of users , there is a dilemma : a single classification-model trained on the entire corpus may fail to capture personalized characteristics such as language and writing-styles unique to each user . on the other hand , a personalized model dedicated to each user may be inaccurate due to the scarcity of training-data , especially at the very beginning ; when users have written just a few articles . to overcome these challenges , we propose learning a global-model over all users ' data , which is then leveraged to continuously refine the individual models through a collaborative-online-learning approach . the class-imbalance-problem is addressed via a cost-sensitive-learning approach . experimental-results show that our method is effective and scalable for timely classification of user-generated-content .
