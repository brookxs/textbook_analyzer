finding the topical-anchors of a context using lexical cooccurrence data lexical cooccurrence in textual data is not uniformly random . the statistics inferred from the term-cooccurrence data enable us to model dependencies between terms as graphs , somewhat resembling the way semantic-memory is organised in human beings . in this paper we look at cooccurrence patterns to identify topical-anchors of a given context . topical-anchors are those terms whose semantics represent the topic of the whole context . this work is based on computing a stationary-distribution in the cooccurrence graph . topical-anchors were computed on a set of 100 contexts and were also evaluated by 86 volunteers and the results show that the algorithm correctly identifies the topical-anchors around 62 \ % of the time .
