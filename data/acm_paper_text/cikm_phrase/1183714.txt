tracking dragon-hunters with language-models we are interested in the problem of understanding the connections between human activities and the content of textual-information generated in regard to those activities . firstly , we define and motivate this problem as an important part in making sense of various life events . secondly , we introduce the domain of massive online collaborative environments , specifically online virtual worlds , where people meet , exchange messages , and perform actions as a rich-data source for such an analysis . finally , we outline three experimental tasks and show how statistical-language-modeling and text-clustering techniques may allow us to explore those connections successfully .
