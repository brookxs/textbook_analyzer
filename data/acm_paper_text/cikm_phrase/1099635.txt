learning to summarise xml-documents using content-and-structure documents formatted in extensible-markup-language (xml) are becoming increasingly available in collections of various document types . in this paper , we present an approach for the summarisation of xml-documents . the novelty of this approach lies in that it is based on features not only from the content of documents , but also from their logical-structure . we follow a machine-learning like , sentence extraction-based summarisation technique . to find which features are more effective for producing summaries this approach views sentence-extraction as an ordering task . we evaluated our summarisation model using the inex dataset . the results demonstrate that the inclusion of features from the logical-structure of documents increases the effectiveness of the summariser , and that the learnable system is also effective and well-suited to the task of summarisation in the context of xml-documents .
