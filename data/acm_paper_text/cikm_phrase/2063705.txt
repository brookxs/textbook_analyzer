cloning for privacy-protection in multiple independent data publications data-anonymization has become a major technique in privacy-preserving-data-publishing . many methods have been proposed to anonymize one dataset and a series of datasets of a data owner . however , no method has been proposed for the anonymization of data of multiple independent data publications . a data owner publishes a dataset , which contains overlapping population with other datasets published by other independent data owners . in this paper we analyze the privacy risk in the such scenario and vulnerability of partitioned based anonymization methods . we show that no partitioned based anonymization methods can protect privacy in arbitrary data distributions , and identify a case that the privacy can be protected in the scenario . we propose a new generalization principle ? - cloning to protect privacy for multiple independent data publications . we also develop an effective algorithm to achieve the ? - cloning . we experimentally show that the proposed algorithm anonymizes data to satisfy the privacy requirement and preserves good data-utility .
