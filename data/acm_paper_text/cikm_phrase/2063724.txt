do all birds tweet the same ? : characterizing twitter around the world social-media services have spread throughout the world in just a few years . they have become not only a new source of information , but also new mechanisms for societies world-wide to organize themselves and communicate . therefore , social-media has a very strong impact in many aspects -- at personal level , in business , and in politics , among many others . in spite of its fast adoption , little is known about social-media usage in different countries , and whether patterns of behavior remain the same or not . to provide deep-understanding of differences between countries can be useful in many ways , e.g. : to improve the design of social-media-systems (which features work best for which country ?) , and influence marketing and political campaigns . moreover , this type of analysis can provide relevant insight into how societies might differ . in this paper we present a summary of a large-scale-analysis of twitter for an extended period of time . we analyze in detail various aspects of social-media for the ten countries we identified as most active . we collected one year 's worth of data and report differences and similarities in terms of activity , sentiment , use of languages , and network-structure . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first on-line social network study of such characteristics .
