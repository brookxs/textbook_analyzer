indexing time vs. query time : trade-offs in dynamic-information-retrieval systems we examine issues in the design of fully dynamic-information-retrieval systems supporting both document insertions and deletions . the two main components of such a system , index-maintenance and query-processing , affect each other , as high query-performance is usually paid for by additional work during update-operations . two aspects of the system -- incremental-updates and garbage-collection for delayed document deletions -- are discussed , with a focus on the respective indexing vs. query-performance trade-offs . depending on the relative number of queries and update-operations , different strategies lead to optimal overall performance .
