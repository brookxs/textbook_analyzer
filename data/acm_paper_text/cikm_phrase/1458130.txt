inferring semantic-query relations from collective user-behavior in this paper we describe how high quality transaction-data comprising of online searching , product viewing , and product buying activity of a large online-community can be used to infer semantic-relationships between queries . we work with a large-scale query-log consisting of around 115 million queries from ebay . we discuss various techniques to infer semantic-relationships among queries and show how the results from these methods can be combined to measure the strength and depict the kinds of relationships . further , we show how this extraction of relations can be used to improve search-relevance , related-query recommendations , and recovery from null results in an ecommerce context .
