relevance-feedback exploiting query-specific document manifolds we incorporate relevance-feedback into a learning-to-rank framework by exploiting query-specific document similarities . given a few judged feedback documents and many retrieved but unjudged documents for a query , we learn a function that adjusts the initial ranking score of each document . scores are fit so that documents with similar term content get similar scores , and scores of judged documents are close to their labels . by such smoothing along the manifold of retrieved documents , we avoid overfitting , and can therefore learn a detailed query-specific scoring-function with several dozen term-weights .
