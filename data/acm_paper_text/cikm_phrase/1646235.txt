a co-classification framework for detecting web-spam and spammers in social-media web-sites social-media are becoming increasingly popular and have attracted considerable attention from spammers . using a sample of more than ninety thousand known spam web-sites , we found between 7 \ % to 18 \ % of their urls are posted on two popular social-media web-sites , digg.com and delicious.com . in this paper , we present a co-classification framework to detect web-spam and the spammers who are responsible for posting them on the social-media web-sites . the rationale for our approach is that since both detection tasks are related , it would be advantageous to train them simultaneously to make use of the labeled examples in the-web spam and spammer training-data . we have evaluated the effectiveness of our algorithm on the delicious.com data-set . our experimental-results showed that the proposed co-classification algorithm significantly outperforms classifiers that learn each detection-task independently .
