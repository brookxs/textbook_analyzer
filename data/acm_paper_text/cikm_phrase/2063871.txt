adaptive term-frequency-normalization for bm25 a key component of bm25 contributing to its success is its sub linear term-frequency (tf) normalization formula . the scale and shape of this tf normalization component is controlled by a parameter k1 , which is generally set to a term-independent constant . we hypothesize and show empirically that in order to optimize retrieval-performance , this parameter should be set in a term-specific way . following this intuition , we propose an information-gain measure to directly estimate the contributions of repeated term occurrences , which is then exploited to fit the bm25 function to predict a term-specific k1 . our experiment results show that the proposed approach , without needing any training-data , can efficiently and automatically estimate a term-specific k1 , and is more effective and robust than the standard bm25 .
