quantifying uncertainty in multi-dimensional cardinality estimations we propose a method for predicting the cardinality-distribution of a multi-dimensional query . compared to conventional ` point-based ' estimates , distribution-based estimates enable the query-optimizer to predict the cost of a query-plan more accurately , as we show experimentally . our method is computationally efficient and works on top of a histogram already in place . it does not store any information additional to the histogram . our experiments show that the quality of the predictions with the new method is high .
