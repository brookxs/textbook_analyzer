automatic-detection of craters in planetary images : an embedded framework using feature-selection and boosting identifying impact craters on planetary surfaces is one fundamental task in planetary science . in this paper , we present an embedded framework on auto-detection of craters , using feature-selection and boosting strategies . the paradigm aims at building a universal and practical crater detector . this methodology addresses three issues that such a tool must possess : (i) it utilizes mathematical-morphology to efficiently identify the regions of an image that can potentially contain craters ; only those regions , defined as crater candidates , are the subjects of further processing ; (ii) it selects haar-like image-texture features in combination with boosting ensemble supervised-learning algorithms to accurately classify candidates into craters and non-craters ; (iii) it uses transfer-learning , at a minimum additional cost , to enable maintaining an accurate auto-detection of craters on new images , having morphology different from what has been captured by the original training-set . all three aforementioned components of the detection methodology are discussed , and the entire framework is evaluated on a large test image of 37,500 x 56,250 $ m 2 on mars , showing heavily cratered martian terrain characterized by nonuniform surface morphology . our study demonstrates that this methodology provides a robust and practical tool for planetary science , in terms of both detection-accuracy and efficiency .
