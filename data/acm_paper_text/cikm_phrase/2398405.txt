comprehension-based result snippets result snippets are used by most search-interfaces to preview query results . snippets help users quickly decide the relevance of the results , thereby reducing the overall search-time and effort . most work on snippets have focused on text-snippets for web-pages in web-search . however , little work has studied the problem of snippets for structured-data , e.g. , product-catalogs . furthermore , all works have focused on the important goal of creating informative snippets , but have ignored the amount of user effort required to comprehend , i.e. , read and digest , the displayed snippets . in particular , they implicitly assume that the comprehension effort or cost only depends on the length of the snippet , which we show is incorrect for structured-data . we propose novel techniques to construct snippets of structured heterogeneous results , which not only select the most informative attributes for each result , but also minimize the expected user effort (time) to comprehend these snippets . we create a comprehension-model to quantify the effort incurred by users in comprehending a list of result snippets . our model is supported by an extensive user-study . a key observation is that the user effort for comprehending an attribute across multiple snippets only depends on the number of unique positions (e.g. , indentations) where this attribute is displayed and not on the number of occurrences . we analyze the complexity of the snippet construction problem and show that the problem is np-hard , even when we only consider the comprehension cost . we present efficient approximate-algorithms , and experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency .
