discovering top-k teams of experts with/without a leader in social-networks we study the problem of discovering a team of experts from a social-network . given a project whose completion requires a set of skills , our goal is to find a set of experts that together have all of the required-skills and also have the minimal-communication cost among them . we propose two communication-cost functions designed for two types of communication structures . we show that the problem of finding the team of experts that minimizes one of the proposed cost-functions is np-hard . thus , an approximation-algorithm with an approximation ratio of two is designed . we introduce the problem of finding a team of experts with a leader . the leader is responsible for monitoring and coordinating the project , and thus a different communication-cost function is used in this problem . to solve this problem , an exact polynomial-algorithm is proposed . we show that the total number of teams may be exponential with respect to the number of required-skills . thus , two procedures that produce top-k teams of experts with or without a leader in polynomial delay are proposed . extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods .
