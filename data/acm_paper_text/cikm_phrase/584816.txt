query-processing of streamed xml-data we are addressing the efficient processing of continuous xml-streams , in which the server broadcasts xml-data to multiple clients concurrently through a multicast data-stream , while each client is fully responsible for processing the stream . in our framework , a server may disseminate xml-fragments from multiple-documents in the same stream , can repeat or replace fragments , and can introduce new fragments or delete invalid ones . a client uses a light-weight database based on our proposed xml-algebra to cache stream-data and to evaluate xml-queries against these data . the synchronization between clients and servers is achieved through annotations and punctuations transmitted along with the data-streams . we are presenting a framework for processing xml-queries in xquery form over continuous xml-streams . our framework is based on a novel xml-algebra and a new algebraic optimization framework based on query decorrelation , which is essential for non-blocking stream-processing .
