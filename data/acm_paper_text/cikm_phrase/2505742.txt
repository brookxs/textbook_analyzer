cache refreshing for online social news-feeds several social-networking-applications enable users to view the events generated by other users , typically friends in the social-network , in the form of `` news-feeds '' . friends and events are typically maintained per user and cached in memory to enable efficient generation of news-feeds . caching user friends and events , however , raises concerns about the freshness of news-feeds as users may not observe the most recent events when cache content becomes stale . mechanisms to keep cache content fresh are thus critical for user-satisfaction while computing news-feeds efficiently through caching . we propose a novel cache scheme called socr (social online cache refreshing) for identifying and refreshing cache entries . socr refreshes the cache in an online manner and does not require the backend data store to push updates to the cache . socr uses a utility-based strategy to accurately identify cache entries that need to be refreshed . the basic idea is to estimate at the time of each request to generate news-feed whether refreshing would lead to different results for a news-feed . to make such estimation , we model the rates of changes to social-networks and events , and assess the performance of socr by analyzing datasets from facebook and yahoo! news activity . our experimental-evaluation shows that the utility-based strategy ensures fresh news-feeds (43 % fewer stales) and efficient news-feed responses (51 % fewer false-positives) compared to the ttl-based strategy . socr also reduces data-transmission between the backend data store and the cache by 27 % compared to a hybrid push-pull cache refreshing scheme .
