compressed-data-structures with relevance we describe recent breakthroughs in the field of compressed-data-structures , in which the data-structure is stored in a compressed representation that still allows fast answers to queries . we focus in particular on compressed-data-structures to support the important application of pattern-matching on massive document-collections . given an arbitrary-query pattern in textual form , the job of the data-structure is to report all the locations where the pattern appears . another variant is to report all the documents that contain at least one instance of the pattern . we are particularly interested in reporting only the most relevant documents , using a variety of notions of relevance . we discuss recently developed techniques that support fast-search in these contexts as well as under additional positional and temporal-constraints .
