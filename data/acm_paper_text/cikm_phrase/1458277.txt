passage relevance-models for genomics-search we present a passage relevance-model for integrating semantic and statistical evidence of biomedical concepts and topics in context using the framework of a probabilistic-graphical-model . component-models of topics , concepts , terms , and document are represented as potential functions within a markov-random-field , and the probability of a passage being relevant to a biologist 's information-need is represented as the joint-distribution across all potential functions . relevance-model feedback of top ranked passages is used to improve distributional estimates of concepts and topics in context , and a dimensional indexing strategy is used for efficient aggregation of concept and term statistics . by integrating multiple sources of evidence including dependencies between topics , concepts , and terms , we seek to improve genomics literature passage-retrieval precision . using this model , we demonstrate statistically significant improvements in retrieval-precision using a large genomics literature corpus .
