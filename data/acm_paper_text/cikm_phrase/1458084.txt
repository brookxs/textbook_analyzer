markov-logic : a unifying language for knowledge and information-management modern information and knowledge-management is characterized by high degrees of complexity and uncertainty . complexity is well handled by first-order-logic , and uncertainty by probabilistic-graphical-models . what has been sorely missing is a seamless combination of the two . markov-logic provides this by attaching weights to logical formulas and treating them as templates for features of markov-random-fields . this talks surveys markov-logic representation , inference , learning and applications . inference-algorithms combine ideas from satisfiability testing , resolution , markov-chain-monte-carlo and belief-propagation . learning-algorithms involve statistical weight-learning and inductive-logic-programming . markov-logic has been successfully applied to a wide range of information-and-knowledge-management problems , including information-extraction , entity-resolution , ontology-learning , link-prediction , heterogeneous knowledge bases , and others . it is the basis of the open-source alchemy system (http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu) .
