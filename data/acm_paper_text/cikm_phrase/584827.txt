augeas : authoritativeness grading , estimation , and sorting when searching for content in in a large heterogeneous document-collections like the world-wide-web it is not easy to know which documents provide reliable authoritative information about a subject . the problem is particularly pointed as it concerns content-search for `` high-value '' informational needs such as retrieving medical-information , where the cost of error may be high . in this paper , a method is described for estimating the authoritativeness of a document based on textual , non-topical cues . this method is complementary to estimates of authoritativeness based on link-structure , such as the pagerank and hits algorithms . this method is particularly suited to `` high-value '' content-search where the user is interested in searching for information about a specific topic . a method for combining textual estimates of authoritativeness with link-analysis is also presented . the types of textual cues to authoritativeness that are easily computed and utilized by our method are described , as well as the method used to select a subset of cues to increase the computation speed . methods for applying authoritativeness estimates to re-ranking documents returned from search-engines , combining textual authoritativeness with social authority , and use in query-expansion are also presented . by combining textual authority with link-analysis , a more complete and robust estimate can be made of a document 's authoritativeness .
