weighted hashing for fast large-scale similarity-search similarity-search , or finding approximate nearest neighbors , is an important technique for many applications . many recent research demonstrate that hashing methods can achieve promising results for large-scale similarity-search due to its computational and memory-efficiency . however , most existing hashing methods treat all hashing bits equally and the distance between data examples is calculated as the hamming-distance between their hashing codes , while different hashing bits may carry different amount of information . this paper proposes a novel method , named weighted hashing (weihash) , to assign different weights to different hashing bits . the hashing codes and their corresponding weights are jointly learned in a unified-framework by simultaneously preserving the similarity between data-examples and balancing the variance of each hashing bit . an iterative coordinate descent optimization-algorithm is designed to derive desired hashing codes and weights . extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed research over several state-of-the-art hashing methods .
