olap-based query-recommendation query-recommendation is an invaluable tool for enabling users to speed up their searches . in this paper , we present algorithms for generating query-suggestions , assuming no previous knowledge of the collection . we developed an online olap algorithm to generate query-suggestions for the users based on the frequency of the keywords in the selected documents and the correlation between the keywords in the collection . in addition , performance-and-scalability experiments of these algorithms are presented as proof of their feasibility . we also present sampling as an additional approach for improving performance by using approximate results . we show valid recommendations as a result of combinations generated using the correlations between the keywords . the online olap algorithm is also compared with the well-known apriori-algorithm and found to be faster only when simple computations were performed in smaller collections with a few keywords . on the other hand , olap showed a more stable behavior between collections , and allows us to have more complex policies during the aggregation and term combinations . additionally , sampling showed improvement in the time without a significant change on the suggested queries , and proved to be an accurate alternative with a few small samples .
