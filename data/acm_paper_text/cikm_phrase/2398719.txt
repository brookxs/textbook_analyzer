fast and accurate incremental entity-resolution relative to an entity knowledge-base user facing topical web-applications such as events or shopping sites rely on large-collections of data records about real-world entities that are updated at varying latencies ranging from days to seconds . for example , event venue details are changed relatively infrequently whereas ticket pricing and availability for an event is often updated in near-realtime . users regard these sites as high quality if they seldom show duplicates , the urls are stable , and their content is fresh , so it is important to resolve duplicate entity records with high quality and low latencies . high quality entity-resolution typically evaluates the entire record corpus for similar record clusters at the cost of latency , while low-latency resolution examines the least possible entities to keep time to a minimum , even at the cost of quality . in this paper we show how to keep low-latency while achieving high quality , combining the best of both approaches : given an entity to be resolved , our incremental fastpath system , in a matter of milliseconds , makes approximately the same decisions that the underlying batch-system would have made . our experiments show that the fastpath system makes matching decisions for previously unseen entities with 90 % precision and 98 % recall relative to batch decisions , with latencies under 20ms on commodity-hardware .
