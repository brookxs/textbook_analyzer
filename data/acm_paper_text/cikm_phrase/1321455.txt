lightweight web-based fact-repositories for textual question-answering since answers to fact-seeking questions usually reside within small factual text nuggets , often `` hidden '' within full-length documents , their relevance to a question is not necessarily correlated to the relevance of the full-length document to the question . yet previous approaches to open-domain textual question-answering from large document collections quasi-unanimously employ a document-retrieval stage , in order to apply widely different , often expensive answer-mining techniques to only a small subset of documents . depending on the collection-size , 95 \ % or more of the documents in the collection (much more in the case of the-web) are left out of the selected subset for any given query , and thus become invisible to subsequent processing stages for actual answer-mining . this paper introduces a new model for answer-retrieval for question-answering . the collection is distilled offline into large repositories of facts . each fact constitutes a potential direct answer to questions seeking a particular kind of entity or relation , such as questions asking about the date of particular events . question-answering becomes equivalent to online fact-retrieval , which greatly simplifies the de-facto system-architecture for fact-seeking question-answering . in addition to simplicity , experiments on a fact repository acquired from approximately a billion web-documents illustrate the impact of fact-repositories in extracting accurate answers to a standard evaluation-set of open-domain test questions and additional sets of domain-specific questions .
