top-k-retrieval using conditional-preference networks this paper considers top-k-retrieval using conditional-preference network (cp-net) . as a model for expressing user-preferences on multiple mutually correlated attributes , cp-net is of great interest for decision-support-systems . however , little work has addressed how to conduct efficient data-retrieval using cp-nets . this paper presents an approach to efficiently retrieve the most preferred data items based on a user 's cp-net . the proposed approach consists of a top-k algorithm and an indexing-scheme . we conducted extensive experiments to compare our approach against a baseline top-k method - sequential-scan . the results show that our approach outperform sequential-scan in several circumstances .
