re-evaluating indexing schemes for nested objects performance is a major issue in the acceptance of object-oriented-database management-systems (oodbms) . the nested index and path index schemes have been criticized for their heavy costs and poor handling of update-operations . this paper re-evaluates three index schemes (nested index , path index , and multi-index) applicable to queries on nested attributes . among these , we found that a multi-index scheme is best supported in the object-oriented or extended relational dbms environment . multi-index schemes not only provide a better balance between retrieval and update costs than do the nested or path indices , but they also scale well for update when the number of indices increases . in this paper , we propose a multi-index design that reuses the single-table index-structures already present in a dbms . our performance-study extends previous models by permitting attributes to be multi-valued as well as single-valued . we also suggest that a combination of nested index and multi-index schemes offers a feasible solution to the support of queries on nested objects .
