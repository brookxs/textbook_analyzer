wam-miner : in the search of web-access motifs from historical web-log data existing web-usage-mining techniques focus only on discovering knowledge based on the statistical measures obtained from the static characteristics of web-usage data . they do not consider the dynamic nature of web-usage data . in this paper , we focus on discovering novel knowledge by analyzing the change-patterns of historical web-access sequence-data . we present an algorithm called w <small> am </small> - m <small> iner </small> to discover web-access motifs (wams) . wams are web-access-patterns that never change or do not change significantly most of the time (if not always) in terms of their support values during a specific time period . wams are useful for many applications , such as intelligent-web advertisement , web-site restructuring , business-intelligence , and intelligent-web caching .
