adaptive parallel approximate similarity search for responsive multimedia-retrieval this paper introduces hypercurves , a flexible framework for pro- viding similarity-search indexing to high-throughput multimedia-services . hypercurves efficiently and effectively answers k-nearest-neighbor searches on multigigabyte high-dimensional databases . it supports massively-parallel-processing and adapts at runtime its parallelization regimens to keep answer times optimal for either low and high demands . in order to achieve its goals , hypercurves introduces new techniques for selecting parallelism configurations and allocating threads to computation cores , including hyperthreaded cores . its efficiency gains are throughly validated on a large database of multimedia descriptors , where it presented near linear speedups and superlinear scaleups . the adaptation reduces query response-times in 43 \ % and 74 \ % for both platforms tested , when compared to the best static parallelism regimens .
