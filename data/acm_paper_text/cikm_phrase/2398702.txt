a scalable approach for performing proximal search for verbose patent-search queries even though queries received by traditional information-retrieval-systems are quite short , there are many application-scenarios where long natural-language queries are more effective . further , incorporating term-position information can help improve results of long-queries . however , the techniques for incorporating term-position information have been developed for terse queries and hence , can not be directly applied to long-queries . though there exist some methods for performing proximal search for long-queries , they are not scalable due to long-query response-times . we describe an intuitive and simple , yet effective technique that implicitly incorporates term-position information for long-queries in a scalable manner . our proposed approach achieves more than 700 % faster query response-times while maintaining the quality of retrieved results when compared with a state-of-the-art method for performing proximal search for very long queries .
