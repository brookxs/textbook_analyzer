a topical-link-model for community-discovery in textual interaction graph this paper is concerned with community-discovery in textual interaction graph , where the links between entities are indicated by textual-documents . specifically , we propose a topical-link-model (tlm) , which leverages hierarchical-dirichlet-process (hdp) to introduce hidden topical variable of the links . other than the use of links , tlm can look into the documents on the links in detail to recover sound communities . moreover , tlm is a nonparametric model , which is able to learn the number of communities from the data . extensive experiments on two real-world corpora show tlm outperforms two state-of-the-art baseline models , which verify the effectiveness of tlm in determining the proper number of communities and generating sound communities .
