dist : a distributed spatio-temporal index-structure for sensor-networks we consider the general problem of tracking moving-objects in sensor-networks . the specific application we consider is that of tracking a chemical plume moving over a large infrastructure network . we present a distributed-index structure dist that stores and updates distributed summaries as the plume moves . we present algorithms for range-queries on the history of the plume . dist localizes information with respect to time and space using a hierarchy that scales with the plume size . the highlight of our work is an analytical-model to predict the cost-of-query algorithms based on the query location , query size , and plume 's spatio-temporal distribution . using this model , our adaptive-scheme chooses the optimal scheme . experimental-results show that dist outperforms alternative techniques in query , update , and storage costs , and scales well with the number of plumes .
