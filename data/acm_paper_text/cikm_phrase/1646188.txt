a hybrid-index-structure for geo-textual searches the efficient execution of multi-criteria queries has gained increasing interest over the last years . in the present paper we propose an r-tree_based approach for queries addressing textual as well as geographic filter conditions . whereas most previous approaches use an index-structure optimised for a single criterion adding special treatment for the other criterion at the leaf nodes or end points of this index-structure , our approach uses a deeper integration . in short , r-trees are maintained for certain subsets of the whole term-set . furthermore , in each of these r-trees bit sets are used within the nodes to indicate whether entries for the terms associated with the single bits can be found in the corresponding sub-tree . our index-structure aims to be both , time and space efficient . the paper investigates the efficiency and applicability of the proposed index-structure via practical experiments based on real-world and synthetic-data .
