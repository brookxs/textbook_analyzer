sentiment-focused web-crawling the sentiments and opinions that are expressed in web-pages towards objects , entities , and products constitute an important portion of the textual content available in the web . despite the vast interest in sentiment-analysis and opinion-mining , somewhat surprisingly , the discovery of the sentimental or opinionated web-content is mostly ignored . this work aims to fill this gap and address the problem of quickly discovering and fetching the sentimental content present in the web . to this end , we design a sentiment-focused web-crawling framework for faster discovery and retrieval of such content . in particular , we propose different sentiment-focused web-crawling-strategies that prioritize discovered urls based on their predicted sentiment scores . through simulations , these strategies are shown to achieve considerable performance-improvement over general-purpose web-crawling-strategies in discovering sentimental content .
