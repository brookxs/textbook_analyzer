document update-summarization using incremental-hierarchical-clustering document-summarization has become a hot topic in recent years . however , most of existing summarization methods work on a batch of documents and do not consider that documents may arrive in a sequence and the corresponding summaries need to be updated in real-time . in this paper , we propose a new summarization-method based on an incremental-hierarchical-clustering framework to update summaries as soon as a new document arrives . extensive experimental-results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method .
