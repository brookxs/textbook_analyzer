deriving non-redundant approximate association-rules from hierarchical datasets association-rule-mining plays an important job in knowledge and information-discovery . however , there are still shortcomings with the quality of the discovered rules and often the number of discovered rules is huge and contain redundancies , especially in the case of multi-level-datasets . previous work has shown that the mining of non-redundant rules is a promising approach to solving this problem , with work by [6,8,9,10] focusing on single level datasets . recent work by shaw et . al. [7] has extended the non-redundant approaches presented in [6,8,9] to include the elimination of redundant exact basis rules from multi-level-datasets . here we propose a continuation of the work in [7] that allows for the removal of hierarchically redundant approximate basis rules from multi-level-datasets by using a dataset 's hierarchy or taxonomy .
