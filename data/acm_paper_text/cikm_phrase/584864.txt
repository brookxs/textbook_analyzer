a singer-identification technique for content-based classification of mp3 music objects as there is a growing amount of mp3 music data available on the internet today , the problems related to music-classification and content-based-music-retrieval are getting more attention recently . in this paper , we propose an approach to automatically classify mp3 music objects according to their singers . first , the coefficients extracted from the output of the polyphase filters are used to compute the mp3 features for segmentation . based on these features , an mp3 music object can be decomposed into a sequence of notes (or phonemes) . then for each mp3 phoneme in the training-set , its mp3 feature is extracted and used to train an mp3 classifier which can identify the singer of an unknown mp3 music object . experiments are performed and analyzed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method .
