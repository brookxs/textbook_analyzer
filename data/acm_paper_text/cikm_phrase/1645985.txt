using multiple ontologies in information-extraction ontology-based-information-extraction (obie) has recently emerged as a subfield of information-extraction (ie) . here , ontologies - which provide formal and explicit specifications of conceptualizations - play a crucial role in the information-extraction process . several obie systems have been implemented previously but all of them use a single ontology although multiple ontologies have been designed for many domains . we have studied the theoretical basis for using multiple ontologies in information-extraction and have developed information-extraction-systems that use them . these systems investigate the two major scenarios for having multiple ontologies for the same domain : specializing in sub-domains and providing different perspectives . the domain of universities has been used for the former scenario through a corpus collected from university websites . for the latter , the domain of terrorist attacks and a corpus used by a previous message-understanding-conference (muc) have been used . the results from these two case-studies indicate that using multiple ontologies in information-extraction has led to a clear improvement in performance-measures .
