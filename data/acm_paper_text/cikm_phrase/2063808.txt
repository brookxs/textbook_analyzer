the list viterbi training-algorithm and its application to keyword-search-over-databases hidden-markov-models (hmms) are today employed in a variety of applications , ranging from speech-recognition to bioinformatics . in this paper , we present the list viterbi training-algorithm , a version of the expectation-maximization (em) algorithm based on the list-viterbi-algorithm instead of the commonly used forward-backward-algorithm . we developed the batch and online versions of the algorithm , and we also describe an interesting application in the context of keyword-search-over-databases , where we exploit a hmm for matching keywords into database terms . in our experiments we tested the online version of the training-algorithm in a semi-supervised setting that allows us to take into account the feedbacks provided by the users .
