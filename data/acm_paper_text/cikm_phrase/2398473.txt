mining topic-level opinion influence in microblog this paper proposes a topic-level opinion influence-model (toim) that simultaneously incorporates topic factor , user opinions and social-influence in a unified probabilistic-model with two stages learning-processes . in the first stage , topic factor and user influence are integrated to generate users ' influential relationship based on different topics ; in the second stage , users ' historical messages and social-interaction records are leveraged by toim to construct their historical opinions and neighbors ' opinion influence through a statistical learning-process , which can be further utilized to predict users ' future opinions on some specific topics . we evaluate our toim on a large-scaled dataset from tencent weibo , one of the largest microbloggings website in china . the experimental-results show that toim can better predict users ' opinion than other baseline methods .
