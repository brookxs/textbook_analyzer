google , bing and a new perspective on ranking similarity in this paper , we propose a framework to characterize and compare two search-engine-results . typical user-queries are ambiguous and , consequentially , each search-engine will compute ranks in different manners , attempting to answer them in the best possible way . thus , each search-engine will have its own bias . given the importance of the first page results in web-search-engines , in this paper we propose a framework to assess the information presented in the first page by measuring the information-entropy and the correlations between two ranks . employing the recently proposed rank-biased-overlap measure [2] we compare to which extent do bing and google rankings in fact differ . we also extend this measure and propose a measure for comparing the information-entropy present in two ranks . the proposed measure is based on the correlation of two ranks and the application of jensen-shannon 's divergence among two document-sets . our methodology starts with 40,000 user queries and crawls the search-results for these queries on both search-engines . the results allow us to determine the search-engines correlations , crawling coverage , information overlap , and information entropy .
