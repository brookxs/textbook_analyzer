matching directories and owl ontologies with aroma this paper presents a simple and adaptable matching-method dealing with web-directories , catalogs and owl ontologies . by using a well-known knowledge-discovery-in-databases model , such as the association-rule paradigm , this method has the originality to be both extensional and asymmetric . it works at the terminological level (by selecting concept-relevant terms contained in documents) and permits to discover equivalence and also subsumption relations holding between entities (concepts and properties) . this method relies on the implication intensity measure , a probabilistic-model of deviation from independence . selection of significant rules between concepts (or properties) is lead by two criteria permitting to assess respectively the implication quality and the generativity of the rule . finally , the proposed method is evaluated on two benchmarks . the first contains two conceptual-hierarchies populated with textual-documents and the second one is composed of owl ontologies .
