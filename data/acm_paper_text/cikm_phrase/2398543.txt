query-biased learning-to-rank for real-time twitter search by incorporating diverse sources of evidence of relevance , learning-to-rank has been widely applied to real-time twitter search , where users are interested in fresh relevant messages . such approaches usually rely on a set of training queries to learn a general ranking-model , which we believe that the benefits brought by learning-to-rank may not have been fully exploited as the characteristics and aspects unique to the given target queries are ignored . in this paper , we propose to further improve the retrieval-performance of learning-to-rank for real-time twitter search , by taking the difference between queries into consideration . in particular , we learn a query-biased ranking-model with a semi-supervised transductive-learning algorithm so that the query-specific features , e.g. the unique expansion terms , are utilized to capture the characteristics of the target query . this query-biased ranking-model is combined with the general ranking-model to produce the final ranked list of tweets in response to the given target query . extensive experiments on the standard trec tweets11 collection show that our proposed query-biased learning-to-rank approach outperforms strong baseline , namely the conventional application of the state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithms .
