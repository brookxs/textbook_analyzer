semantic data markets : a flexible environment for knowledge-management we present nyaya , a system for the management of semantic-web data which couples a general-purpose and extensible storage mechanism with efficient ontology reasoning and querying capabilities . nyaya processes large semantic-web datasets , expressed in multiple formalisms , by transforming them into a collection of semantic data kiosks . nyaya uniformly exposes the native meta-data of each kiosk using the datalog + - language , a powerful rule-based modelling-language for ontological-databases . the kiosks form a semantic data market where the data in each kiosk can be uniformly accessed using conjunctive-queries and where users can specify user-defined constraints over the data . nyaya is easily extensible and robust to updates of both data and meta-data in the kiosk and can readily adapt to different logical organization of the persistent-storage . the approach has been experimented using well-known benchmarks , and compared to state-of-the-art research prototypes and commercial systems .
