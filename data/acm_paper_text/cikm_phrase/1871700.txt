intelligent sales-forecasting engine using genetic-algorithms times-series techniques have been extensively used for sales-forecasting . research has established that a combination forecast works better than a single forecast . our research attempts to design an intelligent forecasting engine which will use a combination forecasting technique . this design is based on use of genetic-algorithms , for selecting the best methods to combine for forecasting . early results demonstrate that genetic-algorithms have the potential to become a powerful tool for time-series sales-forecasting .
