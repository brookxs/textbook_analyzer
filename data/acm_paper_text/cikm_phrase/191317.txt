facilitating transformations in a human-genome-project database human-genome-project databases present a confluence of interesting database challenges : rapid schema and data-evolution , complex-data entry and constraint management , and the need to integrate multiple data sources and software-systems which range over a wide variety of models and formats . while these challenges are not necessarily unique to biological-databases , their combination , intensity and complexity are unusual and make automated solutions imperative . we illustrate these problems in the context of the philadelphia genome center for human chromosome 22 , and describe a new approach to a solution for these problems , by means of a deductive language for expressing database transformations and-constraints .
