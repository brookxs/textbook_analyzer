a new probabilistic-model for top-k-ranking problem this paper is concerned with top-k-ranking problem , which reflects the fact that people pay more attention to the top ranked objects in real ranking application like information-retrieval . a popular approach to top-k-ranking problem is based on probabilistic-models , such as luce model and mallows model . however , whether the sequential generative-process described in these models is a suitable way for top-k-ranking remains a question . according to the riffled independence factorization proposed in recent literature , which is a natural structural assumption on top-k-ranking , we propose a new generative-process of top-k-ranking data . our approach decomposes distributions over the top-k-ranking into two layers : the first layer describes the relative ordering between the top k objects and the rest n-k objects , and the second layer describes the full ordering on the top k objects . on this basis , we propose a new probabilistic-model for top-k-ranking problem , called hierarchical ordering model . specifically , we use three different probabilistic-models to describe different generative processes of the first layer , and luce model to describe the sequential generative-process of the second layer , thus we obtain three different specific hierarchical ordering models . we also conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to show that our proposed models can outperform previous models significantly .
