query likelihood with negative query-generation the query likelihood retrieval-function has proven to be empirically effective for many retrieval tasks . from theoretical perspective , however , the justification of the standard query likelihood retrieval-function requires an unrealistic assumption that ignores the generation of a `` negative query '' from a document . this suggests that it is a potentially non-optimal retrieval-function . in this paper , we attempt to improve the query likelihood-function by bringing back the negative query-generation . we propose an effective approach to estimate the probabilities of negative query-generation based on the principle of maximum-entropy , and derive a more complete query likelihood retrieval-function that also contains the negative query-generation-component . the proposed approach not only bridges the theoretical gap in the existing query likelihood retrieval-function , but also improves retrieval-effectiveness significantly with no additional computational cost .
