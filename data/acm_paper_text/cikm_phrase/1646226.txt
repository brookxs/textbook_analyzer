comprehenrank : estimating comprehension in classroom by absorbing-random-walks on a cognitive graph this paper develops a graph-theoretic framework for estimating comprehension in classroom . to deal with imprecise-data gathered in classroom , we propose multi-step comprehension propagation over a semantic-graph . random-walks on the graph measure students ' comprehension with probabilities absorbed at student nodes .
