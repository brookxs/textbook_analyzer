low-cost management of inverted-files for online full-text-search in dynamic-environments with frequent content updates , we require online full-text-search that scales to large-data collections and achieves low search latency . several recent methods that support fast incremental-indexing of documents typically keep on disk multiple partial index-structures that they continuously update as new documents are added . however , spreading indexing information across multiple locations on disk tends to considerably decrease the search responsiveness of the system . in the present paper , we take a fresh look at the problem of online full-text-search with consideration of the architectural features of modern systems . selective range flush is a greedy-method that we introduce to manage the index in the system by using fixed-size blocks to organize the data on disk and dynamically keep low the cost of data-transfer between memory and disk . as we experimentally demonstrate with the proteus prototype-implementation that we developed , we retrieve indexing information at latency that matches the lowest achieved by existing methods . additionally , we reduce the total building cost by 30 \ % in comparison to methods with similar retrieval-time .
