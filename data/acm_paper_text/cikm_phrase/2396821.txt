collective-intelligence in the online-social-network of yahoo!answers and its implications question-and-answer (q &#38; a) websites such as yahoo!answers provide a platform where users can post questions and receive answers . these systems take advantage of the collective-intelligence of users to find information . in this paper , we analyze the online social-network (osn) in yahoo!answers . based on a large amount of our collected data , we studied the osn 's structural-properties , which reveals strikingly distinct properties such as low link symmetry and weak correlation between indegree and outdegree . after studying the knowledge-base and behaviors of the users , we find that a small number of top contributors answer most of the questions in the system . also , each top contributor focuses on only a few knowledge categories . in addition , the knowledge categories of the users are highly clustered . we also study the knowledge-base in a user 's social-network , which reveals that the members in a user 's social-network share only a few knowledge categories . based on the findings , we provide guidance in the design of spammer detection-algorithms and distributed q &#38; a systems . we also propose a friendship-knowledge oriented q &#38; a framework that synergically combines current osn-based q &#38; a and web q &#38; a . we believe that the results presented in this paper are crucial in understanding the collective-intelligence in the web q &#38; a osns and lay a cornerstone for the evolution of next-generation q &#38; a systems .
