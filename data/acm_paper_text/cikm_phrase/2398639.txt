on using category experts for improving the performance and accuracy in recommender-systems a variety of recommendation-methods have been proposed to satisfy the performance and accuracy ; however , it is fairly difficult to satisfy both of them because there is a trade-off between them . in this paper , we introduce the notion of category experts and propose the recommendation-method by exploiting the ratings of category experts instead of those of the users similar to a target user . we also extend the method that uses both the category preference of a target user and his/her similarity to category experts . we show that our method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of performance and accuracy through extensive experiments with real-world-data .
