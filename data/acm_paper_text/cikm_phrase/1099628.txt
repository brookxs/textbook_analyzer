domain-specific keyphrase-extraction document keyphrases provide semantic-metadata characterizing documents and producing an overview of the content of a document . they can be used in many text-mining and knowledge-management related applications . this paper describes a keyphrase identification program (kip) , which extracts document keyphrases by using prior positive samples of human identified domain keyphrases to assign weights to the candidate keyphrases . the logic of our algorithm is : the more keywords a candidate keyphrase contains and the more significant these keywords are , the more likely this candidate phrase is a keyphrase . to obtain prior positive inputs , kip first populates its glossary database using manually identified keyphrases and keywords . it then checks the composition of all noun-phrases of a document , looks up the database and calculates scores for all these noun-phrases . the ones having higher scores will be extracted as keyphrases .
