on sparsity and drift for effective real-time-filtering in microblogs in this paper , we approach the problem of real-time-filtering in the twitter microblogging platform . we adapt an effective traditional news-filtering technique , which uses a text-classifier inspired by rocchio 's relevance-feedback algorithm , to build and dynamically update a profile of the user 's interests in real-time . in our adaptation , we tackle two challenges that are particularly prevalent in twitter : sparsity and drift . in particular , sparsity stems from the brevity of tweets , while drift occurs as events related to the topic develop or the interests of the user change . first , to tackle the acute sparsity-problem , we apply query-expansion to derive terms or related tweets for a richer initialisation of the user-interests within the profile . second , to deal with drift , we modify the user-profile to balance between the importance of the short-term-interests , i.e. emerging subtopics , and the long-term interests in the overall topic . moreover , we investigate an event-detection method from twitter and newswire streams to predict times at which drift may happen . through experiments using the trec microblog track 2012 , we show that our approach is effective for a number of common filtering metrics such as the user 's utility , and that it compares favourably with state-of-the-art news-filtering baselines . our results also uncover the impact of different factors on handling topic drifting .
