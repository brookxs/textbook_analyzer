polyhedral transformation for indexed rank-order correlation queries rank-order correlation has been used extensively when the data is non-parametric or when the relationship between two variables is nonlinear and monotonic . in such cases , linear correlation measures , such as the product-moment coefficient , are inadequate and fail to detect correlative relations . we present a polyhedral indexing-technique for rank-order correlation queries for time-series-data . we use an interesting geometry interpretation of rank-order correlation which lends itself to indexing by spatial-indexes such as r-trees . our experimental-results indicate one to two orders of magnitudes improvement over sequential-scan - the only alternative solution .
