where shall we go today ? : planning touristic tours with tripbuilder in this paper we propose tripbuilder , a new framework for personalized touristic tour planning . we mine from flickr the information about the actual itineraries followed by a multitude of different tourists , and we match these itineraries on the touristic point of interests available from wikipedia . the task of planning personalized touristic tours is then modeled as an instance of the generalized maximum coverage-problem . wisdom-of-the-crowds information allows us to derive touristic plans that maximize a measure of interest for the tourist given her preferences and visiting time-budget . experimental-results on three different touristic cities show that our approach is effective and outperforms strong baselines .
