learning-to-rank categories for web-queries in web-search , understanding-the-user intent plays an important role in improving search experience of the end-users . such an intent can be represented by the categories which the user-query belongs to . in this work , we propose an information-retrieval_based approach to query-categorization with an emphasis on learning category rankings . to carry out categorization we first represent a category by web-documents (from open-directory-project) that describe the semantics of the category . then , we learn the category rankings for the queries using ` learning-to-rank ' techniques . to show that the results obtained are consistent and do not vary across datasets , we evaluate our approach on two datasets including the publicly available kdd cup dataset . we report an overall improvement of 20 \ % on all evaluation-metrics (precision , recall and f-measure) over two baselines : a text-categorization baseline and an unsupervised ir baseline .
