on the elasticity of nosql databases over cloud-management platforms nosql databases focus on analytical processing of large-scale datasets , offering increased scalability over commodity-hardware . one of their strongest features is elasticity , which allows for fairly portioned premiums and high-quality performance and directly applies to the philosophy of a cloud-based platform . yet , the process of adaptive expansion and contraction of resources usually involves a lot of manual effort during cluster configuration . to date , there exists no comparative-study to quantify this cost and measure the efficacy of nosql engines that offer this feature over a cloud-provider . in this work , we present a cloud-enabled framework for adaptive-monitoring of nosql systems . we perform a study of the elasticity feature on some of the most popular nosql databases over an open-source cloud-platform . based on these measurements , we finally present a prototype-implementation of a decision-making system that enables automatic elastic operations of any nosql engine based on administrator or application-specified constraints .
