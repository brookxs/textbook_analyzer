a word-order_based graph-representation for relevance identification in this paper we propose a new word-order_based graph-representation for text . in our graph-representation vertices represent words or phrases and edges represent relations between contiguous words or phrases . the graph-representation also includes dependency-information . our text-representation is suitable for applications involving the identification of relevance or paraphrases across texts , where word-order information would be useful . we show that this word-order_based graph-representation performs better than a dependency-tree representation while identifying the relevance of one piece of text to another .
