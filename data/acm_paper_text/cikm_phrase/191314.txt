finding interesting-rules from large-sets of discovered association-rules association-rules , introduced by agrawal , imielinski , and swami , are rules of the form for 90 \ % of the rows of the relation , if the row has value 1 in the columns in set w , then it has 1 also in column b . efficient methods exist for discovering association-rules from large-collections of data . the number of discovered rules can , however , be so large that browsing the rule-set and finding interesting-rules from it can be quite difficult for the user . we show how a simple formalism of rule templates makes it possible to easily describe the structure of interesting-rules . we also give examples of visualization of rules , and show how a visualization-tool interfaces with rule templates .
