coolcat : an entropy-based-algorithm for categorical-clustering in this paper we explore the connection between clustering categorical-data and entropy : clusters of similar poi lower entropy than those of dissimilar ones . we use this connection to design an incremental heuristic algorithm , coolcat , which is capable of efficiently clustering large-data-sets of records with categorical attributes , and data-streams . in contrast with other categorical-clustering algorithms published in the past , coolcat 's clustering results are very stable for different sample sizes and parameter-settings . also , the criteria for clustering is a very intuitive one , since it is deeply rooted on the well-known notion of entropy . most importantly , coolcat is well equipped to deal with clustering of data-streams (continuously arriving streams of data point) since it is an incremental-algorithm capable of clustering new points without having to look at every point that has been clustered so far . we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of coolcat by a series of experiments on real and synthetic-data sets .
