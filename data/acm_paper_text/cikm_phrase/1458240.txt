identification of class specific discourse-patterns in this paper we address the problem of extracting important (and unimportant) discourse-patterns from call-center conversations . call-centers provide dialog based calling-in support for customers to address their queries , requests and complaints . a call-center is the direct interface between an organization and its customers and it is important to capture the voice-of-customer by gathering insights into the customer-experience . we have observed that the calls received at a call-center contain segments within them that follow specific patterns that are typical of the issue being addressed in the call . we present methods to extract such patterns from the calls . we show that by aggregating over a few hundred calls , specific discourse-patterns begin to emerge for each class of calls . further , we show that such discourse-patterns are useful for classifying calls and for identifying parts of the calls that provide insights into customer behaviour .
