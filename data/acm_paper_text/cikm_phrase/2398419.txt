cgstream : continuous correlated graph-query for data-streams in this paper , we propose to query correlated graph in a data-stream scenario , where given a query-graph q an algorithm is required to retrieve all the subgraphs whose pearson 's correlation coefficients with q are greater than a threshold &#920; over some graph-data flowing in a stream fashion . due to the dynamic changing nature of the stream-data and the inherent complexity of the graph-query process , treating graph streams as static datasets is computationally infeasible or ineffective . in the paper , we propose a novel algorithm , cgstream , to identify correlated graphs from data-stream , by using a sliding-window which covers a number of consecutive batches of stream-data records . our theme is to regard stream query as the traversing along a data-stream and the query is achieved at a number of outlooks over the data-stream . for each outlook , we derive a lower frequency bound to mine a set of frequent-subgraph candidates , where the lower-bound guarantees that no pattern is missing from the current outlook to the next outlook . on top of that , we derive an upper correlation bound and a heuristic-rule to prune the candidate size , which helps reduce the computation-cost at each outlook . experimental-results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is several times , or even an order of magnitude , more efficient than the straightforward algorithm . meanwhile , our algorithm achieves good performance in terms of query precision .
