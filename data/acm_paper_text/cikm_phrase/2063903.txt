relative effect of spam and irrelevant documents on user-interaction with search-engines meaningful evaluation of web-search must take account of spam . here we conduct a user-experiment to investigate whether satisfaction with search-engine result pages as a whole is harmed more by spam or by irrelevant documents . on some measures , search result pages are differentially harmed by the insertion of spam and irrelevant documents . additionally we find that when users are given two documents of equal utility , the one with the lower spam score will be preferred ; a result page without any spam documents will be preferred to one with spam ; and an irrelevant document high in a result list is surprisingly more damaging to user-satisfaction than a spam document . we conclude that web-ranking and evaluation should consider both utility (relevance) and `` spamminess '' of documents .
