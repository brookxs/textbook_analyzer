mining-data-streams with periodically changing distributions dynamic-data streams are those whose underlying distribution changes over time . they occur in a number of application-domains , and mining them is important for these applications . coupled with the unboundedness and high arrival rates of data-streams , the dynamism of the underlying distribution makes data-mining challenging . in this paper , we focus on a large class of dynamic streams that exhibit periodicity in distribution changes . we propose a framework , called dmm , for mining this class of streams that includes a new change-detection technique and a novel match-and-reuse approach . once a distribution-change is detected , we compare the new distribution with a set of historically observed distribution-patterns and use the mining results from the past if a match is detected . since , for two highly similar distributions , their mining results should also present high similarity , by matching and reusing existing mining results , the overall stream-mining efficiency is improved while the accuracy is maintained . our experimental-results confirm this conjecture .
