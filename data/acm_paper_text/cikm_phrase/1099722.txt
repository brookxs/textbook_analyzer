regularizing ad-hoc-retrieval scores the cluster-hypothesis states : closely related documents tend to be relevant to the same request . we exploit this hypothesis directly by adjusting ad-hoc-retrieval scores from an initial retrieval so that topically related documents receive similar scores . we refer to this process as score regularization . score regularization can be presented as an optimization-problem , allowing the use of results from semi-supervised-learning . we demonstrate that regularized scores consistently and significantly rank documents better than unregularized scores , given a variety of initial retrieval algorithms . we evaluate our method on two large-corpora across a substantial number of topics .
