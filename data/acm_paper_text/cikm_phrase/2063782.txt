finding all justifications of owl entailments using tms and mapreduce finding all justifications of an owl entailment is an important reasoning service for explaining logical inconsistencies . in this paper , we consider finding all justifications of an entailment in owl pd * fragment , which is a fragment of owl that makes possible decidable rule extensions of owl . we first propose a novel approach to find all justifications of owl pd * entailments using tms and show the complexity of this approach . this approach is limited by the hardware capabilities of standalone systems . in order to improve its scalability to handle large-scale semantic data , we optimize the proposed approach by exploiting the mapreduce technology . we implement our approach and the optimization , and do experiments on synthetic and real-world data-sets . evaluation results show that our approach has the ability to scale to more than one billion triples .
