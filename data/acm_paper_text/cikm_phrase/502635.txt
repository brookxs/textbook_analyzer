effective arabic-english cross-language-information-retrieval via machine-readable dictionaries and machine-translation in cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) , queries in one language retrieve relevant documents in other languages machine-readable-dictionary (mrd) and machine-translation (mt) are important resources for query-translation in clir . we investigate mt and mrd to arabic-english clir . the translation-ambiguity associated with these resources is the key problem . we present three methods of query-translation using a bilingual-dictionary for arabic-english clir . first , we present the every-match (em) method . this method yields ambiguous translations since many extraneous terms are added to the original query . to disambiguate the query-translation , we present the first-match (fm) method that considers the first match in the dictionary as the candidate-term . finally , we present the two-phase (tp) method . we show that good retrieval-effectiveness can be achieved without complex resources using the two-phase method for arabic-english clir . we also empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the mt-based method using short , medium , and long-queries from trec . the effects of the query-length on the quality of the mt-based clir are investigated .
