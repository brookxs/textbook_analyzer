fast approximation of steiner-trees in large-graphs finding the minimum connected subtree of a graph that contains a given set of nodes (i.e. , the steiner-tree-problem) is a fundamental operation in keyword-search in graphs , yet it is known to be np-hard . existing approximation techniques either make use of the heavy indexing of the graph , or entirely rely on online heuristics . in this paper we bridge the gap between these two extremes and present a scalable landmark-based index-structure that , combined with a few lightweight online heuristics , yields a fast and accurate approximation of the steiner-tree . our solution handles real-world graphs with millions of nodes and provides an approximation error of less than 5 % on average .
