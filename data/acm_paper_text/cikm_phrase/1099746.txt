y!q : contextual-search at the point of inspiration contextual-search tries to better capture a user 's information-need by augmenting the user 's query with contextual-information extracted from the search-context (for example , terms from the-web page the user is currently reading or a file the user is currently editing) . this paper presents y!q -- a first of its kind large-scale contextual-search system -- and provides an overview of its system-design and architecture . y!q solves two major problems . first , how to capture high quality search-context . second , how to use that context in a way to improve the relevancy of search queries . to address the first problem , y!q introduces an information widget that captures precise search-context and provides convenient access to its functionality at the point of inspiration . for example , y!q can be easily embedded into web-pages using a web-api , or it can be integrated into a web-browser toolbar . this paper provides an overview of y!q 's user-interaction-design , highlighting its novel aspects for capturing high quality search context.to address the second problem , y!q uses a semantic-network for analyzing search-context , possibly resolving ambiguous terms , and generating a contextual digest comprising its key concepts . this digest is passed through a query planner and rewriting framework for augmenting a user 's search-query with relevant context-terms to improve the overall search relevancy and experience . we show experimental-results comparing contextual y!q search-results side-by-side with regular yahoo! web-search-results . this evaluation suggests that y!q results are considered significantly more relevant.the paper also identifies interesting research problems and argues that contextual-search may represent the next major step in the evolution of web-search-engines .
