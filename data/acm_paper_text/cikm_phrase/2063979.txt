subject-oriented top-k hot-region queries in spatial dataset this paper proposes and solves a novel type of spatial-queries named subject-oriented top-k hot-region (str) queries . given a subject s defined by a feature-set r and features importance denoted by weights , an str query retrieves k non-overlapping regions that have the highest scores computed by the number of feature objects and their weights . as an example , the culture subject is defined by exhibition halls , libraries and museums . on the subject , an str query finds cultural centers intensively distributed feature objects . in this paper , we propose two efficient-algorithms , single-partition (sp) algorithm and dual-partition (dp) algorithm , to process str queries . extensive experiments evaluate the proposed solutions under a wide range of parameter-settings .
