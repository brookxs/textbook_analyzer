entity-based query-reformulation using wikipedia many real-world-applications increasingly involve both structured-data and text , and entity_based retrieval is an important problem in this realm . in this paper , we present an automatic query reformulation approach based on entities detected in each query . the aim is to utilize semantics associated with entities for enhancing document-retrieval . this is done by expanding a query with terms/phrases related to entities in the query . we exploit wikipedia as a large repository of entity information . our reformulated approach consists of three major steps : (1) detect representative entity in a query ; (2) expand the query with entity related terms/phrases ; and (3) facilitate term-dependency features . we evaluate our approach in ad-hoc-retrieval task on four trec collections , including two large web collections . experiments results show that significant improvement is possible by utilizing entity corresponding information .
