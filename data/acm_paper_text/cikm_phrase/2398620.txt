information-propagation in social-rating-networks the polarity of opinion is a crucial part of information and ignoring the asymmetry between them , can potentially result in an inaccurate estimation of the number of product adoptions and incorrect recommendations . we analyze the propagation patterns of the negative and positive opinions on two real-world datasets , flixster and epinions , and observe that the presence of negative opinions significantly reduces the number of expressed opinions . to account for the asymmetry between the two kind of opinions , we propose extensions of the two most popular information-propagation models , independent cascade and linear-threshold models . the proposed extensions give a tractable influence problem and improves the prediction-accuracy of future opinions , by more than 3 % on flixster and 5 % on epinions datasets .
