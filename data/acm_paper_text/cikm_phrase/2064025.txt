annotating knowledge-work lifelog : term-extraction from sensor and operation-history we present a system that supports review of a knowledge-work lifelog as an activity-history . since knowledge-workers often review their own activity histories , gathering each user 's activities on his/her terminal as a lifelog is a promising approach . however , readability of the stored lifelog is a large problem of lifelog-based application . we propose a term-extraction method to add annotation labels to the stored lifelog for supporting knowledge-workers , exploiting text-data acquired from desktop activities . our prototype-system monitors a user 's desktop activities after combining raw events , and then extracts possible annotation labels with lda and c-value techniques from documents and text-data in sensor events . in this paper , we introduce a lifelogging module and a lifelog annotation method based on term-extraction techniques . according to an empirical-evaluation for three weeks , we found that the current method is useful for one-week review .
