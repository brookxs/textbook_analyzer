proactive-learning : cost-sensitive-active-learning with multiple imperfect oracles proactive-learning is a generalization of active-learning designed to relax unrealistic assumptions and thereby reach practical applications . active-learning seeks to select the most informative unlabeled instances and ask an omniscient oracle for their labels , so as to retrain the learning-algorithm maximizing accuracy . however , the oracle is assumed to be infallible (never wrong) , indefatigable (always answers) , individual (only one oracle) , and insensitive to costs (always free or always charges the same) . proactive-learning relaxes all four of these assumptions , relying on a decision-theoretic-approach to jointly select the optimal oracle and instance , by casting the problem as a utility optimization-problem subject to a budget constraint . results on multi-oracle optimization over several data-sets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the single-imperfect-oracle baselines in most cases .
