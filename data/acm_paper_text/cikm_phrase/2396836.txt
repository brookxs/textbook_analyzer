enabling direct interest-aware audience-selection advertisers typically have a fairly accurate idea of the interests of their target-audience . however , today 's online-advertising systems are unable to leverage this information . the reasons are two-fold . first , there is no agreed upon vocabulary of interests for advertisers and advertising systems to communicate . more importantly , advertising systems lack a mechanism for mapping users to the interest vocabulary . in this paper , we tackle both problems . we present a system for direct interest-aware audience-selection . this system takes the query histories of search-engine users as input , extracts their interests , and describes them with interpretable labels . the labels are not drawn from a predefined taxonomy , but rather dynamically generated from the query histories , and are thus easy for the advertisers to interpret and use for targeting users . in addition , the system enables seamless addition of interest labels that may be provided by the advertiser .
