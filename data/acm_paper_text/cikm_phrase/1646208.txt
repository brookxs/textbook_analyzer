automatic link detection : a sequence-labeling approach the popularity of wikipedia and other online knowledge-bases has recently produced an interest in the machine-learning community for the problem of automatic-linking . automatic-hyperlinking can be viewed as two sub problems - link-detection which determines the source of a link , and link disambiguation which determines the destination of a link . wikipedia is a rich corpus with hyperlink data provided by authors . it is possible to use this data to train classifiers to be able to mimic the authors in some capacity . in this paper , we introduce automatic link detection as a sequence-labeling problem . conditional-random-fields (crfs) are a probabilistic-framework for labeling sequential-data . we show that training a crf with different types of features from the wikipedia dataset can be used to automatically detect links with almost perfect precision and high recall .
