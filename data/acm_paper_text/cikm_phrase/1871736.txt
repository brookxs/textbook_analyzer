efficient wikipedia-based semantic-interpreter by exploiting top-k-processing proper representation of the meaning of texts is crucial to enhancing many data-mining and information-retrieval-tasks , including clustering , computing semantic-relatedness between texts , and searching . representing of texts in the concept-space derived from wikipedia has received growing attention recently , due to its comprehensiveness and expertise , this concept-based representation is capable of extracting semantic-relatedness between texts that can not be deduced with the bag-of-words-model . a key obstacle , however , for using wikipedia as a semantic-interpreter is that the sheer size of the concepts derived from wikipedia makes it hard to efficiently map texts into concept-space . in this paper , we develop an efficient-algorithm which is able to represent the meaning of a text by using the concepts that best match it . in particular , our approach first computes the approximate top - k concepts that are most relevant to the given text . we then leverage these concepts for representing the meaning of the given text . the experimental-results show that the proposed technique provides significant gains in execution-time over current solutions to the problem .
