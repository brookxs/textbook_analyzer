a study on the effects of personalization and task information on implicit-feedback performance while implicit-relevance-feedback (irf) algorithms exploit users ' interactions with information to customize support offered to users of search systems , it is unclear how individual and task-differences impact the effectiveness of such algorithms . in this paper we describe a study on the effect on retrieval-performance of using additional-information about the user and their search-tasks when developing irf algorithms . we tested four algorithms that use document-display time to estimate relevance , and tailored the threshold times (i.e. , the time distinguishing relevance from non-relevance) to the task , the user , a combination of both , or neither . interaction logs gathered during a longitudinal naturalistic-study of online-information-seeking behavior are used as stimuli for the algorithms . the findings show that tailoring display-time thresholds based on task information improves irf algorithm-performance , but doing so based on user-information worsens performance . this has implications for the development of effective irf algorithms .
