detection of orthogonal concepts in subspaces of high-dimensional-data in the knowledge-discovery-process , clustering is an established technique for grouping objects based on mutual similarity . however , in today 's applications for each object very many attributes are provided . as multiple concepts described by different attributes are mixed in the same data-set , clusters do not appear in all dimensions . in these high-dimensional-data spaces , each object can be clustered in several projections of the data . however , recent clustering-techniques do not succeed in detection of these orthogonal concepts hidden in the data . they either miss multiple concepts for each object by partitioning approaches or provide redundant clusters in very similar subspaces . in this work we propose a novel clustering-method aiming only at orthogonal concept-detection in subspaces of the data . unlike existing clustering approaches , osclu (orthogonal subspace clustering) detects for each object the orthogonal concepts described by differing attributes while pruning similar concepts . thus , each detected cluster in an orthogonal subspace provides novel information about the hidden structure of the data . thorough experiments on real and synthetic-data show that osclu yields substantial quality improvements over existing clustering approaches .
