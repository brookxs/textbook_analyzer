mining soft-matching association-rules variation and noise in database entries can prevent data-mining-algorithms , such as association-rule-mining , from discovering important regularities . in particular , textual fields can exhibit variation due to typographical-errors , mispellings , abbreviations , etc. . by allowing partial or `` soft matching '' of items based on a similarity-metric such as edit-distance or cosine-similarity , additional important patterns can be detected . this paper introduces an algorithm , softapriori that discovers soft-matching association-rules given a user-supplied similarity-metric for each field . experimental-results on several `` noisy '' datasets extracted from text demonstrate that softapriori discovers additional relationships that more accurately reflect regularities in the data .
