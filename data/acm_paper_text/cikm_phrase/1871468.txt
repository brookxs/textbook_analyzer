mining interesting link-formation rules in social-networks link-structures are important patterns one looks out for when modeling and analyzing social-networks . in this paper , we propose the task of mining interesting link-formation rules (lf-rules) containing link-structures known as link-formation patterns (lf-patterns) . lf-patterns capture various dyadic and/or triadic structures among groups of nodes , while lf-rules capture the formation of a new link from a focal node to another node as a postcondition of existing connections between the two nodes . we devise a novel lf-rule mining algorithm , known as lfr-miner , based on frequent-subgraph-mining for our task . in addition to using a support-confidence framework for measuring the frequency and significance of lf-rules , we introduce the notion of expected-support to account for the extent to which lf-rules exist in a social-network by chance . specifically , only lf-rules with higher-than-expected support are considered interesting . we conduct empirical-studies on two real-world social-networks , namely epinions and mygamma . we report interesting lf-rules mined from the two networks , and compare our findings with earlier findings in social-network-analysis .
