virtual cursors for xml joins structural-joins are a fundamental operation in xml-query-processing and a large body of work has focused on index-based algorithms for executing them . in this paper , we describe how two well-known index features -- path indices and ancestor information -- can be combined in a novel way to replace one or more of the physical index cursors in a structural-join with <i> virtual cursors </i> . the position of a virtual cursor is derived from the path and ancestor information of a physical cursor . implementation results are provided to show that , by eliminating index i/o , virtual cursors can improve the performance of structural-joins by an order of magnitude or more .
