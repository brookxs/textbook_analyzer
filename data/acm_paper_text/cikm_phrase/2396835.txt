daily-deal selection for revenue-maximization daily-deal sites (dds) like groupon , livingsocial , amazon 's goldbox , and many more , have become particularly popular over the last three years , providing discounted offers to customers for restaurants , ticketed events , services etc. . in this paper , we study the following problem : among a set of candidate deals , which are the ones that a dds should feature as daily-deals in order to maximize its revenue ? our first contribution lies in providing two combinatorial formulations of this problem . both formulations take into account factors like the diversification of daily-deals and the limited consuming capacity of the userbase . we prove that our problems are np-hard and devise pseudopolynomial -- time approximation-algorithms for their solution . we also propose a set of heuristics , and demonstrate their efficiency in our experiments . in the context of deal selection and scheduling , we acknowledge the importance of the ability to estimate the expected revenue of a candidate deal . we explore the nature of this task in the context of real-data , and propose a framework for revenue-estimation . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our entire methodology in an experimental-evaluation on a large dataset of daily-deals from groupon .
