hierarchical image annotation using semantic hierarchies semantic hierarchies have been introduced recently to improve image-annotation . they was used as a framework for hierarchical image classification , and thus to improve classifiers accuracy and reduce the complexity of managing large-scale-data . in this paper , we investigate the contribution of semantic hierarchies for hierarchical image classification . we propose first a new method based on the hierarchy-structure to train efficiently hierarchical-classifiers . our method , named one-versus-opposite-nodes , allows decomposing the problem in several independent-tasks and therefore scales well with large database . we also propose two methods for computing a hierarchical decision function that serves to annotate new image samples . the former is performed by a top-down classifiers voting , while the second is based on a bottom-up score-fusion . the experiments on pascal voc ' 2010 dataset showed that our methods improve well the image-annotation results .
