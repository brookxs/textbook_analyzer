the gardener 's problem for web-information-monitoring we introduce and theoretically study the gardener 's problem that well models many web-information-monitoring scenarios , where numerous dynamically changing web sources are monitored and local-information needs to be periodically updated under communication and computation capacity constraints . typical such examples include maintenance of inverted-indexes for search-engines and maintenance of extracted structures for unstructured-data management-systems . we formulate a corresponding multicriteria-optimization problem and propose heuristic-solutions .
