learning-to-rank audience for behavioral-targeting in display-ads behavioral-targeting (bt) , which aims to sell advertisers those behaviorally related user segments to deliver their advertisements , is facing a bottleneck in serving the rapid growth of long-tail advertisers . due to the small-business nature of the tail advertisers , they generally expect to accurately reach a small group of audience , which is hard to be satisfied by classical bt solutions with large size user segments . in this paper , we propose a novel probabilistic-generative-model named rank latent-dirichlet-allocation (ranklda) to rank audience according to their ads click probabilities for the-long-tail advertisers to deliver their ads . based on the basic assumption that users who clicked the same group of ads will have a higher probability of sharing similar latent search topical interests , ranklda combines topic-discovery from users ' search-behaviors and learning-to-rank users from their ads click behaviors together . in computation , the topic-learning could be enhanced by the supervised information of the rank learning and simultaneously , the rank learning could be better optimized by considering the discovered topics as features . this co-optimization scheme enhances each other iteratively . experiments over the real click-through log of display-ads in a public ad network show that the proposed ranklda model can effectively rank the audience for the tail advertisers .
