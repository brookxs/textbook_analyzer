ontocube : efficient ontology-extraction using olap cubes ontologies are knowledge conceptualizations of a particular domain and are commonly represented with hierarchies . while final ontologies appear deceivingly simple on paper , building ontologies represents a time-consuming task that is normally performed by natural-language-processing-techniques or schema-matching . on the other hand , olap cubes are most commonly used during decision-making-processes via the analysis-of-data summarizations . in this paper , we present a novel approach based on using olap cubes for ontology-extraction . the resulting ontology is obtained through an analytical process of the summarized frequencies of keywords within a corpus . the solution was implemented within a relational-database system (dbms) . in our experiments , we show how all the proposed discrimination measures (frequency , correlation , lift) affect the resulting classes . we also show a sample ontology result and the accuracy of finding true classes . finally , we show the performance breakdown of our algorithm .
