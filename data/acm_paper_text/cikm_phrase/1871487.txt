inferring gender of movie reviewers : exploiting writing style , content and metadata despite differences in the way that men and women experience-goods and communicate their perspectives , online-review communities typically do not provide participants ' gender . we propose to infer author gender , given a set of reviews of a particular item , and experiment on reviews posted at the-internet movie database (imdb) . using logistic-regression , we explore the contribution of three types of information : 1) style , 2) content , and 3) metadata (e.g. review age , social-feedback) . our results concur with previous research , in that there are salient differences in writing style and content between reviews authored by men versus women . however , in comparison to literary or scientific texts , to which classification-tasks are often applied , reviews are brief and occur within the context of an ongoing discourse . therefore , to compensative for the brevity of reviews , content and stylistic features can be augmented with metadata . we find in particular that the perceived utility of a review is an important correlate of gender . the model incorporating all features has a classification-accuracy of 73.7 \ % and is not as sensitive to review length as are those based only on stylistic or content-features .
