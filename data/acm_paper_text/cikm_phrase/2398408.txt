non-stationary bayesian-networks based on perfect-simulation non-stationary dynamic-bayesian-networks (non-stationary dbns) are widely used to model the temporal-changes of directed dependency-structures from multivariate-time-series data . however , the existing change-points based non-stationary dbns methods have several drawbacks including excessive computational cost , and low convergence-speed . in this paper we proposed a novel non-stationary dbns method . our method is based on the perfect-simulation model . we applied this approach for network-structure inference from synthetic-data and biological microarray gene-expression-data and compared it with other two state-of-the-art non-stationary dbns methods . the experimental-results demonstrated that our method outperformed two other state-of-the-art methods in both computational cost and structure-prediction accuracy . the further sensitivity-analysis showed that once converged our model is robust to large parameter ranges , which reduces the uncertainty of the model behavior .
