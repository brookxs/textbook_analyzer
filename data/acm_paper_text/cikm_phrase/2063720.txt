improving user-interest inference from social neighbors prior research has provided some evidence of social-correlation (i.e. , `` you are who you know '') , which makes it possible to infer one 's interests from his or her social neighbors . however , it is also shown to be challenging to consistently obtain high quality inference . this challenge can be partially attributed to the fact that people usually maintain diverse social-relationships , in order to tap into diverse information and knowledge . it is unlikely that a person would possess all interests of his/her social neighbors . instead , s/he may selectively acquire just a subset of them . this paper intends to improve inferring interests from neighbors given this observation . we conduct this study by implementing a privacy-preserving large distributed social-sensor system in a large global it company to capture the multifaceted activities (e.g. , emails , instant-messaging , social-bookmarking , etc.) of 25k + people . these activities occupy the majority of employees ' time , and thus , provide a higher quality view of the diverse aspects of their professional interests compared to the friending activity on online-social-networking sites . in this paper , we propose a technique that exploits the correlation among the attributes that a person possesses to improve social-correlation-based inference quality . our technique offers two unique contributions . first , we demonstrate that the proposed technique can significantly improve inference quality by as much as 76.1 \ % . second , we study the interaction between the two factors : social-correlation and attribute-correlation under different situations . the results can inform practical applications how the inference quality would change in various scenarios .
