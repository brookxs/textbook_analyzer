a framework for semantic-link-discovery over relational-data discovering links between different data items in a single data source or across different data sources is a challenging problem faced by many information-systems today . in particular , the recent linking-open-data (lod) community project has highlighted the paramount importance of establishing semantic links among web-data sources . currently , lod sources provide billions of rdf-triples , but only millions of links between data sources . many of these data sources are published using tools that operate over relational-data stored in a standard rdbms . in this paper , we present a framework for discovery of semantic links from relational-data . our framework is based on declarative-specification of linkage requirements by a user . we illustrate the use of our framework using several link-discovery algorithms on a real-world scenario . our framework allows data publishers to easily find and publish high-quality links to other data sources , and therefore could significantly enhance the value of the data in the next generation of web .
