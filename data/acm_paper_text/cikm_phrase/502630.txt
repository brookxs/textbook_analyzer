sliding-window filtering : an efficient-algorithm for incremental-mining we explore in this paper an effective sliding-window filtering (abbreviatedly as swf) algorithm for incremental-mining of association-rules . in essence , by partitioning a transaction-database into several partitions , algorithm swf employs a filtering threshold in each partition to deal with the candidate itemset generation . under swf , the cumulative information of mining previous partitions is selectively carried over toward the generation of candidate itemsets for the subsequent partitions . algorithm swf not only significantly reduces i/o and cpu cost by the concepts of cumulative filtering and scan reduction-techniques but also effectively controls memory-utilization by the technique of sliding-window partition . algorithm swf is particularly powerful for efficient incremental-mining for an ongoing time-variant transaction-database . by utilizing proper scan reduction-techniques , only one scan of the incremented dataset is needed by algorithm swf . the i/o cost of swf is , in orders of magnitude , smaller than those required by prior methods , thus resolving the performance-bottleneck . experimental-studies are performed to evaluate performance of algorithm swf . it is noted that the improvement achieved by algorithm swf is even more prominent as the incremented portion of the dataset increases and also as the size of the database increases .
