approximating the top-m passages in a parallel question-answering-system we examine the problem of retrieving the top - <i> m </i> ranked items from a large-collection , randomly distributed across an <i> n </i> - node system . in order to retrieve the top <i> m </i> overall , we must retrieve the top <i> m </i> from the subcollection stored on each node and merge the results . however , if we are willing to accept a small probability that one or more of the top - <i> m </i> items may be missed , it is possible to reduce computation-time by retrieving only the top <i> k < m </i> from each node . in this paper , we demonstrate that this simple observation can be exploited in a realistic application to produce a substantial efficiency improvement without compromising the quality of the retrieved results . to support our claim , we present a statistical model that predicts the impact of the optimization . the paper is structured around a specific application ~ -- ~ passage-retrieval for question-answering ~ -- ~ but the primary results are more broadly applicable .
