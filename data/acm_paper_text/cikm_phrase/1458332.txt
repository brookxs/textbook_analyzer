on quantifying changes in temporally evolving dataset in this paper , we present a general-framework to quantify changes in temporally evolving data . we focus on changes that materialize due to evolution and interactions of features extracted from the data . the changes are captured by the following key transformations : create , merge , split , continue , and cease . first , we identify various factors which influence the importance of each transformation . these factors are then combined using a weight-vector . the weight-vector encapsulates domain-knowledge . we evaluate our algorithm using the following datasets : dblp , imdb , text and scientific dataset .
