an unsupervised-method for author extraction from web-pages containing user-generated-content in this paper , we address the problem of author extraction (ae) from user-generated-content (ugc) pages . most existing solutions for web-information-extraction , including ae , adopt supervised approaches , which require expensive manual-annotation . we propose a novel unsupervised-approach for automatically collecting and labeling training-data based on two key observations of author-names : (1) people tend to use a single name across sites if their preferred names are available ; (2) people tend to create unique usernames to easily distinguish themselves from others , e.g. travelbug61 . our ae solution only requires features extracted from a single ugc page instead of relying on clues from multiple ugc pages . we conducted extensive experiments . (1) the evaluation of automatically labeled author field-data shows 95.0 % precision . (2) our method achieves an f1 score of 96.1 % , which significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art supervised approach with single page features (f1 score : 68.4 %) and has a comparable performance to its multiple page solution (f1 score : 95.4 %) . (3) we also examine the robustness of our approach on various ugc pages from forums and review sites , and achieve promising results as well .
