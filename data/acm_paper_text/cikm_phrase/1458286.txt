coreference-resolution using expressive logic models coreference-resolution is regarded as a crucial step for acquiring linkages among pieces of information extracted . traditionally , coreference-resolution models make use of independent attribute-value features over pairs of noun-phrases . however , dependency and deeper relations between features can more adequately describe the properties of coreference relations between noun-phrases . in this paper , we propose a framework of coreference-resolution based on first-order-logic and probabilistic-graphical-model , the markov logic network . the proposed framework enables the use of background-knowledge and captures more complex coreference linkage properties through rich expression of conditions . moreover , the proposed conditions can capture the structural-pattern within a noun-phrase as well as contextual-information between noun-phrases . our experiments show improvement with the use of the expressive logic models and the use of pattern-based conditions .
