adaptive outlierness for subspace outlier ranking outlier-mining is an important data-analysis task to distinguish exceptional outliers from regular objects . however , in recent applications traditional outlier-mining approaches miss outliers as they are hidden in subspace projections . in this work , we propose a novel outlier ranking based on the degree of deviation in subspaces . object deviation is measured only in a selection of relevant subspaces and is based on adaptive neighborhoods in these subspaces . we show that our approach outperforms competing outlier ranking approaches by detecting outliers in arbitrary subspaces .
