efficient processing of group-oriented connection queries in a large-graph we study query-processing in large-graphs that are fundamental data-model underpinning various social-networks and web structures . given a set of query nodes , we aim to find the groups which the query nodes belong to , as well as the best connection among the groups . such a query is useful to many applications but the query-processing is extremely costly . we define a new notion of correlation group (cg) , which is a set of nodes that are strongly correlated in a large-graph g . we then extract the subgraph from g that gives the best connection for the nodes in a cg . to facilitate query-processing , we develop an efficient index built upon the cgs . our experiments show that the cgs are meaningful as groups and importantly , the meaningfulness of the query results are justifiable . we also demonstrate the high efficiency of cg computation , index-construction and query-processing .
