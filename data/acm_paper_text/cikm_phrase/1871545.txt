xml-schema-computations : schema compatibility-testing and subschema extraction in this paper , we propose new models and algorithms to perform practical computations on w3c xml schemas , which are schema minimization , schema equivalence-testing , subschema testing and subschema extraction . we have conducted experiments on an e-commerce standard xsd called xcbl to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms . one experiment has refuted the claim that the xcbl 3.5 xsd is compatible with the xcbl 3.0 xsd . another experiment has shown that the xcbl xsds can be effectively trimmed into small subschemas for specific applications , which has significantly reduced schema processing-time .
