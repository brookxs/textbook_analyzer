user-interests in social-media sites : an exploration with micro-blogs recent technological advances in mobile-based access to social-networking-platforms and facilities to update information in real {time (e.g. in facebook) have allowed an individual 's online presence to be as ephemeral and dynamic in nature , as her very thoughts and interests . in this context , micro-blogging has been widely adopted by users as an effective means to capture and disseminate their thoughts and actions to a larger audience on a daily basis . interestingly , daily chatters of a user obtained from her micro-blogs offer a unique information-source to analyze and interpret her context in real-time - i.e. interests , intentions , and activities . in this paper , we gather data from the public timeline of twitter spanning across ten worldwide cities over a period of four weeks . we use this dataset to (a) explore how users express interests in real-time through micro-blogs , and (b) understand how text-mining techniques can be applied to interpret real-time context of a user based on her tweets . initial findings reported herein suggest that social-media sites like twitter constitute a promising source for extracting user-context that can be exploited by novel social-networking-applications .
