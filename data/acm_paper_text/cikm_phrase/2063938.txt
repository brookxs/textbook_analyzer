review-recommendation : personalized prediction of the quality of online reviews the problem of identifying high quality and helpful reviews automatically has attracted many attention recently . current methods assume that the helpfulness of a review is independent from the readers of that review . however , we argue that the quality of a review may not be the same for different users . in this paper , we employ latent-factor-models to address this problem . we evaluate the proposed models using a real life database from epinions.com . the experiments demonstrate that the latent-factor-models outperform the state-of-the-art approaches and confirms that the helpfulness of a review is indeed not the same for all users .
