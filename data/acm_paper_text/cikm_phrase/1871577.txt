menta : inducing multilingual taxonomies from wikipedia in recent years , a number of projects have turned to wikipedia to establish large-scale taxonomies that describe orders of magnitude more entities than traditional manually built knowledge-bases . so far , however , the multilingual nature of wikipedia has largely been neglected . this paper investigates how entities from all editions of wikipedia as well as wordnet can be integrated into a single coherent taxonomic class-hierarchy . we rely on linking heuristics to discover potential taxonomic relationships , graph-partitioning to form consistent equivalence-classes of entities , and a markov chain-based ranking approach to construct the final taxonomy . this results in menta (multilingual entity taxonomy) , a resource that describes 5.4 million entities and is presumably the largest multilingual lexical knowledge-base currently available .
