data , health , and algorithmics : computational challenges for biomedicine in the decade following the completion of the human-genome-project in 2000 , the cost of sequencing dna fell by a factor of around a million , and continues to fall . applications of sequencing in health include precise diagnosis of infection and disease , lifestyle management , and development of highly targeted treatments . however , the volume and complexity of the data produced by these technologies presents a severe computational challenge . breakthroughs in methods for search , storage , and analysis are required to keep pace with the flow of data , and to make use of the changes in biomedical knowledge that these technologies are creating . this keynote is an overview of some of these technologies and the new computational obstacles they have engendered , and reviews examples of algorithmic innovations and approaches currently being explored . these illustrate both the kinds of solutions that are required and the challenges that must be addressed to allow this data to be fully exploited .
