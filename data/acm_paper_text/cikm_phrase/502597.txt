a relational-algebra for data/metadata integration in a federated-database-system the need for interoperability among databases has increased dramatically with the proliferation of readily available dbms and application software . even within a single organization , data from disparate relational-databases must be integrated . a framework for interoperability in a federated system of relational-databases should be inherently relational , so that it can use existing techniques for query-evaluation-and-optimization where possible and retain the key features of sql , such as a modest complexity and ease of query-formulation . our contribution is a logspace relational-algebra , the meta-algebra (ma) , for data/metadata integration among relational-databases containing semantically similar information in schematically disparate formats . the ma is a simple yet powerful extension of the classical relational-algebra (ra) . the ma has a natural declarative counterpart , the meta-query language (mql) , which we briefly describe . we state a result showing mql and the ma are computationally equivalent , which enables us to algebratize mql queries in fundamentally the same way as ordinary sql queries . this algebratization in turn enables us to use ma equivalences to facilitate the application of known query-optimization techniques to mql query-evaluation .
