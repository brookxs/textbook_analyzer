optimizing parallel itineraries for knn-query processing in wireless-sensor-networks spatial-queries for extracting data from wireless-sensor-networks are important for many applications , such as environmental-monitoring and military surveillance . one such query is k-nearest-neighbor (knn) query that facilitates sampling of monitored sensor-data in correspondence with a given query location . recently , itinerary-based knn-query processing techniques , that propagate queries and collect data along a pre-determined itinerary , have been developed concurrently [12] [14] . these research works demonstrate that itinerary-based knn-query processing-algorithms are able to achieve better energy-efficiency than other existing algorithms . however , how to derive itineraries based on different performance-requirements remains a challenging problem . in this paper , we propose a new itinerary-based knn-query processing technique , called pciknn , that derives different itineraries aiming at optimizing two performance-criteria , response latency and energy-consumption . the performance of pciknn is analyzed mathematically and evaluated through extensive experiments . experimental-results show that pciknn has better performance-and-scalability than the state-of-the-art .
