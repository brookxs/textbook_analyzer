identifying table boundaries in digital-documents via sparse line detection most prior work on information-extraction has focused on extracting information from text in digital-documents . however , often , the most important information being reported in an article is presented in tabular form in a-digital document . if the data reported in tables can be extracted and stored in a database , the data can be queried and joined with other data using database-management-systems . in order to prepare the data source for table-search , accurately detecting the table-boundary plays a crucial role for the later table structure decomposition . table-boundary-detection and content-extraction is a challenging problem because tabular formats are not standardized across all documents . in this paper , we propose a simple but effective preprocessing method to improve the table-boundary-detection performance by considering the sparse-line property of table rows . our method easily simplifies the table-boundary-detection problem into the sparse line analysis problem with much less noise . we design eight line label types and apply two machine-learning-techniques , conditional-random-field (crf) and support-vector-machines (svm) , on the table-boundary-detection field . the experimental-results not only compare the performances between the machine-learning-methods and the heuristics-based method , but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the sparse line analysis in the table-boundary-detection .
