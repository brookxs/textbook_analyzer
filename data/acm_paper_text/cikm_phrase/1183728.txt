adapting association-patterns for text-categorization : weaknesses and enhancements the use of association-patterns for text-categorization has attracted great interest and a variety of useful methods have been developed . however , the key characteristics of pattern-based text-categorization remain unclear . indeed , there are still no concrete answers for the following two questions : first , what kind of association-patterns are the best candidate for pattern-based text-categorization ? second , what is the most desirable way to use patterns for text-categorization ? in this paper , we focus on answering the above two questions . specifically , we show that hyperclique-patterns are more desirable than frequent-patterns for text-categorization . along this line , we develop an algorithm for text-categorization using hyperclique-patterns . the experimental-results show that our method provides better performance than state-of-the-art methods in terms of both computational performance and classification-accuracy .
