selc : a self-supervised model for sentiment-classification this paper presents the selc model (se lf-supervised , (l exicon-based and (c orpus-based model) for sentiment-classification . the selc model includes two phases . the first phase is a lexicon-based iterative-process . in this phase , some reviews are initially classified based on a sentiment dictionary . then more reviews are classified through an iterative-process with a negative/positive ratio control . in the second phase , a supervised classifier is learned by taking some reviews classified in the first phase as training-data . then the supervised classifier applies on other reviews to revise the results produced in the first phase . experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed model . selc totally achieves 6.63 \ % f 1 - score improvement over the best result in previous studies on the same data (from 82.72 \ % to 89.35 \ %) . the first phase of the selc model independently achieves 5.90 \ % improvement (from 82.72 \ % to 88.62 \ %) . moreover , the standard-deviation of f 1 - scores is reduced , which shows that the selc model could be more suitable for domain-independent sentiment-classification .
