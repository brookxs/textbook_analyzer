dynamic faceted-search for discovery-driven analysis we propose a dynamic faceted-search system for discovery-driven analysis on data with both textual content and structured attributes . from a keyword-query , we want to dynamically select a small set of `` interesting '' attributes and present aggregates on them to a user . similar to work in olap exploration , we define `` interestingness '' as how surprising an aggregated value is , based on a given expectation . we make two new contributions by proposing a novel `` navigational '' expectation that 's particularly useful in the context of faceted-search , and a novel interestingness-measure through judicious application of p - values . through a user-survey , we find the new expectation and interestingness metric quite effective . we develop an efficient dynamic faceted-search system by improving a popular open-source engine , solr . our system-exploits compressed bitmaps for caching the posting lists in an inverted-index , and a novel directory-structure called a bitset tree for fast bitset intersection . we conduct a comprehensive experimental-study on large real-data sets and show that our engine performs 2 to 3 times faster than solr .
