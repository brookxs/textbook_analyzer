the robustness of content-based-search in hierarchical peer-to-peer-networks hierarchical <i> peer-to-peer </i> networks with multiple directory-services are an important architecture for large-scale file-sharing due to their effectiveness and efficiency . recent research argues that they are also an effective method of providing large-scale content-based federated-search of text-based digital-libraries . in both cases the directory-services are critical resources that are subject to attack or failure , but the latter architecture may be particularly vulnerable because content is less likely to be replicated throughout the network . this paper studies the robustness , effectiveness and efficiency of content-based federated-search in hierarchical <i> peer-to-peer </i> networks when directory-services fail unexpectedly . several recovery methods are studied using simulations with varying failure-rates . experimental-results show that quality-of-service and efficiency degrade gracefully as the number of directory-service failures increases . furthermore , they show that content-based-search mechanisms are more resilient to failures than the match-based search-techniques .
