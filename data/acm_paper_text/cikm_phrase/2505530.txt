mining frequent neighborhood patterns in a large labeled graph over the years , frequent-subgraphs have been an important kind of targeted pattern in pattern-mining research , where most approaches deal with databases holding a number of graph transactions , e.g. , the chemical structures of compounds . these methods rely heavily on the downward-closure property (dcp) of the support measure to ensure an efficient pruning of the candidate patterns . when switching to the emerging scenario of single-graph databases such as google 's knowledge graph and facebook 's social-graph , the traditional support measure turns out to be trivial (either 0 or 1) . however , to the best of our knowledge , all attempts to redefine a single-graph support have resulted in measures that either lose dcp , or are no longer semantically intuitive . this paper targets pattern-mining in the single-graph setting . we propose mining a new class of patterns called frequent neighborhood patterns , which is free from the `` dcp-intuitiveness '' dilemma of mining frequent subgraphs in a single graph . a neighborhood is a specific topological pattern in which a vertex is embedded , and the pattern is frequent if it is shared by a large portion (above a given threshold) of vertices . we show that the new patterns not only maintain dcp , but also have equally significant interpretations as subgraph patterns . experiments on real-life datasets support the feasibility of our algorithms on relatively large-graphs , as well as the capability of mining interesting knowledge that is not discovered by prior methods .
