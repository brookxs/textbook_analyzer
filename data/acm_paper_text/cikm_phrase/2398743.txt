the nautilus analyzer : understanding and debugging data-transformations when developing data transformations - a task omnipresent in applications like data-integration , data-migration , data-cleaning , or scientific-data-processing - developers quickly face the need to verify the semantic correctness of the transformation . declarative-specifications of data-transformations , e.g. , sql or etl tools , increase developer-productivity but usually provide limited or no means for inspection or debugging . in this situation , developers today have no choice but to manually analyze the transformation and , in case of an error , to (repeatedly) fix and test the transformation . the goal of the nautilus project is to semi-automatically support this analysis-fix-test cycle . this demonstration focuses on one main component of nautilus , namely the nautilus analyzer that helps developers in understanding and debugging their data-transformations . the demonstration will show the capabilities of this component for data-transformations specified in sql on scenarios from different domains that are based on real-world-data . we provide an overview the nautilus analyzer , discuss components and implementation-techniques , and outline our demonstration plan . the nautilus website (http://nautilus-system.org) features a video , screenshots , and further details .
