weakly-supervised discovery of named-entities using web-search-queries a seed-based framework for textual-information extraction allows for weakly supervised extraction of named-entities from anonymized web-search-queries . the extraction is guided by a small set of seed named-entities , without any need for handcrafted extraction-patterns or domain-specific-knowledge , allowing for the acquisition of named-entities pertaining to various classes of interest to web-search users . inherently noisy search queries are shown to be a highly valuable , albeit little explored , resource for web-based named-entity discovery .
