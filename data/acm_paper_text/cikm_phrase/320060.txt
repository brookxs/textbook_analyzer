a learning-approach to processor-allocation in parallel-systems given a typical parallel-system and a collection of applications that are to execute on the system , a common problem is determining an effective allocation of processors among the applications . in this paper a learning-approach is applied to processor-allocation . the approach is to use a stochastic learning automaton (sla) as a decision tool . an sla uses values of the current-state description , makes an allocation decision , evaluates its decision at some later time , modifies its decision-making-process , and tries to find the best allocation-strategy by learning from its previous mistakes . the method is applied to the problem of allocating processors to parallel-applications in a distributed-system such as a cluster-of-workstations , and is validated through simulation . the result of this study show that a learning-approach that utilizes a stochastic learning automaton is effective at making processor-allocation decisions in a parallel-system .
