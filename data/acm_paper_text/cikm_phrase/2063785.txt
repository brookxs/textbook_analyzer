efficient resource attribute-retrieval in rdf triple-stores the w3c resource-description-framework (rdf) is gaining popularity for its ability to manage semi-structured-data without a predefined database-schema . so far , most rdf-query processors have concentrated on finding complex graph-patterns in rdf , which typically involves a high number of joins . this works very well to query resources by the relations between them . yet , obtaining a record-like view on the attributes of resources , as natively supported by rdbms , imposes unnecessary performance burdens , as the individual attributes must be joined to assemble the final result records . we present an approach to retrieve the attributes of resources efficiently . we first determine the resources in question and then retrieve all their attributes efficiently at once , exploiting contiguous storage in rdf indexes . in addition , we present an index-structure which is specifically designed for rdf attribute-retrieval . our measurements show that our approach is clearly superior for larger numbers of attributes .
