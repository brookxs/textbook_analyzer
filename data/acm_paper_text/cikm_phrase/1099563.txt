decentralized-coordination of transactional-processes in peer-to-peer environments business-processes executing in peer-to-peer environments usually invoke web-services on different , independent peers . although peer-to-peer environments inherently lack global control , some business-processes nevertheless require global transactional guarantees , i.e. , atomicity and isolation applied at the level of processes . this paper introduces a new decentralized serialization graph testing protocol to ensure concurrency-control and recovery in peer-to-peer environments . the uniqueness of the proposed protocol is that it ensures global-correctness without relying on a global serialization graph . essentially , each transactional process is equipped with partial knowledge that allows the transactional-processes to coordinate . globally correct execution is achieved by communication among dependent transactional-processes and the peers they have accessed . in case of failures , a combination of partial backward and forward-recovery is applied . experimental-results exhibit a significant performance-gain over traditional distributed locking-based protocols with respect to the execution of transactions encompassing web-service requests .
