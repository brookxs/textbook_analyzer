effective stratification for low selectivity queries on deep-web data sources we study the problem of estimating the result of an aggregation query with low selectivity when a data source only supports limited data accesses . existing stratified-sampling techniques can not be applied to such a problem since either it is very hard , if not impossible , to gather certain critical statistics from such a data source , or more importantly , the selective attribute of the query may not be queriable on the data source . in such cases , we need an effective mechanism to stratify the data and form homogeneous strata with respect to the selective attribute of the query , despite not being able to query the data source with the selective attribute . this paper presents and evaluates a stratification method for this problem utilizing a queriable auxiliary attribute . the breaking points for the stratification are computed based on a novel bayesian adaptive harmony-search-algorithm . this method derives from the existing harmony-search method , but includes novel objective-function , and introduces a technique for dynamically adapting key parameters of this method . our experiments show that the estimation-accuracy achieved using our method is consistently higher than 95 \ % even for 0.01 \ % selectivity query , even when there is only a low correlation between the auxiliary attribute and the selective attribute . furthermore , our method achieves at least a five fold reduction in estimation-error over three other methods , for the same sampling cost .
