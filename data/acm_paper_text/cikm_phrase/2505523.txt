on popularity-prediction of videos shared in online-social-networks popularity-prediction , with both technological and economic importance , has been extensively studied for conventional video-sharing-sites (vsses) , where the videos are mainly found via searching , browsing , or related links . recent statistics however suggest that online-social-network (osn) users regularly share video contents from vsses , which has contributed to a significant portion of the accesses ; yet the popularity-prediction in this new context remains largely unexplored . in this paper , we present an initial study on the popularity-prediction of videos propagated in osns along friendship links . we conduct a large-scale measurement and analysis of viewing-patterns of videos shared in one of largest osns in china , and examine the performance of typical views-based prediction-models . we find that they are generally ineffective , if not totally fail , especially when predicting the early peaks and later bursts of accesses , which are common during video propagations in osns . to overcome these limits , we track the propagation process of videos shared in a facebook-like osn in china , and analyze the user viewing and sharing behaviors . we accordingly develop a novel propagation-based video-popularity prediction solution , namely sovp . instead of relying solely on the early views for prediction , sovp considers both the intrinsic attractiveness of a video and the influence from the underlying propagation structure . the effectiveness of sovp , particularly for predicting the peaks and bursts , have been validated through our trace-driven experiments .
