g-wstd : a framework for geographic web search topic-discovery search-engine-query-log is an important information-source that contains millions of users ' interests and information needs . in this paper , we tackle the problem of discovering latent geographic-search topics via mining search engine query-logs . a novel framework g-wstd that contains search-session derivation , geographic-information extraction and geographic-search topic-discovery is developed to support a variety of downstream web-applications . the core components of the framework are two topic-models , which discover geographic-search topics from two different perspectives . the first one is the discrete-search topic-model (dstm) , which aims to capture the semantic commonalities across discrete geographic locations . the second one is the regional search topic-model (rstm) , which focuses on a specific region on the map and discovers web-search topics that demonstrate geographic locality . we evaluate our framework against several strong baselines on a real-life query-log . the framework demonstrates improved data interpretability , better prediction-performance and higher topic distinctiveness in the experimentation . the effectiveness of the framework is also verified by applications such as user-profiling and url-annotation .
