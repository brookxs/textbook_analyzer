a general language-model for information-retrieval statistical-language-modeling has been successfully used for speech-recognition , part-of-speech-tagging , and syntactic-parsing . recently , it has also been applied to information-retrieval . according to this new paradigm , each document is viewed as a language-sample , and a query as a generation-process . the retrieved documents are ranked based on the probabilities of producing a query from the corresponding language-models of these documents . in this paper , we will present a new language-model for information-retrieval , which is based on a range of data smoothing-techniques , including the good-turning estimate , curve-fitting-functions , and model-combinations . our model is conceptually simple and intuitive , and can be easily extended to incorporate probabilities of phrases such as word-pairs and word triples . the experiments with the wall-street-journal and trec4 data-sets showed that the performance of our model is comparable to that of inquery and better than that of another language-model for information-retrieval . in particular , word-pairs are shown to be useful in improving the retrieval-performance .
