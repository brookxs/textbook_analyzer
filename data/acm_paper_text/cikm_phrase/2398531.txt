leveraging tagging for neighborhood-aware probabilistic-matrix-factorization collaborative-filtering (cf) is a popular way to build recommender-systems and has been successfully employed in many applications . generally , two kinds of approaches to cf , the local neighborhood methods and the global matrix-factorization models , have been widely studied . though some previous researches target on combining the complementary advantages of both approaches , the performance is still limited due to the extreme sparsity of the rating data . therefore , it is necessary to consider more information for better reflecting user-preference and item content . to that end , in this paper , by leveraging the extra tagging data , we propose a novel unified two-stage recommendation framework , named neighborhood-aware probabilistic-matrix-factorization (nhpmf) . specifically , we first use the tagging data to select neighbors of each user and each item , then add unique gaussian distributions on each user 's (item 's) latent feature-vector in the matrix-factorization to ensure similar users (items) will have similar latent features} . since the proposed method can effectively explores the external data source (i.e. , tagging data) in a unified probabilistic-model , it leads to more accurate recommendations . extensive experimental-results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our nhpmf model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods .
