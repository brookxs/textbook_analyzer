probabilistic-models for topic-learning from images and captions in online biomedical literatures biomedical-images and captions are one of the major sources-of-information in online biomedical publications . they often contain the most important results to be reported , and provide rich information about the main themes in published papers . in the data-mining and information-retrieval-community , there has been much effort on using text-mining and language-modeling algorithms to extract knowledge from the text-content of online biomedical publications ; however , the problem of knowledge-extraction from biomedical-images and captions has not been fully studied yet . in this paper , a hierarchical probabilistic topic-model with background distribution (hpb) is introduced to uncover the latent-semantic topics from the co-occurrence patterns of caption words , visual-words and biomedical concepts . with downloaded biomedical figures , restricted captions are extracted with regard to each individual image panel . during the indexing stage , the ` bag-of-words ' representation of captions is supplemented by an ontology-based concept-indexing to alleviate the synonym and polysemy problems . as the visual counterpart of text words , the visual-words are extracted and indexed from corresponding image panels . the model is estimated via collapsed-gibbs-sampling algorithm . we compare the performance of our model with the extension of the correspondence lda (corr-lda) model under the same biomedical image annotation scenario using cross-validation . experimental-results demonstrate that our model is able to accurately extract latent patterns from complicated biomedical image-caption pairs and facilitate knowledge-organization and understanding in online biomedical literatures .
