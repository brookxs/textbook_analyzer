learning-based relevance-feedback for web-based-relation-completion in a pilot application based on web-search-engine called web-based-relation-completion (webrc) , we propose to join two columns of entities linked by a predefined relation by mining knowledge from the-web through a web-search-engine . to achieve this , a novel retrieval-task relation query-expansion (relqe) is modelled : given an entity (query) , the task is to retrieve documents containing entities in predefined relation to the given one . solving this problem entails expanding the query before submitting it to a web-search-engine to ensure that mostly documents containing the linked entity are returned in the top k search-results . in this paper , we propose a novel learning-based relevance-feedback (lrf) approach to solve this retrieval-task . expansion terms are learned from training pairs of entities linked by the predefined relation and applied to new entity-queries to find entities linked by the same relation . after describing the approach , we present experimental-results on real-world web-data collections , which show that the lrf approach always improves the precision of top-ranked search-results to up to 8.6 times the baseline . using lrf , webrc also shows performances way above the baseline .
