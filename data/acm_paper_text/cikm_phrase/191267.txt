a lock method for kbmss using abstraction relationships ' semantics knowledge-base-management-systems (kbmss) are a growing research area finding applicability in different domains . as a consequence , the demand for ever-larger knowledge-bases (kbs) is growing more and more . inside this context , knowledge-sharing turns out to be a crucial point to be supported by kbmss . in this paper , we propose a way of controlling knowledge-sharing . we show how we obtain serializability of transactions providing many different locking granules , which are based on the semantics of the abstraction relationships . the main benefit of our technique is the high degree of potential concurrency , to be obtained through a logical partitioning of the kb graph and the provision of lock types used for each referenced partition . by this way , we capture more of the semantics contained in a kb graph , through an interpretation of its edges grounded in the abstraction relationships , and make feasible a full exploitation of all inherent parallelism in a knowledge-representation approach .
