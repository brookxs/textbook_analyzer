comparative-document-summarization via discriminative-sentence-selection given a collection of document groups , a quick question is what are the differences in these groups . in this paper , we study a novel problem of summarizing the differences between document groups . a discriminative-sentence-selection method is proposed to extract the most discriminative sentences which represent the specific characteristics of each document group . experiments on real-world data-sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method .
