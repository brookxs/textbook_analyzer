discovering leaders from community actions we introduce a novel frequent-pattern-mining approach to discover leaders and tribes in social-networks . in particular , we consider social-networks where users perform actions . actions may be as simple as tagging resources (urls) as in del.icio.us , rating songs as in yahoo!-music , or movies as in yahoo! movies , or users buying gadgets such as cameras , handhelds , etc. and blogging a review on the gadgets . the assumption is that actions performed by a user can be seen by their network friends . users seeing their friends ' actions are sometimes tempted to perform those actions . we are interested in the problem of studying the propagation of such `` influence '' , and on this basis , identifying which users are leaders when it comes to setting the trend for performing various actions . we consider alternative definitions of leaders based on frequent-patterns and develop algorithms for their efficient discovery . our definitions are based on observing the way influence propagates in a time-window , as the window is moved in time . given a social-graph and a table of user actions , our algorithms can discover leaders of various flavors by making one pass over the actions table . we run detailed experiments to evaluate the utility and scalability of our algorithms on real-life data . the results of our experiments confirm on the one hand , the efficiency of the proposed algorithm , and on the other hand , the effectiveness and relevance of the overall framework . to the best of our knowledge , this the first frequent-pattern_based approach to social-network-mining .
