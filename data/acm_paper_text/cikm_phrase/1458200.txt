ranked feature-fusion models for ad-hoc-retrieval we introduce the ranked feature-fusion framework for information-retrieval-system design . typical information-retrieval formalisms such as the vector-space-model , the best-match model and the language-model first combine features (such as term-frequency and document-length) into a unified representation , and then use the representation to rank documents . we take the opposite approach : documents are first ranked by the relevance of a single feature value and are assigned scores based on their relative ordering within the collection . a separate ranked list is created for every feature-value and these lists are then fused to produce a final document scoring . this new `` rank then combine '' approach is extensively evaluated and is shown to be as effective as traditional `` combine then rank '' approaches . the model is easy to understand and contains fewer parameters than other approaches . finally , the model is easy to extend (integration of new features is trivial) and modify . this advantage includes but is not limited to relevance-feedback and distribution flattening .
