probabilistic first pass retrieval for search-advertising : from theory to practice information-retrieval in search-advertising , as in other ad-hoc-retrieval tasks , aims to find the most appropriate ranking of the ad documents of a corpus for a given query . in addition to ranking the ad documents , we also need to filter or threshold irrelevant ads from participating in the auction to be displayed alongside search-results . in this work , we describe our experience in implementing a successful ad retrieval-system for a commercial-search-engine based on the language-modeling (lm) framework for retrieval . the lm demonstrates significant performance-improvements over the baseline vector-space-model (tf-idf) system that was in production at the time . from a modeling perspective , we propose a novel approach to incorporate query-segmentation and phrases in the lm framework , discuss impact of score-normalization for relevance-filtering , and present preliminary results of incorporating query expansions using query-rewriting techniques . from an implementation perspective , we also discuss real-time latency constraints of a production search-engine and how we overcome them by adapting the wand algorithm to work with language-models . in sum , our lm formulation is considerably better in terms of accuracy metrics such as precision-recall (10 \ % improvement in auc) and ndcg (8 \ % improvement in ndcg@5) on editorial data and also demonstrates significant improvements in clicks in live user-tests (0.787 \ % improvement in click yield , with 8 \ % coverage increase) . finally , we hope that this paper provides the reader with adequate insights into the challenges of building a system that serves millions of users every day .
