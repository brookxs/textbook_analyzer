scalable community-discovery on textual data with relations every piece of textual data is generated as a method to convey its authors ' opinion regarding specific topics . authors deliberately organize their writings and create links , i.e. , references , acknowledgments , for better expression . thereafter , it is of interest to study texts as well as their relations to understand the underlying topics and communities . although many efforts exist in the literature in data-clustering and topic-mining , they are not applicable to community-discovery on large document corpus for several reasons . first , few of them consider both textual attributes as well as relations . second , scalability remains a significant issue for large-scale-datasets . additionally , most algorithms rely on a set of initial parameters that are hard to be captured and tuned . motivated by the aforementioned observations , a hierarchical community model is proposed in the paper which distinguishes community cores from affiliated members . we present our efforts to develop a scalable community-discovery solution for large-scale document corpus . our proposal tries to quickly identify potential cores as seeds of communities through relation analysis . to eliminate the influence of initial parameters , an innovative attribute-based core merge process is introduced so that the algorithm promises to return consistent communities regardless initial parameters . experimental-results suggest that the proposed method has high scalability to corpus-size and feature dimensionality , with more than 15 topical precision improvement compared with popular clustering-techniques .
