user-engagement : the network effect matters ! in the online-world , user-engagement refers to the quality of the user-experience that emphasizes the positive aspects of the interaction with a web-application and , in particular , the phenomena associated with wanting to use that application longer and frequently . this definition is motivated by the observation that successful web-applications are not just used , but they are engaged with . users invest time , attention , and emotion into them . online providers aim not only to engage users with each service , but across all services in their network . they spend increasing effort to direct users to various services (e.g. ~ using hyperlinks to help users navigate to and explore other services) , to increase user traffic between their services . nothing is known for users engaging across such a network of web-sites , something we call networked user-engagement . we address this problem by combining techniques from web-analytics and mining , information-retrieval-evaluation , and existing works on user-engagement coming from the domains of information-science , multimodal-human-computer-interaction and cognitive-psychology . in this way , we can combine insights from big-data with deep-analysis of human-behavior in the lab or through crowd-sourcing experiments .
