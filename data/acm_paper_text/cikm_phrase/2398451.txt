the walls have ears : optimize sharing for visibility and privacy in online-social-networks with a rapid expansion of online-social-networks (osns) , millions of users are tweeting and sharing their personal status daily without being aware of where that information eventually travels to . likewise , with a huge magnitude of data available on osns , it poses a substantial challenge to track how a piece of information-leaks to specific targets . in this paper , we study the problem of smartly sharing information to control the propagation of sensitive-information in osns . in particular , we formulate and investigate the maximum circle-of-trust problem of which we seek to construct a circle-of-trust on-the-fly so that osn users can safely share their information knowing that it will not be propagated to their unwanted targets (whom they are not willing to share with) . since most of messages in osns are propagated within 2 to 5 hops , we first investigate this problem under 2-hop information-propagation by showing the hardness of obtaining an optimal-solution , along with an algorithm with proven performance-guarantee . in a general case where information can be propagated more than two hops , the problem is #p - hard i.e. the problem can not be solved in a polynomial-time . thus we propose a novel greedy-algorithm , hybridizing the handy but costly sampling-method with a novel cut-based estimation . the quality of the hybrid algorithm is comparable to that of the sampling-method while taking only a tiny fraction of the time . we have validated the effectiveness of our solutions in many real-world traces . such an extensive experiment also highlights several important observations on information-leakage which help to sharpen the security of osns in the future .
