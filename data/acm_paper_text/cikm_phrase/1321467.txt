predictive user click-models based on click-through history web-search-engines consistently collect information about users interaction with the system : they record the query they issued , the url of presented and selected documents along with their ranking . this information is very valuable : it is a poll over millions of users on the most various topics and it has been used in many ways to mine users interests and preferences . query-logs have the potential to partially alleviate the search-engines from thousand of searches by providing a way to predict answers for a subset of queries and users without knowing the content of a document . even if the predicted result is at rank-one , this analysis might be of interest : if there is enough confidence on a user 's click , we might redirect the user directly to the page whose link would be clicked . in this paper , we present three different models for predicting user clicks , ranging from most specific ones (using only past user-history for the query) to very general ones (aggregating data over all users for a given query) . the former model has a very high precision at low recall values , while the latter can achieve high recalls . we show that it is possible to combine the different models to predict with high accuracy (over 90 \ %) a high subset of query sessions (24 \ % of all the sessions) .
