exploring multimedia-databases via optimization-based relevance-feedback and the earth mover 's distance determining similar objects is a fundamental operation both in data-mining tasks such as clustering and in query-driven object-retrieval . by definition of similarity-search , query objects can only be imprecise descriptions of what users are looking for in a database , and even high-quality similarity-measures can only be approximations of the users ' notion of similarity . to overcome these shortcomings , iterative-query-refinement systems have been proposed . they utilize user-feedback regarding the relevance of intermediate results to adapt the query object and/or the similarity-measure . we propose an optimization-based relevance-feedback approach for adaptable distance-measures - focusing on the earth mover 's distance . our technique enables quicker iterative database exploration as shown by our experiments .
