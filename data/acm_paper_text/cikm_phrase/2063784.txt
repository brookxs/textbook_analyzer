estimating selectivity for joined rdf triple patterns a fundamental problem related to rdf-query-processing is selectivity-estimation , which is crucial to query-optimization for determining a join order of rdf triple patterns . in this paper we focus research on selectivity-estimation for sparql graph-patterns . the previous work takes the join uniformity assumption when estimating the joined triple patterns . this assumption would lead to highly inaccurate estimations in the cases where properties in sparql graph-patterns are correlated . we take into account the dependencies among properties in sparql graph-patterns and propose a more accurate estimation-model . since star and chain query-patterns are common in sparql graph-patterns , we first focus on these two basic patterns and propose to use bayesian-network and chain histogram respectively for estimating the selectivity of them . then , for estimating the selectivity of an arbitrary sparql graph pattern , we design algorithms for maximally using the precomputed statistics of the star paths and chain paths . the experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy .
