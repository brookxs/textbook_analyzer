a personalized-recommendation system on scholarly-publications researchers , as well as ordinary-users who seek information in diverse academic fields , turn to the-web to search for publications of interest . even though scholarly-publication recommenders have been developed to facilitate the task of discovering literature pertinent to their users , they (i) are not personalized enough to meet users ' expectations , since they provide the same suggestions to users sharing similar profiles/preferences , (ii) generate recommendations pertaining to each user 's general interests as opposed to the specific need of the user , and (iii) fail to take full advantages of valuable user-generated data at social websites that can enhance their performance . to address these problems , we propose pubrec , a recommender that suggests closely-related references to a particular publication p tailored to a specific user u , which minimizes the time and efforts imposed on u in browsing through general recommended publications . empirical-studies conducted using data extracted from citeulike (i) verify the efficiency of the recommendation and ranking strategies adopted by pubrec and (ii) show that pubrec significantly outperforms other baseline recommenders .
