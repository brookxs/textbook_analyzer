content-based social-behavior prediction : a multi-task-learning approach information-flow studies analyze the principles and mechanisms of social-information distribution and is an essential research-topic in social-networks . traditional approaches are primarily based on the social-network graph-topology . however , topology itself can not accurately reflect the user-interests or activities . in this paper , we adopt a `` microeconomics '' approach to study social-information diffusion and aim to answer the question that how social-information flow and socialization behaviors are related to content-similarity and user-interests . in particular , we study content-based social-activity prediction , i.e. , to predict a user 's response (e.g. comment or like) to their friends ' postings (e.g. blogs) w.r.t. message content . in our solution , we cast the social-behavior prediction problem as a multi-task-learning problem , in which each task corresponds to a user . we have designed a novel multi-task-learning algorithm that is specifically designed for learning information-flow in social-networks . in our model , we apply l 1 and tikhonov-regularization to obtain a sparse and smooth model in a linear multi-task-learning framework . using comprehensive experimental-study , we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed learning-method .
