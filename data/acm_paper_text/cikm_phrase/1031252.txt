taxonomy-driven computation of product-recommendations recommender-systems have been subject to an enormous rise in popularity and research interest over the last ten years . at the same time , very-large taxonomies for product-classification are becoming increasingly prominent among e-commerce-systems for diverse domains , rendering detailed machine-readable content descriptions feasible . amazon.com makes use of an entire plethora of hand-crafted taxonomies classifying books , movies , apparel , and various other goods . we exploit such taxonomic background-knowledge for the computation of personalized recommendations . hereby , relationships between super-concepts and sub-concepts constitute an important cornerstone of our novel approach , providing powerful inference opportunities for profile-generation based upon the classification of products that customers have chosen . ample empirical-analysis , both offline and online , demonstrates our proposal 's superiority over common existing approaches when user-information is sparse and implicit-ratings prevail .
