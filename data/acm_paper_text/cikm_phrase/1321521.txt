dex : high-performance exploration on large-graphs for information-retrieval link and graph analysis-tools are important devices to boost the richness of information-retrieval-systems . internet and the existing social-networking portals are just a couple of situations where the use of these tools would be beneficial and enriching for the users and the analysts . however , the need for integrating different data sources and , even more important , the need for high-performance generic tools , is at odds with the continuously growing size and number of data-repositories . in this paper we propose and evaluate dex , a high-performance graph-database querying system that allows for the integration of multiple data sources . dex makes graph-querying possible in different flavors , including link-analysis , social-network-analysis , pattern-recognition and keyword-search . the richness of dex shows up in the experiments that we carried out on the internet-movie-database (imdb) . through a variety of these complex analytical queries , dex shows to be a generic and efficient tool on large-graph databases .
