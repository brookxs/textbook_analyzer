index-tuning for query-log_based on-line-index-maintenance the existing query-log_based on-line-index-maintenance approaches rely on frequency-distribution of terms in the static query-log . though these approaches are proved to be efficient , but in real-world , the frequency-distribution of the terms changes over a period of time . this negatively affects the efficiency of the static query-log_based approaches . to overcome this problem , we propose an index-tuning strategy for reorganizing the indexes according to the latest frequency-distribution of the terms captured from query-logs . experimental-results show that the proposed tuning strategy improves the performance of static query-log_based approaches .
