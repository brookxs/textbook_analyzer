graph-based seed-selection for web-scale crawlers one of the most important steps in web-crawling is determining the starting-points , or seed-selection . this paper identifies and explores the problem of seed-selection in web-scale incremental crawlers . we argue that seed-selection is not a trivial but very important problem . selecting proper seeds can increase the number of pages a crawler will discover , and can result in a repository with more `` good '' and less `` bad '' pages . we propose a graph-based framework for crawler seed-selection , and present several algorithms within this framework . evaluation on real web-data showed significant improvements over heuristic seed-selection approaches .
