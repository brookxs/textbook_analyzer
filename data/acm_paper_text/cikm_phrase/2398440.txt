generically extending anonymization algorithms to deal with successive queries this paper addresses the scenario of multi-release anonymization of datasets . we consider dynamic datasets where data can be inserted and deleted , and view this scenario as a case where each release is a small subset of the dataset corresponding , for example , to the results of a query . compared to multiple releases of the full database , this has the obvious advantage of faster anonymization . we present an algorithm for post-processing anonymized queries that prevents anonymity attacks using multiple released queries . this algorithm can be used with several distinct protection principles and anonymization algorithms , which makes it generic and flexible . we give an experimental-evaluation of the algorithm and compare it to $ m $ - invariance both in terms of efficiency and data-quality . to this end , we propose two data-quality metrics based on shannon 's entropy , and show that they can be seen as a refinement of existing metrics .
