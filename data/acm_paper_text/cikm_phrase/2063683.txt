modeling personalized email-prioritization : classification-based and regression-based approaches email-overload , even after spam-filtering , presents a serious productivity challenge for busy-professionals and executives . one solution is automated prioritization of incoming emails to ensure the most important are read and processed quickly , while others are processed later as/if time permits in declining priority levels . this paper presents a study of machine-learning-approaches to email-prioritization into discrete levels , comparing ordinal-regression versus classifier cascades . given the ordinal nature of discrete email priority levels , svm ordinal-regression would be expected to perform well , but surprisingly a cascade of svm classifiers significantly outperforms ordinal-regression for email-prioritization . in contrast , svm-regression performs well -- better than classifiers -- on selected uci data-sets . this unexpected performance inversion is analyzed and results are presented , providing core functionality for email-prioritization systems .
