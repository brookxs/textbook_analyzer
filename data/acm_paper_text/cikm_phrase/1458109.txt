modeling and exploiting query interactions in database-systems the typical workload in a database-system consists of a mixture of multiple-queries of different types , running concurrently and interacting with each other . hence , optimizing performance requires reasoning about query mixes and their interactions , rather than considering individual queries or query-types . in this paper , we show the significant impact that query interactions can have on workload performance . we present a new approach based on planning experiments and statistical-modeling to capture the impact of query interactions . this approach requires no prior assumptions about the internal workings of the database-system or the nature or cause of query interactions , making it portable across systems . as a concrete demonstration of the potential of capturing , modeling , and exploiting query interactions , we develop a novel interaction-aware query scheduler that targets report-generation workloads in business-intelligence (bi) settings . under certain assumptions , the schedule found by this scheduler is within a constant factor of optimal . an experimental-evaluation with tpc-h queries on ibm db2 demonstrates that our scheduler consistently outperforms (up to 4x) conventional schedulers that do not account for query interactions .
