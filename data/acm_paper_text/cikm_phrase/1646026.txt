independent informative subgraph-mining for graph information-retrieval in order to enable scalable querying of graph-databases , intelligent selection of subgraphs to index is essential . an improved index can reduce response-times for graph-queries significantly . for a given subgraph-query , graph candidates that may contain the subgraph are retrieved using the graph-index and subgraph-isomorphism tests are performed to prune out unsatisfied graphs . however , since the space of all possible subgraphs of the whole set of graphs is prohibitively large , feature-selection is required to identify a good subset of subgraph features for indexing . thus , one of the key issues is : given the set of all possible subgraphs of the graph set , which subset of features is the optimal such that the algorithm retrieves the smallest set of candidate graphs and reduces the number of subgraph-isomorphism tests ? we introduce a graph-search method for subgraph queries based on subgraph frequencies . then , we propose several novel feature-selection criteria , max-precision , max-irredundant-information , and max-information-min-redundancy , based on mutual-information . finally we show theoretically and empirically that our proposed methods retrieve a smaller candidate-set than previous methods . for example , using the same number of features , our method improve the precision for the query candidate-set by 4 \ % -13 \ % in comparison to previous methods . as a result the response-time of subgraph queries also is improved correspondingly .
