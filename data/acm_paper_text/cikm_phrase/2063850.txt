search-result-diversification for enterprise-data search-result-diversification aims to return a list of diversified relevant documents in order to satisfy different user-information-needs . most of the efforts focused on web-search , and few studies have considered another important search domain , i.e. , enterprise-search . unlike web-search , enterprise-search deals with both unstructured and structured-data . in this paper , we propose to integrate the structured and unstructured-data to discover meaningful query-subtopics in search-result-diversification . experimental-results show that integrating structured and unstructured-information allows us to discover high quality query , which are effective in diversifying the retrieval results .
