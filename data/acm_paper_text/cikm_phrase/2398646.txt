automatic-labeling hierarchical topics recently , statistical topic modeling has been widely applied in text-mining and knowledge-management due to its powerful ability . a topic , as a probability-distribution over words , is usually difficult to be understood . a common , major challenge in applying such topic-models to other knowledge-management problem is to accurately interpret the meaning of each topic . topic-labeling , as a major interpreting method , has attracted significant attention recently . however , previous works simply treat topics individually without considering the hierarchical-relation among topics , and less attention has been paid to creating a good hierarchical topic descriptors for a hierarchy of topics . in this paper , we propose two effective algorithms that automatically assign concise labels to each topic in a hierarchy by exploiting sibling and parent-child relations among topics . the experimental-results show that the inter-topic relation is effective in boosting topic-labeling accuracy and the proposed algorithms can generate meaningful topic labels that are useful for interpreting the hierarchical topics .
