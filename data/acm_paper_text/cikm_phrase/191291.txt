preserving update semantics in schema-integration in this paper , we propose a methodology for schema-integration where the semantics of updates is preserved during the view-integration process . we propose to divide view-integration into three steps : combination , restructuring , and optimization . in the view combination step , we define the combined schema that contains all original views , plus a new set of constraints that express how data in distinct views are interrelated . the restructuring step is devoted to normalizing the views so that merging becomes possible . the optimization step tries to reduce redundancy and the size of the schema . our methodology defines a set of transformation primitives that allows schema-integration to be realized in a safe (information preserving) and algorithmic way . in the proposed transformation primitives , the relationship between the original and transformed schema is formally specified by the instance and update mappings . we introduce the notion of an update semantics preserving transformation , which guarantees that the relationships between each view and the global-schema , originated during the view-integration process , reflect exactly the relationships between the views as defined by the combined schema . in our approach , the view-definition mappings and the view-update translator can be directly defined from the instance and update mappings between the different intermediate schemas generated during the view-integration process .
