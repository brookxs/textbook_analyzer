topic based pose relevance learning in dance archives this paper improves spatial-pyramid-kernel (spk) and proposes a relevance learning-approach to compare performer 's poses in a large dance archive , the nrcd collection1 . domain-knowledge of choreutics is exploited to define pose topics and a selection-operator is developed for pose topic matching . the visual structure descriptor of self-similarity (ssf) is extended to hierarchical self similarity (hssf) to keep shape context . the framework of bag-of-visual-words (bovw) is applied to encode as well as to speed up the matching on pose topics/topic combinations . this alleviates the complexity in limb allocation which is infeasible in our data . extensive experiments show that the new approach outperforms the original spk in both precision and robustness .
