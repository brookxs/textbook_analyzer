a classification-algorithm for supporting object-oriented views in recent years , object-oriented (oo) views have been recognized as a powerful mechanism for customizing the structural as well as behavioral aspects of interfaces to object-oriented-databases (oodbs) for diverse-users . in this context , classification is concerned with the integration of virtual-classes derived using an oo query into one unifying schema . existing approaches either require the user to explicitly specify the relationship between a virtual-class and existing base classes , or they relate a virtual-class directly with its source class (es) or with the root of the schema . in this paper , we propose a solution to this classification-problem that accomplishes the following goals : (1) generate maximally informative , and thus comprehensible , schemas that explicitly model the subclass relationships between base and virtual-classes , and (2) support efficient type-resolution for shared property functions by supporting upwards inheritance for both base and virtual-classes . correctness and complexity of the classification-algorithm are also discussed .
