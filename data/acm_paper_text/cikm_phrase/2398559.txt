you should read this ! let me explain you why : explaining news recommendations to users recommender-systems have become ubiquitous in content-based web-applications , from news to shopping sites . nonetheless , an aspect that has been largely overlooked so far in the recommender-system literature is that of automatically building explanations for a particular recommendation . this paper focuses on the news domain , and proposes to enhance effectiveness of news-recommender-systems by adding , to each recommendation , an explanatory statement to help the user to better understand if , and why , the item can be her interest . we consider the news recommender system as a black-box , and generate different types of explanations employing pieces of information associated with the news . in particular , we engineer text-based , entity-based , and usage-based explanations , and make use of a markov-logic-networks to rank the explanations on the basis of their effectiveness . the assessment of the model is conducted via a user-study on a dataset of news read consecutively by actual users . experiments show that news-recommender-systems can greatly benefit from our explanation module as it allows users to discriminate between interesting and not interesting news in the majority of the cases .
