context-modeling and discovery using vector-space bases in this paper , context is modeled by vector-space bases and its evolution is modeled by linear-transformations from one base to another . each document or query can be associated to a distinct base , which corresponds to one context . also , algorithms are proposed to discover contexts from document , query or groups or them . linear-algebra can thus by employed in a mathematical-framework to process context , its evolution and application .
