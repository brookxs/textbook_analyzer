polygene-based evolution : a novel framework for evolutionary-algorithms in this paper , we introduce polygene-based evolution , a novel framework for evolutionary-algorithms (eas) that features distinctive operations in the evolution process . in traditional eas , the primitive evolution unit is gene , where genes are independent components during evolution . in polygene-based evolutionary-algorithms (pgeas) , the evolution unit is polygene , i.e. , a set of co-regulated genes . discovering and maintaining quality polygenes can play an effective role in evolving quality individuals . polygenes generalize genes , and pgeas generalize eas . implementing the pgea framework involves three phases : polygene discovery , polygene planting , and polygene-compatible evolution . extensive experiments on function-optimization benchmarks in comparison with the conventional and state-of-the-art eas demonstrate the potential of the approach in accuracy and efficiency improvement .
