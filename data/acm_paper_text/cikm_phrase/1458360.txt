effective pattern-taxonomy mining in text-documents many data-mining-techniques have been proposed for mining useful-patterns in databases . however , how to effectively utilize discovered patterns is still an open-research issue , especially in the domain of text-mining . most existing methods adopt term-based approaches . however , they all suffer from the problems of polysemy and synonymy . this paper presents an innovative-technique , pattern-taxonomy mining , to improve the effectiveness of using discovered patterns for finding useful information . substantial experiments on rcv1 demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves encouraging performance .
