a general magnitude-preserving boosting-algorithm for search-ranking traditional boosting algorithms for the ranking problems usually employ the pairwise approach and convert the document rating preference into a binary-value label , like rankboost . however , such a pairwise approach ignores the information about the magnitude of preference in the learning-process . in this paper , we present the directed-distance-function (ddf) as a substitute for binary labels in pairwise approach to preserve the magnitude of preference and propose a new boosting-algorithm called mpboost , which applies gentleboost optimization and directly incorporates ddf into the exponential-loss-function . we give the boundedness property of mpboost through theoretic analysis . experimental-results demonstrate that mpboost not only leads to better ndcg accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art ranking solutions in both public and commercial datasets , but also has good properties of avoiding the overfitting problem in the task of learning ranking-functions .
