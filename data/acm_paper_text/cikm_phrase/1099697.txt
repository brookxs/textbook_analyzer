erknn : efficient reverse k-nearest neighbors retrieval with local knn-distance estimation the reverse k-nearest neighbors (rknn) queries are important in profile-based marketing , information-retrieval , decision-support and data-mining systems . however , they are very expensive and existing algorithms are not scalable to queries in high-dimensional spaces or of large values of k . this paper describes an efficient estimation-based rknn search-algorithm (erknn) which answers rknn queries based on local knn-distance estimation-methods . the proposed approach utilizes estimation-based filtering strategy to lower the computation-cost of rknn queries . the results of extensive experiments on both synthetic and real life datasets demonstrate that erknn algorithm retrieves rknn efficiently and is scalable with respect to data-dimensionality , k , and data size .
