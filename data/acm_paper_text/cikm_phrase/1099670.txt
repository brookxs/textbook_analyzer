mining officially unrecognized side-effects of drugs by combining web-search and machine-learning we consider the problem of finding officially unrecognized side-effects of drugs . by submitting queries to the-web involving a given drug name , it is possible to retrieve pages concerning the drug . however , many retrieved pages are irrelevant and some relevant pages are not retrieved . more relevant pages can be obtained by adding the active ingredient of the drug to the query . in order to eliminate irrelevant pages , we propose a machine-learning process to filter out the undesirable pages . the process is shown experimentally to be very effective . since obtaining training-data for the machine-learning process can be time consuming and expensive , we provide an automatic-method to generate the training-data . the method is also shown to be very accurate . the side-effects of three drugs which are not recognized by fda are validated by an expert . we believe that the same approach can be applied to many real life problems and will yield high precision . thus , this could lead a new way to perform retrieval with high accuracy .
