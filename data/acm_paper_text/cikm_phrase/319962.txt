extracting semi-structured-data through examples in this paper , we describe an innovative approach to extracting semi-structured-data from web sources . the idea is to collect a couple of example objects from the user and to use this information to extract new objects from new pages or texts . to perform the extraction of new objects , we introduce a bottom-up extration strategy and , through experimentation , demonstrate that it works quite effectively with distinct web sources , even if only a few examples are provided by the user .
