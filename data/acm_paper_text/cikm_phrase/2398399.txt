leaving so soon ? : understanding and predicting web-search abandonment rationales users of search-engines often abandon their searches . despite the high-frequency of web-search abandonment and its importance to web-search-engines , little is known about why searchers abandon beyond that it can be for good or bad reasons . in this paper , we ex-tend previous work by studying search abandonment using both a retrospective survey and an in-situ method that captures aban-donment rationales at abandonment time . we show that although satisfaction is a common motivator for abandonment , one-in-five abandonment instances does not relate to satisfaction . we also studied the automatic-prediction of the underlying reason for ob-served abandonment . we used features of the query and the results , interaction with the result page (e.g. , cursor-movements , scrolling , clicks) , and the full-search session . we show that our classifiers can learn to accurately predict the reasons for observed search abandonment . such accurate predictions help-search providers estimate user-satisfaction for queries without clicks , affording a more complete understanding of search-engine-performance .
