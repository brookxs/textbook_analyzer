the query-flow graph : model and applications query-logs record the queries and the actions of the users of search-engines , and as such they contain valuable information about the interests , the preferences , and the behavior of the users , as well as their implicit-feedback to search-engine-results . mining the wealth of information available in the query-logs has many important applications including query-log-analysis , user-profiling and personalization , advertising , query-recommendation , and more . in this paper we introduce the query-flow graph , a graph-representation of the interesting knowledge about latent querying behavior . intuitively , in the query-flow graph a directed edge from query q i to query q j means that the two queries are likely to be part of the same `` search mission '' . any path over the query-flow graph may be seen as a searching-behavior , whose likelihood is given by the strength of the edges along the path . the query-flow graph is an outcome of query-log mining and , at the same time , a useful tool for it . we propose a methodology that builds such a graph by mining time and textual-information as well as aggregating queries from different users . using this approach we build a real-world query-flow graph from a large-scale query-log and we demonstrate its utility in concrete applications , namely , finding logical sessions , and query-recommendation . we believe , however , that the usefulness of the query-flow graph goes beyond these two applications .
