exsearch : a novel vertical-search-engine for online barter business e-commerce has shown its exponentially-growing business-value in the past decade . however , in contrast to the successful examples in online sales , such as amazon 1 and ebay 2 , the online barter business is still underexplored due to the lack of corresponding information-aggregation service . in this paper , we design and implement a novel vertical-search-engine , called exsearch , to aggregate online barter information for developing the barter market . different from classical general purpose web-search-engines , exsearch adopts a focused-crawler to gather related information from various websites . we propose to automatically extract the barter information from free-text web-pages such that the unstructured-information is represented in structured databases . in addition , we utilize the data-mining-techniques such as regression to fulfill the missing-information , which can not be extracted from the-web pages . finally , we validate and rank the search-results according to user queries . experimental-results show that each component module in our proposed exsearch system is efficient and effective . the volunteer users are satisfied by and interested in this novel vertical-search-engine .
