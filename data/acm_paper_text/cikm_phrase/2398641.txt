entity-resolution using search-engine-results given a set of automatically extracted entities e of size n , we would like to cluster all the various names referring to the same canonical entity together . the variations of each entity include acronyms , full name , and informal naming conventions . we propose using search-engine-results to cluster variations of each entity based on the urls appearing in those results . we create a cluster c for each top search result returned by querying for the entity e &#8712; e assigning e to the cluster c . our experiments on a manually created dataset shows that our approach achieves higher precision-and-recall than string-matching algorithm and hierarchical-clustering_based disambiguation methods .
