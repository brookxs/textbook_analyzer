opinion-classification with tree-kernel svm using linguistic modality-analysis we propose a method for classifying opinions which captures the role of linguistic modalities in the sentence . we use-features than simple bag-of-words or opinion-holding predicates . the method is based on a machine-learning and utilizes opinion-holding predicates and linguistic modalities as features . two different detectors help to classify the opinions : the opinion-holding predicate detector and the modality detector . an opinion in the target is first parsed into a dependency-structure , and then the opinion-holding predicates and modalities stick onto the leaf nodes of the dependency-tree . the whole tree is regarded as input features of the opinion , and it becomes the input of tree-kernel support-vector-machines . we have applied method to opinions in japanese about television-programs , and have confirmed the effectiveness of the method against conventional bag-of-words features , or against simple opinion-holding predicates features
