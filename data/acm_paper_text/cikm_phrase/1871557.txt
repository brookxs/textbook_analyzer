detecting product-review spammers using rating behaviors this paper aims to detect users generating spam reviews or review spammers . we identify several characteristic behaviors of review spammers and model these behaviors so as to detect the spammers . in particular , we seek to model the following behaviors . first , spammers may target specific products or product groups in order to maximize their impact . second , they tend to deviate from the other reviewers in their ratings of products . we propose scoring methods to measure the degree of spam for each reviewer and apply them on an amazon review dataset . we then select a subset of highly suspicious reviewers for further scrutiny by our user evaluators with the help of a web-based spammer evaluation software specially developed for user-evaluation experiments . our results show that our proposed ranking and supervised methods are effective in discovering spammers and outperform other baseline method based on helpfulness votes alone . we finally show that the detected spammers have more significant impact on ratings compared with the unhelpful reviewers .
