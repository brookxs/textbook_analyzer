relational co-clustering via manifold ensemble-learning co-clustering targets on grouping the samples and features simultaneously . it takes advantage of the duality between the samples and features . in many real-world-applications , the data points or features usually reside on a submanifold of the ambient euclidean-space , but it is nontrivial to estimate the intrinsic manifolds in a principled way . in this study , we focus on improving the co-clustering performance via manifold ensemble-learning , which aims to maximally approximate the intrinsic manifolds of both the sample and feature spaces . to achieve this , we develop a novel co-clustering algorithm called relational multi-manifold co-clustering (rmc) based on symmetric nonnegative matrix tri-factorization , which decomposes the relational-data matrix into three matrices . this method considers the inter-type relationship revealed by the relational-data matrix and the intra-type information reflected by the affinity matrices . specifically , we assume the intrinsic manifold of the sample or feature-space lies in a convex-hull of a group of pre-defined candidate manifolds . we hope to learn an appropriate convex-combination of them to approach the desired intrinsic manifold . to optimize the objective , the multiplicative rules are utilized to update the factorized matrices and the entropic mirror descent algorithm is exploited to automatically learn the manifold coefficients . experimental-results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm .
