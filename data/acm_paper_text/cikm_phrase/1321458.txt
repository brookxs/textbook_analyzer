quickmig : automatic schema matching for data-migration projects a common task in many database-applications is the migration of legacy-data from multiple sources into a new one . this requires identifying semantically related elements of the source and target systems and the creation of mapping expressions to transform instances of those elements from the source format to the target format . currently , data-migration is typically done manually , a tedious and timeconsuming process , which is difficult to scale to a high number of data sources . in this paper , we describe quickmig , a new semi-automatic approach to determining semantic-correspondences between schema elements for data-migration applications . quickmig advances the-state-of-the-art with a set of new techniques exploiting sample instances , domain-ontologies , and reuse of existing mappings to detect not only element correspondences but also their mapping expressions . quickmig further includes new mechanisms to effectively incorporate domain-knowledge of users into the matching-process . the results from a comprehensive evaluation using real-world schemas and data indicate the high quality and practicability of the overall approach .
