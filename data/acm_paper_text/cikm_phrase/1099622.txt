biasing web-search-results for topic-familiarity depending on a web searcher 's familiarity with a query 's target topic , it may be more appropriate to show her introductory or advanced documents . the trec-hard [1] track defined topic-familiarity as meta-data associated with a user 's query . we instead define a user-independent and query-independent model of topic-familiarity required to read a document , so it can be matched to a given user in response to a query . an introductory web page is defined as a web-page that does n't presuppose any background-knowledge of the topic it is on , and to an extent introduces or defines the key terms in the topic . while an advanced web page is defined as a web-page that assumes sufficient background-knowledge of the topic it is on , and familiarity with the key technical / important terms in the topic , and potentially builds on them . we develop a method for biasing the initial mix of documents returned by a search-engine to increase the number of documents of desired familiarity level up to position 5 , and up to position 10 . our method involves building a supervised text classifier , incorporating features based on reading-level , the distribution of stop-words in the text , and non-text features such as average line-length . using this familiarity classifier , we achieve statistically significant improvements at reranking the result-set to show introductory documents higher up the ranked list . our classifier can be seamlessly integrated into current search-engine technology without involving any major modifications to existing architectures .
