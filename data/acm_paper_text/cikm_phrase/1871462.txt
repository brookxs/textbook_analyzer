wisdom of the ages : toward delivering the children 's web with the link-based agerank algorithm though children frequently use web-search-engines to learn , interact , and be entertained , modern web-search-engines are poorly suited to children 's needs , requiring relatively complex querying and filtering of results in order to find pages oriented to young audiences . to address this limitation , we designed agerank , a link-based algorithm that ranks web-pages according their appropriateness for young audiences . we show its effectiveness through a multipart evaluation that demonstrates agerank to be accurate in page-labeling , widely-spanning in page coverage , and with high potential to improve children 's search . as a fast , scalable , and effective algorithm , agerank can be adopted by search-engines seeking to more effectively address the needs of young users , or easily fitted to complementary machine-learning_based classification approaches .
