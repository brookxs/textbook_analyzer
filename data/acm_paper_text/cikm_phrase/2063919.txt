a probabilistic-approach to nearest-neighbor classification : naive hubness bayesian knn most machine-learning tasks , including classification , involve dealing with high-dimensional-data . it was recently shown that the phenomenon of hubness , inherent to high-dimensional-data , can be exploited to improve methods based on nearest-neighbors (nns) . hubness refers to the emergence of points (hubs) that appear among the k nns of many other points in the data , and constitute influential points for knn-classification . in this paper , we present a new probabilistic-approach to knn-classification , naive hubness bayesian k-nearest-neighbor (nhbnn) , which employs hubness for computing class likelihood estimates . experiments show that nhbnn compares favorably to different variants of the knn-classifier , including probabilistic knn (pnn) which is often used as an underlying probabilistic-framework for nn classification , signifying that nhbnn is a promising alternative framework for developing probabilistic nn algorithms .
