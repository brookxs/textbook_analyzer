a tensor encoding model for semantic-processing this paper develops and evaluates an enhanced corpus_based approach for semantic-processing . corpus_based models that build representations of words directly from text do not require pre-existing linguistic-knowledge , and have demonstrated psychologically relevant performance on a number of cognitive tasks . however , they have been criticised in the past for not incorporating sufficient structural-information . using ideas underpinning recent attempts to overcome this weakness , we develop an enhanced tensor encoding model to build representations of word-meaning for semantic-processing . our enhanced model demonstrates superior performance when compared to a robust baseline-model on a number of semantic-processing tasks .
