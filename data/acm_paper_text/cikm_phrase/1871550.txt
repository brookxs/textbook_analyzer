ranksvr : can preference data help regression ? in some regression applications (e.g. , an automatic movie scoring-system) , a large number of ranking data is available in addition to the original regression data . this paper studies whether and how the ranking data can improve the accuracy of regression-task . in particular , this paper first proposes an extension of svr (support-vector-regression) , ranksvr , which incorporates ranking constraints in the learning of regression function . second , this paper proposes novel sampling-methods for ranksvr , which selectively choose samples of ranking data for training of regression functions in order to maximize the performance of ranksvr . while it is relatively easier to acquire ranking data than regression data , incorporating all the ranking data in the learning of regression doest not always generate the best output . moreoever , adding too many ranking constraints into the regression problem substantially lengthens the training-time . our proposed sampling-methods find the ranking samples that maximize the regression performance . experimental-results on synthetic and real-data sets show that , when the ranking data is additionally available , ranksvr significantly performs better than svr by utilizing ranking constraints in the learning of regression , and also show that our sampling-methods improve the ranksvr performance better than the random-sampling .
