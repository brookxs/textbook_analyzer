document-allocation-policies for selective searching of distributed indexes indexes for large-collections are often divided into shards that are distributed across multiple computers and searched in parallel to provide rapid interactive-search . typically , all index shards are searched for each query . for organizations with modest computational-resources the high query-processing cost incurred in this exhaustive-search setup can be a deterrent to working with large-collections . this paper investigates document-allocation-policies that permit searching only a few shards for each query (selective search) without sacrificing search accuracy . random , source-based and topic-based document-to-shard allocation-policies are studied in the context of selective search . a thorough study of the tradeoff between search-cost and search accuracy in a sharded index environment is performed using three large trec collections . the experimental-results demonstrate that selective search using topic-based shards cuts the search-cost to less than 1/5th of that of the exhaustive-search without reducing search accuracy across all the three datasets . stability-analysis shows that 90 \ % of the queries do as well or improve with selective search . an overlap - based evaluation with an additional 1000 queries for each dataset tests and confirms the conclusions drawn using the smaller trec query sets .
