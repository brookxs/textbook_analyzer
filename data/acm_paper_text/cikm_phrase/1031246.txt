providing consistent and exhaustive relevance-assessments for xml-retrieval-evaluation comparing retrieval approaches requires test-collections , which consist of documents , queries and relevance-assessments . obtaining consistent and exhaustive relevance-assessments is crucial for the appropriate comparison of retrieval approaches . whereas the evaluation-methodology for flat text-retrieval approaches is well established , the evaluation of xml-retrieval approaches is a research issue . this is because xml-documents are composed of nested components that can not be considered independent in terms of relevance . this paper describes the methodology adopted in inex (the initiative for the evaluation of xml-retrieval) to ensure consistent and exhaustive relevance-assessments .
