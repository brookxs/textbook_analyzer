adapting cost-sensitive-learning for reject option traditional cost-sensitive-learning algorithms always deterministically predict examples as either positive or negative (in binary setting) , to minimize the total misclassification-cost . however , in more advanced real-world settings , the algorithms can also have another option to reject examples of high uncertainty . in this paper , we assume that cost-sensitive-learning algorithms can reject the examples and obtain their true labels by paying reject cost . we therefore analyse three categories of popular cost-sensitive-learning approaches , and provide generic methods to adapt them for reject option .
