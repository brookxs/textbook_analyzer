building a semantic-representation for personal-information a typical collection of personal-information contains many documents and mentions many concepts (e.g. , person-names , events , etc.) . in this environment , associative-browsing between these concepts and documents can be useful as a complement for search . previous approaches in the area of semantic desktops aimed at addressing this task . however , they were not practical because they require tedious manual-annotation by the user . in this work , we suggest a methodology and a prototype-system for building a semantic-representation of personal-information based on click-feedback from the user . we employed a feature-based model of associations between the concepts and documents . our initial evaluation shows that the suggested semantic-representation can play an important role in the known-item-finding task and that the system can learn to predict such associations with a small amount of click-data .
