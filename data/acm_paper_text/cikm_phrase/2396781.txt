alternative assessor disagreement and retrieval depth assessors are well known to disagree frequently on the relevance of documents to a topic , but the factors leading to assessor disagreement are still poorly understood . in this paper , we examine the relationship between the rank at which a document is returned by a set of retrieval-systems and the likelihood that a second assessor will disagree with the relevance-assessment of the initial assessor , and find that there is a strong and consistent correlation between the two . we adopt a metarank method of summarizing a document 's rank across multiple runs , and propose a logistic-regression predictive-model of second assessor disagreement given metarank and initially-assessed relevance . the consistency of the model-parameters across different topics , assessor pairs , and collections is considered . the model gives comparatively accurate predictions of absolute system scores , but less consistent predictions of relative scores than a simpler rank-insensitive model . we demonstrate that the logistic-regression-model is robust to using sampled , rather than exhaustive , dual assessment . we demonstrate the use of the sampled predictive-model to incorporate assessor disagreement into tests of statistical-significance .
