enhancing expertise-retrieval using community-aware strategies expertise-retrieval has received increased interests in recent years , whose task is to suggest people with relevant expertise . motivated by the observation that communities could provide valuable insight and distinctive information , we investigate two community-aware strategies to enhance expertise-retrieval . we first propose a new smoothing-method using the community context instead of the whole collection for statistical-language-model in the document-based model . furthermore , a query-sensitive authorrank is proposed to model the authors ' authorities according to the community co-authorship-networks , and then an adaptive-ranking refinement method is developed to further enhance expertise-retrieval . experimental-results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both community-aware strategies .
