key blog-distillation : ranking aggregates searchers on the blogosphere often have a need to identify other key bloggers with similar interests to their own . however , a main difference of this blog-distillation task from normal adhoc or web-document retrieval is that each blog can be seen as an aggregate of its constituent posts . on the other hand , we show that the task is similar to the expert-search task , where a person 's expertise is derived from the aggregate of their publications or emails . in this paper , we investigate several aspects of blog-retrieval : firstly , we experiment whether a blog should be represented as a whole unit , or as by considering each of its posts as indicators of its relevance , showing that expert-search techniques can be adapted for blog-search ; secondly , we examine whether indexing only the xml feed provided by each blog (and which is often incomplete) is sufficient , or whether the full-text of each blog post should be downloaded ; lastly , we use approaches to detect the central or recurring interests of each blog to increase the retrieval-effectiveness of the system . using the trec 2007 blog dataset , the results show that our proposed expert-search paradigm is indeed useful in identifying key bloggers , achieving high retrieval-effectiveness .
