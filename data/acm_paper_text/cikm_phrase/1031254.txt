computing consistent query answers using conflict hypergraphs a consistent query answer in a possibly inconsistent-database is an answer which is true in every (minimal) repair of the database . we present here a practical framework for computing consistent query answers for large , possibly inconsistent relational-databases . we consider relational-algebra queries without projection , and denial constraints . because our framework handles union queries , we can effectively (and efficiently) extract indefinite disjunctive information from an inconsistent-database . we describe a number of novel optimization-techniques applicable in this context and summarize experimental-results that validate our approach .
