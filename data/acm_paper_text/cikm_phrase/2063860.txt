worker types and personality-traits in crowdsourcing-relevance-labels crowdsourcing platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for creating evaluation benchmarks , but suffer from varied output quality from crowd workers who possess different levels of competence and aspiration . this raises new challenges for quality-control and requires an in-depth-understanding of how workers ' characteristics relate to the quality of their work . in this paper , we use behavioral observations (hit completion-time , fraction of useful labels , label accuracy) to define five worker types : spammer , sloppy , incompetent , competent , diligent . using data collected from workers engaged in the crowdsourced evaluation of the inex 2010 book track prove-it task , we relate the worker types to label accuracy and personality trait information along the ` big-five ' personality dimensions . we expect that these new insights about the types of crowd workers and the quality of their work will inform how to design hits to attract the best workers to a task and explain why certain hit designs are more effective than others .
