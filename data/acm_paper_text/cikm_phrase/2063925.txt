using random-walks for multi-label-classification the multi-label-classification (mlc) problem has aroused wide concern in these years since the multi-labeled data appears in many applications , such as page categorization , tag-recommendation , mining of semantic-web data , social-network-analysis , and so forth . in this paper , we propose a novel mlc solution based on the random-walk-model , called mlrw . mlrw maps the multi-labeled instances to graphs , on which the random-walk is applied . when an unlabeled-data is fed , mlrw transforms the original multi-label problem to some single-label subproblems . experimental-results on several real-world-data sets demonstrate that mlrw is a better solution to the mlc problems than many other existing multi-label-classification methods .
