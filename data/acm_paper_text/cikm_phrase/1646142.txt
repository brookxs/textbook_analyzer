incremental similarity-joins with edit-distance constraints with the dynamic increase of string data and the need to integrate data from multiple data sources , a challenging issue is to perform similarity-joins on dynamically-augmented string sets . existing methods only exploit domain-oriented filters to speed up join-processing on static datasets , which are inefficient for incremental data-generation scenarios . in this paper , an efficient approach called isj-ed (abbr for incremental similarity-joins with edit-distance constraints) is proposed to tackle similarity-join problem on ever-growing string sets . we first design a distance-based filtering technique which exploits an incrementally-built index to improve the filtering capability . then , for the existent filters , we study the impact of their executing orders on total filtering cost and suggest dynamically-optimized filtering orders . all these optimization strategies work jointly with the existing domain-oriented filters in isj-ed , that is , they are complementary to those filter-based methods with edit-distance thresholds . experimental-results demonstrate that on dynamically augmented string sets , our method is more efficient than those only leverage domain-oriented filters with a fixed filtering order .
