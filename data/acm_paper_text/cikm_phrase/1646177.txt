web-search result summarization : title selection-algorithms and user-satisfaction eye-tracking experiments have shown that titles of web-search-results play a crucial role in guiding a user 's search-process . we present a machine-learned algorithm that trains a boosted tree to pick the most relevant title for a web-search result . we compare two modeling-approaches : i) using absolute editorial-judgments and ii) using pairwise-preference judgments . we find that the pairwise modeling approach gives better results in terms of three offline metrics . we present results of our models in four regions . we also describe a hybrid user satisfaction evaluation-process -- search-success -- that combines page relevance and user click-behavior , and show that our machine-learned algorithm improves in search-success .
