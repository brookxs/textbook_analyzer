staticgreedy : solving the scalability-accuracy dilemma in influence-maximization influence-maximization , defined as a problem of finding a set of seed nodes to trigger a maximized spread of influence , is crucial to viral-marketing on social-networks . for practical viral-marketing on large-scale social-networks , it is required that influence-maximization algorithms should have both guaranteed accuracy and high scalability . however , existing algorithms suffer a scalability-accuracy dilemma : conventional greedy-algorithms guarantee the accuracy with expensive computation , while the scalable heuristic-algorithms suffer from unstable accuracy in this paper , we focus on solving this scalability-accuracy dilemma . we point out that the essential reason of the dilemma is the surprising fact that the submodularity , a key requirement of the objective-function for a greedy-algorithm to approximate the optimum , is not guaranteed in all conventional greedy-algorithms in the literature of influence-maximization . therefore a greedy-algorithm has to afford a huge number of monte-carlo-simulations to reduce the pain caused by unguaranteed submodularity . motivated by this critical finding , we propose a static greedy-algorithm , named staticgreedy , to strictly guarantee the submodularity of influence-spread function during the seed-selection process . the proposed algorithm makes the computational expense dramatically reduced by two orders of magnitude without loss of accuracy . moreover , we propose a dynamical update strategy which can speed up the staticgreedy algorithm by 2-7 times on large-scale social-networks .
