using sequence-classification for filtering web-pages web-pages often contain text that is irrelevant to their main-content , such as advertisements , generic format elements , and references to other pages on the same site . when used by automatic content-processing systems , e.g. , for web indexing , text-classification , or information-extraction , this irrelevant text often produces substantial amount of noise . this paper describes a trainable filtering system based on a feature-rich sequence classifier that removes irrelevant parts from pages , while keeping the content intact . most of the features the system uses are purely form-related : html tags and their positions , sizes of elements , etc. . this keeps the system general and domain-independent . we also experiment with content-words and show that while they perform very poorly alone , they can slightly improve the performance of pure-form features , without jeopardizing the domain-independence . our system achieves very high accuracy (95 \ % and above) on several collections of web-pages . we also do a series of tests with different features and different classifiers , comparing the contribution of different components to the system-performance , and comparing two known sequence classifiers , robust-risk-minimization (rrm) and conditional-random-fields (crf) , in a novel setting .
