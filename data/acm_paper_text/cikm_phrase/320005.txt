efficient and effective metasearch for a large number of text-databases metasearch engines can be used to facilitate ordinary-users for retrieving information from multiple local sources (text-databases) . in a metasearch-engine , the contents of each local database is represented by a representative . each user-query is evaluated against the set of representatives of all databases in order to determine the appropriate databases to search . when the number of databases is very-large , say in the order of tens of thousands or more , then a traditional metasearch-engine may become inefficient as each query needs to be evaluated against too many database representatives . furthermore , the storage requirement on the site containing the metasearch-engine can be very-large . in this paper , we propose to use a hierarchy of database representatives to improve the efficiency . we provide an algorithm to search the hierarchy . we show that the retrieval-effectiveness of our algorithm is the same as that of evaluating the user-query against all database representatives . we also show that our algorithm is efficient . in addition , we propose an alternative way of allocating representatives to sites so that the storage burden on the site containing the metasearch-engine is much reduced .
