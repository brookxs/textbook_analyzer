coarse-to-fine sentence-level emotion-classification based on the intra-sentence features and sentential-context this paper proposes a novel approach using a coarse-to-fine-analysis strategy for sentence-level emotion-classification which takes into consideration of similarities to sentences in training-set as well as adjacent sentences in the context . first , we use intra-sentence based features to determine the emotion label set of a target-sentence coarsely through the statistical-information gained from the label sets of the k most similar sentences in the training-data . then , we use the emotion transfer probabilities between neighboring sentences to refine the emotion labels of the target sentences . such iterative refinements terminate when the emotion-classification converges . the proposed algorithm is evaluated on ren-cecps , a chinese blog emotion-corpus . experimental-results show that the coarse-to-fine emotion-classification algorithm improves the sentence-level emotion-classification by 19.11 % on the average-precision metric , which outperforms the baseline methods .
