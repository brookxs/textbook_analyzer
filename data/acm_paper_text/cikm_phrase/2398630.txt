on compressing weighted time-evolving-graphs existing graph-compression techniquesmostly focus on static graphs . however for many practical graphs such as social-networks the edge weights frequently change over time . this phenomenon raises the question of how to compress dynamic-graphs while maintaining most of their intrinsic structural patterns at each time snapshot . in this paper we show that the encoding cost of a dynamic-graph is proportional to the heterogeneity of a three-dimensional tensor that represents the dynamic-graph . we propose an effective algorithm that compresses a dynamic-graph by reducing the heterogeneity of its tensor-representation , and at the same time also maintains a maximum lossy-compression error at any time-stamp of the dynamic-graph . the bounded compression error benefits compressed graphs in that they retain good approximations of the original edge weights , and hence properties of the original graph (such as shortest-paths) are well preserved . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that compresses weighted dynamic-graphs with bounded lossy-compression error at any time snapshot of the graph .
