real-time-data pre-processing technique for efficient feature-extraction in large-scale datasets due to the continuous and rampant increase in the size of domain-specific data sources , there is a real and sustained need for fast processing in time-sensitive applications , such as medical-record information-extraction at the point of care , genetic feature extraction for personalized treatment , as well as off-line knowledge-discovery such as creating evidence-based-medicine . since parallel multi-string matching is at the core of most data-mining tasks in these applications , faster on-line matching in static and streaming-data is needed to improve the overall efficiency of such knowledge-discovery . to solve this data-mining need not efficiently handled by traditional information-extraction-and-retrieval techniques , we propose a block suffix shifting-based approach , which is an improvement over the-state-of-the-art multi-string matching-algorithms such as aho-corasick , commentz-walter , and wu-manber . the strength of our approach is its ability to exploit the different block structures of domain-specific data for off-line and online parallel matching . experiments on several real-world datasets show how our approach translates into significant performance-improvements .
