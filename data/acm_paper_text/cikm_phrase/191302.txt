xel : extended ephemeral logging for log storage-management extended ephemeral logging (xel) is a more general variation of the ephemeral logging (el) technique for managing a log of database activity on disk ; it does not require a timestamp to be maintained with each object in the database . xel does not require periodic checkpoints and does not abort lengthy transactions as frequently as traditional firewall logging for the same amount of disk space . therefore , it is well suited for concurrent databases and applications which have a wide-distribution of transaction lifetimes . simulation-results indicate that xel can offer significant savings in disk space , at the expense of slightly higher bandwidth for logging and more main-memory . the reduced size of the log permits much faster recovery after a crash as well as cost-savings .
