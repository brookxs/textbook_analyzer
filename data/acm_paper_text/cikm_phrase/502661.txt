scaling replica maintenance in intermittently synchronized mobile-databases to avoid the high cost of continuous connectivity , a class of mobile-applications employs replicas of shared data that are periodically updated . updates to these replicas are typically performed on a client-by-client basis -- that is , the server individually computes and transmits updates to each client -- limiting scalability . by basing updates on replica groups (instead of clients) , however , update generation complexity is no longer bound by client population-size . clients then download updates of pertinent groups . proper group-design reduces redundancies in server processing , disk usage and bandwidth usage , and dimininishes the tie between the complexity of updating replicas and the size of the client population . in this paper , we expand on previous work done on group-design , include a detailed i/o cost-model for update generation , and propose a heuristic-based greedy-algorithm for group computation . experimental-results with an adapted commercial replication system demonstrate a significant increase in overall scalability over the client-centric approach .
