anita : a narrative interpretation of taxonomies for their adaptation to text-collections taxonomies embody formalized knowledge and define aggregations between concepts/categories in a given domain , facilitating the organization of the data and making the contents easily accessible to the users . since taxonomies have significant roles in the data-annotation , search and navigation , they are often carefully engineered . however , especially in very dynamic-content , they do not necessarily reflect the content-knowledge . thus , in this paper , we propose a narrative interpretation of taxonomies for their adaptation (anita) for re-structuring existing taxonomies to varying application contexts and we evaluate the proposed scheme by user-studies that show that the proposed algorithm is able to adapt the taxonomy in a new compact and understandable structure from a human point-of-view .
