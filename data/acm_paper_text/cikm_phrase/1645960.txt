query by analogical example : relational-search using web-search-engine indices we describe methods to search with a query-by-example in a known domain for information in an unknown domain by exploiting web-search-engines . relational-search is an effective way to obtain information in an unknown field for users . for example , if an apple user searches for microsoft products , similar apple products are important clues for the search . even if the user does not know keywords to search for specific microsoft products , the relational-search returns a product name by querying simply an example of apple products . more specifically , given a tuple containing three terms , such as (apple , ipod , microsoft) , the term zune can be extracted from the-web search-results , where apple is to ipod what microsoft is to zune . as a previously proposed relational-search requires a huge text-corpus to be downloaded from the-web , the results are not up-to-date and the corpus has a high construction cost . we introduce methods for relational-search by using web-search indices . we consider methods based on term-co-occurrence , on lexico-syntactic-patterns , and on combinations of the two approaches . our experimental-results showed that the combination methods got the highest precision , and clarified the characteristics of the methods .
