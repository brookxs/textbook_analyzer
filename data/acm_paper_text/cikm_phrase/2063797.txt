categorising logical differences between owl ontologies the analysis-of-changes between owl ontologies (in the form of a diff) is an important service for ontology-engineering . a purely syntactic-analysis of changes is insufficient to distinguish between changes that have logical impact and those that do not . the current-state of the art in semantic diffing ignores logically ineffectual changes and lacks any further characterisation of even significant changes . we present a diff method based on an exhaustive categorisation of effectual and ineffectual changes between ontologies . in order to verify the applicability of our approach we apply it to 88 versions of the national cancer institute (nci) thesaurus (ncit) , and demonstrate that all categories are realized throughout the corpus . based on the outcome of the ncit study we argue that the devised categorisation of changes is helpful for ontology engineers and their understanding of changes carried out between ontologies .
