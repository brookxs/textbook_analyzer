tagme : on-the-fly annotation of short-text fragments (by wikipedia entities) we designed and implemented tagme , a system that is able to efficiently and judiciously augment a plain-text with pertinent hyperlinks to wikipedia pages . the specialty of tagme with respect to known systems [5,8] is that it may annotate texts which are short and poorly composed , such as snippets of search-engine results , tweets , news , etc. . this annotation is extremely informative , so any task that is currently addressed using the bag-of-words paradigm could benefit from using this annotation to draw upon (the millions of) wikipedia pages and their inter-relations .
