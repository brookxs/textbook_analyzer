aging-effects on query flow graphs for query-suggestion world-wide-web content continuously grows in size and importance . furthermore , users ask web-search-engines to satisfy increasingly disparate information-needs . new techniques and tools are constantly developed aimed at assisting users in the interaction with the-web search-engine . query-recommender-systems suggesting interesting queries to users are an example of such tools . most query-recommendation techniques are based on the knowledge of the behaviors of past users of the search-engine recorded in query-logs . a recent query-log mining approach for query-recommendation is based on query flow graphs (qfg) . in this paper we propose an evaluation of the effects of time on this query-recommendation model . as users interests change over time , the knowledge extracted from query-logs may suffer an aging effect as new interesting topics appear . in order to validate experimentally this hypothesis , we build different query flow graphs from the queries belonging to a large query-log of a real-world search-engine . each query-flow-graph is built on distinct query-log segments . then , we generate recommendations on different sets of queries . results are assessed both by means of human-judgments and by using an automatic evaluator showing that the models inexorably age .
