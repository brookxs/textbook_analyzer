fuzzy semantic-web-ontology learning from fuzzy-uml-model how to quickly and cheaply construct web-ontologies has become a key technology to enable the-semantic-web . classical ontologies are not sufficient for handling imprecise and uncertain-information that is commonly found in many application-domains . in this paper , we propose an approach for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy uml models , in which the fuzzy-ontology consists of fuzzy-ontology structure and instances . firstly , the fuzzy-uml-model is investigated in detail , and a kind of formal-definition of fuzzy uml models is proposed . then , a kind of fuzzy-ontology called fuzzy owl-dl ontology is introduced . furthermore , we consider the fuzzy-uml-model and the corresponding fuzzy uml instantiations (i.e. , object-diagrams) simultaneously , and translate them into the fuzzy-ontology structure and the fuzzy-ontology instances , respectively . in addition , since a fuzzy owl-dl ontology is equivalent to a fuzzy-description-logic f-shoin (d) knowledge-base , how the reasoning-problems of fuzzy uml models (e.g. , consistency , subsumption , equivalence , and redundancy) may be reasoned through reasoning-mechanism of f-shoin (d) is investigated , which can help to construct fuzzy ontologies more exactly .
