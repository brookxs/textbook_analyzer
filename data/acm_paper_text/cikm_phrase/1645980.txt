ranking-model adaptation for domain-specific-search recently , various domain-specific-search engines emerge , which are restricted to specific topicalities or document-formats , and vertical to the broad-based search . simply applying the ranking-model trained for the broad-based search to the verticals can not achieve a sound-performance due to the domain differences , while building different ranking-models for each domain is both laborious for labeling sufficient training-samples and time-consuming or the training-process . in this paper , to address the above difficulties , we investigate two problems : (1) whether we can adapt the ranking-model learned for existing web-page search or verticals , to the new domain , so that the amount of labeled-data and the training cost is reduced , while the performance requirement is still satisfied ; and (2) how to adapt the ranking-model from auxiliary domains to a new target-domain . we address the second problem from the regularization-framework and an algorithm called ranking-adaptation svm is proposed . our algorithm is flexible enough , which needs only the prediction from the existing ranking-model , rather than the internal-representation of the model or the data from auxiliary domains . the first problem is addressed by the proposed ranking adaptability measurement , which quantitatively estimates if an existing ranking-model can be adapted to the new domain . extensive experiments are performed over letor benchmark-dataset and two large-scale datasets crawled from different domains through a commercial internet-search engine , where the ranking-model learned for one domain will be adapted to the other . the results demonstrate the applicabilities of the proposed ranking-model adaptation-algorithm and the ranking adaptability measurement .
