diversification and refinement in collaborative-filtering recommender this paper considers a popular class of recommender-systems that are based on collaborative-filtering (cf) and proposes a novel technique for diversifying the recommendations that they give to users . items are clustered based on a unique notion of priority-medoids that provides a natural balance between the need to present highly ranked items vs. highly diverse ones . our solution estimates items diversity by comparing the rankings that different users gave to the items , thereby enabling diversification even in common scenarios where no semantic-information on the items is available . it also provides a natural zoom-in mechanism to focus on items (clusters) of interest and recommending diversified similar items . we present direc a plug-in that implements the above concepts and allows cf recommender-systems to diversify their recommendations . we illustrate the operation of direc in the context of a movie-recommendation system and present a thorough experimental-study that demonstrates the effectiveness of our recommendation diversification technique and its superiority over previous solutions .
