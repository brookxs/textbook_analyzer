predicting the volume of comments on online-news stories on-line news agents provide commenting facilities for readers to express their views with regard to news stories . the number of user supplied comments on a news article may be indicative of its importance or impact . we report on exploratory work that predicts the comment-volume of news-articles prior to publication using five feature-sets . we address the prediction-task as a two stage classification-task : a binary-classification identifies articles with the potential to receive comments , and a second binary-classification receives the output from the first step to label articles `` low '' or `` high '' comment-volume . the results show solid performance for the former task , while performance degrades for the latter .
