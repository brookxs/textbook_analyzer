using domain-ontology for semantic-web usage-mining and next page prediction this paper proposes the integration of semantic-information drawn from a web-application 's domain-knowledge into all phases of the-web usage-mining process (preprocessing , pattern-discovery , and recommendation/prediction) . the goal is to have an intelligent semantics-aware web-usage-mining framework . this is accomplished by using semantic-information in the sequential-pattern-mining algorithm to prune the search-space and partially relieve the algorithm from support counting . in addition , semantic-information is used in the prediction phase with low order markov-models , for less space-complexity and accurate prediction , that will help ambiguous predictions problem . experimental-results show that semantics-aware sequential-pattern-mining algorithms can perform 4 times faster than regular non-semantics-aware algorithms with only 26 \ % of the memory requirement .
