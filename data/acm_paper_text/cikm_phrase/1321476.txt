measuring article-quality in wikipedia : models and evaluation wikipedia has grown to be the world largest and busiest free encyclopedia , in which articles are collaboratively written and maintained by volunteers online . despite its success as a means of knowledge-sharing and collaboration , the public has never stopped criticizing the quality of wikipedia articles edited by non-experts and inexperienced contributors . in this paper , we investigate the problem of assessing the quality of articles in collaborative-authoring of wikipedia . we propose three article-quality measurement-models that make use of the interaction data between articles and their contributors derived from the article edit history . our b <scp> asic </scp> model is designed based on the mutual dependency between article-quality and their author authority . the p <scp> eer </scp> r <scp> eview </scp> model introduces the review behavior into measuring article-quality . finally , our p <scp> rob </scp> r <scp> eview </scp> models extend p <scp> eer </scp> r <scp> eview </scp> with partial reviewership of contributors as they edit various portions of the articles . we conduct experiments on a set of well-labeled wikipedia articles to evaluate the effectiveness of our quality-measurement models in resembling human-judgement .
