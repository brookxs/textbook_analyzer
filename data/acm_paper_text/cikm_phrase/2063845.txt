generating links to background-knowledge : a case-study using narrative radiology-reports automatically annotating texts with background-information has recently received much attention . we conduct a case-study in automatically generating links from narrative radiology-reports to wikipedia . such links help users understand the medical-terminology and thereby increase the value of the reports . direct applications of existing automatic-link-generation systems trained on wikipedia to our radiology data do not yield satisfactory results . our analysis reveals that medical phrases are often syntactically regular but semantically complicated , e.g. , containing multiple concepts or concepts with multiple modifiers . the latter property is the main reason for the failure of existing systems . based on this observation , we propose an automatic-link-generation approach that takes into account these properties . we use a sequential labeling approach with syntactic-features for anchor-text identification in order to exploit syntactic regularities in medical-terminology . we combine this with a sub-anchor based approach to target finding , which is aimed at coping with the complex semantic-structure of medical phrases . empirical-results show that the proposed system effectively improves the performance over existing systems .
