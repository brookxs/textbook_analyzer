perspective hierarchical-dirichlet-process for user-tagged image-modeling in this paper , we proposed a perspective hierarchical-dirichlet-process (phdp) model to deal with user-tagged image-modeling . the contribution is two-fold . firstly , we associate image-features with image-tags . secondly , we incorporate the user 's perspectives into the image tag generation-process and introduce new latent-variables to determine if an image tag is generated from user 's perspectives or from the image-content . therefore , the model is able to extract both embedded semantic-components and user 's perspectives from user-tagged images . based on the proposed phdp model , we achieve automatic-image-tagging with users ' perspective . experimental-results show that the phdp model achieves better image-tagging performance compared to state-of-the-art topic-models .
