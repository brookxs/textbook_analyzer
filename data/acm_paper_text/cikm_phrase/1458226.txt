data weaving : scaling up the state-of-the-art in data-clustering the enormous amount and dimensionality of data processed by modern data-mining tools require effective , scalable unsupervised-learning techniques . unfortunately , the majority of previously proposed clustering-algorithms are either effective or scalable . this paper is concerned with information-theoretic-clustering (itc) that has historically been considered the state-of-the-art in clustering multi-dimensional-data . most existing itc methods are computationally expensive and not easily scalable . those few itc methods that scale well (using , e.g. , parallelization) are often outperformed by the others , of an inherently sequential nature . first , we justify this observation theoretically . we then propose data weaving - a novel method for parallelizing sequential-clustering algorithms . data weaving is intrinsically multi-modal - it allows simultaneous-clustering of a few types of data (modalities) . finally , we use data weaving to parallelize multi-modal itc , which results in proposing a powerful dataloom algorithm . in our experimentation with small datasets , dataloom shows practically identical performance compared to expensive sequential alternatives . on large-datasets , however , dataloom demonstrates significant gains over other parallel clustering-methods . to illustrate the scalability , we simultaneously clustered rows and columns of a contingency-table with over 120 billion entries .
