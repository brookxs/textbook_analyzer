query-suggestion using hitting-time generating alternative queries , also known as query-suggestion , has long been proved useful to help a user explore and express his information-need . in many scenarios , such suggestions can be generated from a large-scale graph of queries and other accessory information , such as the clickthrough . however , how to generate suggestions while ensuring their semantic-consistency with the original query remains a challenging problem . in this work , we propose a novel query-suggestion algorithm based on ranking-queries with the hitting-time on a large-scale bipartite-graph . without involvement of twisted heuristics or heavy tuning of parameters , this method clearly captures the semantic consistency between the suggested query and the original query . empirical experiments on a large-scale query-log of a commercial-search-engine and a scientific-literature collection show that hitting-time is effective to generate semantically consistent query suggestions . the proposed algorithm and its variations can successfully boost long-tail queries , accommodating personalized-query-suggestion , as well as finding related authors in research .
