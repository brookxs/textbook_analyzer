context interchange : overcoming the challenges of large-scale interoperable database-systems in a dynamic-environment research in database interoperability has primarily focused on circumventing schematic and semantic incompatibility arising from autonomy of the underlying databases . we argue that , while existing integration-strategies might provide satisfactory support for small or static systems , their inadequacies rapidly become evident in large-scale interoperable database-systems operating in a dynamic-environment . this paper highlights the problem of receiver heterogeneity , scalability , and evolution which have received little attention in the literature , provides an overview of the context interchange approach to interoperability , illustrates why this is able to better circumvent the problems identified , and forges the connections to other works by suggesting how the context interchange framework differs from other integration approaches in the literature .
