an index for efficient semantic full-text-search in this paper we present a novel index-data-structure tailored towards semantic full-text-search . semantic full-text-search , as we call it , deeply integrates keyword-based full-text-search with structured-search in ontologies . queries are sparql-like , with additional relations for specifying word-entity co-occurrences . in order to build such queries the user-needs to be guided . we believe that incremental query-construction with context-sensitive suggestions in every step serves that purpose well . our index has to answer queries and provide such suggestions in real-time . we achieve this through a novel kind of posting lists and query-processing , avoiding very long (intermediate) result lists and expensive (non-local) operations on these lists . in an evaluation of 8000 queries on the full english wikipedia (40 gb xml dump) and the yago ontology (26.6 million facts) , we achieve average query and suggestion times of around 150ms .
