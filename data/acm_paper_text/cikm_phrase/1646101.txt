fast and effective histogram construction histogram construction or sequence-segmentation is a basic task with applications in database-systems , information-retrieval , and knowledge-management . its aim is to approximate a sequence by line-segments . unfortunately , the quadratic algorithm that derives an optimal histogram for euclidean error lacks the desired scalability . therefore , sophisticated approximation-algorithms have been recently proposed , while several simple heuristics are used in practice . still , these solutions fail to resolve the efficiency-quality tradeoff in a satisfactory manner . in this paper we take a fresh view on the problem . we propose conceptually clear and scalable-algorithms that efficiently derive high-quality histograms . we experimentally demonstrate that existing approximation schemes fail to deliver the desired efficiency and conventional heuristics do not fare well on the side of quality . on the other hand , our schemes match or exceed the quality of the former and the efficiency of the latter .
