visual cube and on-line-analytical-processing of images on-line-analytical-processing (olap) has shown great success in many industry applications , including sales , marketing , management , financial-data analysis , etc. . in this paper , we propose visual cube and multi-dimensional olap of image-collections , such as web-images indexed in search-engines (e.g. , google and bing) , product-images (e.g. amazon) and photos shared on social-networks (e.g. , facebook and flickr) . it provides online responses to user requests with summarized statistics of image information and handles rich semantics related to image visual-features . a clustering structure measure is proposed to help users freely navigate and explore images . efficient-algorithms are developed to construct visual cube . in addition , we introduce the new issue of cell overlapping in data-cube and present efficient solutions for visual cube computation and olap-operations . extensive experiments are conducted and the results show good performance of our algorithms .
