seeking provenance of information using social-media social-media propagates breaking-news and disinformation alike fast and on an unsurpassed scale . because of its democratizing nature , social-media users can easily produce , receive , and propagate a piece of information without necessarily providing traceable information . thus , there are no means for a user to verify the provenance (aka sources or originators) of information . the disinformation can cause tragic consequences to society and individuals . this work aims to take advantage of characteristics of social-media to provide a solution to the problem of lacking traceable information . such knowledge can provide additional context to received information such that a user can assess how much value , trust , and validity should be placed in it . in this paper , we are studying a novel research problem that facilitates the seeking of the provenance of information for a few known recipients (less than 1 % of the total recipients) by recovering the paths it has taken from its originators . the proposed methodology exploits easily computable node centralities of a large social-media network . the experimental-results with facebook and twitter datasets show that the proposed mechanism is effective in correctly identifying the additional recipients and seeking the provenance of information .
