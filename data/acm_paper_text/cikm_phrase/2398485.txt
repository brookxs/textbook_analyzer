incorporating word-correlation into tag-topic model for semantic-knowledge-acquisition this paper presents a tag-topic model with dirichlet forest prior (ttm-df) for semantic-knowledge-acquisition from blog . the ttm-df model extends the tag-topic model (ttm) by replacing the dirichlet-prior with the dirichlet forest prior over the topic-word multinomial . the correlation between words are calculated to generate a set of must-links and cannot-links , then the structures of dirichlet trees are obtained though encoding the constraints of must-links and cannot-links . words under the same subtrees are expected to be more correlated than words under different subtrees . we conduct experiments on a synthetic and a blog dataset . both of the experimental-results show that the ttm-df model performs much better than the ttm model . it can improve the coherence of the underlying topics and the tag-topic distributions , and capture semantic-knowledge effectively .
