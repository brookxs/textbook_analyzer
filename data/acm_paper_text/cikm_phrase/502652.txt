svm binary-classifier ensembles for image-classification we study how the svm-based binary classifiers can be effectively combined to tackle the multi-class image-classification problem . we study several ensemble schemes , including opc (one per class) , pwc (pairwise-coupling) , and ecoc (error-correction output-coding) , that aim to achieve good error-correction capability through redundancy . to enhance these ensemble schemes ' accuracy , we propose methods that on the one hand boost the margins (i.e. , confidence) of the svm-based binary classifiers , and , on the other hand , remove the noise of irrelevant classifiers from class prediction . from empirical-study we show that our margin boosting and noise-reduction methods lead to higher classification-accuracy than ensemble schemes that are solely designed for maximum-error correction capability .
