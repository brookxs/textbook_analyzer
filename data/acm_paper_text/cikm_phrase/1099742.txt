consistent-query-answering under key and exclusion dependencies : algorithms and experiments research in consistent-query-answering studies the definition and computation of `` meaningful '' answers to queries posed to inconsistent-databases , i.e. , databases whose data do not satisfy the integrity-constraints (ics) declared on their schema . computing consistent answers to conjunctive-queries is generally conp-hard in data-complexity , even in the presence of very restricted forms of ics (single , unary keys) . recent studies on consistent-query-answering for database schemas containing only key dependencies have analyzed the possibility of identifying classes of queries whose consistent answers can be obtained by a first-order rewriting of the query , which in turn can be easily formulated in sql and directly evaluated through any relational-dbms . in this paper we study consistent-query-answering in the presence of key dependencies and exclusion dependencies . we first prove that even in the presence of only exclusion dependencies the problem is conp-hard in data-complexity , and define a general method for consistent answering of conjunctive-queries under key and exclusion dependencies , based on the rewriting of the query in datalog with negation . then , we identify a subclass of conjunctive-queries that can be first-order rewritten in the presence of key and exclusion dependencies , and define an algorithm for computing the first-order rewriting of a query belonging to such a class of queries . finally , we compare the relative efficiency of the two methods for processing queries in the subclass above mentioned . experimental-results , conducted on a real and large database of the computer-science engineering degrees of the university of rome `` la sapienza '' , clearly show the computational advantage of the first-order_based technique .
