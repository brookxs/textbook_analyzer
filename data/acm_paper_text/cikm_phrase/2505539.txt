ontology authoring with forza generic , reusable ontology elements , such as a foundational-ontology 's categories and part-whole relations , are essential for good and interoperable knowledge-representation . ontology developers , which include domain-experts and novices , face the challenge to figure out which category or relationship to choose for their ontology authoring task . to reduce this bottleneck , there is a need to have guidance to handle these ontology-laden entities . we solve this with a generic-approach and realize it with the foundational-ontology and reasoner-enhanced axiomatization (forza) method , containing dolce , a decision-diagram for dolce categories , part-whole relations , and an automated reasoner that is used during the authoring process to propose feasible axioms . this fusion has been integrated in the moki ontology-development tool to validate its implementability .
