an extended-logic-programming_based multi-agent-system formalization in mobile-environments in this paper , we propose an extended-logic-programming_based formalization for a multi-agent-system in mobile-environments . such a system consists of a number of agents connected via wire or wireless-communication channels . our formalization is knowledge oriented and has declarative-semantics inherited from extended-logic-programming . this model can be used to study the details of knowledge transaction in mobile-environments .
