predicting web-spam with http-session-information web-spam is a widely-recognized threat to the quality and security of the-web . web-spam pages pollute search-engine indexes , burden web-crawlers and web-mining services , and expose users to dangerous web-borne malware . to defend against web-spam , most previous research analyzes the contents of web pages and the link-structure of the-web graph . unfortunately , these heavyweight approaches require full downloads of both legitimate and spam pages to be effective , making real-time deployment of these techniques infeasible for web-browsers , high-performance web-crawlers , and real-time-web applications . in this paper , we present a lightweight , predictive approach to web-spam classification that relies exclusively on http-session-information (i.e. , hosting ip-addresses and http session headers) . concretely , we built an http session classifier based on our predictive technique , and by incorporating this classifier into http retrieval operations , we are able to detect web-spam pages before the actual content transfer . as a result , our approach protects web users from web-propagated malware , and it generates significant bandwidth and storage savings . by applying our predictive technique to a corpus of almost 350,000 web-spam instances and almost 400,000 legitimate instances , we were able to successfully detect 88.2 \ % of the-web spam pages with a false-positive-rate of only 0.4 \ % . these classification results are superior to previous evaluation results obtained with traditional link-based and content-based techniques . additionally , our experiments show that our approach saves an average of 15.4 kb of bandwidth and storage resources for every successfully identified web-spam page , while only adding an average of 101 microseconds to each http retrieval operation . therefore , our predictive technique can be successfully deployed in applications that demand real-time spam-detection .
