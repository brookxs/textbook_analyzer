estimating corpus-size via queries we consider the problem of estimating the size of a collection of documents using only a standard query-interface . our main idea is to construct an unbiased and low-variance estimator that can closely approximate the size of any set of documents defined by certain conditions , including that each document in the set must match at least one query from a uniformly sampleable query pool of known size , fixed in advance.using this basic estimator , we propose two approaches to estimating corpus-size . the first approach requires a uniform random-sample of documents from the corpus . the second approach avoids this notoriously difficult sample-generation problem , and instead uses two fairly uncorrelated sets of terms as query pools ; the accuracy of the second approach depends on the degree of correlation among the two sets of terms.experiments on a large trec collection and on three major search-engines demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms .
