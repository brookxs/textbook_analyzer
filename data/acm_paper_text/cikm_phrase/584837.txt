inferring query-models by computing information-flow the language-modelling approach to information-retrieval can also be used to compute query-models . a query-model can be envisaged as an expansion of an initial query . the more prominent query-models in the literature have a probabilistic basis . this paper introduces an alternative , non-probabilistic approach to query modelling whereby the strength of information-flow is computed between a query q and a term w . information-flow is a reflection of how strongly w is informationally contained within the query q . the information-flow model is based on hyperspace-analogue-to-language (hal) vector-representations , which reflects the lexical-co-occurrence-information of terms . research from cognitive-science has demonstrated the cognitive compatibility of hal representations with human-processing . query-models computed from trec queries by hal-based information-flow are compared experimentally with two probabilistic query-language models . experimental-results are provided showing the hal-based information-flow model be superior to query-models computed via markov-chains , and seems to be as effective as a probabilistically motivated relevance-model .
