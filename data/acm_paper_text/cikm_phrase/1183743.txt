estimation , sensitivity , and generalization in parameterized retrieval-models in this work we investigate three important aspects of parameterized retrieval-models : estimation , sensitivity , and generalization . since all parameterized models , even those based on heuristics , have inherent uncertainty , we study these issues using statistical tools .
