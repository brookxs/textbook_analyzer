automatically acquiring a semantic-network of related concepts we describe the automatic-construction of a semantic-network 1 , in which over 3000 of the most frequently occurring monosemous nouns 2 in wikipedia (each appearing between 1,500 and 100,000 times) are linked to their semantically related concepts in the wordnet noun ontology . relatedness between nouns is discovered automatically from co-occurrence in wikipedia texts using an information-theoretic inspired measure . our algorithm then capitalizes on salient sense-clustering among related nouns to automatically disambiguate them to their appropriate senses (i.e. , concepts) . through the act of disambiguation , we begin to accumulate relatedness data for concepts denoted by polysemous nouns , as well . the resultant concept-to-concept associations , covering 17,543 nouns , and 27,312 distinct senses among them , constitute a large-scale semantic-network of related concepts that can be conceived of as augmenting the wordnet noun ontology with related-to links .
