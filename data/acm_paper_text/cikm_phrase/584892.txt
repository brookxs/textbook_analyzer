thematic-mapping - from unstructured documents to taxonomies verity inc. has developed a comprehensive suite of tools for accurately and efficiently organizing enterprise content which involves four basic steps : (i) creating taxonomies , (ii) building classification-models , (iii) populating taxonomies with documents , and (iv) deploying populated taxonomies in enterprise portals . a taxonomy is a hierarchical-representation of categories . a taxonomy provides a navigation-structure for exploring and understanding the underlying corpus without sifting through a huge volume of documents . thematic-mapping automatically discovers a concept-tree from a corpus of unstructured documents and assigns meaningful labels to concepts based on a semantic-network . integrating with verity intelligent classifier 's user-friendly gui , a user can drill down a concept-tree for navigation , perform a conceptual-search to retrieve documents pertaining to a concept , build a taxonomy from the concept-tree , as well as edit a taxonomy to tailor it into various views (customized taxonomies) of the same corpus . classification-rules can be generated automatically from concepts . these classification-rules can be used for populating documents into the taxonomy .
