codet : sentence-based containment detection in news corpora we study a generalized version of the near-duplicate-detection problem which concerns whether a document is a subset of another document . in text-based applications , document-containment can be observed in exact-duplicates , near-duplicates , or containments , where the first two are special cases of the third . we introduce a novel method , called codet , which focuses particularly on this problem , and compare its performance with four well-known near-duplicate-detection methods (dsc , full fingerprinting , i-match , and simhash) that are adapted to containment detection . our method is expandable to different domains , and especially suitable for streaming-news . experimental-results show that codet effectively and efficiently produces remarkable results in detecting containments .
