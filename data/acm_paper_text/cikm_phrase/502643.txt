dynamic and hierarchical spatial-access-method using integer searching dynamic and complex computation in the area of geographic-information-system (gis) or mobile-computing system involves huge amount of spatial-objects such as points , boxes , polygons , etc and requires a scalable data structure and an efficient management tool for this information . in this paper , for a dynamic management of spatial-objects , we construct a hierarchical dynamic-data-structure , called an ist/opg hierarchy , which may overcome some limitations of existing spatial-access-methods (sams) . the hierarchy is constructed by combining three primary components : (1) minimum boundary rectangle (mbr) , which is the most widely used method among sams ; (2) the population-based domain slicing , which is modified from the-grid file [14] ; (3) extended optimal integer searching algorithm [4] . for dynamic management of spatial-objects in the ist/opg hierarchy , a number of primary and supplementary operations are introduced . this paper includes a comparative-analysis of our approach with previous sams , such as r-tree , r + - tree and r * - tree and qsf-tree . the results of analysis show that our approach is better than other sams in construction and query time and space requirements . specifically , for a given search domain with n objects , our query-operations yield $ o ($ \ scriptsize $ \ sqrt {\ frac {\ log n} {\ log \ log n}} $ \ normalsize $) $ compared to $ o (\ log n) $ of the fast sam and an ist/opg hierarchy containing $ n $ objects can be constructed in $ o (n $ \ scriptsize $ \ sqrt {\ frac {\ log n} {\ log \ log n}} $ \ normalsize $) $ time and o (n) space .
