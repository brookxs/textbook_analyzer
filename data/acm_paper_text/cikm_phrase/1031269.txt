database support for species extraction from the biosystematics literature : a feasibility demonstration a part of the biosystematics literature is currently being digitized and manually marked up with xml . fast-search on such documents shall be feasible . but marking up such documents incurs high costs , and biologists would like to know the value of such an activity in advance . deploying standard xml-database technology in a straightforward way is not feasible , because of two characteristics of biosystematics documents . the first one is that descriptions of taxa are related , i.e. , a more specific taxon should inherit from a more general one . the combination of inheritance with information-retrieval mechanisms gives rise to difficulties addressed in this article . the second issue is the frequent occurrence of very specific technical-terms in such documents , i.e. , geographical-information or biological terms . to investigate the characteristics of the search in the presence of such difficulties , we have designed and implemented a respective system , based on relational-database-technology . we use a collection of xml-documents that mimics the characteristics of biosystematics documents , as we will explain . we propose two query-evaluation alternatives and compare them by means of performance experiments . it turns out that our techniques can administer the envisioned corpus of documents efficiently and cope with those problems at the same time .
