hybrid results-merging the problem of results-merging in distributed-information-retrieval environments has been approached by two different directions in research . estimation approaches attempt to calculate the relevance of the returned documents through ad-hoc methodologies (weighted-score merging , regression etc) while download approaches , download all the documents locally , partially or completely , in order to estimate `` first hand '' their relevance . both have their advantages and disadvantages . it is assumed that download algorithms are more effective but they are very expensive in terms of time and bandwidth . estimation approaches on the other hand , usually rely on document-relevance scores being returned by the remote collections in order to achieve maximum performance . in addition to that , regression algorithms , which have proved to be more effective than weighted scores merging , rely on a significant number of overlap documents in order to function effectively , practically requiring multiple interactions with the remote collections . the new algorithm that is introduced reconciles the above two approaches , combining their strengths , while minimizing their weaknesses . it is based on downloading a limited , selected number of documents from the remote collections and estimating the relevance of the rest through regression methodologies . the proposed algorithm is tested in a variety of settings and its performance is found to be better than estimation approaches , while approximating that of download .
