empirical-validation of the buckley-osthus model for the-web host-graph : degree and edge distributions we consider the buckley-osthus implementation of preferential-attachment and its ability to model the-web host-graph in two aspects . one is the degree-distribution that we observe to follow the power-law , as often being the case for real-world graphs . another one is the two-dimensional edge distribution , the number of edges between vertices of given degrees . we fit a single `` initial attractiveness '' parameter a of the model , first with respect to the degree-distribution of the-web host-graph , and then , absolutely independently , with respect to the edge distribution . surprisingly , the values of a we obtain turn out to be nearly the same . therefore the same model with the same value of the parameter a fits very well the two independent and basic aspects of the-web host-graph . in addition , we demonstrate that other models completely lack the asymptotic behavior of the edge distribution of the-web host-graph , even when accurately capturing the degree-distribution . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study confirming the ability of preferential-attachment models to reflect the distribution of edges between vertices with respect to their degrees in a real graph of internet .
