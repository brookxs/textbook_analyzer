short-text classification by detecting information path short-text is becoming ubiquitous in many modern information systems . due to the shortness and sparseness of short-texts , there are less informative word co-occurrences among them , which naturally pose great difficulty for classification-tasks on such data . to overcome this difficulty , this paper proposes a new way for effectively classifying the short-texts . our method is based on a key observation that there usually exists ordered subsets in short-texts , which is termed `` information path '' in this work , and classification on each subset based on the classification results of some pervious subsets can yield higher overall accuracy than classifying the entire data-set directly . we propose a method to detect the information path and employ it in short-text classification . different from the state-of-art methods , our method does not require any external-knowledge or corpus that usually need careful fine-tuning , which makes our method easier and more robust on different data-sets . experiments on two real-world data-sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over the existing methods .
