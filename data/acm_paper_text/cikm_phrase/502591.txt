bipartite-graph partitioning and data-clustering many data-types arising from data-mining-applications can be modeled as bipartite-graphs , examples include terms and documents in a text-corpus , customers and purchasing items in market-basket-analysis and reviewers and movies in a movie recommender-system . in this paper , we propose a new data-clustering method based on partitioning the underlying bipartite-graph . the partition is constructed by minimizing a normalized-sum of edge weights between unmatched pairs of vertices of the bipartite-graph . we show that an approximate-solution to the minimization problem can be obtained by computing a partial singular-value-decomposition (svd) of the associated edge-weight matrix of the bipartite-graph . we point out the connection of our clustering-algorithm to correspondence-analysis used in multivariate-analysis . we also briefly discuss the issue of assigning data objects to multiple clusters . in the experimental-results , we apply our clustering-algorithm to the problem of document-clustering to illustrate its effectiveness and efficiency .
