a quasi-synchronous dependence model for information-retrieval incorporating syntactic-features in a retrieval-model has had very limited success in the past , with the exception of binary term dependencies . this paper presents a new term-dependency modeling approach based on syntactic-dependency parsing for both queries and documents . our model is inspired by a quasi-synchronous stochastic-process for machine-translation [21] . we model four different types of relationships between syntactically dependent term pairs to perform inexact-matching between documents and queries . we also propose a machine-learning technique for predicting optimal parameter-settings for a retrieval-model incorporating syntactic relationships . the results on trec collections show that the quasi-synchronous dependence model can improve retrieval-performance and outperform a strong state-of-art sequential dependence baseline when we use predicted optimal parameters .
