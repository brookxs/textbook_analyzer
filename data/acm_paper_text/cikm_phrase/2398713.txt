spatial-aware interest group queries in location-based-social-networks location-based-social-networks , such as foursquare and facebook places , are bridging the gap between the physical world and online-social-networking-services through acquired user locations . some social-networks released check-in services that allow users to share their visiting locations with their friends . in this paper , users ' interests are modeled by check-in actions . we propose a new spatial-aware interest group (sig) query that retrieves a user-group of size k where every user is highly interested in the query keyword and also spatially close to each other . an efficient-algorithm air based on the ir-tree is proposed for the processing of sig queries . furthermore , an optimization is developed and achieves a much better performance than the baseline algorithm .
