exploring and predicting search-task difficulty we report on an investigation of behavioral differences between users in difficult and easy search-tasks . behavioral factors that can be used in real-time to predict task-difficulty are identified . user-data was collected in a controlled lab experiment (n = 38) where each participant completed four search-tasks in the genomics domain . we looked at user-behaviors that can be obtained by systems at three levels , distinguished by the time point when the measurements can be done . they are : 1) first-round level at the beginning of the search , 2) accumulated level during the search , and 3) whole-session level by the end of the search . results show that a number of user-behaviors at all three levels differed between easy and difficult tasks . models predicting task-difficulty at all three levels were developed and evaluated . a real-time model incorporating first-round and accumulated levels of behaviors (fa) had fairly good prediction-performance (accuracy 83 % ; precision 88 %) , which is comparable with the model using the whole-session level behaviors which are not real-time (accuracy 75 % ; precision 92 %) . we also found that for efficiency purpose , using only a limited number of significant variables (fc_fa) can obtain a prediction-accuracy of 75 % , with a precision of 88 % . our findings can help-search systems predict task-difficulty and adapt search-results to users .
