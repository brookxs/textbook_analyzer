a late-fusion approach to cross-lingual document-re-ranking the field of information-retrieval still strives to develop models which allow semantic-information to be integrated in the ranking process to improve performance in comparison to standard bag-of-words_based models . cross-lingual-information-retrieval is an example of where such a model is required , as content or concepts often need to be matched across languages . to overcome this problem , a conceptual-model has been adopted in ranking an entire corpus which normally exploits latent/implicit features of the text . one of the drawbacks of this model is that the computational cost is significant and often intractable in modern test-collections . therefore , approaches utilizing concept-based models for re-ranking initial retrieval results have attracted a considerable amount of study , in particular the latent concept-model . however , fitting such a model to a smaller collection is less meaningful than fitting it into the whole corpus . this paper proposes a late-fusion method which incorporates scores generated by using external-knowledge to enhance the space produced by the latent concept method . this method is further demonstrated to be suitable for multilingual re-ranking purposes . to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method , experiments were conducted over test-collections across three languages . the results demonstrate that the method can comfortably achieve improvements in retrieval-performance over several re-ranking methods .
