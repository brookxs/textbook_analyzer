robust nonnegative-matrix-factorization using l21-norm nonnegative-matrix-factorization (nmf) is widely used in data-mining and machine-learning fields . however , many data contain noises and outliers . thus a robust version of nmf is needed . in this paper , we propose a robust formulation of nmf using l21-norm loss-function . we also derive a computational-algorithm with rigorous convergence-analysis . our robust nmf approach , (1) can handle noises and outliers ; (2) provides very efficient and elegant updating rules ; (3) incurs almost the same computational cost as standard nmf , thus potentially to be used in more real-world-application tasks . experiments on 10 datasets show that the robust nmf provides more faithful basis factors and consistently better clustering results as compared to standard nmf .
