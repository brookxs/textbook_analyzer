exploiting user-interests for collaborative-filtering : interests-expansion via personalized-ranking in real applications , a given user buys or rates an item based on his/her interests . learning to leverage this interest information is often critical for recommender-systems . however , in existing recommender-systems , the information about latent user interests are largely under-explored . to that end , in this paper , we propose an interest expansion strategy via personalized-ranking based on the topic-model , named iexpand , for building an interest-oriented collaborative-filtering framework . the iexpand method introduces a three-layer , user-interest-item , representation-scheme , which leads to more interpretable recommendation results and helps the understanding of the interactions among users , items , and user-interests . moreover , iexpand strategically deals with many issues , such as the overspecialization and the cold-start-problems . finally , we evaluate iexpand on benchmark data sets , and experimental-results show that iexpand outperforms state-of-the-art methods .
