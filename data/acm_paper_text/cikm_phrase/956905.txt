a reliable storage-management layer for distributed-information-retrieval systems we present a storage-management layer that facilitates the implementation of parallel-information-retrieval systems , and related applications , on networks-of-workstations . the storage-management layer automates the process of adding and removing nodes , and implements a dispersed mirroring strategy to improve reliability . when nodes are added and removed , the document collection managed by the system is redistributed for load-balancing purposes . the use of dispersed mirroring minimizes the impact of node-failures and system modifications on query-performance .
