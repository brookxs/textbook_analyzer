a general-framework to encode heterogeneous-information-sources for contextual pattern-mining traditional pattern-mining methods usually work on single data sources . however , in practice , there are often multiple and heterogeneous-information-sources . they collectively provide contextual-information not available in any single-source alone describing the same set of objects , and are useful for discovering hidden contextual patterns . one important challenge is to provide a general methodology to mine contextual patterns easily and efficiently . in this paper , we propose a general-framework to encode contextual-information from multiple sources into a coherent representation -- contextual-information graph (cig) . the complexity of the encoding-scheme is linear in both time and space . more importantly , cig can be handled by any single-source pattern-mining algorithms that accept taxonomies without any modification . we demonstrate by three applications of the contextual association-rule , sequence and graph-mining , that contextual patterns providing rich and insightful knowledge can be easily discovered by the proposed framework . it enables contextual pattern-mining (cpm) by reusing single-source methods , and is easy to deploy and use in real-world systems .
