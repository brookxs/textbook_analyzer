constructing better document and query-models with markov-chains document and query expansions have been used separately in previous studies to enhance the representation of documents and queries . in this paper , we propose a general method that integrates both of them . expansion is carried out using multi-stage markov-chains . our experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the existing approaches .
