filtering or adapting : two strategies to exploit noisy parallel-corpora for cross-language-information-retrieval noisy parallel-corpora have been widely used for cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) . however , the previous studies only focus on truly parallel-corpus . in this paper , we examine two possible approaches to exploit noisy corpora : filtering out noise from the corpora or adapting the training-process of translation-model to the noise corpora . our experiments show that the second approach is better suited to clir .
