exploiting bidirectional-links : making spamming detection easier previous anti-spamming algorithms based on link-structure suffer from either the weakness of the page value metric or the vagueness of the seed-selection . in this paper , we propose two page value metrics , avrank and hvrank . these two `` values '' of all the-web pages can be well assessed by using the bidirectional-links ' information . moreover , with the help of bidirectional-links , it becomes easier to enlarge the propagation coverage of seed-sets . we further discuss the effectiveness of the combination of these two metrics , such as the quadratic mean of them . our experimental-results show that with such two metrics , our method can filter out spam sites and identify reputable ones more effectively than previous algorithms such as trustrank .
