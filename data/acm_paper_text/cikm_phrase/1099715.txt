effects of web-document evolution on genre-classification the world-wide-web is a massive corpus that constantly evolves . classification experiments usually grab a snapshot (temporally and spatially) of the-web for a corpus . in this paper , we examine the effects of page evolution on genre-classification of web-pages . web genre refers to the type of the page characterized by features such as style , form or presentation layout , and meta-content ; web genre can be used to tune spider crawling re-visits and inform relevance-judgments for search-engines . we found that pages in some genres change rarely if at all and can be used in present-day research experiments without requiring an updated version . we show that an old corpus can be used for training when testing on new web pages , with only a marginal drop in accuracy rates on genre-classification . we also show that features found to be useful in one corpus do not transfer well to other corpora with different genres .
