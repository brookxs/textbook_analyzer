topic-evolution and social-interactions : how authors effect research we propose a method for discovering the dependency-relationships between the topics of documents shared in social-networks using the latent social-interactions , attempting to answer the question : given a seemingly new topic , from where does this topic evolve ? in particular , we seek to discover the pair-wise probabilistic dependency in topics of documents which associate social-actors from a latent social-network , where these documents are being shared . by viewing the evolution of topics as a markov-chain , we estimate a markov transition-matrix of topics by leveraging social-interactions and topic semantics . metastable states in a markov-chain are applied to the clustering of topics . applied to the citeseer dataset , a collection of documents in academia , we show the trends of research topics , how research topics are related and which are stable . we also show how certain social-actors , authors , impact these topics and propose new ways for evaluating author impact .
