text-classification using esc-based stochastic decision lists we propose a new method of text-classification using stochastic decision lists . a stochastic decision list is an ordered sequence of if-then rules , and our method can be viewed as a rule-based-method for text-classification having advantages of readability and refinability of acquired knowledge . our method is unique in that decision lists are automatically constructed on the basis of the principle of minimizing extended stochastic complexity (esc) , and with it we are able to construct decision lists that have fewer errors in classification . the accuracy of classification achieved with our method appears better than or comparable to those of existing rule-based methods .
