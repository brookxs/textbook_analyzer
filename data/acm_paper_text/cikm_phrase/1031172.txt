the edam project : mining mass-spectra and more the edam project is a collaborative effort between computer scientists and environmental chemists at carleton college and uw-madison . the goal is to develop data-mining-techniques for advancing the-state-of-the-art in analyzing atmospheric aerosol datasets . the traditional approach for particle measurement , which is the collection of bulk samples of particulates on filters , is not adequate for studying particle dynamics and real-time correlations . this has led to the development of a new generation of real-time instruments that provide continuous or semi-continuous streams of data about certain aerosol properties . however , these instruments have added a significant level of complexity to atmospheric aerosol data , and dramatically increased the amounts of data to be collected , managed , and analyzed . we are investigating techniques for automatically labeling mass-spectra from different kinds of aerosol mass spectrometers , and then analyzing and exploring the rich spatiotemporal information collected from multiple geographically distributed instruments . in this talk , i will present an overview of some novel data mining problems , describe some of the techniques we are developing to address them , and discuss the broader applicability of these techniques to problems from other domains .
