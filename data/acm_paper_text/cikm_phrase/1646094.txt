scalable-learning of collective-behavior based on sparse social-dimensions the study of collective-behavior is to understand how individuals behave in a social-network environment . oceans of data generated by social-media like facebook , twitter , flickr and youtube present opportunities and challenges to studying collective-behavior in a large-scale . in this work , we aim to learn to predict collective-behavior in social-media . in particular , given information about some individuals , how can we infer the behavior of unobserved individuals in the same network ? a social-dimension_based approach is adopted to address the heterogeneity of connections presented in social-media . however , the networks in social-media are normally of colossal size , involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of actors . the scale of networks entails scalable-learning of models for collective-behavior prediction . to address the scalability issue , we propose an edge-centric-clustering scheme to extract sparse social-dimensions . with sparse social-dimensions , the social-dimension_based approach can efficiently handle networks of millions of actors while demonstrating comparable prediction-performance as other non-scalable methods .
