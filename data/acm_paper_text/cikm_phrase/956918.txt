dynamically maintaining frequent-items over a data-stream it is challenge to maintain frequent-items over a data-stream , with a small bounded memory , in a dynamic-environment where both insertion/deletion of items are allowed . in this paper , we propose a new novel algorithm , called hcount , which can handle both insertion-and-deletion of items with a much less memory-space than the best reported algorithm . our algorithm is also superior in terms of precision , recall and processing-time . in addition , our approach does not request the preknowledge on the size of range for a data-stream , and can handle range extension dynamically . given a little modification , algorithm hcount can be improved to hcount * , which even owns significantly better performance than before .
