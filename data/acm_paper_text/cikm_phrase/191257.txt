an optimal graph-traversal algorithm for evaluating linear binary-chain programs grahne et al. have presented a graph-algorithm for a subset of recursive-queries . this method consists of two phases . in the first phase , the method transforms a linear binary-chain program into a set of equations over expressions containing predicate symbols . in the second phase , a graph is constructed from the equations and the answers are produced by traversing the relevant paths . here we describe a new algorithm which requires less time than the algorithm of grahne et al. . the key idea of the improvement is to reduce the search-space that will be traversed when a query is invoked . further , we speed up the evaluation of cyclic data by generating most answers directly in terms of the answers already found and the associated path-information instead of traversing the corresponding paths as usual . in this way , our algorithm achieves a linear time-complexity for both cyclic and non-cyclic data .
