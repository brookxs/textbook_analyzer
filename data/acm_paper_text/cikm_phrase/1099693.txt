detecting changes on unordered xml-documents using relational-databases : a schema-conscious approach several relational approaches have been proposed to detect the changes to xml-documents by using relational-databases . these approaches store the xml-documents in the relational-database and issue sql queries (whenever appropriate) to detect the changes . all of these relational-based approaches use the schema-oblivious xml-storage strategy for detecting the changes . however , there is growing evidence that schema-conscious storage approaches perform significantly better than schema-oblivious approaches as far as xml-query-processing is concerned . in this paper , we study a relational-based unordered xml change-detection technique (called h <small> elios </small>) that uses a schema-conscious approach (shared-inlining) as the underlying storage strategy . h <small> elios </small> is up to 52 times faster than x-diff [7] for large-datasets (more than 1000 nodes) . it is also up to 6.7 times faster than x <small> andy </small> [4] . the result quality of deltas detected by h <small> elios </small> is comparable to the result quality of deltas detected by x andy .
