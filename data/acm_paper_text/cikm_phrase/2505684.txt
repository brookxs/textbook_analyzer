supporting exploratory people-search : a study of factor transparency and user-control people-search is an active research-topic in recent years . related works includes expert-finding , collaborator recommendation , link-prediction and social-matching . however , the diverse objectives and exploratory nature of those tasks make it difficult to develop a flexible method for people-search that works for every task . in this project , we developed peopleexplorer , an interactive people-search system to support exploratory-search tasks when looking for people . in the system , users could specify their task objectives by selecting and adjusting key criteria . three criteria were considered : the content relevance , the candidate authoritativeness and the social-similarity between the user and the candidates . this project represents a first attempt to add transparency to exploratory people-search , and to give users full control over the search-process . the system was evaluated through an experiment with 24 participants undertaking four different tasks . the results show that with comparable time and effort , users of our system performed significantly better in their people-search tasks than those using the baseline system . users of our system also exhibited many unique behaviors in query-reformulation and candidate-selection . we found that users ' general perceptions about three criteria varied during different tasks , which confirms our assumptions regarding modeling task difference and user variance in people-search systems .
