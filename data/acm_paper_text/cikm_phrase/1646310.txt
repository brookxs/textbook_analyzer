ofcourse : web-content-discovery , classification and information-extraction for online-course materials in this paper we present ofcourse , a vertical-search-engine for online-course materials . these materials have the following characteristics : they are scattered very sparsely in the university web-sites ; and are generated by the teachers with totally different hmtl templates and layouts . these characteristics impose some challenges for web-classification (to identify the course materials) and web-information-extraction (to extract course metadata , such as course title , time and id) from the identified course homepages . here , we describe our proposed method to tackle these challenges , and the features of this system . ofcourse , containing over 60,000 courses from the top 50 universities in the us , is currently available for public-access at http://fusion.hpl.hp.com/ofcourse/ .
