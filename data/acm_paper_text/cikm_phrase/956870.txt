approximate searches : k-neighbors + precision it is known that all multi-dimensional-index structures fail to accelerate content-based-similarity searches when the feature-vectors describing images are high-dimensional . it is possible to circumvent this problem by relying on approximate search-schemes trading-off result quality for reduced query-execution time . most approximate schemes , however , provide none or only complex control on the precision of the searches , especially when retrieving the k-nearest-neighbors (nns) of query points.in contrast , this paper describes an approximate-search scheme for high-dimensional databases where the precision of the search can be probabilistically controlled when retrieving the k nns of query points . it allows a fine and intuitive-control over this precision by setting at run time the maximum probability for a vector that would be in the exact answer set to be missed in the approximate set of answers eventually returned . this paper also presents a performance-study of the implementation using real datasets showing its reliability and efficiency . it shows , for example , that our method is 6.72 times faster than the sequential-scan when it handles more than 5 10 6 24-dimensional vectors , even when the probability of missing one of the true nearest-neighbors is below 0.01 .
