efficient term-proximity search with term-pair indexes there has been a large amount of research on early-termination techniques in web-search and information retrieval . such techniques return the top - k documents without scanning and evaluating the full inverted-lists of the query terms . thus , they can greatly improve query-processing efficiency . however , only a limited amount of efficient top - k processing work considers the impact of term-proximity , i.e. , the distance between term occurrences in a document , which has recently been integrated into a number of retrieval-models to improve effectiveness . in this paper , we propose new early-termination techniques for efficient-query-processing for the case where term-proximity is integrated into the retrieval-model . we propose new index-structures based on a term-pair-index , and study new document-retrieval strategies on the resulting indexes . we perform a detailed experimental-evaluation on our new techniques and compare them with the existing approaches . experimental-results on large-scale-data sets show that our techniques can significantly improve the efficiency of query-processing .
