mass : a multi-axis storage-structure for large xml-documents effective indexing for xml must consider both the query requirements of the xpath language and the dynamic nature of xml . we introduce mass , a multiple axis storage-structure , to provide scalable-indexing for xpath expressions with guaranteed update performance . we describe the building-blocks of mass and provide results that demonstrate mass 's scalability . we show that mass can outperform other state-of-the-art xml-indexing solutions , even with constrained system-resources .
