multi-scale link-prediction the automated-analysis of social-networks has become an important problem due to the proliferation of social-networks , such as livejournal , flickr and facebook . the scale of these social-networks is massive and continues to grow rapidly . an important problem in social-network-analysis is proximity estimation that infers the closeness of different users . link-prediction , in turn , is an important application of proximity estimation . however , many methods for computing proximity measures have high computational-complexity and are thus prohibitive for large-scale link-prediction problems . one way to address this problem is to estimate proximity measures via low-rank-approximation . however , a single low-rank-approximation may not be sufficient to represent the behavior of the entire network . in this paper , we propose multi-scale link-prediction (mslp) , a framework for link-prediction , which can handle massive-networks . the basic idea of mslp is to construct low-rank approximations of the network at multiple scales in an efficient manner . to achieve this , we propose a fast tree-structured approximation-algorithm . based on this approach , mslp combines predictions at multiple scales to make robust and accurate predictions . experimental-results on real-life datasets with more than a million nodes show the superior performance-and-scalability of our method .
