modeling topic-hierarchies with the recursive chinese restaurant process topic-models such as latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) and hierarchical-dirichlet-processes (hdp) are simple solutions to discover topics from a set of unannotated documents . while they are simple and popular , a major shortcoming of lda and hdp is that they do not organize the topics into a hierarchical-structure which is naturally found in many datasets . we introduce the recursive chinese restaurant process (rcrp) and a nonparametric topic-model with rcrp as a prior for discovering a hierarchical topic structure with unbounded depth and width . unlike previous models for discovering topic-hierarchies , rcrp allows the documents to be generated from a mixture over the entire set of topics in the hierarchy . we apply rcrp to a corpus of new york times articles , a dataset of movielens ratings , and a set of wikipedia articles and show the discovered topic-hierarchies . we compare the predictive-power of rcrp with lda , hdp , and nested chinese restaurant process (ncrp) using heldout likelihood to show that rcrp outperforms the others . we suggest two metrics that quantify the characteristics of a topic-hierarchy to compare the discovered topic-hierarchies of rcrp and ncrp . the results show that rcrp discovers a hierarchy in which the topics become more specialized toward the leaves , and topics in the immediate family exhibit more affinity than topics beyond the immediate family .
