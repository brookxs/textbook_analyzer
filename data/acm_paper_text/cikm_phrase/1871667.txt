search as if you were in your home town : geographic-search by regional context and dynamic-feature-space selection we propose a query-by-example geographic object-search method for users that do not know well about the place they are in . geographic objects , such as restaurants , are often retrieved using an attribute-based or keyword-query . these queries , however , are difficult to use for users that have little knowledge on the place where they want to search . the proposed query-by-example method allows users to query by selecting examples in familiar places for retrieving objects in unfamiliar places . one of the challenges is to predict an effective distance-metric , which varies for individuals . another challenge is to calculate the distance between objects in heterogeneous-domains considering the feature gap between them , for example , restaurants in japan and china . our proposed method is used to robustly estimate the distance-metric by amplifying the difference between selected and non-selected examples . by using the distance-metric , each object in a familiar domain is evenly assigned to one in an unfamiliar domain to eliminate the difference between those domains . we developed a restaurant search using data obtained from a japanese restaurant web guide to evaluate our method .
