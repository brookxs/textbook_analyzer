semantically coherent image-annotation with a learning-based keyword-propagation strategy automatic-image-annotation plays an important role in modern keyword-based image-retrieval-systems . recently , many neighbor-based-methods have been proposed and achieved good performance for image-annotation . however , existing work mainly focused on exploring a distance-metric-learning algorithm to determine the neighbors of an image , and neglected the subsequent keyword-propagation process . they usually used some simple heuristic propagation rules , and propagated each keyword independently without considering the inherent semantic-coherence among keywords . in this paper , we propose a novel learning-based keyword-propagation strategy and incorporate it into the neighbor-based method framework . in particular , we employ the structural-svm to learn a scoring-function which can evaluate different candidate keyword sets for a test image . moreover , we explicitly enforce the semantic coherence constraint for the propagated keywords in our approach . the annotation of the test image is propagated as a whole rather than separate keywords . experiments on two benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image-annotation and ranked-retrieval .
