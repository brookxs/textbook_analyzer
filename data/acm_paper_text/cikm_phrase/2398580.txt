discovering conditional inclusion-dependencies data-dependencies are used to improve the quality of a database-schema , to optimize queries , and to ensure consistency in a database . conditional dependencies have been introduced to analyze and improve data-quality . a conditional-dependency is a dependency with a limited scope defined by conditions over one or more attributes . only the matching part of the instance must adhere to the dependency . in this paper we focus on conditional inclusion-dependencies (cinds) . we generalize the definition of cinds , distinguishing covering and completeness conditions . we present a new use-case for such cinds showing their value for solving complex-data quality tasks . further , we propose efficient-algorithms that identify covering and completeness conditions conforming to given quality thresholds . our algorithms choose not only the condition values but also the condition attributes automatically . finally , we show that our approach efficiently provides meaningful and helpful results for our use-case .
