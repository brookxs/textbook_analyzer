semantic-tags generation and retrieval for online-advertising one of the main problems in online-advertising is to display-ads which are relevant and appropriate w.r.t. what the user is looking for . often search-engines fail to reach this goal as they do not consider semantics attached to keywords . in this paper we propose a system that tackles the problem by two different angles : help (i) advertisers to create more efficient ads campaigns and (ii) ads providers to properly match ads content to keywords in search-engines . we exploit semantic-relations stored in the dbpedia dataset and use an hybrid ranking-system to rank keywords and to expand queries formulated by the user . inputs of our ranking-system are (i) the dbpedia dataset ; (ii) external information-sources such as classical search-engine-results and social-tagging systems . we compare our approach with other rdf similarity-measures , proving the validity of our algorithm with an extensive evaluation involving real-users .
