queryable acyclic production-systems we pose a query problem about the behavior of a consultation-system s : given a constraint formula q and a potential conclusion c for s , determine if there is a user-input binding that satisfies q and causes s to conclude c . existing rule-based-expert-systems , both forward and backward chaining [3] , implement a consultation mechanism s , but are not designed for these queries about s . for general production-systems , the queries are undecidable . here we solve the problem for useful sublanguages of acyclic production-systems . we implement a query tool in a datalog + constraints framework , and optimize for embedded decision-trees in the rule system . our data-complexity is & thgr ;(n (n)) in the size of the embedded trees , versus & thgr ;(n (n) + n 2) for existing datalog evaluation algorithms , where (n) is the cost of destructively conjoining a constraint of unit size into a conjunction of n constraints .
