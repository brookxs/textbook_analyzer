self-correcting queries for xml it has been observed that queries over xml-data sources are often unsatisfiable . unsatisfiability may stem from several different sources , e.g. , the user may be insufficiently familiar with the labels appearing the documents , or may not be intimately aware of the hierarchical-structure of the documents . this difficulty may be compounded by the fact that errors in query-formulation lead to an empty answer , and not to some sort of compilation error . to deal with query and document mismatches , previous research has considered returning answers that maximally satisfy (in some sense) the query , instead of only returning strictly satisfying answers . however , this breaks the golden database rule that only strictly satisfying answers are returned when querying . indeed , the relationship between the query and answers is no longer clear , when unsatisfying answers are returned . to revive the golden database rule , this paper proposes a framework for deriving self-correcting queries over xml . this framework generates similar satisfiable queries , when the user-query is unsatisfiable . the user can then choose a satisfiable query of interest , and receive exactly satisfying answers to this query .
