regularized-locality-preserving-indexing via spectral-regression we consider the problem of document-indexing and representation . recently , locality-preserving-indexing (lpi) was proposed for learning a compact document subspace . different from latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) which is optimal in the sense of global euclidean structure , lpi is optimal in the sense of local manifold structure . however , lpi is not efficient in time and memory which makes it difficult to be applied to very-large data set . specifically , the computation of lpi involves eigen-decompositions of two dense-matrices which is expensive . in this paper , we propose a new algorithm called regularized-locality-preserving-indexing (rlpi) . benefit from recent progresses on spectral-graph analysis , we cast the original lpi algorithm into a regression framework which enable us to avoid eigen-decomposition of dense-matrices . also , with the regression_based framework , different kinds of regularizers can be naturally incorporated into our algorithm which makes it more flexible . extensive experimental-results show that rlpi obtains similar or better results comparing to lpi and it is significantly faster , which makes it an efficient and effective data preprocessing method for large-scale text-clustering , classification and retrieval .
