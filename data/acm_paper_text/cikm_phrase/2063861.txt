a nugget-based test-collection-construction paradigm the problem of building test-collections is central to the development of information retrieval-systems such as search-engines . starting with a few relevant `` nuggets '' of information manually extracted from existing trec corpora , we implement and test a methodology that finds and correctly assesses the vast majority of relevant documents found by trec assessors - as well as up to four times more additional relevant documents . our methodology produces highly accurate test-collections that hold the promise of addressing the issues of scalability , reusability , and applicability .
