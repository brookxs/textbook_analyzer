learning-to-rank with cross-entropy learning-to-rank algorithms are usually grouped into three types : the point wise approach , the pairwise approach , and the listwise approach , according to the input spaces . much of the prior work is based on the three approaches to learn the ranking-model to predict the relevance of a document to a query . in this paper , we focus on the problem of constructing new input space based on groups of documents with the same relevance-judgment . a novel approach is proposed based on cross-entropy to improve the existing ranking-method . the experimental-results show that our approach leads to significant improvements in retrieval-effectiveness .
