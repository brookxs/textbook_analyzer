mining multiple phenotype structures underlying gene-expression-profiles dna-microarray technology is now widely used in basic biomedical-research for mrna expression-profiling and are increasingly being used to explore patterns of gene-expression in clinical-research . automatically detecting phenotype structures from gene-expression-profiles can provide deep insight into the nature of many diseases as well as lead in the development of new drugs . while most of the previous studies focus on only mining empirical phenotype structure which the experiment controls , it is also interesting to detect possible hidden phenotype structures underlying gene-expression profiles.since the number of samples is usually limited , such data-sets are very sparse in high-dimensional gene space . furthermore , most of the genes of interest are buried in large amount of noise . unsupervised phenotype structure-discovery of such sparse high-dimensional-data sets present interesting but challenging problems . in this paper , we propose the model of simultaneously mining both empirical and hidden phenotype structures from gene-expression-data . we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method on various real-world-data sets .
