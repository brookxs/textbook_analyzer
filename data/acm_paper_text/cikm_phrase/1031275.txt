citeseer-api : towards seamless resource-location and interlinking for digital-libraries we introduce citeseer-api , a public api to citeseer-like services . citeseer-api is soap/wsdl based and allows for easy programmatical access to all the specific functionalities offered by citeseer services , including full-text-search of documents and citations and citation-based document discovery . in order to enable operability and interlinking with arbitrary software-agents and digital-library-systems , citeseer-api uses digital-content signatures to create system-independent handles for the document , citation and group resources of citeseer servers . we discuss specific functionalities of citeseer-api that take advantage of these handlers in order to enable seamless location of citeseer resources . finally we argue that the digital signature-scheme used by citeseer-api is well suited for the creation of machine-usable semantic-descriptions of digital-library services which is the key toward seamless discovery and integration of services such as citeseer-api . citeseer-api is currently showcased on citeseer.ist , the citeseer server of the school of information-science and technology at the pennsylvania state university .
