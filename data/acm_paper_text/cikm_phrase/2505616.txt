modeling temporal-effects of human mobile behavior on location-based-social-networks the rapid growth of location-based-social-networks (lbsns) invigorates an increasing number of lbsn users , providing an unprecedented opportunity to study human mobile behavior from spatial , temporal , and social-aspects . among these aspects , temporal-effects offer an essential contextual-cue for inferring a user 's movement . strong temporal cyclic patterns have been observed in user-movement in lbsns with their correlated spatial and social effects (i.e. , temporal correlations) . it is a propitious time to model these temporal-effects (patterns and correlations) on a user 's mobile behavior . in this paper , we present the first comprehensive study of temporal-effects on lbsns . we propose a general-framework to exploit and model temporal cyclic patterns and their relationships with spatial and social-data . the experimental-results on two real-world lbsn datasets validate the power of temporal-effects in capturing user mobile behavior , and demonstrate the ability of our framework to select the most effective location-prediction algorithm under various combinations of prediction-models .
