climbing the app wall : enabling mobile app discovery through context-aware-recommendations the explosive growth of the mobile-application (app) market has made it difficult for users to find the most interesting and relevant apps from the hundreds of thousands that exist today . context is key in the mobile space and so too are proactive services that ease user-input and facilitate effective interaction . we believe that to enable truly novel mobile app recommendation and discovery , we need to support real context-aware-recommendation that utilizes the diverse range of implicit mobile-data available in a fast and scalable manner . in this paper we introduce the djinn model , a novel context-aware collaborative-filtering algorithm for implicit-feedback data that is based on tensor-factorization . we evaluate our approach using a dataset from an android mobile app recommendation-service called appazaar . our results show that our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art collaborative-filtering methods .
