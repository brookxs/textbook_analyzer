search result summarization and disambiguation via contextual dimensions topic-hierarchies are a popular method of summarizing the results obtained in response to a query in various search-applications . however , topic-hierarchies are rigid when they are pre-defined and somewhat unintuitive when they are dynamically generated by statistical-techniques . in this paper , we propose an alternative approach to query-disambiguation and result summarization by placing the results in set of contextual dimensions which can be viewed as facets . for the generic search scenario , we illustrate our approach by using three types of contextual dimensions , namely , concepts , features , and specializations . we use nlp-techniques and a data-mining algorithm to select distinct contexts .
