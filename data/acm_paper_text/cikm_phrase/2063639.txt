personalizing web-search-results by reading-level traditionally , search-engines have ignored the reading difficulty of documents and the reading proficiency of users in computing a document-ranking . this is one reason why web-search-engines do a poor job of serving an important segment of the population : children . while there are many important problems in interface-design , content-filtering , and results presentation related to addressing children 's search needs , perhaps the most fundamental challenge is simply that of providing relevant results at the right level of reading-difficulty . at the opposite end of the proficiency spectrum , it may also be valuable for technical users to find more advanced material or to filter out material at lower levels of difficulty , such as tutorials and introductory texts . we show how reading-level can provide a valuable new relevance signal for both general and personalized-web-search . we describe models and algorithms to address the three key problems in improving relevance for search using reading-difficulty : estimating user proficiency , estimating result difficulty , and re-ranking based on the difference between user and result reading-level profiles . we evaluate our methods on a large volume of web-query traffic and provide a large-scale log-analysis that highlights the importance of finding results at an appropriate reading-level for the user .
