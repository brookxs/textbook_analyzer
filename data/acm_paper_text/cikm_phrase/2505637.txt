location-recommendation for out-of-town users in location-based-social-networks most previous research on location-recommendation services in location-based-social-networks (lbsns) makes recommendations without considering where the targeted user is currently located . such services may recommend a place near her hometown even if the user is traveling out of town . in this paper , we study the issues in making location recommendations for out-of-town users by taking into account user-preference , social-influence and geographical proximity . accordingly , we propose a collaborative-recommendation framework , called user-preference , proximity and social-based collaborative-filtering} (ups-cf) , to make location-recommendation for mobile-users in lbsns . we validate our ideas by comprehensive experiments using real datasets collected from foursquare and gowalla . by comparing baseline algorithms and conventional collaborative-filtering-approach (and its variants) , we show that ups-cf exhibits the best performance . additionally , we find that preference derived from similar users is important for in-town users while social-influence becomes more important for out-of-town users .
