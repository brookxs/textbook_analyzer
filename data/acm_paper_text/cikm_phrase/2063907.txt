user-action interpretation for personalized content-optimization in recommender-systems user-interaction plays a vital role in recommender-systems . previous studies on algorithmic recommender-systems have mainly focused on modeling-techniques and feature-development . traditionally , implicit-user-feedback or explicit user ratings on the recommended items form the basis for designing and training of recommendation-algorithms . but user-interactions in real-world web-applications (e.g. , a portal website with different recommendation modules in the interface) are unlikely to be as ideal as those assumed by previously proposed models . to address this problem , we build an online-learning framework for personalized-recommendation . we argue that appropriate user-action interpretation is critical for a recommender-system . the main contribution in this paper is an approach of interpreting users ' actions for the online learning to achieve better item relevance-estimation . our experiments on the large-scale-data from a commercial web recommender system demonstrate significant improvement in terms of a precision metric over the baseline-model that does not incorporate user-action interpretation . the efficacy of this new algorithm is also proved by the online test results on real user traffic .
