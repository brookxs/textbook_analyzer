novel local-features with hybrid sampling technique for image-retrieval in image-retrieval , most existing approaches that incorporate local-features produce high-dimensional vectors , which lead to a high computational and data-storage cost . moreover , when it comes to the retrieval of generic real-life images , randomly generated patches are often more discriminant than the ones produced by corner/blob detectors . in order to tackle these problems , we propose a novel method incorporating local-features with a hybrid sampling (a combination of detector-based and random-sampling) . we take three large-data collections for the evaluation : mirflickr , imageclef , and a collection from british national geological survey . the overall performance of the proposed approach is better than the performance of global-features and comparable with the current state-of-the-art methods in content-based-image-retrieval . one of the advantages of our method when compared with others is its easy implementation and low computational cost . another is that hybrid sampling can improve the performance of other methods based on the `` bag-of-visual-words '' approach .
