collective-prediction with latent graphs collective-classification in relational-data has become an important and active research-topic in the last decade . it exploits the dependencies of instances in a network to improve predictions . related applications include hyperlinked document-classification , social-network-analysis and collaboration-network analysis . most of the traditional collective-classification models mainly study the scenario that there exists a large amount of labeled examples (labeled nodes) . however , in many real-world-applications , labeled-data are extremely difficult to obtain . for example , in network-intrusion-detection , there may be only a limited number of identified intrusions whereas there are a huge set of unlabeled nodes . in this situation , most of the data have no connection to labeled nodes ; hence , no supervision knowledge can be obtained from the local-connections . in this paper , we propose to explore various latent linkages among the nodes and judiciously integrate the linkages to generate a latent-graph . this is achieved by finding a graph that maximizes the linkages among the training-data with the same label , and maximizes the separation among the data with different labels . the objective is further cast into an optimization-problem and is solved with quadratic-programming . finally , we apply label-propagation on the latent-graph to make prediction . experiments show that the proposed model lnp (latent network propagation) can improve the learning accuracy significantly . for instance , when there are only 10 \ % of labeled examples , the accuracies of all the comparison models are less than 63 \ % , while that of the proposed model is 74 \ % .
