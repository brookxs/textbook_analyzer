predicting primary categories of business listings for local-search we consider the problem of identifying primary categories of a business listing among the categories provided by the owner of the business . the category-information submitted by business owners can not be trusted with absolute certainty since they may purposefully add some secondary or irrelevant categories to increase recall in local-search results , which makes category-search very challenging for local-search engines . thus , identifying primary categories of a business is a crucial problem in local-search . this problem can be cast as a multi-label-classification problem with a large number of categories . however , the large-scale of the problem makes it infeasible to use conventional supervised-learning-based text-categorization approaches . we propose a large-scale-classification framework that leverages multiple-types of classification labels to produce a highly accurate classifier with fast training-time . we effectively combine the complementary label sources to refine prediction . the experimental-results indicate that our framework achieves very high precision-and-recall and outperforms a centroid-based method .
