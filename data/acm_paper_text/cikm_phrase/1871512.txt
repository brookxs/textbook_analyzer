facetcube : a framework of incorporating-prior-knowledge into non-negative-tensor-factorization non-negative-tensor-factorization (ntf) is a relatively new technique that has been successfully used to extract significant characteristics from polyadic-data , such as data in social-networks . because these polyadic-data have multiple dimensions (e.g. , the author , content , and timestamp of a blog post) , ntf fits in naturally and extracts data-characteristics jointly from different data dimensions . in the standard ntf , all information comes from the observed data and end-users have no control over the outcomes . however , in many applications very often the end-users have certain prior-knowledge , such as the demographic information about individuals in a social-network or a pre-constructed ontology on the contents , and therefore prefer the extracted data characteristics being consistent with such prior-knowledge . to allow users ' prior-knowledge to be naturally incorporated into ntf , in this paper we present a novel framework - facetcube - that extends the standard non-negative-tensor-factorization . the new framework allows the end-users to control the factorization outputs at three different levels for each of the data dimensions . the proposed framework is intuitively appealing in that it has a close connection to the probabilistic generative models . in addition to introducing the framework , we provide an iterative-algorithm for computing the optimal-solution to the framework . we also develop an efficient-implementation of the algorithm that consists of a series of techniques to make our framework scalable to large-data-sets . extensive experimental-studies on a paper citation data-set and a blog-data set demonstrate that our new framework is able to effectively incorporate users ' prior-knowledge , improves performance over the standard ntf on the task of personalized-recommendation , and is scalable to large-data-sets from real-life applications .
