tractable xml-data-exchange via relations we consider data-exchange for xml-documents : given source and target schemas , a mapping between them , and a document conforming to the source schema , construct a target document and answer target queries in a way that is consistent with source information . the problem has primarily been studied in the relational context , in which data-exchange systems have also been built . since many xml-documents are stored in relations , it is natural to consider using a relational system for xml-data-exchange . however , there is a complexity mismatch between query-answering in relational and xml-data-exchange , which indicates that restrictions have to be imposed on xml-schemas and mappings , and on xml-shredding schemes , to make the use of relational-systems possible . we isolate a set of five requirements that must be fulfilled in order to have a faithful representation of the xml data-exchange problem by a relational translation . we then demonstrate that these requirements naturally suggest the inlining technique for dataexchange tasks . our key contribution is to provide shredding algorithms for schemas , documents , mappings and queries , and demonstrate that they enable us to correctly perform xml data-exchange tasks using a relational system .
