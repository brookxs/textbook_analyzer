unified-filtering by combining collaborative-filtering and content-based-filtering via mixture-model and exponential-model collaborative-filtering and content-based-filtering are two types of information filtering techniques . combining these two techniques can improve the recommendation effectiveness . the main problem with previous research is that the content information and the rating information are not combined in an integrated way . this paper presents a unified probabilistic-framework that allows the mutual interaction between these two types of information . experiments have shown that the new unified-filtering algorithm outperforms a pure collaborative-filtering-approach , a pure content-based-filtering approach and another unified-filtering algorithm .
