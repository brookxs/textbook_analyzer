natural event-summarization event-mining is a useful way to understand computer-system behaviors . the focus of recent works on event-mining has been shifted to event-summarization from discovering frequent-patterns . event-summarization seeks to provide a comprehensible explanation of the event-sequence on certain aspects . previous methods have several limitations such as ignoring temporal-information , generating the same set of boundaries for all event-patterns , and providing a summary which is difficult for human to understand . in this paper , we propose a novel framework called natural event-summarization that summarizes an event-sequence using inter-arrival histograms to capture the temporal-relationship among events . our framework uses the minimum description length principle to guide the process in order to balance between accuracy and brevity . also , we use multi-resolution-analysis for pruning the problem-space . we demonstrate how the principles can be applied to generate summaries with periodic patterns and correlation patterns in the framework . experimental-results on synthetic and real-data show our method is capable of producing usable event summary , robust to noises , and scalable .
