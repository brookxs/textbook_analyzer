hypergraph-based multilevel matrix-approximation for text-information-retrieval in latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) , a collection of documents is often pre-processed to form a sparse term-document-matrix , followed by a computation of a low-rank-approximation to the data-matrix . a multilevel-framework based on hypergraph coarsening is presented which exploits the hypergraph that is canonically associated with the sparse term-document-matrix representing the data . the main goal is to reduce the cost of the-matrix approximation without sacrificing accuracy . because coarsening by multilevel hypergraph techniques is a form of clustering , the proposed approach can be regarded as a hybrid of factorization-based lsi and clustering-based lsi . experimental-results indicate that our method achieves good improvement of the retrieval-performance at a reduced cost
