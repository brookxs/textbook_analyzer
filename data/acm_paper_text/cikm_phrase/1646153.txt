multidimensional-routing-indices for efficient distributed-query-processing traditional routing indices in peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are mainly designed for document-retrieval applications and maintain aggregated one-dimensional values representing the number of documents that can be obtained in a certain direction in the network . in this paper , we introduce the concept of multidimensional-routing-indices (mris) , which are suitable for handling multidimensional-data represented by minimum bounding regions (mbrs) . depending on data-distribution on peers , the aggregation of the mbrs may lead to mris that exhibit extremely poor performance , which renders them ineffective . thus , focusing on a hybrid unstructured p2p network , we analyze the parameters for building mris of high selectivity . we present techniques that boost the query-routing performance by detecting similar peers and grouping and reassigning these peers to other parts of the hybrid network in a distributed and scalable way . we demonstrate the advantages of our approach using large-scale-simulations .
