meta-metadata : a metadata semantics language for collection representation applications collecting , organizing , and thinking about diverse information-resources is the keystone of meaningful digital-information experiences , from research to education to leisure . metadata semantics are crucial for organizing collections , yet their structural-diversity exacerbates problems of obtaining and manipulating them , strewing end-users and application developers amidst the shadows of a proverbial tower of babel . we introduce meta-metadata , a language and software-architecture addressing a metadata semantics lifecycle : (1) data-structures for representation of metadata in programs ; (2) metadata-extraction from information-resources ; (3) semantic actions that connect metadata to collection representation applications ; and (4) rules for presentation to users . the language enables power-users to author metadata semantics wrappers that generalize template-based information-sources . the architecture supports development of independent collection representation applications that reuse wrappers . the initial meta-metadata repository of information-source wrappers includes google , flickr , yahoo , imdb , wikipedia , and the acm portal . case-studies validate the approach .
