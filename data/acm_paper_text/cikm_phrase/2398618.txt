accelerating locality-preserving nonnegative-matrix-factorization matrix-factorization techniques have been frequently applied in information-retrieval , computer-vision and pattern-recognition . among them , non-negative-matrix-factorization (nmf) has received considerable attention due to its psychological and physiological interpretation of naturally occurring data whose representation may be parts-based in the human-brain . locality-preserving non-negative-matrix-factorization (lpnmf) is a recently proposed graph-based nmf extension which tries to preserves the intrinsic geometric-structure of the data . compared with the original nmf , lpnmf has more discriminating power on data representa - tion thanks to its geometrical interpretation and outstanding ability to discover the hidden topics . however , the computa - tional complexity of lpnmf is o (n3) , where n is the number of samples . in this paper , we propose a novel approach called accelerated lpnmf (a-lpnmf) to solve the com - putational issue of lpnmf . specifically , a-lpnmf selects p (p j n) landmark points from the data and represents all the samples as the sparse linear combination of these landmarks . the non-negative factors which incorporates the geometric-structure can then be efficiently computed . experimental-results on the real-data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method .
