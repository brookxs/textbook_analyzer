merging distributed-database summaries the database summarization-system coined s <scp> aint </scp> e <scp> ti </scp> q provides multi-resolution summaries of structured-data stored into acentralized database . summaries are computed online with a conceptual hierarchical-clustering algorithm . however , most companies work in distributed legacy environments and consequently the current centralized version of s <scp> aint </scp> e <scp> ti </scp> q is either not feasible (privacy-preserving) or not desirable (resource limitations) . to address this problem , we propose new algorithms to generate a single summary hierarchy given two distinct hierarchies , without scanning the raw data . the greedy merging algorithm (gma) takes all leaves of both hierarchies and generates the optimal-partitioning for the considered data-set with regards to a cost-function (compactness and separation) . then , a hierarchical organization of summaries is built by agglomerating or dividing clusters such that the cost-function may emphasize local or global patterns in the data . thus , we obtain two different hierarchies according to the performed optimisation . however , this approach breaks down due to its exponential-time complexity . two alternative approaches with constant-time complexity w.r.t. the number of data items , are proposed to tackle this problem . the first one , called merge by incorporation algorithm (mia) , relies on the s <scp> aint </scp> e <scp> ti </scp> q engine whereas the second approach , named merge by alignment-algorithm (maa) , consists in rearranging summaries by levels in a top-down manner . then , we compare those approaches using an original quality-measure in order to quantify how good our merged hierarchies are . finally , an experimental-study , using real-data sets , shows that merging processes (mia and maa) are efficient in terms of computational time .
