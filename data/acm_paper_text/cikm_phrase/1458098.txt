a sparse gaussian processes classification framework for fast tag-suggestions tagged data is rapidly becoming more available on the world-wide-web . web-sites which populate tagging services offer a good way for internet-users to share their knowledge . an interesting problem is how to make tag-suggestions when a new resource becomes available . in this paper , we address the issue of efficient tag-suggestion . we first propose a multi-class sparse gaussian process classification framework (sgps) which is capable of classifying data with very few training instances . we suggest a novel prototype-selection algorithm to select the best subset of points for model-learning . the framework is then extended to a novel multi-class multi-label-classification algorithm (mmsg) that transforms tag-suggestion into the problem of multi-label ranking . experiments on bench-mark data-sets and real-world-data from del.icio.us and bibsonomy suggest that our model can greatly improve the performance of tag-suggestions when compared to the state-of-the-art . overall , our model requires linear-time to train and constant-time to predict per case . the memory-consumption is also significantly less than traditional batch-learning algorithms such as svms . in addition , results on tagging digital-data also demonstrate that our model is capable of recommending relevant tags to images and videos by using their surrounding textual-information .
