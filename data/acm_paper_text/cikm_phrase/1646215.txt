the impact of document-structure on keyphrase-extraction keyphrases are short phrases that reflect the main topic of a document . because manually annotating documents with keyphrases is a time-consuming-process , several automatic approaches have been developed . typically , candidate phrases are extracted using features such as position or frequency in the document-text . document-structure may contain useful information about which parts or phrases of a document are important , but has rarely been considered as a source of information for keyphrase-extraction . we address this issue in the context of keyphrase-extraction from scientific-literature . we introduce a new , large-corpus that consists of full-text journal-articles , where the rich collection and document-structure available at the publishing stage is explicitly annotated . we explore features based on the xml tags contained in the documents , and based on generic section types derived using position and cue-words in section titles . for xml tags we find sections , abstract , and title to perform best , but many smaller elements may be beneficial in combination with other features . of the generic section types , the discussion section is found to be most useful for keyphrase-extraction .
