diffusion-of-innovations revisited : from social-network to innovation-network the spreading of innovations among individuals and organizations in a social-network has been extensively studied . although the recent studies among the social-computing and data-mining communities have produced various insightful conclusions about the diffusion-process of innovations by focusing on the properties and evolution of social-network structures , less attention has been paid to the interrelationships among the multiple innovations being diffused , such as the competitive and collaborative relationships between innovations . in this paper , we take a formal quantitative approach to address how different pieces of innovations socialize with each other and how the interrelationships among innovations affect users ' adoption behavior , which provides a novel perspective of understanding the diffusion-of-innovations . networks of innovations are constructed by mining large-scale text-collections in an unsupervised fashion . we are particularly interested in the following questions : what are the meaningful metrics on the network of innovations ? what effects do these metrics exert on the diffusion-of-innovations ? do these effects vary among users with different adoption preferences or communication-styles ? while existing studies primarily address social-influence , we provide a detailed discussion of how innovations interrelate and influence the diffusion-process .
