components for information-extraction : ontology-based information extractors and generic platforms information-extraction (ie) has existed as a field for several decades and has produced some impressive systems in the recent past . despite its success , widespread usage and commercialization remain elusive goals for this field . we identify the lack of effective mechanisms for reuse as one major reason behind this situation . here , we mean not only the reuse of the same ie technique in different situations but also the reuse of information related to the application of ie techniques (e.g. , features used for classification) . we have developed a comprehensive component-based-approach for information-extraction that promotes reuse to address this situation . we designed this approach starting from our previous work on the use of multiple ontologies in information-extraction [24] . the key ideas of our approach are `` information extractors , '' which are components of an ie-system that make extractions with respect to particular components of an ontology and `` platforms for ie , '' which are domain and corpus independent implementations of ie techniques . a case-study has shown that this component-based-approach can be successfully applied in practical situations .
