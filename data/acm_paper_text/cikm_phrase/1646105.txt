a system for detecting xml-similarity in content-and-structure using relational-database in this paper , we describe a system incorporating an improved technique that detects the similarity of two xml-documents based on content-and-structure similarity using keys . the technique consists of three major components : a subtree generator and validator , a key generator , and similarity components that compare content-and-structure of the xml-documents . first , an xml-document is stored in a relational-database and extracted into small subtrees using leaf-node parents . the leaf-node parents are considered as a root of a subtree which is then recursively traversed bottom-up for matching . second , a possible key (s) is identified in order to match xml subtrees from two documents efficiently . key matchings help in reducing the number of comparisons dramatically . in addition , the number of subtrees to be processed is reduced in the subtree validation phase using instance statistics and taxonomic analyzer . the subtrees are matched by the key (s) first and the remaining subtrees are matched by finding degrees of similarity in content-and-structure . to obtain improved similarity comparison results , xml element names are transformed according to their semantic-similarity . the results show that the clustering points are selected appropriately and the overall execution-time is reduced dramatically .
