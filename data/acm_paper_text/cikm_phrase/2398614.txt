an effective category classification-method based on a language-model for question-category recommendation on a cqa service classiying user 's question into several topics helps respondents answering the question in a cqa service . the word weighting-method must estimate the appropriate weight of a word to improve the category (or topic) classification . in this paper , we propose a novel effective word weighting-method based on a language-model for automatic category classification in the cqa service . we first calculate the occurrence-probability of a word in each category by using a language-model and then the final weight of each word is estimated by ratio of the occurrence-probability of the word on a category to the occurrence-probability of the word on the other categories . as a result , the proposed method significantly improves the performance of the category classification .
