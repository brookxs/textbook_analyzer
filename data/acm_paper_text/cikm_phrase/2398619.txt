the twitaholic next door. : scalable friend recommender-system using a concept-sensitive hash-function in this paper we present a friend recommender-system for micro-blogging . traditional batch-processing of massive amounts of data makes it difficult to provide a near-real time friend recommender-system or even a system that can properly scale to millions of users . in order to overcome these issues , we have designed a solution that represents user-generated micro posts as a set of pseudo-cliques . these graphs are assigned a hash value using an original concept-sensitive hash-function , a new sub-kind of locally-sensitive hash-functions . finally , since the user-profiles are represented as a binary footprint , the pairwise-comparison of footprints using the hamming-distance provides scalability to the recommender-system . the paper goes with an online application relying on a large twitter dataset , so that the reader can freely experiment the system .
