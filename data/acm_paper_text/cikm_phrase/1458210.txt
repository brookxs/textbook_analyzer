mining influential-attributes that capture class and group-contrast behaviour contrast data-mining is a key tool for finding differences between sets of objects , or classes , and contrast-patterns are a popular method for discrimination between two classes . however , such patterns can be limited in two primary ways : i) they do not readily allow second order differentiation - i.e. discovering contrasts of contrasts , ii) mining contrast-patterns often results in an overwhelming volume of output for the user . to address these limitations , this paper proposes a method which can identify contrast behaviour across both classes and also groups of classes . furthermore , to increase interpretability for the user , it presents a new technique for finding the attributes which represent the key underlying factors behind the contrast behaviour . the associated mining-task is computationally challenging and we describe an efficient-algorithm to handle it , based on binary-decision-diagrams . experimental-results demonstrate that our technique can efficiently identify and explain contrast behaviour which would be difficult or impossible to isolate using standard techniques .
