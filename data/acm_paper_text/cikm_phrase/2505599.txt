originator or propagator ? : incorporating social-role theory into topic-models for twitter content-analysis a large number of studies have been devoted to modeling the contents and interactions between users on twitter . in this paper , we propose a method inspired from social-role theory (srt) , which assumes that a user behaves differently with different roles in the generation-process of twitter content . we consider the two most distinctive social-roles on twitter : originator and propagator , who respectively posts original messages and retweets or forwards the messages from others . in addition , we also consider role-specific social-interactions , especially implicit interactions between users who share some common interests . all the above elements are integrated into a novel regularized-topic-model . we evaluate the proposed method on real twitter data . the results show that our method is more effective than the existing ones which do not distinguish social-roles .
