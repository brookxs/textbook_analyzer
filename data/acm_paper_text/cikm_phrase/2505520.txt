toward advice mining : conditional-random-fields for extracting advice-revealing text units web-forums are platforms for personal-communications on sharing information with others . such information is often expressed in the form of advice . in this paper , we address the problem of advice-revealing text unit (atu) extraction from online-forums due to its usefulness in travel domain . we represent advice as a two-tuple comprising an advice-revealing sentence and its context sentences . to extract the advice-revealing sentences , we propose to define the task as a sequence-labeling problem , using three different types of features : syntactic , contextual , and semantic-features . to extract the context sentences , we propose to use a 2 dimensional crf (2d-crf) model , which gives the best performance compared to traditional machine-learning models . finally , we present a solution to the integrated problem of extracting both advice-revealing sentences and their respective context sentences at the same time using our proposed models , i.e. , multiple linear crf (ml-crf) and 2 dimensional crf plus (2d-crf +) . the experimental-results show that ml-crf performs better than any other models studied in this paper for extracting advice-revealing sentences and context sentences .
