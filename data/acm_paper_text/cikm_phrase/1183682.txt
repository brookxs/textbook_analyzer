automatic computation of semantic proximity using taxonomic knowledge taxonomic measures of semantic proximity allow us to compute the relatedness of two concepts . these metrics are versatile instruments required for diverse applications , e.g. , the-semantic-web , linguistics , and also text-mining . however , most approaches are only geared towards hand-crafted taxonomic dictionaries such as word net , which only feature a limited fraction of real-world concepts . more specific concepts , and particularly instances of concepts , i.e. , names of artists , locations , brand names , etc. , are not covered.the contributions of this paper are two fold . first , we introduce a framework based on google and the open-directory-project (odp) , enabling us to derive the semantic proximity between arbitrary concepts and instances . second , we introduce a new taxonomy-driven proximity metric tailored for our framework . studies with human-subjects corroborate our hypothesis that our new metric outperforms benchmark semantic proximity metrics and comes close to human-judgement .
