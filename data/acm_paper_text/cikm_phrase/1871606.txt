efficiently querying archived data using hadoop the need to analyze structured-data for various business-intelligence applications such as customer churn analysis , social-network-analysis , telecom network-monitoring etc. , is well known . however , the potential size to which such data will scale in future will make solutions that revolve around data-warehouses hard to scale . as data sizes grow the movement of data from the warehouse to archives becomes more frequent . current file_based archive models make the archived data unusable for any type of insight extraction . in this paper , we present an active archival solution for data-warehouses that makes use of hadoop distributed-file-system (hdfs) to store the data in an always available and cost-effective manner . we investigate various structured-data storage-schemes within hdfs and empirical evaluations show that a combination of universal scheme model and column-store is best suited for the active archival solution .
