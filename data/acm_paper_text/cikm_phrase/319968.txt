database-model for web-based cooperative-applications in this paper we propose a model of a database that could become a kernel of cooperative-database applications . first , we propose a new data-model cdm (collaborative data model) that is oriented for the specificity of multiuser-environments , in particular : cooperation scenarios , cooperation techniques and cooperation management . second , we propose to apply to databases supporting collaboration so called multiuser transactions . multiuser transactions are flat transactions in which , in comparison to classical acid-transactions , the isolation-property is relaxed .
