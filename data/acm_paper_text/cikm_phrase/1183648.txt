effective and efficient classification on a search-engine model traditional document classification frameworks , which apply the learned classifier to each document in a corpus one by one , are infeasible for extremely large document corpora , like the-web or large corporate intranets . we consider the classification-problem on a corpus that has been processed primarily for the purpose of searching , and thus our access to documents is solely through the inverted-index of a large-scale search-engine . our main goal is to build the `` best '' short query that characterizes a document-class using operators normally available within large engines . we show that surprisingly good classification-accuracy can be achieved on average over multiple classes by queries with as few as 10 terms . moreover , we show that optimizing the efficiency of query-execution by careful selection of these terms can further reduce the query costs . more precisely , we show that on our set-up the best 10 terms query canachieve 90 \ % of the accuracy of the best svm-classifier (14000 terms) , and if we are willing to tolerate a reduction to 86 \ % of the best svm , we can build a 10 terms query that can be executed more than twice as fast as the best 10 terms query .
