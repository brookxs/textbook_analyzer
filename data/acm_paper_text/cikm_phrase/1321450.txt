randomized metric induction and evolutionary conceptual-clustering for semantic-knowledge-bases we present an evolutionary-clustering method which can be applied to multi-relational knowledge-bases storing semantic resource annotations expressed in the standard languages for the-semantic-web . the method exploits an effective and language-independent semi-distance measure defined for the space of individual resources , that is based on a finite number of dimensions corresponding to a committee of features represented by a group of concept descriptions (discriminating features) . we show how to obtain a maximally discriminating group of features through a feature-construction method based on genetic-programming . the algorithm represents the possible clusterings as strings of central elements (medoids , w.r.t. the given metric) of variable-length . hence , the number of clusters is not needed as a parameter since the method can optimize it by means of the mutation-operators and of a proper fitness-function . we also show how to assign each cluster with a newly constructed intensional definition in the employed concept language . an experimentation with some ontologies proves the feasibility of our method and its effectiveness in terms of clustering validity-indices .
