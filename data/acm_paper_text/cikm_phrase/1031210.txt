discovering frequently changing structures from historical structural deltas of unordered xml recently , a large amount of work has been done in xml-data mining . however , we observed that most of the existing works focus on the snapshot xml-data , while xml-data is dynamic in real applications . to the best of our knowledge , none of the existing works has addressed the issue of mining the history of changes to xml-documents . such mining results can be useful in many applications such as xml change-detection , xml-indexing , association-rule-mining , and classification etc. . in this paper , we propose a novel approach to discover the <i> frequently changing structures </i> from the sequence of historical <i> structural deltas </i> of unordered xml . to make the structure discovering process efficient , an expressive and compact data model , <b> h </b> istorical - <b> d </b> ocument <b> o </b> bject <b> m </b> odel (<b> h-dom </b>) , is proposed . using this model , two basic algorithms , which can discover all the <i> frequently changing structures </i> with only two scans of the xml sequence , are presented . experimental-results show that our algorithms , together with the optimization-techniques , are efficient and scalable .
