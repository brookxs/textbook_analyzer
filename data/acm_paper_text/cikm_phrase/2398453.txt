influence and similarity on heterogeneous-networks in the social-network research , the studies on social-influence maximization and entity similarity are two important and orthogonal tasks . on homogeneous networks , social-influence maximization research tries to identify an initial influential set that maximizes the spread of the information , while similarity studies focus on designing meaningful ways to quantify entities ' similarities . when heterogeneous-networks are becoming ubiquitous and entities of different types are related to each other , we observe the possibility of merging the two directions together to improve the performance for both of them . in fact , we found that influence values among one type of nodes and similarity-scores among the other type of nodes reinforce each other towards better and more meaningful results . therefore , we introduce a framework that computes social-influence for one type of nodes and simultaneously measures similarity of the other type of nodes in a heterogeneous-network . first , we decouple the target heterogeneous-network (or we call it influence similarity (is) network) into three different parts : influence network , similarity network and information tunnels (it) between them . through it , we exchange the influence scores and the similarity-scores to calculate more precise similarity and influence scores in order to improve both of their qualities . the experiment results on real-world data shows that our framework enables influence-maximization framework to identify more influential seeds in influence network and similarity-measures to produce more meaningful similarity-scores in similarity network simultaneously .
