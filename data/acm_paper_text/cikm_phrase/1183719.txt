efficient join-processing over uncertain-data in many applications data-values are inherently uncertain . this includes moving-objects , sensors and biological-databases . there has been recent interest in the development of database-management-systems that can handle uncertain-data . some proposals for such systems include attribute values that are uncertain . in particular , an attribute-value can be modeled as a range of possible values , associated with a probability-density-function . previous efforts for this type of data have only addressed simple queries such as range and nearest-neighbor queries . queries that join multiple relations have not been addressed in earlier work despite the significance of joins in databases . in this paper we address join-queries over uncertain-data . we propose a semantics for the join operation , define probabilistic operators over uncertain-data , and propose join-algorithms that provide efficient execution of probabilistic joins . the paper focuses on an important class of joins termed probabilistic threshold joins that avoid some of the semantic complexities of dealing with uncertain-data . for this class of joins we develop three sets of optimization-techniques : item-level , page-level , and index-level pruning . these techniques facilitate pruning with little space and time overhead , and are easily adapted to most join-algorithms . we verify the performance of these techniques experimentally .
