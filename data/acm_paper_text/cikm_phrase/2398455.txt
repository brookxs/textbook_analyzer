hierarchical-co-clustering based on entropy splitting two dimensional contingency-tables or co-occurrence-matrices arise frequently in various important applications such as text-analysis and web-log mining . as a fundamental research-topic , co-clustering aims to generate a meaningful partition of the contingency-table to reveal hidden relationships between rows and columns . traditional co-clustering algorithms usually produce a predefined number of flat partition of both rows and columns , which do not reveal relationship among clusters . to address this limitation , hierarchical-co-clustering algorithms have attracted a lot of research interests recently . although successful in various applications , the existing hierarchial co-clustering algorithms are usually based on certain heuristics and do not have solid theoretical background . in this paper , we present a new co-clustering algorithm with solid information-theoretic background . it simultaneously constructs a hierarchical-structure of both row and column clusters which retains sufficient mutual-information between rows and columns of the contingency-table . an efficient and effective greedy-algorithm is developed which grows a co-cluster hierarchy by successively performing row-wise or column-wise splits that lead to the maximal mutual-information gain . extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can reveal essential relationships of row (and column) clusters and has better clustering precision than existing algorithms .
