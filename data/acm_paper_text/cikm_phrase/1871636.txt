explore click-models for search-ranking recent advances in click-model have positioned it as an effective approach to estimate document-relevance based on user-behavior in web-search . yet , few works have been conducted to explore the use of click-model to help-web search-ranking . in this paper , we focus on learning a ranking-function by taking the results from a click-model into account . thus , besides the editorial relevance data arising from the explicit manually labeled search result by experts , we also have the estimated relevance data that is automatically inferred from click-models based on user-search-behavior . we carry out extensive experiments on large-scale commercial datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods .
