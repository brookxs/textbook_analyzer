detecting distance-based-outliers in streams of data in this work a method for detecting distance-based-outliers in data-streams is presented . we deal with the sliding-window model , where outlier queries are performed in order to detect anomalies in the current window . two algorithms are presented . the first one exactly answers outlier queries , but has larger space requirements . the second algorithm is directly derived from the exact one , has limited-memory requirements and returns an approximate answer based on accurate estimations with a statistical guarantee . several experiments have been accomplished , confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the high quality of approximate-solutions .
