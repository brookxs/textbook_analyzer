sdoc : exploring social wisdom for document-enhancement in web-mining web-document could be seen to be composed of textual content as well as social-metadata of various forms (e.g. , anchor-text , search-query and social-annotation) , both of which are valuable to indicate the semantic content of the document . however , due to the free nature of the-web , the two streams of web-data suffer from the serious problems of noise and sparseness , which have actually become the major challenges to the success of many web-mining-applications . previous work has shown that it could enhance the content of web-document by integrating anchor-text and search-query . in this paper , we study the problem of exploring emergent social-annotation for document-enhancement and propose a novel reinforcement framework to generate `` social representation '' of document . distinguishing from prior work , textual content and social-annotation are enhanced simultaneously in our framework , which is achieved by exploiting a kind of mutual-reinforcement relationship behind them . two convergent models , social-content model and social-annotation model , are symmetrically derived from the framework to represent enhanced textual content and enhanced social-annotation respectively . the enhanced document is referred to as social-document or sdoc in that it could embed complementary viewpoints from many web authors and many web visitors . in this sense , the document semantics is enhanced exactly by exploring social wisdom . we build the framework on a large del.icio.us data and evaluate it through three typical web-mining-applications : annotation , classification and retrieval . experimental-results demonstrate that social representation of web-document could boost the performance of these applications significantly .
