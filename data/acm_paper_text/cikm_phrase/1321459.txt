automatic call section segmentation for contact-center calls this paper presents a svm (support-vector-machine) classification-system which divides contact-center call transcripts into `` greeting '' , `` question '' , `` refine '' , `` research '' , `` resolution '' , `` closing '' and `` out-of-topic '' sections . this call-section-segmentation is useful to improve search-and-retrieval functions and to provide more detailed statistics on calls . we use an off-the-shelf automatic-speech-recognition (asr) system to generate call transcripts from recorded calls between customers and service representatives . we first classify an individual utterance into a call section by applying the svm-classifier and then merge adjacent utterances classified into a same call section . we experiment with the proposed system on 100 automatically transcribed calls . the 10-fold-cross-validation shows 87.2 \ % classification-accuracy . we also compare the proposed algorithm with two other approaches - the most frequent section only method and a maximum entropy-based segmentation . the evaluation shows that our system 's accuracy is 12 \ % higher than the first baseline system and 6 \ % higher than the second baseline system respectively .
