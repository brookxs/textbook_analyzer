connecting users with similar interests via tag-network inference the popularity of social-networking greatly increases interaction among people . however , one major challenge remains -- how to connect people who share similar interests . in a social-network , the majority of people who share similar interests with given a user are in the long-tail that accounts for 80 \ % of total population . searching for similar users by following links in social-network has two limitations : it is inefficient and incomplete . thus , it is desirable to design new methods to find like-minded people . in this paper , we propose to use collective-wisdom from the crowd or tag networks to solve the problem . in a tag-network , each node represents a tag as described by some words , and the weight of an undirected edge represents the co-occurrence of two tags . as such , the tag-network describes the semantic relationships among tags . in order to connect to other users of similar interests via a tag-network , we use-diffusion kernels on the tag-network to measure the similarity between pairs of tags . the similarity of people 's interests are measured on the basis of similar tags they share . to recommend people who are alike , we retrieve top k people sharing the most similar tags . compared to two baseline methods triadic-closure and lsi , the proposed tag-network approach achieves 108 \ % and 27 \ % relative improvements on the blogcatalog dataset , respectively .
