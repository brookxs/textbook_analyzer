you can stop early with cola : online-processing of aggregate-queries in the cloud cloud-based data-management-systems are emerging as scalable , fault-tolerant , and efficient solutions to manage large volumes of data with cost effective infrastructures , and more and more data-analysis applications are migrated to the cloud . as an attractive solution to provide a quick sketch of massive-data before a long wait of the final accurate query result , online-processing of aggregate-queries in the cloud is of paramount importance . this problem is challenging to solve because of the large block_based data-organization and distributed-processing mode in the cloud . in this paper , we present cola , a system for cloud online-aggregation to provide progressive approximate answers for both single tables and joined multiple tables . we develop an online query processing-algorithm for mapreduce to support incremental and continuous computing of aggregations on joins which minimizes the waiting-time before an acceptable estimate is achieved . we formulate a statistical foundation that supports block-level sampling for single-table online aggregations and effective estimation of approximate results and confidence-intervals of statistical-significance . we also develop a two-phase stratified-sampling method to support multi-table aggregations to improve the approximate-query answers and speed up the convergence of confidence-intervals . we implement cola in hadoop , and our experiments demonstrate that cola can deliver reasonable precise online estimates within a time period two orders of magnitude shorter than that used to produce exact answers .
