efficient influence-based processing of market-research queries the rapid growth of social-web has contributed vast amounts of user-preference data . analyzing this data and its relationships with products could have several practical applications , such as personalized advertising , market-segmentation , product-feature promotion etc. . in this work we develop novel algorithms for efficiently processing two important classes of queries involving user-preferences , i.e. potential customers identification and product positioning . with regards to the first problem , we formulate product attractiveness based on the notion of reverse skyline-queries . we then present a new algorithm , termed as rsa , that significantly reduces the i/o cost , as well as the computation-cost , when compared to the state-of-the-art reverse skyline algorithm , while at the same time being able to quickly report the first results . several real-world-applications require processing of a large number of queries , in order to identify the product characteristics that maximize the number of potential customers . motivated by this problem , we also develop a batched extension of our rsa algorithm that significantly improves upon processing multiple-queries individually , by grouping contiguous candidates , exploiting i/o commonalities and enabling shared-processing . our experimental-study using both real and synthetic-data sets demonstrates the superiority of our proposed algorithms for the studied classes of queries .
