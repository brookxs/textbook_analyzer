efficient mining of association-rules in text-databases in this paper , we propose two new algorithms for mining association-rules between words in text-databases . the characteristics of text-databases are quite different from those of retail transaction databases , and existing mining algorithms can not handle text-databases efficiently because of the large number of itemsets (i.e. , words) that need to be counted . two well-known mining algorithms , apriori-algorithm and direct hashing and pruning (dhp) algorithm , are evaluated in the context of mining text-databases , and are compared with the new proposed algorithms named multipass-apriori (m-apriori) and multipass-dhp (m-dhp) . it has been shown that the proposed algorithms have better performance for large text databases .
