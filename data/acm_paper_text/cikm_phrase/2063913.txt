citation chain aggregation : an interaction-model to support citation cycling citation-chaining is a powerful means of exploring the academic literature . starting from just one or two known relevant items , a na ve researcher can cycle backwards and forwards through the citation-graph to generate a rich overview of key works , authors and journals relating to their topic . whilst online citation indexes greatly facilitate this process , the size and complexity of the search-space can rapidly escalate . in this paper , we propose a novel-interaction model called citation chain aggregation (cca) . cca employs a simple three-list view which highlights the overlaps that occur between the first-generation relations of known relevant items . as more relevant articles are identified , differences in the frequencies of citations made by or to unseen articles provide strong-relevance feedback cues . the benefits of this technique are illustrated using a simple case-study .
