statistical-transliteration for english-arabic cross-language-information-retrieval out of vocabulary (oov) words are problematic for cross-language-information-retrieval . one way to deal with oov-words when the two languages have different alphabets , is to transliterate the unknown words , that is , to render them in the orthography of the second-language . in the present study , we present a simple statistical-technique to train an english to arabic transliteration-model from pairs of names . we call this a selected n-gram-model because a two-stage training-procedure first learns which n-gram segments should be added to the unigram inventory for the source-language , and then a second stage learns the translation-model over this inventory . this technique requires no heuristics or linguistic-knowledge of either language . we evaluate the statistically-trained model and a simpler hand-crafted model on a test-set of named-entities from the arabic afp corpus and demonstrate that they perform better than two online translation sources . we also explore the effectiveness of these systems on the trec 2002 cross-language ir task . we find that transliteration either of oov named-entities or of all oov-words is an effective approach for cross-language ir .
