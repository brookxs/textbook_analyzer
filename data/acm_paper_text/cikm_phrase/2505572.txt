how the live web feels about events microblogging platforms , such as twitter , tumblr etc. , have been established as key components in the contemporary web ecosystem . users constantly post snippets of information regarding their actions , interests or perception of their surroundings , which is why they have been attributed the term live web . nevertheless , research on such platforms has been quite limited when it comes to identifying events , but is rapidly gaining ground . event-identification is a key step to news-reporting , proactive or reactive crisis-management at multiple scales , efficient resource allocation , etc. . in this paper , we focus on the problem of automatically identifying events as they occur , in such a user-driven , fast paced and voluminous setting . we propose a novel and natural way to address the issue using notions from emotional theories , combined with spatiotemporal information and employ online event-detection mechanisms to solve it at large-scale in a distributed fashion . we present a modular framework that incorporates all of our key ideas and experimentally validate its superiority , in terms of both efficiency-and-effectiveness , over the state-of-the-art using real life data from the twitter stream . we also present empirical evidence on the importance of spatiotemporal information in event-detection for this setting .
