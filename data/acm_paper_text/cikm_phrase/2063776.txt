discovering customer intent in real-time for streamlining service-desk conversations businesses require the contact-center agents to meet pre-specified customer-satisfaction levels while keeping the cost of operations low or meeting sales targets , objectives that end up being complementary and difficult to achieve in real-time . in this paper , we describe a speech enabled real-time conversation-management system that tracks customer-agent conversations to detect user-intent (e.g. gathering information , likely to buy , etc.) that can help agents to then decide the best sequence of actions for that call . we present an entropy_based decision-support-system that parses a text-stream generated in real-time during a audio conversation and identifies the first instance at which the intent becomes distinct enough for the agent to then take subsequent actions . we provide evaluation results displaying the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our system .
