summarizing biological-literature with biosumm biosumm is a summarization environment that supports user queries on online repositories of scientific publications by providing abstract descriptions of focused document groups . the summarization-approach is driven by a grading function which evaluates the occurrences of domain dictionary terms . the demonstrated system enables users to query and download research papers from online-databases (e.g. , pubmed) and local repositories . the (possibly large) retrieved document-collection is then partitioned into document clusters devoted to homogeneous topics . finally , documents in a cluster are summarized by extracting sentences relevant for a specific application-domain . in the demo the considered domain is the interaction of human genes and proteins .
