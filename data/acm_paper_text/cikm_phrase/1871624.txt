data aspects in a relational-database data has cross-cutting-concerns such as versioning , privacy , and reliability . in this paper we sketch support such concerns by adapting the aspect-oriented-programming (aop) paradigm to data . our goal , shared by aop , is to re-engineer applications to support cross-cutting-concerns without directly modifying the application 's data or queries . we propose modeling a cross-cutting data concern as a data aspect . a data aspect weaves metadata around an application 's data and queries , imbuing them with additional semantics for constraint and query-processing .
