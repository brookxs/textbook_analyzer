using appraisal groups for sentiment-analysis little work to date in sentiment-analysis (classifying texts by ` positive ' or ` negative ' orientation) has attempted to use fine-grained semantic distinctions in features used for classification . we present a new method for sentiment-classification based on extracting and analyzing appraisal groups such as `` very good '' or `` not terribly funny '' . an appraisal group is represented as a set of attribute values in several task-independent semantic taxonomies , based on appraisal-theory . semi-automated methods were used to build a lexicon of appraising adjectives and their modifiers . we classify movie-reviews using features based upon these taxonomies combined with standard `` bag-of-words '' features , and report state-of-the-art accuracy of 90.2 \ % . in addition , we find that some types of appraisal appear to be more significant for sentiment-classification than others .
