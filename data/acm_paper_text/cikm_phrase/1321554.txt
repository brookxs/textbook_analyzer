finding and linking incidents in news news reports are being produced and disseminated in overwhelming volume , making it difficult to keep up with the newest information . most previous research in automatic-news-organization treated news topics as a flat list , ignoring the intrinsic connection among individual reports . we argue that more contextual-information within and across the topics will benefit users in their news understanding-process . a news organization infrastructure , incident-threading , is proposed in this article . all text-snippets describing the occurrence of a real-world happening are combined into a news incident , and a network is composed of incidents that are interconnected by links in certain types . a limited vocabulary of connection types is defined and corresponding rules are established based upon the human experience of news understanding . the incident-threading system is implemented with two different algorithms . one starts from clustering of text passages and then creates links with pre-built rules . the other method defines a global score function over the whole collection and solves the optimization-problem with simulated-annealing . the former achieves higher accuracy in the identification of incidents and the latter generates better links , which is preferred since the links are more important for the formation of the incident network .
