pidgin : ontology-alignment using web-text as interlingua the problem of aligning ontologies and database schemas across different knowledge-bases and databases is fundamental to knowledge-management problems , including the problem of integrating the disparate knowledge sources that form the-semantic-web 's linked-data [5] . we present a novel approach to this ontology-alignment problem that employs a very-large natural-language-text corpus as an interlingua to relate different knowledge-bases (kbs) . the result is a scalable and robust method (pidgin) that aligns relations and categories across different kbs by analyzing both (1) shared relation instances across these kbs , and (2) the verb-phrases in the text instantiations of these relation instances . experiments with pidgin demonstrate its superior performance when aligning ontologies across large existing kbs including nell , yago and freebase . furthermore , we show that in addition to aligning ontologies , pidgin can automatically learn from text , the verb-phrases to identify relations , and can also type the arguments of relations of different kbs .
