temporal-models for microblogs time information impacts relevance in retrieval for the queries that are sensitive to trends and events . microblog services particularly focused on recent news and events so dealing with the temporal-aspects of microblogs is essential for providing effective retrieval . recent work on time-based retrieval has shown that selecting the relevant time period for query-expansion is promising . in this paper , we suggest a method for selecting the time period for query-expansion based on a user-behavior (i.e. , retweets) that can be collected easily . we then use these time periods for query-expansion in a pseudo-relevance-feedback setting . more specifically , we use the difference in the temporal-distribution between the top retrieved documents and retweets . the experimental-results based on the trec microblog collection show that our method for selecting periods for query-expansion improves retrieval-performance compared to another approach .
