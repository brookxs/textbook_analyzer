extracting collective expectations about the-future from large text collections news-articles often contain information about the-future . given the huge volume of information available nowadays , an automatic way for extracting and summarizing future-related-information is desirable . such information will allow people to obtain a collective image of the-future , to recognize possible future-scenarios and be prepared for the-future events . we propose a model-based-clustering algorithm for detecting future-events based on information extracted from a text-corpus . the algorithm takes into account both textual and temporal-similarity of sentences . we demonstrate that our algorithm can be used to discover future-events and estimate their probabilities over time .
