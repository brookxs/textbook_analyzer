a word-clustering approach for language model-based sentence-retrieval in question-answering-systems in this paper we propose a term-clustering approach to improve the performance of sentence-retrieval in question-answering (qa) systems . as the search in question-answering is conducted over smaller segments of data than in a document-retrieval task , the problems of data-sparsity and exact-matching become more critical . in this paper we propose language-modeling (lm) techniques to overcome such problems and improve the sentence-retrieval performance . our proposed methods include building class-based models by term-clustering , and then employing higher-order n-grams with the new class-based-model . we report our experiments on the trec 2007 questions from qa track . the results show that the methods investigated here enhanced the mean-average-precision of sentence-retrieval from 23.62 \ % to 29.91 \ % .
