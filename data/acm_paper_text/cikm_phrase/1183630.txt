on gmap : and other transformations as an alternative to the usual mean-average-precision , some use is currently being made of the geometric-mean average-precision (gmap) as a measure of average search-effectiveness across topics . gmap is specifically used to emphasise the lower end of the average-precision scale , in order to shed light on poor performance of search-engines . this paper discusses the status of this measure and how it should be understood .
