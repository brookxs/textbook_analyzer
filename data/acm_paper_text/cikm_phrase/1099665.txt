document-clustering using character-n-grams : a comparative-evaluation with term-based and word-based clustering we propose a novel method for document-clustering using character-n-grams . in the traditional vector-space-model , the documents are represented as vectors , in which each dimension corresponds to a word . we propose a document-representation based on the most frequent character-n-grams , with window-size of up to 10 characters . we derive a new distance-measure , which produces uniformly better results when compared to the word-based and term-based methods . the result becomes more significant in the light of the robustness of the n-gram method with no language-dependent preprocessing . experiments on the performance of a clustering-algorithm on a variety of test document corpora demonstrate that the n-gram representation with n = 3 outperforms both word and term representations . the comparison between word and term representations depends on the data-set and the selected dimensionality .
