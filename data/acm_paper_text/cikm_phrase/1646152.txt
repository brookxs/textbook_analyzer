dynamic in-page-logging for flash-aware b-tree index this paper presents dynamic ipl b + - tree (d-ipl in short) as a b + - tree-index variant for flash-based storage-systems . the d-ipl b + - tree adopts a dynamic in-page-logging (ipl) scheme in order to address a few new problems that are caused by the unique characteristics of b + - tree indexes the d-ipl b + - tree avoids the frequent log overflow problem by allocating a log area in a flash block dynamically . it also addresses elegantly the problem of page evaporation , imposed by the contemporary nand-flash chips , by introducing ghost nodes within the context of the dynamic ipl scheme . this simple but elegant design of the d-ipl b + - tree improves the performance significantly . for a random insertion workload , the d-ipl b + - tree-index outperformed a b + - tree with a plain ipl scheme by more than a factor of two in terms of page write and block erase operations .
