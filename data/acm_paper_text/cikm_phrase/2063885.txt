question-routing in community-question-answering : putting category in its place this paper investigates a ground-breaking incorporation of question-category to question-routing (qr) in community-question-answering (cqa) services . the incorporation of question-category was designed to estimate answerer expertise for routing questions to potential answerers . two category-sensitive language models (lms) were developed with large-scale real-world data-sets being experimented . results demonstrated that higher accuracies of routing questions with lower computational costs were achieved , relative to traditional query likelihood lm (qllm) , state-of-the-art cluster-based lm (cblm) and the mixture of latent-dirichlet-allocation and qllm (ldalm) .
