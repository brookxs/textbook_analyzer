query-optimization for ontology-based information integration in recent years , there has been an explosion of publicly available rdf and owl data sources . in order to effectively and quickly answer queries in such an environment , we present an approach to identifying the potentially relevant semantic-web data sources using query rewritings and a term index . we demonstrate that such an approach must carefully handle query goals that lack constants ; otherwise the algorithm may identify many sources that do not contribute to eventual answers . this is because the term index only indicates if uris are present in a document , and specific answers to a subgoal can not be calculated until the source is physically accessed - an expensive operation given disk/network latency . we present an algorithm that , given a set of query rewritings that accounts for ontology heterogeneity , incrementally selects and processes sources in order to maintain selectivity . once sources are selected , we use an owl reasoner to answer queries over these sources and their corresponding ontologies . we present the results of experiments using both a synthetic-data set and a subset of the real-world billion triple challenge data .
