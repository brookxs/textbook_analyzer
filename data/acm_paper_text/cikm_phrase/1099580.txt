rotation-invariant indexing of shapes and line-drawings we present data-representations , distance-measures and organizational-structures for fast and efficient retrieval of similar shapes in image-databases . using the-hough-transform we extract shape signatures that correspond to important features of an image . the new shape-descriptor is robust against line discontinuities and takes into consideration not only the shape boundaries , but also the content inside the object perimeter . the object signatures are eventually projected into a space that renders them invariant to translation , scaling and rotation . in order to provide support for real-time query-by-content , we also introduce an index-structure that hierarchically organizes compressed versions of the extracted object signatures . in this manner we can achieve a significant performance boost for multimedia-retrieval . our experiments suggest that by exploiting the proposed framework , similarity-search in a database of 100,000 images would require under 1 sec , using an off-the-shelf personal-computer .
