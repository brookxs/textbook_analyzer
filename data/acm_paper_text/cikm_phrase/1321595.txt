mining redundancy in candidate-bearing snippets to improve web-question-answering conventional question-answering (qa) techniques independently process candidate-bearing snippets to select an exact answer to a question from candidate answers . this paper presents two novel ways of utilizing redundancy in candidate-bearing snippets to help select an exact answer to a question in our web qa-system , i.e. , cluster-based-language-model (clm-m) and unsupervised svm-classifier (u-svm) techniques . the comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform the language model-based (lm-m) and supervised svm-based (s-svm) techniques that do not utilize this redundancy in the candidate-bearing snippets . using the clm-m , the top_1 score is increased from 36.03 \ % (lm-m) to 46.96 \ % ; and the top_1 improvement in the u-svm over the s-svm is about 23 \ % . moreover , a cross-model comparison shows that the performance ranking of these models is : u-svm > clm-lm > lm-m > s-svm > r-m (the retrieval-based model) .
