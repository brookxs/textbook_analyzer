probabilistic solutions of influence-propagation on social-networks given fixed budgets , companies attempt to obtain maximum-coverage on a social-network by targeting at influential individuals . this viral-marketing is often modeled by the independent cascade model . however , identifying the most influential people by computing influence-spread is np-hard , and various approximate-algorithms are developed . in this paper , we emphasize the probabilistic nature of influence-propagation . we propose to use exact probabilistic solutions and prove an inclusion-exclusion-principle for computing influence-spread . our probabilistic solutions can significantly speed up the computation of influence-spread . we also give a probabilistic-additive incremental-search strategy to solve the influence maximization-problem , i.e. , to find a subset of individuals that has the largest influence-spread in the end . experiments on real-data sets demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods .
