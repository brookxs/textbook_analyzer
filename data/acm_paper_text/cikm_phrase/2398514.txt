content-based relevance-estimation on the web using inter-document similarities in adversarial and noisy search settings as the-web , the document-query surface-level similarity can be a highly misleading relevance signal . thus , devising content-based relevance-estimation (ranking) approaches becomes highly challenging . we address this challenge using two methods that utilize inter-document similarities in an initially retrieved list . the first removes documents from the list that exhibit high query-similarity , but for which there is insufficient additional support for relevance that is based on inter-document similarities . the method is based on a probabilistic-model that decouples document-query similarities from relevance-estimation . the second method re-ranks the list by `` rewarding '' documents that exhibit high similarity both to the query and to other documents in the list . both methods incorporate , in addition , at the model level , query-independent document-quality estimates . extensive empirical-evaluation demonstrates the merits of our methods .
