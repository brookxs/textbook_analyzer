probabilistic moving-range-query over rfid spatio-temporal-data-streams moving-range-query over rfid-data-streams is one of the most important spatio-temporal-queries to support valuable information-analysis . however , the location-uncertainty challenges the query strategy . in this paper , we propose a probability evaluation-model in the rfid-enabled monitoring environments and discuss the query-optimization techniques under the scenarios of continuous moving-range-query , which can also be applied into more situations . the extensive experimental-evaluation verifies the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our proposed model and methods .
