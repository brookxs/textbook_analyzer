shard ranking and cutoff estimation for topically partitioned collections large document collections can be partitioned into ` topical shards ' to facilitate distributed-search . in a low-resource search environment only a few of the shards can be searched in parallel . such a search environment faces two intertwined challenges . first , determining which shards to consult for a given query : shard ranking . second , how many shards to consult from the ranking : cutoff estimation . in this paper we present a family of three algorithms that address both of these problems . as a basis we employ a commonly used data-structure , the central sample index (csi) , to represent the shard contents . running a query against the csi yields a flat document-ranking that each of our algorithms transforms into a tree-structure . a bottom up traversal of the tree is used to infer a ranking of shards and also to estimate a stopping point in this ranking that yields cost-effective selective distributed-search . as compared to a state-of-the-art shard ranking approach the proposed algorithms provide substantially higher search efficiency while providing comparable search-effectiveness .
