this image smells good : effects of image information scent in search-engine-results-pages users are confronted with an overwhelming amount of web-pages when they look for information on the internet . current search-engines already aid the user in their information-seeking-tasks by providing textual results but adding images to results pages could further help the user in judging the relevance of a result . we investigated this problem from an information-foraging perspective and we report on two empirical-studies that focused on the information-scent of images . our results show that images have their own distinct `` smell '' which is not as strong as that of text . we also found that combining images and text cues leads to a stronger overall scent . surprisingly , when images were added to search-engine-results-pages , this did not lead our participants to behave significantly differently in terms of effectiveness or efficiency . even when we added images that could confuse the participants ' scent , this had no significantly detrimental impact on their behaviour . however , participants expressed a preference for results pages which included images . we discuss potential challenges and point to future-research to ensure the success of adding images to textual results in search-engine-results-pages .
