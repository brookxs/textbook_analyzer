cp/cv : concept similarity mining without frequency information from domain describing taxonomies domain-specific ontologies are heavily used in many applications . for instance , these form the bases on which similarity/dissimilarity between keywords are extracted for various knowledge-discovery and retrieval tasks . existing similarity-computation schemes can be categorized as (a) structure - or (b) information-based approaches . structure_based approaches compute dissimilarity between keywords using a (weighted) count of edges between two keywords . information-base approaches , on the other hand , leverage available corpora to extract additional-information , such as keyword frequency , to achieve better performance in similarity-computation than structure-based approaches . unfortunately , in many application-domains (such as applications that rely on unique-keys in a relational-database) , frequency information required by information-based approaches does not exist . in this paper , we note that there is a third way of computing similarity : if each node in a given hierarchy can be represented as a vector of related concepts , these vectors could be compared to compute similarities . this requires mapping concept-nodes in a given hierarchy onto a concept-space . in this paper , we propose a concept-propagation (cp) scheme , which relies on the semantical relationships between concepts implied by the structure of the hierarchy to annotate each concept-node with a concept-vector (cv) . we refer to this approach as cp/cv . comparison of keyword-similarity results shows that cp/cv provides significantly better (upto 33 \ %) results than existing structure-based schemes . also , even if cp/cv does not assume the availability of an appropriate corpus to extract keyword frequency information , our approach matches (and slightly improves on) the performance of information-based approaches .
