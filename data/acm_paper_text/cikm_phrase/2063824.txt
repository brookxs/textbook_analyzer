the quality of the xml-web we collect evidence to answer the following question : is the quality of the xml-documents found on the web sufficient to apply xml-technology like xquery , xpath and xslt ? xml collections from the-web have been previously studied statistically , but no detailed information about the quality of the xml-documents on the web is available to date . we address this shortcoming in this study . we gathered 180k xml-documents from the-web . their quality is surprisingly good ; 85.4 \ % is well-formed and 99.5 \ % of all specified encodings is correct . validity needs serious attention . only 25 \ % of all files contain a reference to a dtd or xsd , of which just one third is actually valid . errors are studied in detail . automatic error repair seems promising . our study is well documented and easily repeatable . this paves the way for a periodic quality-assessment of the xml-web .
