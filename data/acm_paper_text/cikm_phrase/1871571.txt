reverted-indexing for feedback and expansion traditional interactive-information-retrieval systems function by creating inverted-lists , or term indexes . for every term in the vocabulary , a list is created that contains the documents in which that term occurs and its relative-frequency within each document . retrieval algorithms then use these term frequencies alongside other collection statistics to identify the matching documents for a query . in this paper , we turn the process around : instead of indexing documents , we index query result sets . first , queries are run through a chosen retrieval-system . for each query , the resulting document ids are treated as terms and the score or rank of the document is used as the frequency statistic . an index of documents retrieved by basis queries is created . we call this index a reverted index . with reverted indexes , standard retrieval algorithms can retrieve the matching queries (as results) for a set of documents (used as queries) . these recovered queries can then be used to identify additional documents , or to aid the user in query-formulation , selection , and feedback .
