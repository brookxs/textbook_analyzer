stemming and lemmatization in the clustering of finnish text-documents stemming and lemmatization were compared in the clustering of finnish text-documents . since finnish is a highly inflectional and agglutinative-language , we hypothesized that lemmatization , involving splitting of the compound-words , would be more appropriate normalization approach than the straightforward stemming . the relevance of the documents were evaluated with a four-point relevance-assessment scale , which was collapsed into binary one by considering all the relevant and only the highly relevant documents relevant , respectively . experiments with four hierarchical-clustering-methods supported the hypothesis . the stringent relevance scale showed that lemmatization allowed the single and complete linkage methods to recover especially the highly relevant documents better than stemming . in comparison with stemming , lemmatization together with the average linkage and ward 's methods produced higher precision . we conclude that lemmatization is a better word normalization method than stemming , when finnish text-documents are clustered for information-retrieval .
