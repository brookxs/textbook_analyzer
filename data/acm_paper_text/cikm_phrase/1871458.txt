on wavelet-decomposition of uncertain time-series-data sets in this paper , we will explore the construction of wavelet decompositions of uncertain-data . uncertain representations of data-sets require significantly more space , and it is therefore even more important to construct compressed representations for such cases . we will use a hierarchical-optimization technique in order to construct the most effective partitioning for our wavelet-representation . we explore two different schemes which optimize the uncertainty in the resulting representation . we will show that the incorporation of uncertainty into the design of the wavelet representations significantly improves the compression-rate of the representation . we present experimental-results illustrating the effectiveness of our approach .
