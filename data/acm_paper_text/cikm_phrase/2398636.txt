top-n-recommendation through belief-propagation the top-n-recommendation focuses on finding the top-n items that the target user is likely to purchase rather than predicting his/her ratings on individual items . in this paper , we propose a novel method that provides top-n-recommendation by probabilistically determining the target user 's preference on items . this method models the purchasing relationships between users and items as a bipartite-graph and employs belief-propagation to compute the preference of the target user on items . we analyze the proposed method in detail by examining the changes in recommendation-accuracy under different parameter-settings . we also show that the proposed method is up to 40 % more accurate than an existing method by comparing it with an rwr-based method via extensive experiments .
