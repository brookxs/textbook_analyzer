predicting the uncertainty of sentiment adjectives in indirect answers opinion question-answering (qa) requires automatic and correct interpretation of an answer relative to its question . however , the ambiguity that often exists in the question-answer pairs causes complexity in interpreting the answers . this paper aims to infer yes/no answers from indirect-yes/no-question-answer-pairs (iqaps) that are ambiguous due to the presence of ambiguous-sentiment-adjectives . we propose a method to measure the uncertainty of the answer in an iqap relative to its question . in particular , to infer the yes or no response from an iqap , our method employs antonyms , synonyms , word-sense-disambiguation as well as the semantic association between the sentiment adjectives that appear in the iqap . extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over the baseline .
