irank : an interactive-ranking framework and its application in query-focused-summarization we address the problem of unsupervised-ensemble-ranking in this paper . traditional approaches either combine multiple ranking criteria into a unified representation to obtain an overall ranking score or to utilize certain rank fusion or aggregation-techniques to combine the ranking results . beyond the aforementioned combine-then-rank and rank-then-combine approaches , we propose a novel rank-learn-combine ranking framework , called interactive-ranking (irank) , which allows two base rankers to `` teach '' each other before combination during the ranking process by providing their own ranking results as feedback to the others so as to boost the ranking-performance . this mutual ranking refinement process continues until the two base rankers can not learn from each other any more . the overall performance is improved by the enhancement of the base rankers through the mutual-learning mechanism . we apply this framework to the sentence-ranking problem in query-focused-summarization and evaluate its effectiveness on the duc 2005 data-set . the results are encouraging with consistent and promising improvements .
