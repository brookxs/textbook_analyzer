authentication of location-based skyline-queries in outsourced spatial-databases , the location-based-service (lbs) provides query services to the clients on behalf of the data owner . however , if the lbs is not trustworthy , it may return incorrect or incomplete query results . thus , authentication is needed to verify the soundness and completeness of query results . in this paper , we study the authentication problem for location-based skyline-queries , which have recently been receiving increasing attention in lbs applications . we propose two authentication-methods : one based on the traditional mr-tree index and the other based on a newly developed mr-sky-tree . experimental-results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods in terms of the authentication cost .
