collaborative-filtering in social-tagging systems based on joint item-tag recommendations tapping into the wisdom of the crowd , social-tagging can be considered an alternative mechanism - as opposed to web-search - for organizing and discovering information on the web . effective tag-based recommendation of information items , such as web-resources , is a critical aspect of this social-information discovery mechanism . a precise understanding of the information-structure of social-tagging systems lies at the core of an effective tag-based recommendation-method . while most of the existing research either implicitly or explicitly assumes a simple tripartite graph-structure for this purpose , we propose a comprehensive information-structure to capture all types of co-occurrence-information in the tagging data . based on the proposed information-structure , we further propose a unified user-profiling scheme to make full use of all available information . finally , supported by our proposed user-profile , we propose a novel framework for collaborative-filtering in social-tagging systems . in our proposed framework , we first generate joint item-tag recommendations , with tags indicating topical interests of users in target items . these joint recommendations are then refined by the wisdom from the crowd and projected to the item space for final item recommendations . evaluation using three real-world datasets shows that our proposed recommendation approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches .
