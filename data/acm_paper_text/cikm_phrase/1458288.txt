large maximal-cliques enumeration in sparse-graphs here we study a variant of maximal-clique-enumeration problem by incorporating a minimum size criterion . we describe preprocessing techniques to reduce the graph size . this is of practical interest since enumerating maximal-cliques is a computationally hard problem and the execution-time increases rapidly with the input size . we discuss basics of an algorithm for enumerating large maximal-cliques which exploits the constraint on minimum size of the desired maximal-cliques . social-networks are prime examples of large sparse graphs where enumerating large maximal-cliques is of interest . we present experimental-results on the social-network formed by the call-detail-records of one of the world 's largest telecom service-providers . our results show that the preprocessing methods achieve significant reduction in the graph size . we also characterize the execution behaviour of our large maximal-clique-enumeration algorithm .
