discovering trending-phrases on information streams we study the problem of efficient discovery of trending-phrases from high-volume text-streams -- be they sequences of twitter-messages , email-messages , news-articles , or other time-stamped text-documents . most existing approaches return top-k trending-phrases . but , this approach neither guarantees that the top-k phrases returned are all trending , nor that all trending-phrases are returned . in addition , the value of k is difficult to set and is indifferent to stream dynamics . hence , we propose an approach that identifies all the trending-phrases in a stream and is flexible to the changing stream properties .
