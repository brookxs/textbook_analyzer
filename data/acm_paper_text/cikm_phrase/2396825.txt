multiview hierarchical bayesian regression-model andapplication to online-advertising with the development of web-applications , large-scale-data are popular ; and they are not only getting richer , but also ubiquitously interconnected with users and other objects in various ways , which brings about multi-view data with implicit-structure . in this paper , we propose a novel hierarchical bayesian mixture regression-model , which discovers and then exploits the relationships among multiple-views of the data to perform various machine-learning tasks . a stochastic em inference and learning-algorithm is derived ; and a parallel-implementation in hadoop-mapreduce [9] paradigm is developed to scale up the learning . we apply the developed model and algorithm on click-through-rate (ctr) prediction and campaign targeting recommendation in online-advertising to measure its effectiveness . the experiments on both synthetic-data and large-scale ads serving data from a real-world online-advertising exchange demonstrate the superior ctr-prediction accuracy of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods . the results also show that our model can recommend high-performance targeting features for online-advertising campaigns .
