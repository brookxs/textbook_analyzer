auto-generation of topic-hierarchies for web-images from users ' perspectives in this paper , we propose an approach to automatically generating a yahoo! - like topic-hierarchy for organizing web-images from users ' perspectives . relatively little effort has been devoted towards providing such a taxonomy simultaneously considering users ' image requests for semantic and visual information . based on the characteristic that a web-image query may be refined by various attributes , the proposed approach hierarchically groups similar queries from search-engine-logs into topic classes at different semantic levels . the generated topic-hierarchy has the advantages of organizing image-data from users ' perspectives for browsing , searching , annotation and users ' needs analysis.a series of experiments have been conducted on real-world image-search-engine logs . experimental-results show that the proposed approach is feasible to generate topic-hierarchies for web-images . moreover , the generated hierarchy has been successfully applied to analysis of users ' search-interests , which have more focuses on some specific domains when compared with document requests .
