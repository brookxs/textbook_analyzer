consistent on-line classification of dbs workload events an important goal of self-managing-databases is the autonomic adaptation of the database configuration to evolving workloads . however , the diversity of sql statements in real-world workloads typically causes the required analysis overhead to be prohibitive for a continuous workload-analysis . the workload-classification presented in this paper reduces the workload-analysis overhead by grouping similar workload events into classes . our approach employs clustering-techniques based upon a general distance-function for dbs workload events . to be applicable for a continuous workload-analysis , our workload-classification specifically addresses a stream-based , lightweight operation , a controllable loss of quality , and self-management .
