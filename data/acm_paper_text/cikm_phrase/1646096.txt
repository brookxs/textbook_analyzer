socializing or knowledge-sharing ? : characterizing social intent in community-question-answering knowledge-sharing communities , such as wikipedia or yahoo!-answers , add greatly to the wealth of information available on the web . they represent complex social-ecosystems that rely on user paricipation and the quality of users ' contributions to prosper . however , quality is harder to achieve when knowledge-sharing is facilitated through a high degree of personal interactions . the individuals ' objectives may change from knowledge-sharing to socializing , with a profound impact on the community and the value it delivers to the broader population of web users . in this paper we provide new insights into the types of content that is shared through community-question-answering (cqa) services . we demonstrate an approach that combines in-depth content-analysis with social-network-analysis techniques . we adapted the undirected inductive coding method to analyze samples of user questions and arrive at a comprehensive typology of the user-intent . in our analysis we focused on two types of intent , social vs. non-social , and define measures of social-engagement to characterize the users ' participation and content contributions . our approach is applicable to a broad class of online-communities and can be used to monitor the dynamics of community ecosystems .
