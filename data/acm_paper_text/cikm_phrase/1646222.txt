agglomerating local-patterns hierarchically with alpha to increase the relevancy of local-patterns discovered from noisy relations , it makes sense to formalize error-tolerance . our starting point is to address the limitations of state-of-the-art methods for this purpose . some extractors perform an exhaustive-search w.r.t. a declarative-specification of error-tolerance . nevertheless , their computational-complexity prevents the discovery of large relevant patterns . alpha is a 3-step method that (1) computes complete collections of closed patterns , possibly error-tolerant ones , from arbitrary n - ary relations , (2) enlarges them by hierarchical agglomeration , and (3) selects the relevant agglomerated patterns .
