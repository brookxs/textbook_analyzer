applying theory to practice we discuss the art of applying theory to practice . in particular , we discuss in detail our interactions with two research projects at ibm almaden : the garlic project , which built a multimedia-database-system on top of various existing systems , and the clio project , which developed tools for converting data from one format to another . we discuss the problems we resolved , and the impact this had both on the garlic or clio systems and on the broader scientific community . we draw morals from these interactions , including why theoreticians do better theory by working with system builders , and why system builders build better systems by working with theoreticians . we present the remarkably simple threshold algorithm , which is optimal in an extremely strong sense : optimal not just in the worst-case , or in the average case , but in every case ! the threshold algorithm and its variants have applications to numerous areas , including information-retrieval , fuzzy and uncertain-databases , group-recommendation systems , and the-semantic-web .
