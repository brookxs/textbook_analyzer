(k , p) - anonymity : towards pattern-preserving anonymity of time-series-data the challenges with privacy-protection of time-series are mainly due to the complex nature of the data and the queries performed on them . we study the anonymization of time-series while trying to support complex-queries , such as range and pattern-similarity queries , on the published data . the conventional k-anonymity can not effectively address this problem as it may suffer severe pattern loss . we propose a novel anonymization model called (k , p) - anonymity for pattern-rich time-series . this model publishes both the attribute values and the patterns of time-series in separate data forms . we demonstrate that our model can prevent linkage attacks on the published data while effectively support a wide variety of queries on the anonymized data . we also design an efficient-algorithm for enforcing (k , p) - anonymity on time-series-data .
