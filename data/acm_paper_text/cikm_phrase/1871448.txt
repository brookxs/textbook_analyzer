an efficient-algorithm for mining time interval-based patterns in large database most studies on sequential-pattern-mining are mainly focused on time point-based event data . few research efforts have elaborated on mining patterns from time interval-based event data . however , in many real applications , event usually persists for an interval of time . since the relationships among event time-intervals are intrinsically complex , mining time interval-based patterns in large database is really a challenging problem . in this paper , a novel approach , named as incision strategy and a new representation , called coincidence representation are proposed to simplify the processing of complex relations among event intervals . then , an efficient-algorithm , ctminer (c oincidence t emporal miner) is developed to discover frequent time-interval based patterns . the algorithm also employs two pruning techniques to reduce the search-space effectively . furthermore , experimental-results show that ctminer is not only efficient and scalable but also outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms .
