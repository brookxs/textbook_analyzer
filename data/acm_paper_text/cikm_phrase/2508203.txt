search excavator : the knowledge-discovery tool we present a knowledge-discovery tool search excavator (se) developed for detecting similar words in web-documents ranked by overall usage frequency in american-english . the se prototype application is a web-browser add-on developed to assist users in acquiring new knowledge in unknown domains and to help in posing more specific search queries . the se is designed to discover similar but generally infrequent words with surrounding texts in browser web-documents and then suggest found words as possible query keywords . this technique allows users to discover unknown data intersections and use less ambiguous-queries to target the required documents . the se concept is motivated by a number of ideas . the similar infrequent words in the texts of the relevant documents can include field specific terms and facts that can be unknown to the user . suggesting such keywords can decrease the overall search-time encouraging early learning by directing users to the new unknown relevant terms and facts in a search-session with an ambiguous-query . finally , we present four demonstration scenarios from our small-scale qualitative-user-study of the se tool .
