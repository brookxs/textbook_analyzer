a heuristic-approach for checking containment of generalized tree-pattern-queries query-processing techniques for xml-data have focused mainly on tree-pattern-queries (tpqs) . however , the need for querying xml data sources whose structure is very complex or not fully known to the user , and the need to integrate multiple xml-data sources with different structures have driven , recently , the suggestion of query-languages that relax the complete specification of a tree-pattern . in order to implement the processing of such languages in current dbmss , their containment problem has to be efficiently solved . in this paper , we consider a query-language which generalizes tpqs by allowing the partial-specification of a tree-pattern . partial tree-pattern queries (ptpqs) constitute a large fragment of xpath that flexibly permits the specification of a broad range of queries from keyword-queries without structure , to queries with partial-specification of the structure , to complete tpqs . we address the containment problem for ptpqs . this problem becomes more complex in the context of ptpqs because the partial-specification of the structure allows new , non-trivial , structural expressions to be inferred from those explicitly specified in a query . we show that the containent problem can not be characterized by homomorphisms between ptpqs , even when ptpqs are put in a canonical-form that comprises all derived structural expressions . we provide necessary and sufficient-conditions for this problem in terms of homomorphisms between ptpqs and (a possibly exponential number of) tpqs . to cope with the high complexity of ptpq containment , we suggest a heuristic-approach for this problem that trades accuracy for speed . an extensive experimental-evaluation of our heuristic shows that our heuristic-approach can be efficiently implemented in a query-optimizer .
