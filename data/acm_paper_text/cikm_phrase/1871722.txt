manifold-ranking-with-sink-points for update-summarization update-summarization aims to create a summary over a topic-related multi-document dataset based on the assumption that the user has already read a set of earlier documents of the same topic . beyond the problems (i.e. , topic-relevance , salience , and diversity in extracted information) tackled by topic-focused-multi-document-summarization , the update-summarization must address the novelty problem as well . in this paper , we propose a novel extractive approach based on manifold-ranking-with-sink-points for update-summarization . specifically , our approach leverages a manifold-ranking process over the sentence manifold to find topic relevant and salient sentences . more important , by introducing the sink points into sentence manifold , the ranking process can further capture the novelty and diversity based on the intrinsic sentence manifold . therefore , we are able to address the four challenging problems above for update-summarization in a unified way . experiments on benchmarks of tac are performed and the evaluation results show that our approach can achieve comparative performance to the existing best performing systems in tac tasks .
