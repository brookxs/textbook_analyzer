feature-subspace transformations for enhancing k-means-clustering unsupervised-classification typically concerns identifying clusters of similar entities in an unlabeled dataset . popular methods include clustering based on (i) distance-based metrics between the entities in the feature-space (k-means) , and (ii) combinatorial properties in a weighted-graph representation of the dataset (multilevel k-means) . in this paper , we present a force-directed-graph-layout_based feature-subspace transformation (fst) scheme to transform the dataset before the application of k-means . our fst-k-means method utilizes both distance-based and combinatorial attributes of the original dataset to seek improvements in the internal and external quality-metrics of unsupervised-classification . we demonstrate the effectiveness of fst-k-means in improving classification-quality relative to k-means and multilevel k-means (graclus) . the quality of classification is measured by observing internal and external quality-metrics on a test-suite of datasets . our results indicate that on average , the internal-quality metric (cluster cohesiveness) is 20.2 \ % better than k-means , and 6.6 \ % better than graclus . more significantly , fst-k-means improves the external quality-metric (accuracy) of classification on average by 14.9 \ % relative to k-means and 23.6 \ % relative to graclus .
