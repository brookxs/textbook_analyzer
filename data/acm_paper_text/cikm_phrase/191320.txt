a semantics approach for kqml a general purpose communication-language for software-agents we investigate the semantics for knowledge query manipulation language (kqml) and we propose a semantic framework for the language . kqml is a language and a protocol to support communication between software-agents . based on ideas from speech-act-theory , we propose a semantic-description for kqml that associates descriptions of the cognitive-states of agents with the use of the language 's primitives (performatives) . we use this approach to describe the semantics for the basic set of kqml performatives . we also investigate implementation issues related to our semantic-approach . we suggest that kqml can offer an all purpose communication-language for software-agents that requires no limiting pre-commitments on the agents ' structure and implementation . kqml can provide the distributed-ai , cooperative-distributed-problem-solving and software-agents communities with an all purpose language and environment for intelligent inter-agent communication .
