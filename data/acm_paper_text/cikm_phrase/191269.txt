analytical version-control management in a hypertext system in this paper it is shown how structural and cognitive versioning issues can be efficiently managed in a petri-nets based hypertextual model . the advantages of this formalism are enhanced by modular and structured modeling ; modularity allows to focus the attention only on some modules , while giving the abstraction of the others . each module owns metaknowledge that is useful in defining new layers and contexts . the central point of the data-model is the formulation and resolution of three recurrence-equations , effective in describing both the versioning and the derivation history ; these equations permit to express in precise terms both the structural-evolution (changes operated on specific nodes of the net) and the behavioral one (changes concerning browsing) .
