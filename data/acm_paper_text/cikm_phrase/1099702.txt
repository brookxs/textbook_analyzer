leveraging collective-knowledge as more organizations begin to deploy taxonomies for categorization and faceted-search , the cost of producing these knowledge-models is becoming the largest expense on a project . at a cost of 200 - 300 dollars per topic , manually developing subject area taxonomies does not scale for any but the smallest of projects . this paper will discuss an approach called orthogonal corpus indexing (oci) . oci leverages existing published knowledge in the subject area of the taxonomy model . this knowledge is algorithmically mapped into multiple taxonomies via the oci algorithm . the resulting taxonomy costs are 1 / 100th of the cost of manual methods and are created with embedded rule-sets for categorization engines . this paper will discuss the theory of oci , its practical use as well as examples of knowledge-management techniques that are possible when taxonomies are large , detailed and inexpensive .
