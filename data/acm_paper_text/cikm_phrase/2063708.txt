recommendation in the end-to-end encrypted domain in recommendation-systems , a central host typically requires access to user-profiles in order to generate useful recommendations . this access , however , undermines user-privacy ; the more information is revealed to the host , the more the user 's privacy is compromised . in this paper , we propose a novel end-to-end encrypted recommendation mechanism which encrypts sensitive private-data at the user end , without ever exposing plaintext private-data to the host server . unlike previously proposed privacy-preserving recommendation mechanisms , the data in this proposed system are lossless - a pivotal feature to many applications , e.g. , in health-informatics , business-analytics , cyber-security , etc. . we achieve this goal by developing encrypted-domain polynomial ring homomorphism cryptographic-algorithms to compute similarity of encrypted scores on the server , so that collaborative recommendations can be computed in the encryption domain and only an authorized person can decrypt the exact-results . we also propose a novel key-management system to make sure private-information-retrieval and recommendation computations can be executed in the encrypted domain in practice . our experiments show that the proposed scheme offers robust security and lossless accurate recommendation , as well as high efficiency . our preliminary results show the recommendation-accuracy is 21 \ % better than the existing statistical lossy privacy-preserving mechanisms based on random-perturbation and user-profile distribution . this new approach can potentially be applied to various data-mining and cloud-computing environments and significantly alleviates the privacy-concerns of users .
