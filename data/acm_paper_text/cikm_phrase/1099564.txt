on the complexity of computing peer agreements for consistent-query-answering in peer-to-peer-data-integration systems peer-to-peer (p2p) data-integration-systems have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to manage and share data dispersed over different peer sources . while integrating data for answering user queries , it often happens that inconsistencies arise , because some integrity-constraints specified on peers ' global schemas may be violated . in these cases , we may give semantics to the inconsistent system by suitably `` repairing '' the retrieved data , as typically done in the context of traditional data-integration-systems . however , some specific-features of p2p-systems , such as peer autonomy and peer preferences (e.g. , different source trusting) , should be properly addressed to make the whole approach effective . in this paper , we face these issues that were only marginally considered in the literature . we first present a formal-framework for reasoning about autonomous peers that exploit individual preference criteria in repairing the data . the idea is that queries should be answered over the best possible database-repairs with respect to the preferences of all peers , i.e. , the states on which they are able to find an agreement . then , we investigate the computational-complexity of dealing with peer agreements and of answering queries in p2p data-integration-systems . it turns out that considering peer preferences makes these problems only mildly harder than in traditional data-integration-systems .
