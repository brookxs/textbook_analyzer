madden : query-driven statistical text analytics in many domains , structured-data and unstructured-text are both important natural resources to fuel data-analysis . statistical text analysis needs to be performed over text-data to extract structured-information for further query-processing . typically , developers will need to connect multiple tools to build off-line batch processes to perform text analytic tasks . madden is an integrated-system developed for relational-database-systems such as postgresql and greenplum for real-time ad-hoc query-processing over structured and unstructured-data . madden implements four important text analytic functions that we have contributed to the madlib open-source-library for textual analytics . in this demonstration , we will show the capability of the madden text analytic library using computational-journalism as the driving application . we show real-time declarative-query processing over multiple data sources with both structured and text-information .
