a competition-based connectionist model for information-retrieval using a merged thesaurus this paper investigates a network-based information-retrieval-model using diagnostic inferencing techniques . a basic inference-network in information-retrieval consists of two component networks : the document component and the query component . in our approach , there is a layer of nodes corresponding to the documents , and a layer of nodes corresponding to the index-terms extracted from the document set , with links connecting documents to the related index-terms 1 . a thesaurus is used to provide concept categories ; these categories are represented by another layer of nodes , with links connecting the index-terms and the related categories 2 . the query component uses a symmetric structure . each query causes markings of category nodes , hence markings of the related index term nodes , in the document component of the network . in our previous work , we adapted a competition-based connectionist model for diagnostic problem-solving to information-retrieval . in this model , documents are treated as disorders and user-information-needs , represented by the marked index term nodes , as manifestations . a competitive-activation mechanism is then used which converges to a set of disorders that best explain the given manifestations . our experiments showed that the retrieval-performance of this model is comparable to or better than that of various information retrieval-models reported in the literature . in this paper , we report further enhancements of the model by using a merged thesaurus .
