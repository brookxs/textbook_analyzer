towards estimating the number of distinct value combinations for a set of attributes accurately and efficiently estimating the number of distinct values for some attribute (s) or sets of attributes in a data-set is of critical importance to many database operations , such as query-optimization and approximation query-answering . previous work has focused on the estimation of the number of distinct values for a single attribute and most existing work adopts a data-sampling approach . this paper addresses the equally important issue of estimating the number of distinct value combinations for multiple attributes which we call colscard (for column set cardinality) . it also takes a different approach that uses existing statistical-information (e.g. , histograms) available on the individual attributes to assist estimation . we start with cases where exact frequency information on individual attributes is available , and present a pair of lower-and-upper-bounds on colscard that are consistent with the available information , as well as an estimator of colscard based on probability . we then proceed to study the case where only partial-information (in the form of histograms) is available on individual attributes , and show how the proposed estimator can be adapted to this case . we consider two types of widely used histograms and show how they can be constructed in order to obtain optimal approximation . an experimental-evaluation of the proposed estimation-method on synthetic as well as two real-data sets is provided .
