yahoo! as an ontology : using yahoo! categories to describe documents we suggest that one (or a collection) of names of yahoo! (or any other www indexer 's) categories can be used to describe the content of a document . such categories offer a standardized and universal way for referring to or describing the nature of real-world-objects , activities , documents and so on , and may be used (we suggest) to semantically characterize the content of documents . www indices , like yahoo! provide a huge hierarchy of categories (topics) that touch every aspect of human endeavors . such topics can be used as descriptors , similarly to the way librarians use for example , the library-of-congress cataloging system to annotate and categorize books . in the course of investigating this idea , we address the problem of automatic-categorization of webpages in the yahoo! directory . we use telltale as our classifier ; telltale uses n-grams to compute the similarity between documents . we experiment with various types of descriptions for the yahoo! categories and the webpages to be categorized . our findings suggest that the best results occur when using the very brief descriptions of the yahoo! categorized entries ; these brief descriptions are provided either by the entries ' submitters or by the yahoo! human indexers and accompany most yahoo! - indexed entries .
