a metamodel approach to flexible semantic-web-service discovery in this paper we describe an approach for service-discovery supported by semantic-annotations . we propose a metamodel representation of both the wsdl documents and the associated semantic-annotations . based on this metamodel , effective service-discovery is achieved by a datalog engine implementing flexible-matchmaking techniques that allow both exact and partial-matches among search-results . the metamodel is supported by a storage-system that ensures scalability of the entire process . finally we illustrate experiments on a public-dataset of semantic-service descriptions .
