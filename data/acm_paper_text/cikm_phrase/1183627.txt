mining blog stories using community-based and temporal-clustering in recent years , weblogs , or blogs for short , have become an important form of online-content . the personal nature of blogs , online-interactions between bloggers , and the temporal nature of blog entries , differentiate blogs from other kinds of web-content . bloggers interact with each other by linking to each other 's posts , thus forming online-communities . within these communities , bloggers engage in discussions of certain issues , through entries in their blogs . since these discussions are often initiated in response to online or offline events , a discussion typically lasts for a limited time duration . we wish to extract such temporal discussions , or stories , occurring within blogger communities , based on some query keywords . we propose a content-community-time model that can leverage the content of entries , their timestamps , and the community-structure of the blogs , to automatically discover stories . doing so also allows us to discover hot stories . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through several case-studies using real-world-data collected from the blogosphere .
