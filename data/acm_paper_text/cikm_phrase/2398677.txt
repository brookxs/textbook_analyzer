relation regularized subspace recommending for related scientific articles recommending related scientific articles for a researcher is very important and useful in practice but also is full of challenges due to the latent complex semantic-relations among scientific literatures . to deal with these challenges , this paper proposes a novel framework with link-missing data adaption , which casts the recommendation task to subspace embedding and similarity ranking problems . the relation regularized subspace in this framework is constructed via relation regularized matrix-factorization (rrmf) for well modeling both content and link structure simultaneously . however , the link-structure for an article is not always available in practical recommending . to solve this problem , we further propose two alternative approaches based on latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) for link-missing articles recommendation as an extension of rrmf . experiments on citeseer dataset demonstrate our method is more effective in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches and is able to handle the link-missing case which the link-based methods never can fit .
