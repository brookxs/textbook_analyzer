lattice-based tagging using support-vector-machines tagging algorithms have become increasingly important for identifying lexical and semantic-features of unstructured-text . we describe an approach to lattice-based tagging that estimates joint transition and emission probabilities using support-vector-machines . the technique offers several advantages over alternative methods , including the ability to accommodate non-local features , support for hundreds of thousands of features , and language-neutrality . we demonstrate the technique on two tagging applications : named-entity-recognition and part-of-speech-tagging .
