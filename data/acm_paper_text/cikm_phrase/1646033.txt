expected reciprocal rank for graded-relevance while numerous metrics for information-retrieval are available in the case of binary relevance , there is only one commonly used metric for graded-relevance , namely the discounted-cumulative-gain (dcg) . a drawback of dcg is its additive nature and the underlying independence-assumption : a document in a given position has always the same gain and discount independently of the documents shown above it . inspired by the `` cascade '' user-model , we present a new editorial metric for graded-relevance which overcomes this difficulty and implicitly discounts documents which are shown below very relevant documents . more precisely , this new metric is defined as the expected reciprocal length of time that the user will take to find a relevant-document . this can be seen as an extension of the classical reciprocal rank to the graded-relevance case and we call this metric expected reciprocal rank (err) . we conduct an extensive evaluation on the query-logs of a commercial-search-engine and show that err correlates better with clicks metrics than other editorial metrics .
