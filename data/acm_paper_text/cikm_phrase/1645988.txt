adaptive-relevance-feedback in information-retrieval relevance-feedback has proven very effective for improving retrieval-accuracy . a difficult yet important problem in all relevance-feedback methods is how to optimally balance the original query and feedback information . in the current feedback methods , the balance parameter is usually set to a fixed value across all the queries and collections . however , due to the difference in queries and feedback documents , this balance parameter should be optimized for each query and each set of feedback documents . in this paper , we present a learning-approach to adaptively predict the optimal balance coefficient for each query and each collection . we propose three heuristics to characterize the balance between query and feedback information . taking these three heuristics as a road-map , we explore a number of features and combine them using a regression approach to predict the balance coefficient . our experiments show that the proposed adaptive-relevance-feedback is more robust and effective than the regular fixed-coefficient feedback .
