crosslingual distant supervision for extracting relations of different complexity we propose crosslingual distant supervision (crosslingual ds) for relation-extraction , an approach that automatically extracts labels from a pivot-language for labeling one or more target-languages . the approach has two benefits compared to standard ds : (i) increased coverage if target-language labels are not available ; and (ii) higher accuracy of automatically generated labels because noisy labels are eliminated in crosslingual filtering . an evaluation for two relations of different complexity shows that crosslingual ds increases the accuracy of relation-extraction . our approach is language-independent ; we successfully apply it to four different languages : chinese , english , french and german .
