logical and physical support for heterogeneous-data heterogeneity arises naturally in virtually all real-world-data . this paper presents evolutionary extensions to a relational-database system for supporting three classes of data heterogeneity : variational , structural and annotational heterogeneities . we define these classes and show the impact of these new features on data-storage , data-access mechanisms , and the data-description language . since xml is an important source of heterogeneity , we describe how the system automatically utilizes these new features when storing-xml-documents .
