a signal-to-noise approach to score-normalization score-normalization is indispensable in distributed-retrieval and fusion or meta-search where merging of result-lists is required . distributional approaches to score-normalization with reference to relevance , such as binary mixture-models like the normal-exponential , suffer from lack of universality and troublesome parameter-estimation especially under sparse relevance . we develop a new approach which tackles both problems by using aggregate score distributions without reference to relevance , and is suitable for uncooperative engines . the method is based on the assumption that scores produced by engines consist of a signal and a noise component which can both be approximated by submitting well-defined sets of artificial queries to each engine . we evaluate in a standard distributed-retrieval testbed and show that the signal-to-noise approach yields better results than other distributional methods . as a significant by-product , we investigate query-length distributions .
