semantic-similarity over the gene-ontology : family-correlation and selecting disjunctive ancestors many bioinformatics applications would benefit from comparing proteins based on their biological role rather than their sequence . in most biological-databases , proteins are already annotated with ontology terms . previous studies identified a correlation between the sequence similarity and the semantic similarity of proteins . the semantic similarity of proteins was computed from their annotated go terms . however , proteins sharing a biological role do not necessarily have a similar sequence.this paper introduces our study of the correlation between go and family similarity . family similarity overcomes some of the limitations of sequence similarity , thus we obtained a strong correlation between go and family similarity . additionally , this paper introduces grasm , a novel method that uses all the information in the graph-structure of the go , instead of considering it as a hierarchical-tree . when calculating the semantic similarity of two concepts , grasm selects the disjunctive common ancestors rather than only using the most informative common ancestor . grasm produced a higher family similarity correlation than the original semantic-similarity-measures .
