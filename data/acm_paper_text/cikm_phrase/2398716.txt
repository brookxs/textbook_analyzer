similarity-search in 3d object-based video data in this paper , we present the vision of the usage of an object-based video data-storage format for similarity-search . the efficient (fast) and effective (accurate) search in video streams is an ongoing and still unsolved problem . using an object-based format of multimedia-data , all the information that is needed to answer queries is already available in a machine accessible format . this way , the process of creating (video) descriptors as well as the similarity-search becomes easier , because the data is already organized in a manner that allows fast access to specific information . to demonstrate the concept of similarity-search process using the object-based 3d-video format , we present experiments conducted on generated clouds of points (an abstraction of 3d-video data) .
