multi-task text-segmentation and alignment based on weighted-mutual-information text-segmentation is important for text-analysis , while text-alignment is to determine shared sub-topics among similar documents . multi-task text-segmentation and alignment is the extension of single-task segmentation to utilize information of multi-source documents . in this paper we introduce a novel domain-independent unsupervised-method for multi-task segmentation and alignment based on the idea that the optimal-segmentation and alignment maximizes weighted-mutual-information , mutual-information with term-weights . the experiment results show that our approach works well .
