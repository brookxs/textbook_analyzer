supervised-semantic-indexing in this article we propose supervised-semantic-indexing (ssi) , an algorithm that is trained on (query , document) pairs of text-documents to predict the quality of their match . like latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) , our models take account of correlations between words (synonymy , polysemy) . however , unlike lsi our models are trained with a supervised signal directly on the ranking task of interest , which we argue is the reason for our superior results . as the query and target texts are modeled separately , our approach is easily generalized to different retrieval tasks , such as online-advertising placement . dealing with models on all pairs-of-words features is computationally challenging . we propose several improvements to our basic model for addressing this issue , including low rank (but diagonal preserving) representations , and correlated feature hashing (cfh) . we provide an empirical-study of all these methods on retrieval tasks based on wikipedia documents as well as an internet-advertisement task . we obtain state-of-the-art performance while providing realistically scalable methods .
