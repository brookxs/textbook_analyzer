power in unity : forming teams in large-scale community systems the-internet has enabled the collaboration of groups at a scale that was unseen before . a key problem for large collaboration groups is to be able to allocate tasks effectively . an effective task-assignment method should consider both how fit teams are for each job as well as how fair the assignment is to team members , in terms that no one should be overloaded or unfairly singled out . the assignment has to be done automatically or semi-automatically given that it is difficult and time-consuming to keep track of the skills and the workload of each person . obviously the method to do this assignment must also be computationally efficient . in this paper we present a general-framework for task-assignment problems . we provide a formal treatment on how to represent teams and tasks . we propose alternative functions for measuring the fitness of a team performing a task and we discuss desirable properties of those functions . then we focus on one class of task-assignment problems , we characterize the complexity of the problem , and we provide algorithms with provable approximation guarantees , as well as lower-bounds . we also present experimental-results that show that our methods are useful in practice in several application-scenarios .
