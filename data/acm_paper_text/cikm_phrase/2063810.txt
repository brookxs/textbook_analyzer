on benchmarking data-translation systems for semantic-web ontologies data-translation , also known as data-exchange , is an integration task that aims at populating a target model using data from a source-model . this task is gaining importance in the context of semantic-web ontologies due to the increasing interest in graph-databases and semantic-web agents . currently , there are a variety of semantic-web technologies that can be used to implement data-translation systems . this makes it difficult to assess them from an empirical point-of-view . in this paper , we present a benchmark that provides a catalogue of seven data-translation patterns that can be instantiated by means of seven parameters . this allows us to create a variety of synthetic , domain-independent scenarios one can use to test existing data-translation systems . we also illustrate how to analyse three such systems using our benchmark . the main benefit of our benchmark is that it allows to compare data-translation systems side by side within a homogeneous framework .
