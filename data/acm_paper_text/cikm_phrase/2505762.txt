searching similar segments over textual event-sequences sequential-data is prevalent in many scientific and commercial-applications such as bioinformatics , system-security and networking . similarity-search has been widely studied for symbolic and time-series-data in which each data object is a symbol or numeric value . textual event-sequences are sequences of events , where each object is a message describing an event . for example , system-logs are typical textual event-sequences and each event is a textual message recording internal system operations , statuses , configuration modifications or execution errors . similar segments of an event-sequence reveals similar system behaviors in the past which are helpful for system-administrators to diagnose system problems . existing search indexing for textual data only focus on unordered data . substring matching methods are able to efficiently find matched segments over a sequence , however , their sequences are single values rather than texts . in this paper , we propose a method , suffix matrix , for efficiently searching similar segments over textual event-sequences . it provides an integration of two disparate techniques : locality-sensitive-hashing and suffix-arrays . this method also supports the k-dissimilar segment search . a k-dissimilar segment is a segment that has at most k dissimilar events to the query-sequence . by using random sequence mask proposed in this paper , this method can have a high probability to reach all k-dissimilar segments without increasing much search-cost . we conduct experiments on real-system log-data and the experimental-results show that our proposed method outperforms alternative methods using existing techniques .
