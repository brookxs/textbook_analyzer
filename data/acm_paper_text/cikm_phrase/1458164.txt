a framework for estimating complex probability-density structures in data-streams probability-density-function estimation is a fundamental component in several stream-mining tasks such as outlier-detection and classification . the nonparametric adaptive kernel-density-estimate (akde) provides a robust and asymptotically consistent estimate for an arbitrary distribution . however , its extensive computational requirements make it difficult to apply this technique to the stream environment . this paper tackles the issue of developing efficient and asymptotically consistent akde over data-streams while heeding the stringent constraints imposed by the stream environment . we propose the concept of local regions to effectively synopsize local density features , design a suite of algorithms to maintain the akde under a time-based sliding-window , and analyze the estimates ' asymptotic consistency and computational costs . in addition , extensive experiments were conducted with real-world and synthetic-data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach .
