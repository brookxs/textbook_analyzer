a visual-interface technique for exploring olap data with coordinated dimension hierarchies multi-dimensional-data occurs in many domains while a wide variety of text based and visual-interfaces for querying such data exists . but many of these interfaces are not applicable to olap , as they do not support use of dimension hierarchies for selection and aggregation . we introduce an-interface technique which supports visual-querying of olap data , that has been implemented in the sgviewer tool . it is based on a data graph rather than a data-cube representation of the data . our interface presents each dimension hierarchy in a zoomable panel which supports selection and aggregation at multiple levels . users explore data and query it by making selections in several dimension views . three view coordinations are identified ; progressive , global and result only . our main contribution , the progressive view coordination provides better support for query-refinement than existing interfaces , by helping users decide the next query step with intermediate-result overviews , and by helping users change a previous selection decision with retained selection context views . our interface technique is demonstrated with a web-log dataset of visits organised into time , download , visitor and referrer address dimensions .
