characteristics of document-similarity measures for compliance-analysis due to increased competition in the it-services business , improving quality , reducing costs and shortening schedules has become extremely important . a key strategy being adopted for achieving these goals is the use of an asset-based approach to service-delivery , where standard reusable-components developed by domain-experts are minimally modified for each customer instead of creating custom solutions . one example of this approach is the use of contract templates , one for each type of service offered . a compliance-checking system that measures how well actual contracts adhere to standard templates is critical for ensuring the success of such an approach . this paper describes the use of document-similarity measures - cosine-similarity and latent-semantic-indexing - to identify the top candidate templates on which a more detailed (and expensive) compliance-analysis can be performed . comparison of results of using the different methods are presented .
