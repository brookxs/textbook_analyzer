automatic-extraction of web-data-records containing user-generated-content in this paper , we are concerned with the problem of automatically extracting web-data-records that contain user-generated-content (ugc) . in previous work , web-data-records are usually assumed to be well-formed with a limited amount of ugc , and thus can be extracted by testing repetitive structure-similarity . however , when a web-data record includes a large portion of free-format ugc , the similarity-test between records may fail , which in turn results in lower performance . in our work , we find that certain domain constraints (e.g. , post-date) can be used to design better similarity-measures capable of circumventing the influence of ugc . in addition , we also use anchor points provided by the domain constraints to improve the extraction-process , which ends in an algorithm called mibat (mining data records based on anchor trees) . we conduct extensive experiments on a dataset consisting of forum thread pages which are collected from 307 sites that cover 219 different forum software-packages . our approach achieves a precision of 98.9 \ % and a recall of 97.3 \ % with respect to post record-extraction . on page level , it perfectly handles 91.7 \ % of pages without extracting any wrong posts or missing any golden posts . we also apply our approach to comment extraction and achieve good results as well .
