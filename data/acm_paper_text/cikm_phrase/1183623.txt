an approximate multi-word matching-algorithm for robust document-retrieval document-generation from low level data and its utilization is one of the most challenging tasks in document-engineering . word occurrence detection is a fundamental problem in the recognized document utilization obtained by a recognizer , such as ocr and speech-recognition . given a set of words , such as a dictionary , this paper proposes an efficient dynamic-programming (dp) algorithm to find the occurrences of each word in a text . in this paper , the string-similarity is measured by a statistical similarity-model that enables a definition of the similarities in the character level as well as edit operation level . the proposed algorithm uses tree-structures to measure similarities in order to avoid measuring similarities of the same substrings appearing in different parts of the text and words . the time-complexity of the proposed algorithm is o (| w | ? | s | ? | q |) , where | w | (resp . | s |) denote the number of nodes in the trees representing the word set (resp . the text) , and | q | donotes the number of the states of the model used for string-similarity . this paper shows the proposed algorithm is experimentally about six times faster than a naive dp-algorithm .
