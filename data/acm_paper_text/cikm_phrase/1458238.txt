using structured-text for large-scale attribute-extraction we propose a weakly-supervised approach for extracting class-attributes from structured-text available within web-documents . the overall precision of the extracted attributes is around 30 \ % higher than with previous methods operating on web-documents . in addition to attribute-extraction , this approach also automatically identifies values for a subset of the extracted class-attributes .
