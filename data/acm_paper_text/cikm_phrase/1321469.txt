modeling historical and future movements of spatio-temporal objects in moving-objects-databases spatio-temporal-databases deal with geometries changing over time . in general , geometries do not only change discretely but continuously ; hence we are dealing with moving-objects . in the past , a few moving-object data-models and query-languages have been proposed . each of them supports either historical-movements or future movements but not both together . consequently , queries that start in the past and extend into the-future can not be supported . to model both historical and future movements of an object , two separate concepts with different properties are required , and extra attention is necessary to avoid their conflicts . furthermore , current definitions of moving-objects are too general and vague . it is unclear how a moving-object is allowed to move through space and time . for instance , the continuity or discontinuity of motion is not specified . in this paper , we propose a new moving-object data-model called balloon-model which provides integrated support for both historical and future movements of moving-objects . as part of the model , we provide formal-definitions of moving-objects with respect to their past and future movements . all kinds of queries including past-queries , future queries , and queries that start in the past and end in the future are supported in our model .
