using lsi for text-classification in the presence of background text this paper presents work that uses latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) for text-classification . however , in addition to relying on labeled-training-data , we improve classification-accuracy by also using unlabeled-data and other forms of available `` background '' text in the classification-process . rather than performing lsi 's singular-value-decomposition (svd) process solely on the training-data , we instead use an expanded term-by-document matrix that includes both the labeled-data as well as any available and relevant background text . we report the performance of this approach on data-sets both with and without the inclusion of the background text , and compare our work to other efforts that can incorporate unlabeled-data and other background text in the classification-process .
