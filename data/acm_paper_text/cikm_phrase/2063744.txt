temporal-link-prediction by integrating content-and-structure information in this paper we address the problem of temporal-link-prediction , i.e. , predicting the apparition of new links , in time-evolving networks . this problem appears in applications such as recommender-systems , social-network-analysis or citation-analysis . link-prediction in time-evolving networks is usually based on the topological-structure of the network only . we propose here a model which exploits multiple-information-sources in the network in order to predict link occurrence probabilities as a function of time . the model integrates three types of information : the global network structure , the content of nodes in the network if any , and the local or proximity information of a given vertex . the proposed model is based on a matrix-factorization formulation of the problem with graph-regularization . we derive an efficient-optimization method to learn the latent-factors of this model . extensive experiments on several real-world datasets suggest that our unified-framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for temporal-link-prediction tasks .
