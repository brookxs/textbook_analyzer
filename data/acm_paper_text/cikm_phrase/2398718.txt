latent topics in graph-structured-data large amounts of graph-structured-data are emerging from various avenues , ranging from natural and life-sciences to social-and-semantic-web communities . we address the problem of discovering subgraphs of entities that reflect latent topics in graph-structured-data . these topics are structured meta-information providing further insights into the data . the presented approach effectively detects such topics by exploiting only the structure of the underlying graph , thus avoiding the dependency on textual labels , which are a scarce asset in prevalent graph datasets . the viability of our approach is demonstrated in experiments on real-world datasets .
