pathrank : a novel node-ranking measure on a heterogeneous graph for recommender-systems in this paper , we present a novel random-walk_based node-ranking measure , pathrank , which is defined on a heterogeneous graph by extending the personalized-pagerank algorithm . not only can our proposed measure exploit the semantics behind the different types of nodes and edges in a heterogeneous graph , but also it can emulate various recommendation semantics such as collaborative-filtering , content-based-filtering , and their combinations . the experimental-results show that pathrank can produce more various and effective recommendation results compared to existing approaches .
