developing learning-strategies for topic-based summarization most up-to-date well-behaved topic-based summarization-systems are built upon the extractive framework . they score the sentences based on the associated features by manually assigning or experimentally tuning the weights of the features . in this paper , we discuss how to develop learning-strategies in order to obtain the optimal feature-weights automatically , which can be used for assigning a sound score to a sentence characterized with a set-of-features . the two fundamental issues are about training-data and learning-models . to save the costly manual-annotation time and effort , we construct the training-data by labeling the sentence with a `` true '' score calculated according to human summaries . the support-vector-regression (svr) model is then used to learn how to relate the `` true '' score of the sentence to its features . once the relations have been mathematically modeled , svr is able to predict the `` estimated '' score for any given sentence . the evaluations by rouge-2 criterion on duc 2006 and duc 2005 document-sets demonstrate the competitiveness and the adaptability of the proposed approaches .
