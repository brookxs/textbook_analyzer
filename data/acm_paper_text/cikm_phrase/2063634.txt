effective and efficient polarity-estimation in blogs based on sentence-level evidence one of the core tasks in opinion-mining consists of estimating the polarity of the opinionated documents found . in some scenarios (e.g. blogs) , this estimation is severely affected by sentences that are off-topic or that simply do not express any opinion . in fact , the key sentiments in a blog post often appear in specific locations of the text . in this paper we propose several effective and robust polarity-detection methods based on different sentence features . we show that we can successfully determine the polarity of documents guided by a sentence-level analysis that takes into account topicality and the location in the blog post of the subjective sentences . our experimental-results show that some of our proposed variants are both highly effective and computationally-lightweight .
