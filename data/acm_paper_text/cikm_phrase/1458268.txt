an approximate-string-matching approach for handling incorrectly typed urls in this paper we approach the problem of providing corrections for incorrectly typed urls . this problem is significantly different from the classical spelling-correction problem . we describe our contribution - building a custom data-structure and a search-algorithm that can find approximate matches for incorrect urls . we evaluate the quality of our results through experiments with analysts . our system is now being used in the google-search-engine .
