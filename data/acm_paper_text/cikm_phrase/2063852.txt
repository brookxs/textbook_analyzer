a peer 's - eye view : network term clouds in a peer-to-peer-system we investigate term clouds that represent the content available in a peer-to-peer (p2p) network . such network term clouds are non-trivial to generate in distributed settings . our term-cloud generator was implemented and released in tribler -- a widely-used , server-free p2p-system -- to support users in understanding the sorts of content available . our evaluation and analysis focuses on three aspects of the clouds : coverage , usefulness and accumulation speed . a live experiment demonstrates that individual peers accumulate substantial network-level information , indicating good coverage of the overall content of the system . the results of a user-study carried out on a crowdsourcing platform confirm the usefulness of clouds , showing that they succeed in conveying to users information on the type of content available in the network . an analysis of five example peers reveals that accumulation speeds of terms at new peers can support the development of a semantically diverse term-set quickly after a cold-start . this work represents the first investigation of term clouds in a live , 100 \ % server-free p2p setting .
