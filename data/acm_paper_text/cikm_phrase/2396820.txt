predicting emerging social-conventions in online-social-networks the way in which social-conventions emerge in communities has been of interest to social-scientists for decades . here we report on the emergence of a particular social convention on twitter -- the way to indicate a tweet is being reposted and attributing the content to its source . despite being invented at different times and having different adoption rates , only two variations became widely adopted . in this paper we describe this process in detail , highlighting the factors that come into play in deciding which variation individuals will adopt . our classification analysis demonstrates that the date of adoption and the number of exposures are particularly important in the adoption process , while personal features (such as the number of followers and join date) and the number of adopter friends have less discriminative power in predicting adoptions . we discuss implications of these findings in the design of future web-applications and services .
