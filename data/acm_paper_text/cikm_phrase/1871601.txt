open user schema guided evaluation of streaming rdf queries performance-and-scalability are two issues that are becoming increasingly pressing as rdf-data model is applied to real-world-applications . because neither vertical nor flat structures of rdf-storage can handle frequent schema updates and meanwhile avoid possible long-chain joins , there is no clear winner between these two typical structures . in this paper , we propose an alternative storage schema called open user schema . the open user schema consists of flat tables automatically extracted from rdf-query streams . a query is divided into two parts and conquered , respectively , on the flat tables in the open user schema and on the vertical table stored in a backend storage . at the core of this divide-and-conquer architecture with open user schema , an efficient isomorphism decision algorithm is given to guide a query to related flat tables in the open user schema . our proposal in essence departs from existing methods in that it can accommodate schema updates without possible long-chain joins . we implement our approach and provide empirical evaluations to demonstrate both efficiency-and-effectiveness of our approach in evaluating complex rdf queries .
