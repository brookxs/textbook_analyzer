a study-of-information retrieval on accumulative-social-descriptions using the generation features this paper is concerned with the study-of-information retrieval (ir) on accumulative-social-descriptions (asds) . asds refer to web texts that accumulated by many web users describing certain web-resources , such as anchor-texts , search-logs and social-annotations . there have been some studies working on leveraging asds for improving search-performance in both internet and intranet . however , to the best of our knowledge , no prior study has concerned the specific generation features of asds , which are the focus point of this paper . specifically , we consider the generation features from two perspectives , the generation processes and the generated distributions . further , three probabilistic-ir models are derived based on them . the three models are first demonstrated with one toy dataset and then empirically evaluated with two real datasets : an internet dataset consisting of 90,295 web-pages , with 25,845,818 social-annotations crawled from del.icio.us and 31,320,005 pieces of anchor-texts crawled through yahoo! api , and an intranet dataset consisting of 179,835 web-pages with 1,245,522 annotations dumped from the intranet tagging-system in ibm , named as dogear . extensive experimental-results show that the proposed methods , which fully leverage the generation features of asds , improve the performance of both internet and intranet-search significantly .
