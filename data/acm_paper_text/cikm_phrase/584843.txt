intelligent knowledge discovery in peer-to-peer-file-sharing emerging peer-to-peer-computing provides new possibilities but also challenges for distributed-applications . despite their significant potential , current peer-to-peer-networks lack efficient knowledge-discovery and management . this paper addresses this deficiency and proposes the intelligent file-sharing framework , which provides an effective and flexible-query for p2p-file-sharing . the ifs is based on powerful schema and flexible inference , as well as efficiently integrated and extensible retrieval algorithms . experimental-results have provided evidence of the high-performance and scalability of the intelligent file-sharing (ifs) system in peer-to-peer environments .
