k-farthest-neighbors-based concept boundary-determination for support-vector-data-description support-vector-data-description (svdd) is very useful for one-class-classification . however , it incurs high time-complexity in handling large-scale-data . in this paper , we propose a novel and efficient method , named k-farthest-neighbors-based concept boundary-detection (kfn-cbd for short) , to improve the svdd learning-efficiency on large-datasets . this work is motivated by the observation that svdd classifier is determined by support-vectors (svs) , and removing the non-support vectors (non-svs) will not change the classifier but will reduce computational costs . our approach consists of two steps . in the first step , we propose the k-farthest-neighbors method to identify the samples around the hyper-sphere surface , which are more likely to be svs . at the same time , a new tree-search strategy of m-tree is presented to speed up the k-farthest neighbor query . in the second step , the non-svs are eliminated from the training-set , and only the identified boundary samples are used to train the svdd classifier . by removing the non-svs , the training-time of svdd can be substantially reduced.extensive experiments have shown that kfn-cbd achieves around 6 times speedup compared to the standard svdd , and obtains the comparable classification-quality as the entire dataset used .
