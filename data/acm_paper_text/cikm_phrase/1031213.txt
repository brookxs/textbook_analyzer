image-similarity search with compact-data-structures the recent theoretical advances on compact-data-structures (also called `` sketches '') have raised the question of whether they can effectively be applied to content-based-image-retrieval systems . the main challenge is to derive an algorithm that achieves high-quality similarity-searches while using compact metadata . this paper proposes a new similarity-search method consisting of three parts . the first is a new region-feature representation with weighted $ = <i> </i> <inf> 1 </inf> distance-function , and emd * match , an improved emd match , to compute image-similarity . the second is a thresholding and transformation algorithm to convert feature-vectors into very compact-data-structures . the third is an emd embedding based filtering method to speed up the query process . we have implemented a prototype-system with the proposed method and performed experiments with a 10,000 image-database . our results show that the proposed method can achieve more effective similarity-searches than previous approaches with metadata 3 to 72 times more compact than previous systems . the experiments also show that our emd embedding based filtering technique can speed up the query process by a factor of 5 or more with little loss in query-effectiveness .
