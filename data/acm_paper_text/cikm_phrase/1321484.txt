a strategy for allowing meaningful and comparable scores in approximate-matching the goal of approximate data matching is to assess whether two distinct data instances represent the same real-world object . this is usually achieved through the use of a similarity-function , which returns a score that defines how similar two data instances are . if this score surpasses a given threshold , both data instances are considered as representing the same real-world object . the score values returned by a similarity-function depend on the algorithm that implements the function and have no meaning to the user (apart from the fact that a higher similarity value means that two data instances are more similar) . in this paper , we propose that instead of defining the threshold in terms of the scores returned by a similarity-function , the user specifies the precision that is expected from the matching-process . precision is a well known quality-measure and has a clear interpretation from the user 's point-of-view . our approach relies on mapping between similarity-scores and precision values based on a training-data-set . experimental-results show the training may be executed against a representative data-set , and reused for other databases from the same domain .
