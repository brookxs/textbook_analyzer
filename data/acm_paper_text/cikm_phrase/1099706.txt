scalable summary_based retrieval in p2p-networks much of the present p2p-ir literature is focused on distributed-indexing structures . within this paper , we present an approach based on the replication of peer data summaries via rumor-spreading and multicast in a structured overlay.we will describe rumorama , a p2p framework for similar-ity queries inspired by gloss and cori and their p2p-adaptation , planetp . rumorama achieves a hierarchization of planetp-like summary-based p2p-ir networks . in a rumorama network , each peer views the network as a small planetp network with connections to peers that see other small planetp networks . one important aspect is that each peer can choose the size of the planetp network it wants to see according to its local processing power and bandwidth . even in this adaptive environment , rumorama manages to process a query such that the summary of each peer is considered exactly once in a network without churn . however , the actual number of peers to be contacted for a query is a small fraction of the total number of peers in the network.within this article , we present the rumorama base protocol , as well as experiments demonstrating the scalability and viability of the approach under churn .
