shine : search heterogeneous-interrelated-entities heterogeneous entities or objects are very common and are usually interrelated with each other in many scenarios . for example , typical web-search activities involve multiple-types of interrelated entities such as end-users , web-pages , and search queries . in this paper , we define and study a novel problem : <ul> s </ul> earch <ul> h </ul> eterogeneous <ul> in </ul> terrelated <ul> e </ul> ntities (shine) . given a shine-query which can be any type (s) of entities , the task of shine is to retrieve multiple-types of related entities to answer this query . this is in contrast to the traditional search , which only deals with a single type of entities (e.g. , web-pages) . the advantages of shine include : (1) it is feasible for end-users to specify their information-need along different dimensions by accepting queries with different types . (2) answering a query by multiple-types of entities provides informative context for users to better understand the search-results and facilitate their information-exploration . (3) multiple relations among heterogeneous entities can be utilized to improve the ranking of any particular type of entities . to attain the goal of shine , we propose to represent all entities in a unified space through utilizing their interaction relationships . two approaches , m-lsa and e-vsm , are discussed and compared in this paper . the experiments on 3 data-sets (i.e. , a literature data-set , a search-engine log-data set , and a recommendation data-set) show the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed methods .
