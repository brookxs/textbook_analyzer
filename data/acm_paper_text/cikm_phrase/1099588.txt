integrating dct and dwt for approximating cube-streams for time-relevant multi-dimensional-data-sets (mds) , users usually pose a huge amount of data due to the large dimensionality , and approximating query-processing has emerged as a viable solution . specifically , the cube-streams handle mdss in a continuous manner . traditional cube approximation focuses on generating single snapshots rather than continuous ones . to address this issue , the application of generating snapshots for cube-streams , called scs , is investigated in this paper . such an application collects data events for cube-streams on-line and generates snapshots with limited-resources in order to keep the approximated information in synopsis memory for further analysis . as compared to olap applications , the scs ones are subject to much more resource-constraints for both processing-time and memory and can not be dealt with by existing methods due to the limited-resources . in this paper , the dawa algorithm , standing for a hybrid-algorithm of dct for data and discrete-wavelet-transform , is proposed to approximate the cube-streams . the dawa algorithm combines the advantage of high compression-rate from dwt and that of low memory-cost from dct . consequently , dawa costs much smaller working buffer and outperforms both dwt-based and dct-based methods in execution efficiency . also , it is shown that dawa provides answers of good quality for scs applications with a small working buffer and short execution-time . the optimality of algorithm dawa is theoretically proved and also empirically demonstrated by our experiments .
