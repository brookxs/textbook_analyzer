opinionit : a text-mining-system for cross-lingual opinion analysis opinion-mining focuses on extracting customers ' opinions from the reviews and predicting their sentiment-orientation . reviewers usually praise a product in some aspects and bemoan it in other aspects . with the business globalization , it is very important for enterprises to extract the opinions toward different aspects and find out cross-lingual/cross-culture difference in opinions . cross-lingual-opinion-mining is a very challenging task as amounts of opinions are written in different languages , and not well structured . since people usually use different words to describe the same aspect in the reviews , product-feature (pf) categorization becomes very critical in cross-lingual-opinion-mining . manual cross-lingual pf categorization is time consuming , and practically infeasible for the massive amount of data written in different languages . in order to effectively find out cross-lingual difference in opinions , we present an aspect-oriented opinion-mining method with cross-lingual latent-semantic-association (clasa) . we first construct clasa model to learn the cross-lingual latent-semantic-association among all the pfs from multi-dimension semantic clues in the review corpus . then we employ clasa model to categorize all the multilingual pfs into semantic aspects , and summarize cross-lingual difference in opinions towards different aspects . experimental-results show that our method achieves better performance compared with the existing approaches . with clasa model , our text-mining-system opinionit can effectively discover cross-lingual difference in opinions .
