computing the top-k maximal-answers in a join of ranked-lists complex-search-tasks that utilize information from several data sources , are answered by integrating the results of distinct basic search queries . in such integration , each basic query returns a ranked list of items , and the main task is to compute the join of these lists , returning the top-k combinations . computing the top-k join of ranked-lists has been studied extensively for the case where the answer comprises merely complete combinations . however , a join is a lossy operation , and over heterogeneous-data-sources some highly-ranked items , from the results of the basic queries , may not appear in any combination . yet , such items and the partial combinations in which they appear may still be relevant answers and should not be discarded categorically . in this paper we consider a join where combinations are padded by nulls for missing items . a combination is maximal if it can not be extended by replacing a null by an item . we present algorithms for computing the top-k maximal combinations and provide an experimental-evaluation .
