on low-dimensional-random-projections and similarity-search random-projection (rp) is a common technique for dimensionality-reduction under l 2 norm for which many significant space-embedding results have been demonstrated . however , many similarity-search applications often require very low dimension embeddings in order to reduce overhead and boost performance . inspired by the use of symmetric probability-distributions in previous work , we propose a novel rp algorithm , beta random-projection , and give its probabilistic analyses based on beta and gaussian approximations . we evaluate the algorithm in terms of standard similarity-metrics with other rp algorithms as well as the singular-value-decomposition (svd) . our experimental-results show that brp preserves both similarity-metrics well and , under various dataset types including random point sets , text (trec5) and images , provides sharper and consistent performance .
