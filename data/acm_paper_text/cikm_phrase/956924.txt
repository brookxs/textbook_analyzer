efficient multi-way text-categorization via generalized discriminant-analysis text-categorization is an important research area and has been receiving much attention due to the growth of the on-line information and of internet . automated-text-categorization is generally cast as a multi-class-classification-problem . much of previous work focused on binary document-classification problems . support-vector-machines (svms) excel in binary-classification , but the elegant theory behind large-margin hyperplane can not be easily extended to multi-class text classification . in addition , the training-time and scaling are also important concerns . on the other hand , other techniques naturally extensible to handle multi-class-classification are generally not as accurate as svm . this paper presents a simple and efficient-solution to multi-class-text-categorization . classification problems are first formulated as optimization via discriminant-analysis . text-categorization is then cast as the problem of finding coordinate-transformations that reflects the inherent similarity from the data . while most of the previous approaches decompose a multi-class-classification-problem into multiple independent binary-classification tasks , the proposed approach enables direct multi-class-classification . by using generalized singular-value-decomposition (gsvd) , a coordinate-transformation that reflects the inherent class structure indicated by the generalized singular-values is identified . extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency-and-effectiveness of the proposed approach .
