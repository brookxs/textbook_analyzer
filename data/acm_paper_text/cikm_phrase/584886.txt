entropy-based link-analysis for mining web informative structures in this paper , we study the problem of mining the informative-structure of a news-web-site which consists of thousands of hyperlinked documents . we define the informative-structure of a news-web-site as a set of index pages (or referred to as toc , i.e. , table-of-contents , pages) and a set of article pages linked by toc pages through informative links . it is noted that the hyperlink induced topics search (hits) algorithm has been employed to provide a solution to analyzing authorities and hubs of pages . however , most of the content sites tend to contain some extra hyperlinks , such as navigation panels , advertisements and banners , so as to increase the add-on values of their web-pages . therefore , due to the structure induced by these extra hyperlinks , hits is found to be insufficient to provide a good precision in solving the problem . to remedy this , we develop an algorithm to utilize entropy-based link-analysis on mining web informative structures . this algorithm is referred to as lamis . the key idea of lamis is to utilize information-entropy for representing the knowledge that corresponds to the amount of information in a link or a page in the link-analysis . experiments on several real news web sites show that the precision and the recall of lamis are much superior to those obtained by heuristic-methods and conventional ink analysis-methods .
