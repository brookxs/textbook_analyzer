continuous keyword search on multiple text-streams in this paper we address the issue of continuous keyword queries on multiple textual streams . this line of work represents a significant departure from previous keyword-search models that assumed a static database . in our model the user poses a query comprised by a collection of keywords , which is subsequently applied on multiple text-streams (these can be rss news-feeds , tv closed-captions , emails , etc) . a result to a query is a combination of streams `` sufficiently correlated '' to each other that collectively contain all query keywords within a specified time span .
