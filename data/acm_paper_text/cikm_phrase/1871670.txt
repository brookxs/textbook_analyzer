visual-semantic graphs : using queries to reduce the semantic gap in web-image-retrieval we explore the application of a graph-representation to model similarity relationships that exist among images found on the web . the resulting similarity-induced graph allows us to model in a unified way different types of content-based similarities , as well as semantic-relationships . content-based similarities include different image-descriptors , and semantic similarities can include relevance user-feedback from search-engines . the goal of our representation is to provide an experimental framework for combining apparently unrelated metrics into a unique graph-structure , which allows us to enhance the results of web-image-retrieval . we evaluate our approach by re-ranking web-image-search results .
