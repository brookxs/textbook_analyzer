evaluation of partial path queries on xml-data xml-query-languages typically allow the specification of structural patterns of elements . finding the occurrences of such patterns in an xml-tree is the key operation in xml-query-processing . many algorithms have been presented for this operation . these algorithms focus mainly on the evaluation of path-pattern or tree-pattern-queries . in this paper , we define a partial-path-pattern-query language , and we address the problem of its efficient evaluation on xml-data . in order to process partial path-pattern queries , we introduce a set of sound and complete inference-rules to characterize structural relationship derivation . we provide necessary and sufficient-conditions for detecting query unsatisfiability and node redundancy . we show how partial path-pattern queries can be equivalently put in a canonical directed-acyclic-graph form . we developed two stack-based algorithms for the evaluation of partial path-pattern queries , partialmj and partialpathstack . partialmj computes answers to the query by merge-joining the results of the root-to-leaf paths of a spanning-tree of the query . partialpathstack exploits a topological-order of the nodes of the query-graph to match the query pattern as a whole to the xml-tree . the experimental-evaluation of our algorithms shows that partialpathstack is independent of intermediate results and largely outperforms partialmj .
