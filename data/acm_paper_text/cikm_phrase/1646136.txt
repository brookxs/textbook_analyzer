workload-aware trie indices for xml well-designed indices can dramatically improve query-performance . including query workload information can produce indices that yield better overall throughput while balancing the space and performance trade-off at the core of index-design . in the context of xml , structural-indices have proven to be particularly effective in supporting xpath-queries by capturing the structural-correlation between data components in an xml-document . in this paper , we propose a family of novel workload-aware indices by taking advantage of the disk-based ? [k] - trie index framework , which indexes node pairs of an xml-document to facilitate index-only evaluation plans . our indices are designed to be optimal for answering frequent path queries in one index-lookup and efficient for answering non-frequent path queries using an index-only plan . experimental-results prove that our indices outperform the apex index in overall throughput and excel in answering non-frequent queries , queries with predicates , and queries that yield empty results .
