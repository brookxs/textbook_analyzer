discovering matching dependencies matching dependencies (mds) are recently proposed for various data-quality applications such as detecting the violation of integrity-constraints and duplicate object-identification . in this paper , we study the problem of discovering matching dependencies for a given database instance . first , we formally define the measures , support and confidence , for evaluating the utility of mds in the given database instance . then , we study the discovery of mds with certain utility requirements of support and confidence . exact-algorithms are developed , together with pruning strategies to improve the time performance . finally , our experimental-evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed methods .
