xml , the-web and database functionality ? with the advance of xml , dtd 's , xml-schema , x-path , x-link , xml-query , xml-protocol , rdf , semantic-web and other information description tools and mechanisms the-web develops more and more into a huge structured-information and data network that becomes computer processable via `` semi '' - automatic `` intelligent '' means.however , most of these multimedia-information resources are kept in hierarchical file-type systems or relatively unstructured relational-systems with none or very little of what is commonly known as `` database functionality '' for the various information types represented . do we still need transaction properties , interoperability , security , reliability , scalability and others ? if yes , then why are these concepts not really taken into the web-world ? are the database people too far away to be able to adopt their existing solutions ? are the information-system people too process-oriented to care about data ? are the knowledge handlers too occupied with semantic-representations and ontology discussions ? does the document community even see the problem ? and do the-web people care whether human-resources are wasted through attempts to achieve database functionality through careful `` behaviour '' ? the panel will offer opinions about these aspects but will also want to raise these issues with the audience .
