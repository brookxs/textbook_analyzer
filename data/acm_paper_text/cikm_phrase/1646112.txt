enhancing recommender-systems under volatile userinterest drifts this paper presents a systematic study of how to enhance recommender-systems under volatile user-interest drifts . a key development challenge along this line is how to track user-interests dynamically . to this end , we first define four types of interest patterns to understand users ' rating behaviors and analyze the properties of these patterns . we also propose a rating graph and rating chain_based approach for detecting these interest patterns . for each users ' rating series , a rating graph and a rating chain are constructed based on the similarities between rated items . the type of a given user 's interest-pattern is identified through the density of the corresponding rating graph and the continuity of the corresponding rating chain . in addition , we propose a general algorithm framework for improving recommender-systems by exploiting these identified patterns . finally , experimental-results on a real-world-data set show that the proposed rating graph-based approach is effective for detecting user-interest patterns , which in turn help to improve the performance of recommender-systems .
