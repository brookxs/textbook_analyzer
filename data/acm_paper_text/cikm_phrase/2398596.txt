efficient distributed locality-sensitive-hashing distributed frameworks are gaining increasingly widespread use in applications that process large amounts of data . one important example application is large-scale similarity-search , for which locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) has emerged as the method of choice , specially when the data is high-dimensional . to guarantee high search-quality , the lsh scheme needs a rather large number of hash-tables . this entails a large space requirement , and in the distributed setting , with each query requiring a network call per hash bucket look up , also a big network load . panigrahy 's entropy lsh scheme significantly reduces the space requirement but does not help with (and in fact worsens) the search network efficiency . in this paper , focusing on the euclidian space under &#953; 2 norm and building up on entropy lsh , we propose the distributed layered lsh scheme , and prove that it exponentially decreases the network-cost , while maintaining a good load-balance between different machines . our experiments also verify that our theoretical results .
