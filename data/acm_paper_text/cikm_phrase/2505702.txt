structured positional entity language-model for enterprise entity-retrieval we investigate the problem of general entity-retrieval for enterprise websites . our framework transforms the webpage content into a structured-content representation , which captures hierarchical-information blocks and semi-structured-data records information . to facilitate entity-retrieval given a user-query , we develop a structured positional entity language-model suitable for ranking entities extracted from the webpage content incorporating the structured-content representation . different from existing language-models for retrieval , our proposed model considers both the proximity and the structured webpage content in a unified manner . extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework .
