dynamic hyperparameter optimization for bayesian topical trend-analysis this paper presents a new bayesian topical trend-analysis . we regard the parameters of topic dirichlet-priors in latent-dirichlet-allocation as a function of document timestamps and optimize the parameters by a gradient-based algorithm . since our method gives similar hyperparameters to the documents having similar timestamps , topic-assignment in collapsed-gibbs-sampling is affected by timestamp similarities . we compute tfidf-based document similarities by using a result of collapsed-gibbs-sampling and evaluate our proposal by link-detection task of topic-detection-and-tracking .
