mixture-model label-propagation usually , we can use a classification or clustering machine-learning-algorithm to manage knowledge and information-retrieval . if we have a small size of known information with a large-scale of unknown data , a semi-supervised-learning (ssl) algorithm is often preferred . under the cluster or manifold assumption , usually , the larger amount of unlabeled-data are used for learning , the bigger gains of the ssl approaches are achieved . in the paper , we adopt the graph-based ssl algorithm to solve the problem . however the graph-based ssl algorithms are unable to be learnt with large-scale unlabeled-samples and originally can only work in a transductive setting . in the paper , we propose a scalable graph-based ssl algorithm to attack the problems aforementioned by gaussian-mixture-model label-propagation . experiments conducted on the real dataset illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .
