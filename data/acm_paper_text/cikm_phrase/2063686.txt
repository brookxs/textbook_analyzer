emerging topic-detection using dictionary-learning streaming user-generated-content in the form of blogs , microblogs , forums , and multimedia-sharing sites , provides a rich source of data from which invaluable information and insights maybe gleaned . given the vast volume of such social-media-data being continually generated , one of the challenges is to automatically tease apart the emerging topics of discussion from the constant background chatter . such emerging topics can be identified by the appearance of multiple posts on a unique subject matter , which is distinct from previous online-discourse . we address the problem of identifying emerging topics through the use of dictionary-learning . we propose a two stage approach respectively based on detection and clustering of novel user-generated-content . we derive a scalable approach by using the alternating directions method to solve the resulting optimization-problems . empirical-results show that our proposed approach is more effective than several baselines in detecting emerging topics in traditional news story and newsgroup data . we also demonstrate the practical application to social-media-analysis , based on a study on streaming-data from twitter .
