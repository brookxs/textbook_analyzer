automatic-query-generation for patent-search patent-search is the task of finding relevant existing patents , which is an important part of the patent 's examiner 's process of validating a patent application . in this paper , we studied how to transform a query patent (the application) into search queries . three types of search features are explored for automatic-query-generation for patent-search . furthermore , different types of features are combined with a learning-to-rank method . experiments based on a uspto patent collection demonstrate that the single best search feature is the combination of words and noun-phrases from the summary field and the retrieval-performance can be significantly improved by combining three types of search features .
