a continuous-query evaluation-scheme for a detection-only-query over data-streams in a data-stream environment , a multi-way-join continuous-query is employed to monitor a considerable number of source data-streams from various remote sites in real-time . one key role of a continuous-query is detecting only the invocation of a particular event corresponding to the specifications of the query . the evaluation of such a detection-only-query does not require to produce either an intermediate tuple or a final result tuple , which not only shortens the processing-time of a query but also reduces the usage of memory-space . however , there has been no special effort to deal with a query of this type . this paper proposes a new evaluation-framework which efficiently processes a multi-way detection-only-query without generating any intermediate-result tuple explicitly .
