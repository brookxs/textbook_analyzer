towards a top-down and bottom-up bidirectional approach to joint-information-extraction most high-level information-extraction (ie) consists of compound and aggregated subtasks . such ie problems are generally challenging and they have generated increasing interest recently . we investigate two representative ie tasks : (1) entity-identification and relation-extraction from wikipedia , and (2) citation-matching , and we formally define joint-optimization of information-extraction . we propose a joint paradigm integrating three factors -- segmentation , relation , and segmentation-relation joint factors , to solve all relevant subtasks simultaneously . this modeling offers a natural formalism for exploiting bidirectional rich dependencies and interactions between relevant subtasks to capture mutual benefits . since exact parameter-estimation is prohibitively intractable , we present a general , highly-coupled learning-algorithm based on variational expectation-maximization (vem) to perform parameter-estimation approximately in a top-down and bottom-up manner , such that information can flow bidirectionally and mutual benefits from different subtasks can be well exploited . in this algorithm , both segmentation and relation are optimized iteratively and collaboratively using hypotheses from each other . we conducted extensive experiments using two real-world datasets to demonstrate the promise of our approach .
