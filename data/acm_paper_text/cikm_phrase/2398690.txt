demographic context in web-search re-ranking in this paper we study usefulness of user 's demographical context for improving ranking of ambiguous-queries . context-aware relevance-model is learnt from implicit user behaviour by using a simple yet general modification of a state-of-art click-model which is capable to catch dependences from the search-context . after that the machine learned click-model is used in an offline re-ranking experiment and it is demonstrated that the demographical context ranking-features provide improvements in ranking quality . further , we perform a study to investigate the impact of different facets of demographical features (gender , age , and income) on search-ranking performance and manually analyse queries which exhibit strong context dependences to get an additional understanding of the model behaviour .
