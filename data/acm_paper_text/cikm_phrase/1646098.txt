time sequence summarization to scale up chronology-dependent applications in this paper , we present the concept of time sequence summarization to support chronology-dependent applications on massive-data sources . time sequence summarization takes as input a time sequence of events that are chronologically ordered . each event is described by a set of descriptors . time sequence summarization produces a concise time sequence that can be substituted for the original time sequence in chronology-dependent applications . we propose an algorithm that achieves time sequence summarization based on a generalization , grouping and concept-formation process . generalization expresses event descriptors at higher levels-of-abstraction using taxonomies while grouping gathers similar events . concept-formation is responsible for reducing the size of the input time sequence of events by representing each group created by one concept . the process is performed in a way such that the overall chronology of events is preserved . the algorithm computes the summary incrementally and has reduced algorithmic complexity . the resulting output is a concise representation , yet , informative enough to directly support chronology-dependent applications . we validate our approach by summarizing one year of financial news provided by reuters .
