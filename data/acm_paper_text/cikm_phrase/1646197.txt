experiments on pattern-based relation-learning relation-extraction is the task of extracting semantic-relations - such as synonymy or hypernymy - between word-pairs from corpus data . past work in relation-extraction has concentrated on manually creating templates to use in directly extracting word-pairs for a given semantic-relation from corpus text . recently , there has been a move towards using machine-learning to automatically learn these patterns . we build on this research by running experiments investigating the impact of corpus type , corpus-size and different parameter-settings on learning a range of lexical-relations .
