an iterative strategy for pattern-discovery in high-dimensional-data sets high-dimensional-data representation in which each data item (termed target object) is described by many features , is a necessary component of many applications . for example , in dna-microarrays , each sample (target object) is represented by thousands of genes as features . pattern-discovery of target objects presents interesting but also very challenging problems . the data-sets are typically not task-specific , many features are irrelevant or redundant and should be pruned out or filtered for the purpose of classifying target objects to find empirical-pattern . uncertainty about which features are relevant makes it difficult to construct an informative feature-space . this paper proposes an iterative strategy for pattern-discovery in high-dimensional-data sets . in this approach , the iterative-process consists of two interactive components : discovering patterns within target objects and pruning irrelevant features . the performance of the proposed method with various real-data sets is also illustrated .
