(not) yet another matcher discovering correspondences between schema elements is a crucial task for data-integration . most schema-matching tools are semi-automatic , e.g. an expert must tune some parameters (thresholds , weights , etc.) . they mainly use several methods to combine and aggregate-similarity measures . however , their quality results often decrease when one requires to integrate a new similarity-measure or when matching particular domain schemas . this paper describes yam (yet another matcher) , which is a schema matcher-factory . indeed , it enables the generation of a dedicated matcher for a given schema-matching scenario , according to user inputs . our approach is based on machine-learning since schema matchers can be seen as classifiers . several bunches of experiments run against matchers generated by yam and traditional matching tools show how our approach is able to generate the best matcher for a given scenario .
