data-degradation : making private-data less sensitive over time trail disclosure is the leakage of privacy sensitive-data , resulting from negligence , attack or abusive scrutinization or usage of personal digital trails . to prevent trail disclosure , data-degradation is proposed as an alternative to the limited-retention principle . data-degradation is based on the assumption that long lasting purposes can often be satisfied with a less accurate , and therefore less sensi-tive , version of the data . data will be progressively degraded such that it still serves application purposes , while decreasing accuracy and thus privacy sensitivity .
