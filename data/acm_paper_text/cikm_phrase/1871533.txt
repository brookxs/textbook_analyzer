network growth and the spectral evolution-model we introduce and study the spectral evolution-model , which characterizes the growth of large-networks in terms of the eigenvalue decomposition of their adjacency-matrices : in large-networks , changes over time result in a change of a graph 's spectrum , leaving the eigenvectors unchanged . we validate this hypothesis for several large social , collaboration , authorship , rating , citation , communication and tagging networks , covering unipartite , bipartite , signed and unsigned graphs . following these observations , we introduce a link-prediction algorithm based on the extrapolation of a network 's spectral evolution . this new link-prediction method generalizes several common graph-kernels that can be expressed as spectral transformations . in contrast to these graph-kernels , the spectral extrapolation algorithm does not make assumptions about specific growth patterns beyond the spectral evolution-model . we thus show that it performs particularly well for networks with irregular , but spectral , growth patterns .
