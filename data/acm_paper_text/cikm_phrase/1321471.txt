boolean-representation based data-adaptive correlation-analysis over time-series-streams correlation-analysis is a basic problem in the field of data-stream-mining . typical approaches add sliding-window to data-streams to get the recent results , but the window length defined by users is always fixed which is not suitable for the changing stream environment . we propose a boolean-representation based data-adaptive method for correlation-analysis among a large number of time-series-streams . the periodical trends of each stream series to are monitored to choose the most suitable window-size and group the series with the same trends together . instead of adopting complex pair-wise calculation , we can also quickly get the correlation pairs of series at the optimal window sizes . all the processing is realized by simple boolean-operations . both the theory analysis and the experimental evaluations show that our method has good computation efficiency with high accuracy .
