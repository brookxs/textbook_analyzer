incorporating robustness into web-ranking evaluation in many web-search-engines , a ranking-function is selected for deployment mainly by comparing the relevance measurements over candidates . due to the dynamical nature of the-web , the ranking-features and the query and url distribution on which the ranking-functions are built , may change dramatically over time . the actual relevance of the function may degrade , and thus the previous function selection conclusions become invalid . in this work we suggest to select web-ranking functions according to both their relevance and robustness to the changes that may lead to relevance degradation over time . we argue that the ranking-robustness can be effectively measured by taking into account the ranking score-distribution across search-results . we then propose two alternatives to the ndcg metric that both incorporate ranking-robustness into ranking-function evaluation and selection . a machine-learning-approach is developed to learn the parameters that control the metric sensitivity to score turbulence , from human-judged preference data .
