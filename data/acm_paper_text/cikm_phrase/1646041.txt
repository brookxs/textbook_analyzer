navigational path privacy-protection : navigational path privacy-protection navigational path query , one of the most popular location-based-services (lbss) , determines a route from a source to a destination on a road-network . however , issuing path queries to some non-trustworthy service-providers may pose privacy threats to the users . for instance , given a query requesting for a path from a residential address to a psychiatrist , some adversaries may deduce `` who is related to what disease '' . in this paper , we present an obfuscator framework that reduces the likelihood of path queries being revealed , while supporting different user-privacy protection needs and retaining query-evaluation efficiency . the framework consists of two major components , namely , an obfuscator and an obfuscated path-query processor . the former formulates obfuscated path queries by intermixing true and fake sources and destinations and the latter facilitates efficient evaluation of the obfuscated path queries in an lbs server . the framework supports three types of obfuscated path queries , namely , independent obfuscated path-query , shared obfuscated path-query , and anti-collusion obfuscated path-query . our proposal strikes a balance between privacy-protection strength and query-processing overheads , while enhancing privacy-protection against collusion attacks . finally , we validate the proposed ideas and evaluate the performance of our framework based on an extensive set of empirical experiments .
