similarity-measures for tracking information-flow text-similarity spans a spectrum , with broad topical-similarity near one extreme and document identity at the other . intermediate levels of similarity -- resulting from summarization , paraphrasing , copying , and stronger forms of topical-relevance -- are useful for applications such as information-flow-analysis and question-answering-tasks . in this paper , we explore mechanisms for measuring such intermediate kinds of similarity , focusing on the task of identifying where a particular piece of information originated . we consider both sentence-to-sentence and document-to-document comparison , and have incorporated these algorithms into <small> recap </small> , a prototype information-flow-analysis tool . our experimental-results with <small> recap </small> indicate that new mechanisms such as those we propose are likely to be more appropriate than existing methods for identifying the intermediate forms of similarity .
