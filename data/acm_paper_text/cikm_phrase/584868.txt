information-retrieval on the-semantic-web we describe an approach to retrieval of documents that contain of both free-text and semantically enriched markup . in particular , we present the design and implementation prototype of a framework in which both documents and queries can be marked up with statements in the daml+oil semantic-web language . these statements provide both structured and semi-structured-information about the documents and their content . we claim that indexing text and semantic-markup together will significantly improve retrieval-performance . our approach allows inferencing to be done over this information at several points : when a document is indexed , when a query is processed and when query results are evaluated .
