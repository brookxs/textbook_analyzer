studying how the past is remembered : towards computational-history through large-scale text-mining history helps us understand the present and even to predict the-future to certain extent . given the huge amount of data about the past , we believe computer-science will play an increasingly important role in historical-studies , with computational-history becoming an emerging interdisciplinary field of research . we attempt to study how the past is remembered through large-scale text-mining . we achieve this by first collecting a large dataset of news-articles about different countries and analyzing the data using computational and statistical tools . we show that analysis of references to the past in news-articles allows us to gain a lot of insight into the collective-memories and societal views of different countries . our work demonstrates how various computational tools can assist us in studying history by revealing interesting topics and hidden correlations . our ultimate objective is to enhance history writing and evaluation with the help of algorithmic support .
