indexing field-values in field-oriented-systems : interval quadtree with the extension of spatial-database applications , field-oriented-systems emerge as an important research issue in order to deal with continuous natural-phenomena during the last years . it however has a large volume of data and efficient indexing-methods for field-data are necessary to overcome the performance obstacle . in special , we introduce indexing-methods for field value queries (i.e. searching some regions where the temperature is more 20 degrees) . we introduce the concept of subfield and show how we make use of this concept to index field-values in field-oriented-systems . we present two implementation-methods based on quadtree space subdivision . we modify traditional linear quadtree implementation-method for field value query-processing using subfields . we analyze the performance of our methods . experimentation with real terrain data shows that proposed indexing-methods improve the query-processing time of field value queries in comparison with the case of no indexing-method .
