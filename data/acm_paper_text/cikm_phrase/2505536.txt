the logical diversity of explanations in owl ontologies given the high expressivity of the-web ontology-language owl 2 , there is a potential for great diversity in the logical content of owl ontologies . the fact that many naturally occurring entailments of such ontologies have multiple justifications indicates that ontologies often overdetermine their consequences , suggesting a diversity in supporting reasons . on closer inspection , however , we often find that justifications -- even for multiple entailments -- appear to be structurally similar , suggesting that their multiplicity might be due to diverse material , not formal grounds for an entailment . in this paper , we introduce and explore several equivalence-relations over justifications for entailments of owl ontologies which partition a set of justifications into structurally similar subsets . these equivalence-relations range from strict isomorphism to looser notions of similarity , covering justifications which contain different class expressions , or even different numbers of axioms . we present the results of a survey of 78 ontologies from the biomedical-domain which shows that owl ontologies used in practice often contain large numbers of structurally similar justifications . we find that a large justification corpus can be reduced by 97 % of its original size to a small core of frequently occurring justification templates .
