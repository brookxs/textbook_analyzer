query-result-ranking over e-commerce web-databases to deal with the problem of too many results returned from an e-commerce web-database in response to a user-query , this paper proposes a novel approach to rank the query results . based on the user-query , we speculate how much the user cares about each attribute and assign a corresponding weight to it . then , for each tuple in the query result , each attribute-value is assigned a score according to its `` desirableness '' to the user . these attribute-value scores are combined according to the attribute weights to get a final ranking score for each tuple . tuples with the top ranking scores are presented to the user first . our ranking-method is domain-independent and requires no user-feedback . experimental-results demonstrate that this ranking-method can effectively capture a user 's preferences .
