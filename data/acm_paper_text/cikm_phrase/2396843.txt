document-topic hierarchies from document graphs topic taxonomies present a multi-level view of a document-collection , where general topics live towards the top of the taxonomy and more specific topics live towards the bottom . topic taxonomies allow users to quickly drill down into their topic of interest to find documents . we show that hierarchies of documents , where documents live at the inner nodes of the hierarchy-tree can also be inferred by combining document-text with inter-document links . we present a bayesian generative-model by which an explicit hierarchy of documents is created . experiments on three document-graph data-sets shows that the generated document hierarchies are able to fit the observed data , and that the levels in the constructed document-hierarchy represent practical groupings .
