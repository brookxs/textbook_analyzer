demonstrating intelligent-crawling and archiving of web-applications we demonstrate here a new approach to web-archival crawling , based on an application-aware helper that drives crawls of web-applications according to their types (especially , according to their content-management-systems) . by adapting the crawling strategy to the-web application type , one is able to crawl a given web-application (say , a given forum or blog) with fewer requests than traditional crawling techniques . additionally , the application-aware helper is able to extract semantic content from the-web pages crawled , which results in a web-archive of richer value to an archive user . in our demonstration scenario , we invite a user to compare application-aware crawling to regular web-crawling on the web-site of their choice , both in terms of efficiency and of experience in browsing and searching the archive .
