twevent : segment-based event-detection from tweets event-detection from tweets is an important task to understand the current events/topics attracting a large number of common users . however , the unique characteristics of tweets (e.g. short and noisy content , diverse and fast changing topics , and large-data volume) make event-detection a challenging task . most existing techniques proposed for well written documents (e.g. news-articles) can not be directly adopted . in this paper , we propose a segment-based event-detection system for tweets , called twevent . twevent first detects bursty tweet segments as event segments and then clusters the event segments into events considering both their frequency-distribution and content-similarity . more specifically , each tweet is split into non-overlapping segments (i.e. phrases possibly refer to named-entities or semantically meaningful information units) . the bursty segments are identified within a fixed time-window based on their frequency patterns , and each bursty segment is described by the set of tweets containing the segment published within that time-window . the similarity between a pair of bursty segments is computed using their associated tweets . after clustering bursty segments into candidate events , wikipedia is exploited to identify the realistic events and to derive the most newsworthy segments to describe the identified events . we evaluate twevent and compare it with the state-of-the-art method using 4.3 million tweets published by singapore-based users in june 2010 . in our experiments , twevent outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large-margin in terms of both precision-and-recall . more importantly , the events detected by twevent can be easily interpreted with little background-knowledge because of the newsworthy segments . we also show that twevent is efficient and scalable , leading to a desirable solution for event-detection from tweets .
