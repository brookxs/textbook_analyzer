search-result-presentation based on faceted clustering we propose a competence partitioning strategy for web-search result-presentation : the unmodified head of a ranked result list is combined with a clustering of documents from the result list tail . we identify two principles to which such a clustering must adhere to improve the user 's search experience : (1) avoid the unwanted effect of query aspect repetition , which is called shadowing here . (2) avoid extreme clusterings , i.e. , neither the number of cluster-labels nor the number of documents per cluster should exceed the size of the result list head . we present measures to quantify the shadowing effect , and with faceted clustering we introduce an algorithm that optimizes the identified principles . the key idea of faceted clustering is a dynamic , user-controlled reorganization of a clustering , similar to a faceted-navigation system . we report on evaluations using the ambient corpus and demonstrate the potential of our approach by a comparison with two well-known clustering search-engines .
