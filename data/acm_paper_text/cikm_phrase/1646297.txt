multidimensional political-spectrum identification and analysis in this work , we show the importance of multidimensional opinion representation in the political context combining domain-knowledge and results from principal-component-analysis . we discuss the differences of feature-selection between political-spectrum analysis and normal opinion-mining tasks . we build regression-models on each opinion dimension for scoring and placing new opinion entities , e.g. personal blogs or politicians , onto the political opinion spectrum . we apply our methods on the floor statement records of the united-states senate and evaluate it against the uni-dimensional representation of political opinion space . the experimental-results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in explaining the voting records of the senate .
