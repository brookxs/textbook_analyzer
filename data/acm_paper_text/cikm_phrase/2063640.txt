location-aware click-prediction in mobile-local-search users increasingly rely on their mobile-devices to search , locate and discover places and activities around them while on the go . their decision-process is driven by the information displayed on their devices and their current context (e.g. traffic , driving or walking etc.) . even though recent research efforts have already examined and demonstrated how different context parameters such as weather , time and personal-preferences affect the way mobile-users click on local businesses , little has been done to study how the location of the user affects the click-behavior . in this paper we follow a data-driven methodology where we analyze approximately 2 million local-search queries submitted by users across the us , to visualize and quantify how differently mobile-users click across locations . based on the data-analysis , we propose new location-aware features for improving local-search click-prediction and quantify their performance on real user-query traces . motivated by the results , we implement and evaluate a data-driven technique where local-search models at different levels of location granularity (e.g. city , state , and country levels) are combined together at run-time to further improve click-prediction accuracy . by applying the location-aware features and the multiple models at different levels of location granularity on real user-query streams from a major , commercially available search-engine , we achieve anywhere from 5 \ % to 47 \ % higher precision than a single click-prediction model across the us can achieve .
