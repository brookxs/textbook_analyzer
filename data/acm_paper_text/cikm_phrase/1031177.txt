extending and inferring functional-dependencies in schema-transformation we study the representation , derivation and utilization of a special kind of constraints in multidatabase-systems . a major challenge is when component database schemas are <i> schematic discrepant </i> from each other , i.e. , data-values of one database correspond to schema labels of another . we propose `` qualified functional-dependencies '' (or qualified fds) , an extension to conventional fds to formalize integrity-constraints in multidatabase-systems . we first give inference-rules to derive qualified fds in fixed schemas , then study the derivation of qualified fds during the transformations between schematic discrepant schemas . propagation rules are given to derive qualified fds of transformed schemas from qualified fds of original schemas . our work can be used in different stages of building and accessing a multidatabase-system , e.g. , to detect and resolve value inconsistency in schema-integration , to verify lossless schema transformations , to normalize integrated schemas , to verify the integrity of data , and to optimize queries at an integration level . in particular , as an application of our theory , we will use fds to check the validity of schemasql views (schemasql is a powerful multidatabase language) .
