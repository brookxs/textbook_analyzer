adaptive geospatially focused-crawling location-information on the web is a precious asset for a multitude of applications and is becoming an increasingly important dimension in web-search . even though more and more web-pages carry location-information , they form only a small share of all pages and are scattered over the-web . to efficiently find and index location-related web-content , we propose an efficient crawling strategy that retrieves precisely those pages that are geospatially relevant while minimizing the amount of the non-spatially-relevant pages within the crawled pages . we propose to address this challenge by expanding the technique of focused-crawling to exploit location references on web-pages to specifically retrieve geospatial topics on the-web . in this paper , we describe the design and development of a focused-crawler with an adaptive geospatial focus that efficiently retrieves and identifies location-relevant documents on the web . drawing from geospatial features of both web-pages and the link-graph , a crawl strategy based on bayesian-classifiers prioritizes promising links and pages , leading to a faster coverage of the desired geospatial topic as a means for fast creation of precise geospatial-web indexes . we present evaluations of the system 's performance and share our findings on the geospatial-web graph and the distribution of location references on the web .
