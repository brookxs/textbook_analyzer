managing ifc for civil-engineering projects the `` industrial foundation classes '' (ifc) are an iso norm to define all components of a building in a civil-engineering project . ifc files are textual files whose size can reach 100 megabytes . several ifc files can coexist on the same civil-engineering project . due to their size , their handling and sharing is a complex task . in this paper , we present an approach to automatically identify business-objects in the ifc files and simplify their visualization and manipulation on the internet . we construct an ifc viewer which transforms the ifc file into a xml ifc tree manipulated through the 3d-visualization of the building . the ifc viewer composed a web-based platform called active3d build server . this platform lets geographically dispersed project participants-from architects to electricians-directly use and exchange project documents in a centralized virtual-environment during the life-cycle of a civil-engineering project .
