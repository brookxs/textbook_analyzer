towards automatic association of relevant unstructured content with structured-query results faced with growing knowledge-management needs , enterprises are increasingly realizing the importance of seamlessly integrating critical business information distributed across both structured and unstructured-data sources . in existing information-integration solutions , the application needs to formulate the sql logic to retrieve the needed structured-data on one hand , and identify a set of keywords to retrieve the related unstructured-data on the other . this paper proposes a novel approach wherein the application specifies its information needs using only a sql-query on the structured-data , and this query is automatically `` translated '' into a set of keywords that can be used to retrieve relevant unstructured-data . we describe the techniques used for obtaining these keywords from (i) the query result , and (ii) additional related information in the underlying database . we further show that these techniques achieve high accuracy with very reasonable overheads .
