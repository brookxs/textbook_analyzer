an algorithm for axiom pinpointing in el + and its incremental variant axiom pinpointing plays an important role in the development and maintenance of ontologies . it helps the user to comprehend an unwanted entailment of an ontology by presenting all minimal subsets of the ontology which are responsible for the entailment (called minas) . in this paper , we consider the problem of axiom pinpointing in description-logic el + , which underpins owl 2 el , a profile of the latest version of web-ontology-language (owl) . we propose a novel method to compute all minas that utilizes the hierarchy information obtained from the classification of an el + ontology . the advantage of our method over an existing labeled classification_based method is that we do not attach labels to entailed subsumptions , which can be memory exhaustion for large-scale ontologies . we further consider axiom pinpointing in el + when ontologies change . an incremental-algorithm is given to compute all minas by reusing minas previously computed .
