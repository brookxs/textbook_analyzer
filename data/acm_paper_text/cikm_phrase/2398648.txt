hierarchical target type-identification for entity-oriented queries a significant portion of information-needs in web-search target entities . these may come in different forms or flavours , ranging from short keyword-queries to more verbose requests , expressed in natural-language . we address the task of automatically annotating queries with target types from an ontology . the identified types can subsequently be used , e.g. , for creating semantically more informed query-and-retrieval models , filtering results , or directing the requests to specific verticals . our study makes the following contributions . first , we formalise the task of hierarchical target type-identification , argue that it is best viewed as a ranking problem , and propose multiple evaluation-metrics . second , we develop a purpose-built test-collection by hand-annotating over 300 queries , from various recent entity-search benchmarking campaigns , with target types from the dbpedia ontology . finally , we introduce and examine two baseline models , inspired by federated-search techniques . we show that these methods perform surprisingly well when target types are limited to a flat list of top level categories ; finding the right level of granularity in the hierarchy , however , is particularly challenging and requires further investigation .
