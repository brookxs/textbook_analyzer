efficient similarity-search : arbitrary similarity measures , arbitrary composition given a (large) set of objects and a query , similarity-search aims to find all objects similar to the query . a frequent approach is to define a set of base similarity-measures for the different aspects of the objects , and to build light-weight similarity-indexes on these measures . to determine the overall similarity of two objects , the results of these base measures are composed , e.g. , using simple aggregates or more involved machine-learning-techniques . we propose the first solution to this search-problem that does not place any restrictions on the similarity-measures , the composition technique , or the data-set size . we define the query-plan optimization-problem to determine the best query-plan using the similarity-indexes . a query-plan must choose which individual indexes to access and which thresholds to apply . the plan result should be as complete as possible within some cost threshold . we propose the approximative top neighborhood algorithm , which determines a near-optimal plan while significantly reducing the amount of candidate plans to be considered . an exact version of the algorithm determines the optimal-solution . evaluation on real-world-data indicates that both versions clearly outperform a complete-search of the query-plan space .
