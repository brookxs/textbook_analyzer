collaborative exploratory-search in real-world-context we propose collaborative exploratory-search (ces) , which is an integration of dialog-analysis and web-search that involves multiparty collaboration to accomplish an exploratory information retrieval goal . given a real-time dialog between users on a single topic ; we define ces as the task of automatically detecting the topic of the dialog and retrieving task-relevant web-pages to support the dialog . to recognize the task of the dialog , we apply the author -- topic-model as a topic-model . then , attribute-extraction is applied to the dialog to obtain the attributes of the tasks . finally , a specific search-query is generated to identify the task-relevant information . we implement and evaluate the ces system for a commercial in-vehicle conversation . we also develop an ipad application that listens to conversations among users and continuously retrieves relevant-web pages . our experimental-results reveal that the proposed method outperforms existing methods , which demonstrates the potential usefulness of collaborative exploratory-search with practically usable accuracy levels .
