efficient range-constrained similarity-search on wavelet-synopses over multiple-streams due to the resource limitation in the data-stream environment , it has been reported that answering user queries according to the wavelet synopsis of a stream is an essential ability of a data-stream-management-system (dsms) . in this paper , motivated by the fact that a user may be interested in an arbitrary range of the data-streams , we investigate two important types of range-constrained queries in time-series streaming environments : the distance queries (which aim at obtaining the euclidean-distance between two streams) and the k nn queries (which aim at discovering k-nearest-neighbors to a reference stream) . to achieve high efficiency in processing these two types of queries , we propose procedure red (standing for range-constrained euclidean-distance) and algorithm eks (standing for enhanced k nn search) . compared to the existing methods in the prior research , the advantageous features of our approaches are in two folds . first , our approaches are capable of processing the queries directly from the wavelet-synopses retained in the main-memory without using idwt to reconstruct the data cells . this feature allows us to save the complexity in both memory and time . moreover , our approaches enable the users to query the dsms within their range of interest . unlike the conventional methods which only support the full-range query-processing , this feature will enhance the flexibility at the client side . we evaluate procedure red and algorithm eks on live and synthetic datasets empirically and show that the proposed approaches are efficient in similarity-search and k nn discovery within arbitrary ranges in the time-series streaming environments .
