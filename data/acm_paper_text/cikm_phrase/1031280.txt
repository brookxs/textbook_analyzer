teg : a hybrid-approach to information-extraction this paper describes a hybrid statistical and knowledge-based-information extraction model , able to extract entities and relations at the sentence-level . the model attempts to retain and improve the high accuracy levels of knowledge-based-systems while drastically reducing the amount of manual labor by relying on statistics drawn from a training-corpus . the implementation of the model , called teg (trainable extraction grammar) , can be adapted to any ie domain by writing a suitable set of rules in a scfg (stochastic context free grammar) based extraction language , and training them using an annotated-corpus . the system does not contain any purely linguistic components , such as pos-tagger or parser . we demonstrate the performance of the system on several named-entity-extraction and relation-extraction tasks . the experiments show that our hybrid-approach outperforms both purely statistical and purely knowledge-based-systems , while requiring orders of magnitude less manual rule writing and smaller amount of training-data . the improvement in accuracy is slight for named-entity-extraction task and more pronounced for relation-extraction .
