assigning documents to master sites in distributed-search an appealing solution to scale web-search with the growth of the-internet is the use of distributed-architectures . distributed-search-engines rely on multiple sites deployed in distant regions across the world , where each site is specialized to serve queries issued by the users of its region . this paper investigates the problem of assigning each document to a master site . we show that by leveraging similarities between a document and the activity of the users , we can accurately detect which site is the most relevant to place a document . we conduct various experiments using two document-assignment approaches , showing performance-improvements of up to 20.8 \ % over a baseline technique which assigns the documents to search sites based on their language .
