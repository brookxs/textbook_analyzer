in the development of a spanish metamap metamap is an online application that allows mapping text to umls metathesaurus concepts , which is very useful interoperability among different languages and systems within the biomedical-domain . metamap transfer (mmtx) is a java-program that makes metamap available to biomedical-researchers . currently there is no spanish version of metamap , which difficults the use of umls metathesaurus to extract concepts from spanish biomedical texts . our ongoing research is mainly focused on using biomedical concepts for cross-lingual text classification and retrieval [3] . in this context the use of concepts instead of bag-of-words representation allows us to face text-classification tasks abstracting from the language [4] . in this paper we evaluate the possibility of combining automatic-translation techniques with the use of biomedical-ontologies to produce an english-text that can be processed by mmtx .
