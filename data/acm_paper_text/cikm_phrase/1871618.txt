print : a provenance model to support integration-processes in some integration applications , users are allowed to import data from heterogeneous-sources , but are not allowed to update source data directly . imported data may be inconsistent , and even when inconsistencies are detected and solved , these changes may not be propagated to the sources due to their update policies . therefore , they continue to provide the same inconsistent-data in the future until the proper authority updates them . in this paper , we propose print , a model that supports user 's decisions on cleaning data to be automatically reapplied in subsequent integration-processes . by reproducing previous decisions , the user may focus only on new inconsistencies originated from source modified data . the reproducibility provided by print is based on logging , and by incorporating data-provenance in the integration process .
