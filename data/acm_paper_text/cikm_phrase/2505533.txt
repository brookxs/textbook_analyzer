community-based user-recommendation in uni-directional social-networks advances in web-2.0 technology has led to the rising popularity of many social-network-services . for example , there are over 500 million active users in twitter . given the huge number-of-users , user-recommendation has gained importance where the goal is to find a set of users whom a target user is likely to follow . content-based approaches that rely on tweet content for user-recommendation have low precision as tweet contents are typically short and noisy , while collaborative-filtering approaches that utilize follower-followee relationships lead to higher precision but data-sparsity remains a challenge . in this work , we propose a community-based approach to user-recommendation in twitter-style social-networks . forming communities enables us to reduce data-sparsity as the focus is on discover the latent characteristics of communities instead of individuals . we employ an lda-based method on the follower-followee relationships to discover communities before applying the state-of-the-art matrix-factorization method on each of the communities . this approach proves effective in improving the conversion-rate (by as much as 20 %) as demonstrated by the results of extensive experiments on two real-world data-sets twitter and weibo . in addition , the community-based approach is scalable as the individual community can be analyzed separately .
