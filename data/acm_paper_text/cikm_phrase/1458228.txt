an effective algorithm for mining 3-clusters in vertically partitioned data conventional clustering-algorithms group similar data points together along one dimension of a data-table . bi-clustering simultaneously clusters both dimensions of a data-table . 3-clustering goes one step further and aims to concurrently cluster two data-tables that share a common set of row labels , but whose column labels are distinct . such clusters reveal the underlying connections between the elements of all three sets . we present a novel algorithm that discovers 3-clusters across vertically partitioned data . our approach presents two new and important formulations : first we introduce the notion of a 3-cluster in partitioned data ; and second we present a mathematical-formulation that measures the quality of such clusters . our algorithm discovers high quality , arbitrarily positioned , overlapping-clusters , and is efficient in time . these results are exhibited in a comprehensive study on real datasets .
