xreal : an interactive xml keyword searching keyword-search over xml-data usually brings irrelevant results especially when the keywords in a user-query have ambiguities . we demonstrate a statistic-based approach to identify the search targets and-constraints of a user-query in the presence of keyword ambiguities , and come out a relevance oriented result-ranking scheme called xml tf * idf . since the search-intention of a same query may even vary from user to user , we provide an interactive-search strategy by allowing user to simply tick their desired search targets from a list of suggestions recommended by the search-engine . in this way , we can acquire more precise results and also take the burden of learning the schema of xml-data off users .
