gpu-acceleration of probabilistic frequent itemset-mining from uncertain-databases uncertain-databases have been widely developed to deal with the vast amount of data that contain uncertainty . to extract valuable information from the uncertain-databases , several methods of frequent-itemset-mining , one of the major data-mining-techniques , have been proposed . however , their performance is not satisfactory because handling uncertainty incurs high processing costs . in order to address this problem , we utilize gpgpu (general-purpose computation on gpu) . gpgpu implies using a gpu (graphics-processing-unit) , which is originally designed for processing graphics , to accelerate general purpose computation . in this paper , we propose a method of frequent-itemset-mining from uncertain-databases using gpgpu . the main idea is to speed up probability computations by making the best use of gpu 's high parallelism and low-latency memory . we also employ an algorithm to manipulate a bitstring and data-parallel primitives to improve performance in the other parts of the method . extensive experiments show that our proposed method is up to two orders of magnitude faster than existing methods .
