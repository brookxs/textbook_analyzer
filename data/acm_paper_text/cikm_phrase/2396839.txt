matching product titles using web-based enrichment matching product titles from different data-feeds that refer to the same underlying product entity is a key problem in online-shopping . this matching problem is challenging because titles across the feeds have diverse representations with some missing important keywords like brand and others containing extraneous keywords related to product specifications . in this paper , we propose a novel unsupervised matching-algorithm that leverages web earch engines to (1) enrich product titles by adding important missing tokens that occur frequently in search-results , and (2) compute importance scores for tokens based on their ability to retrieve other (enriched title) tokens in search-results . our matching scheme calculates the cosine-similarity between enriched title pairs with tokens weighted by their importance scores . we propose an optimization that exploits the templatized structure of product titles to reduce the number of search queries . in experiments with real-life shopping datasets , we found that our matching-algorithm has superior f1 scores compared to idf-based cosine-similarity .
