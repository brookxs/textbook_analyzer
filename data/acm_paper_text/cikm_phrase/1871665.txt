selecting keywords for content-based-recommendation the continued growth of online-content makes personalized-recommendation an increasingly important tool for media-consumption . while collaborative-filtering techniques have shown to be very successful in stable collections , content-based approaches are necessary for recommending new items . content-based-recommendation uses the similarity between new items and consumed items to predict whether a new item is interesting for the user . the similarity is computed by comparing the content or the meta-data of the items . in this paper we consider recommendation of tv-broadcasts for which meta-data and synopses are available . we thereby concentrate on the new-item-problem . we investigate the value of different types of meta-data provided by the broadcaster or extracted from synopsis . we show that extracted keywords are better suited for recommendation than manually assigned keywords . furthermore we show that the number of keywords used is of great importance . using a rather small number of keywords to present an item yields the best results for recommendation .
