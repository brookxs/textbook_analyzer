clost : a hadoop-based storage-system for big spatio-temporal-data analytics during the past decade , various gps-equipped devices have generated a tremendous amount of data with time and location-information , which we refer to as big spatio-temporal-data . in this paper , we present the design and implementation of clost , a scalable big spatio-temporal-data storage-system to support data-analytics using hadoop . the main objective of clost is to avoid scan the whole dataset when a spatio-temporal range is given . to this end , we propose a novel data model which has special treatments on three core attributes including an object id , a location and a time . based on this data-model , clost hierarchically partitions data using all core attributes which enables efficient parallel-processing of spatio-temporal range-scans . according to the data-characteristics , we devise a compact-storage structure which reduces the storage size by an order of magnitude . in addition , we proposes scalable bulk-loading algorithms capable of incrementally adding new data into the system . we conduct our experiments using a very-large gps log dataset and the results show that clost has fast data loading speed , desirable scalability in query-processing , as well as high data compression-ratio .
