statistical-information-retrieval modelling : from the-probability-ranking-principle to recent advances in diversity , portfolio-theory , and beyond statistical-modelling of information-retrieval (ir) systems is a key driving force in the development of the ir field . the goal of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to statistical ir modelling . we take a fresh and systematic perspective from the viewpoint of portfolio-theory of ir and risk-management . a unified treatment and new insights will be given to reflect the recent developments of considering the ranked-retrieval results as a whole . recent research progress in diversification , risk-management , and portfolio-theory will be covered , in addition to classic methods such as maron and kuhns ' probabilistic indexing , robertson-sparck jones model (and the resulting bm25 formula) and language-modelling approaches . the tutorial also reviews the resulting practical algorithms of risk-aware query-expansion , diverse ranking , ir metric-optimization as well as their performance-evaluations . practical ir applications such as web-search , multimedia-retrieval , and collaborative-filtering are also introduced , as well as discussion of new-opportunities for future-research and applications that intersect among information-retrieval , knowledge-management , and databases .
