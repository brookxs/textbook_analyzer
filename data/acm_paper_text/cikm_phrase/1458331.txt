semi-supervised metric-learning by maximizing constraint-margin distance-metric-learning is an old problem that has been researched in the supervised-learning field for a very long time . in this paper , we consider the problem of learning a proper distance-metric under the guidance of some weak supervisory information . specifically , those information are in the form of pairwise-constraints which specify whether a pair of data points are in the same class (must link constraints) or in the different classes (can not link constraints) . given those constraints , our algorithm aims to learn a distance-metric under which the points with must link constraints are pushed as close as possible , while simultaneously the points with can not link constraints are pulled away as far as possible . finally the experimental-results are presented to show the effectiveness of our method .
