parallelizing the buckshot algorithm for efficient document-clustering we present a parallel-implementation of the buckshot document-clustering algorithm . we demonstrate that this parallel approach is highly efficient both in terms of load-balancing and minimization of communication . in a series of experiments using the 2gb of sgml data from trec disks 4 and 5 , our parallel approach was shown to be scalable in terms of processors efficiently used and the number of clusters created .
