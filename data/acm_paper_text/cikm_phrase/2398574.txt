fast top-k similarity-queries via matrix-compression in this paper , we propose a novel method to efficiently compute the top-k most similar items given a query item , where similarity is defined by the set of items that have the highest vector inner products with the query . the task is related to the classical k-nearest-neighbor problem , and is widely applicable in a number of domains such as information-retrieval , online-advertising and collaborative-filtering . our method assumes an in-memory representation of the dataset and is designed to scale to query lengths of 100,000 s of terms . our algorithm uses a generalized holder 's inequality to upper-bound the inner-product with the norms of the constituent vectors . we also propose a novel compression scheme that computes bounds for groups of candidate items , thereby speeding up computation and minimizing memory-requirements per query . we conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available wikipedia dataset , and demonstrate that , with a memory overhead of 21 % , our method can provide 1-3 orders of magnitude improvement in query run-time compared to naive methods and state-of-the-art competing methods . our median top-10 word query time is 25 us on 7.5 million words and 2.3 million documents .
