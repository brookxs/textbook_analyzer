a co-training_based method for chinese patent semantic-annotation patents are public and scientific literatures protected by the law , and their abstracts highly contained valuable information . patent 's semantic-annotation can effectively protect intellectual-property-rights and promote corporations ' scientific-research innovation . currently , automatic patent annotation mainly used supervised-machine-learning algorithms , which required abundant expensive labeled patent data . due to lack of enough labeled chinese patent data , this paper adopted a semi-supervised-machine-learning method named co-training , which started from a little labeled-data . this method combined keyword-extraction with list-extraction , and incrementally annotated functional clauses in patent abstract . experiment results indicated this method can gradually improve the recall without sacrificing the precision .
