information-extraction as a filtering task information-extraction is usually approached as an annotation-task : input texts run through several analysis steps of an extraction-process in which different semantic-concepts are annotated and matched against the slots of templates . we argue that such an approach lacks an efficient control of the input of the analysis steps . in this paper , we hence propose and evaluate a model and a formal-approach that consistently put the filtering view in the focus : before spending annotation-effort , filter those portions of the input texts that may contain relevant-information for filling a template and discard the others . we model all dependencies between the semantic concepts sought for with a truth-maintenance-system , which then efficiently infers the portions of text to be annotated in each analysis step . the filtering view enables an information-extraction-system (1) to annotate only relevant portions of input texts and (2) to easily trade its run-time-efficiency for its recall . we provide our approach as an open-source extension of apache uima and we show the potential of our approach in a number of experiments .
