generating sql/xml query and update statements the xml support in relational-databases and the sql/xml language are still relatively new as compared to purely relational-databases and traditional sql . today , most database users have a strong relational and sql background . sql/xml enables users to perform queries and updates across xml and relational data , but many struggle with writing sql/xml statements or xquery update expressions . one reason is the novelty of sql/xml and of the xquery expressions that must be included . another problem is that the tree structure of the xml-data may be unknown or difficult to understand for the user . evolving xml-schemas as well as hybrid xml/relational schemas make it even harder to write sql/xml statements . also , legacy-applications use sql but may require access to xml-data without costly code changes . motivated by these challenges , we developed a method to generate sql/xml query and update statements automatically . the input is either a gui or a regular sql statement that uses logical data item names irrespective of their actual location in relational or xml columns in the database . the output is a sql/xml statement that queries or updates relational and xml-data as needed to carry out the original user statement . this relieves the user and simplifies schema-evolution and integration . we have prototyped and tested the proposed method on top of db2 9.5 .
