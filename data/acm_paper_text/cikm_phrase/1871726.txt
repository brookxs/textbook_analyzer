comparison of six aggregation strategies to compute users ' trustworthiness the decision to grant trust in virtual societies is often an evidence_based process . the evidence for such decision derives from a diverse set , where mutual relationships and contradictions might occur . this paper compares and evaluates six aggregation strategies to compute users ' trustworthiness . our evaluation performed over a large online-community , shows how a rule-based strategy based on an argumentation semantic outperforms strategies where mutual relationships among evidence are ignored .
