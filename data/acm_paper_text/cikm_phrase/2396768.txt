dqr : a probabilistic-approach to diversified query-recommendation web-search-queries issued by casual users are often short and with limited expressiveness . query-recommendation is a popular technique employed by search-engines to help users refine their queries . traditional similarity-based methods , however , often result in redundant and monotonic recommendations . we identify five basic requirements of a query-recommendation system . in particular , we focus on the requirements of redundancy-free and diversified recommendations . we propose the dqr framework , which mines a search-log to achieve two goals : (1) it clusters search-log queries to extract query concepts , based on which recommended queries are selected . (2) it employs a probabilistic-model and a greedy-heuristic algorithm to achieve recommendation diversification . through a comprehensive user-study we compare dqr against five other recommendation-methods . our experiment shows that dqr outperforms the other methods in terms of relevancy , diversity , and ranking-performance of the recommendations .
