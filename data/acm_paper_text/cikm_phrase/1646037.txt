probabilistic-skyline queries the ability to deal with uncertain-information is becoming increasingly important for modern database-applications . whereas a conventional (certain) object is usually represented by a vector from a multidimensional feature-space , an uncertain object is represented by a multivariate probability density-function (pdf) . this pdf can be defined either discretely (e.g. by a histogram) or continuously in parametric form (e.g. by a gaussian-mixture-model) . for a database of uncertain objects , the users expect similar data-analysis techniques as for a conventional database of certain objects . an important analysis-technique for certain objects is the skyline-operator which finds maximal or minimal vectors with respect to any possible attribute weighting . in this paper , we propose the concept of probabilistic skylines , an extension of the skyline-operator for uncertain objects . in addition , we propose efficient and effective methods for determining the probabilistic-skyline of uncertain objects which are defined by a pdf in parametric form (e.g. a gaussian-function or a gaussian-mixture-model) . to further accelerate the search , we elaborate how the computation of the probabilistic-skyline can be supported by an index-structure for uncertain objects . an extensive experimental-evaluation demonstrates both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our technique .
