learning to aggregate vertical results into web-search-results aggregated-search is the task of integrating results from potentially multiple specialized-search services , or verticals , into the-web search-results . the task requires predicting not only which verticals to present (the focus of most prior research) , but also predicting where in the web results to present them (i.e. , above or below the-web results , or somewhere in between) . learning-models to aggregate results from multiple verticals is associated with two major challenges . first , because verticals retrieve different types of results and address different search-tasks , results from different verticals are associated with different types of predictive evidence (or features) . second , even when a feature is common across verticals , its predictiveness may be vertical-specific . therefore , approaches to aggregating vertical results require handling an inconsistent feature-representation across verticals , and , potentially , a vertical-specific relationship between features and relevance . we present 3 general approaches that address these challenges in different ways and compare their results across a set of 13 verticals and 1070 queries . we show that the best approaches are those that allow the learning-algorithm to learn a vertical-specific relationship between features and relevance .
