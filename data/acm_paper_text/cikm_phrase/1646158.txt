inverted-indexes vs. bitmap-indexes in decision-support-systems bitmap-indexes are widely used in decision-support-systems (dsss) to improve query-performance . in this paper , we evaluate the use of compressed inverted-indexes with adapted query-processing strategies from information-retrieval as an alternative . in a thorough experimental-evaluation on both synthetic-data and data from the star-schema benchmark , we show that inverted-indexes are more compact than bitmap-indexes in almost all cases . this compactness combined with efficient-query-processing strategies results in inverted-indexes outperforming bitmap-indexes for most queries , often significantly .
