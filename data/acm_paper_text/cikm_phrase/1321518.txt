learning query-biased-web-page-summarization query-biased-web-page-summarization is the summarization of a web-page reflecting the relevance of it to a specific query . it plays an important role in search-results representation of web-search-engines . in this paper , we propose a learning-based query-biased-web-page-summarization method . the summarization-problem is solved within the typical sentence-selection framework . different from existing web-page-summarization methods that use page content or link context alone , both of them are considered as the sources of sentences in this work . most of existing learning-based summarization methods treat summarization as a sentence-classification problem and train a classifier to discriminate between extracted sentences and non-extracted sentences of all training-documents . the basic assumption of these methods is that sentences from different documents are comparable with respect to the class-information . in contrast to the classification-scheme , a ranking-scheme is introduced to rank extracted sentences higher than non-extracted sentences of each training-document . the underlying assumption that sentences within a document are comparable is weaker and more reasonable than the assumption of classification-based scheme . extensive results using intrinsic-evaluation metrics gauge many aspects of the proposed method .
