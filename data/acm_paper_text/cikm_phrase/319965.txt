classification algorithms for netnews articles we propose several algorithms using the vector-space-model to classify the news-articles posted on the netnews according to the newsgroup categories . the baseline method combines the terms of all the articles of each newsgroup in the training-set to represent the newsgroups as single vectors . after training , the incoming news-articles are classified based on their similarity to the existing newsgroup categories . we propose to use the following techniques to improve the classification-performance of the baseline method : (1) use routing (classification) accuracy and the similarity values to refine the training-set ; (2) update the underlying term structures periodically during testing ; and (3) apply k - means clustering to partition the newsgroup articles and represent each newsgroup by k vectors . our test-collection consists of the real news-articles and the 519 subnewsgroups under the rec newsgroup of netnews in a period of 3 months . our experimental-results demonstrate that the technique of refining the training-set reduces from one-third to two-thirds of the storage . the technique of periodical updates improves the routing accuracy ranging from 20 \ % to 100 \ % but incurs runtime overhead . finally , representing each newsgroup by k vectors (with k = 2 or 3) using clustering yields the most significant improvement in routing accuracy , ranging from 60 \ % to 100 \ % , while causing only slightly higher storage requirements .
