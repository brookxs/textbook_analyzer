coupling or decoupling for knn-search on road-networks ? : a hybrid-framework on user-query patterns we explore in this paper a new knn algorithm , called the square algorithm , for searching spatial-objects on road-networks . recent works in the literature discussed the necessity to support object updates for promising location-based-services . among them , the decoupling spatial-search algorithms , which separate the handle of the network traversal and the object lookup , has been recognized as the most effective approach to cut the maintenance overhead from updates . however , the queue-based network traversal needs to be performed from scratch for each knn-query until the knn objects are exactly identified , indicating that the query-complexity is in proportion to the number of visited network-nodes . the query-efficiency is concerned for online lbs applications since they only allow lightweight operations for minimizing the query latency . to improve the query scalability while supporting data updates , square constructs the network index similar to the way used in decoupling models , and meanwhile exploit the coupling idea to maintain the knn information relative to hot regions in the network index . the hot-region denotes the area with frequent-queries discovered in the query-history . inspired from the prevalently observed 80-20 rule , square can maximize the query throughput by returning knn results in the quasi-constant time for 80 \ % queries that are roughly issued within 20 \ % area (hot regions) . as validated in our experimental-results , square outperforms previous works and achieves the significant performance-improvement without sacrifice on the maintenance overhead for object updates .
