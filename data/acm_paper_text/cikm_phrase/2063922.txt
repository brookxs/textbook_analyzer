promotional-subspace-mining with eprobe framework in multidimensional-data , promotional-subspace-mining (psm) aims to find out outstanding subspaces for a given object , and to discover meaningful rules from them . in psm , one major research issue is to produce top-subspaces efficiently given a predefined subspace ranking measure . a common approach is to achieve an exact solution , which searches through the entire subspace search-space and evaluate the target object 's rank in every subspace , assisted with possible pruning strategies . in this paper , we propose eprobe , an efficient subspace probing framework . this novel framework strives to initialize the idea of `` early-stop '' of the top subspace search-process . the essential goal is to provide a scalable , cost-effective , and flexible solution where its accuracy can be traded with the efficiency using adjustable parameters . this framework is especially useful when the computation resources are insufficient and only a limited number of candidate subspaces can be evaluated . as a first attempt to seek solutions under eprobe framework , we propose two novel algorithms sratio and slidingcluster . in our experiments , we illustrate that these two algorithms could produce a more effective subspace traversal order . being effective , the top-k subspaces included in the final results are shown to be evaluated in the early stage of the subspace traversal process .
