personalized social-search based on the user 's social-network this work investigates personalized social-search based on the user 's social-relations -- search-results are re-ranked according to their relations with individuals in the user 's social-network . we study the effectiveness of several social-network types for personalization : (1) familiarity-based network of people related to the user through explicit familiarity connection ; (2) similarity-based network of people `` similar '' to the user as reflected by their social-activity ; (3) overall network that provides both relationship types . for comparison we also experiment with topic-based personalization that is based on the user 's related terms , aggregated from several social-applications . we evaluate the contribution of the different personalization strategies by an off-line study and by a user-survey within our organization . in the off-line study we apply bookmark-based evaluation , suggested recently , that exploits data gathered from a social-bookmarking-system to evaluate personalized-retrieval . in the on-line study we analyze the feedback of 240 employees exposed to the alternative personalization approaches . our main results show that both in the off-line study and in the user-survey social-network_based personalization significantly outperforms non-personalized social-search . additionally , as reflected by the user-survey , all three sn-based strategies significantly outperform the topic-based strategy .
