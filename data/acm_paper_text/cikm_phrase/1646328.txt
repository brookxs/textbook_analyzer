xqgen : an algebra-based xpath query generator for micro-benchmarking we propose xqgen , a stand-alone , algebra-based xpath generator to aid engineers in testing and improving the design of xml-query engines . xqgen takes an xml-schema sketch and user configurations , such as number of queries , query-types , duplication factors , and branching factors as input , and generates a set of queries that comform to the schema and configurations . in addition , given a set of label-paths as workload input , xqgen is capable of generating query sets that honor the workload .
