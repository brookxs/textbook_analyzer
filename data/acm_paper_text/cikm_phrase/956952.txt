exploiting syntactic-structure of queries in a language-modeling-approach to ir natural-language-processing (nlp) techniques have been explored to enhance the performance of information-retrieval (ir) methods with varied results . most efforts in using nlp-techniques have been to identify better index-terms for representing documents . this use in the indexing phase of ir has implicit effect on retrieval-performance . however , the explicit use of nlp-techniques during the retrieval or information-seeking phase has been restricted to interactive or dialogue-systems . recent advances in ir are based on using statistical-language-models (slm) to represent documents and ranking them based on their model generating a given user-query . this paper presents a novel method for using nlp-techniques on user queries , specifically , a syntactic-parse of a query , in the statistical-language-modeling approach to ir . in the proposed method , named concept language-models , a query is viewed as a sequence of concepts and a concept as a sequence terms . the paper presents different approximations to estimate the concept and term probabilities and compute the query likelihood-estimate for documents . some empirical-results on trec test-collections comparing concept language-models with smoothed n-gram language models are presented .
