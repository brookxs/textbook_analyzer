a comprehensive analysis of parameter-settings for novelty-biased cumulative-gain in the trec web diversity track , novelty-biased cumulative-gain (&#945; - ndcg) is one of the official measures to assess retrieval-performance of ir systems . the measure is characterised by a parameter , &#945; , the effect of which has not been thoroughly investigated . we find that common settings of &#945; , i.e. &#945; = 0.5 , may prevent the measure from behaving as desired when evaluating result-diversification . this is because it excessively penalises systems that cover many intents while it rewards those that redundantly cover only few intents . this issue is crucial since it highly influences systems at top ranks . we revisit our previously proposed threshold , suggesting &#945; be set on a query-basis . the intuitiveness of the measure is then studied by examining actual rankings from trec 09-10 web track submissions . by varying &#945; according to our query-based threshold , the discriminative power of &#945; - ndcg is not harmed and in fact , our approach improves &#945; - ndcg 's robustness . experimental-results show that the threshold for &#945; can turn the measure to be more intuitive than using its common settings .
