discovering approximate keys in xml-data keys are very important in many aspects of data-management , such as guiding query-formulation , query-optimization , indexing , etc. . we consider the situation where an xml-document does not come with key definitions , and we are interested in using data mining techniques to obtain a representation of the keys holding in a document . in order to have a compact-representation of the set of keys holding in a document , we define a partial-order on the set of all key expressions . this order is based on an analysis of the properties of absolute and relative-keys for xml . given the existence of the partial-order , only a reduced set of key expressions need to be discovered.due to the semistructured nature of xml-documents , it turns out to be useful to consider keys that hold in `` almost '' the whole document , that is , they are violated only in a small part of the document . to this end , the support and confidence of a key expression are also defined , and the concept of approximate key expression is introduced . we give an efficient-algorithm to mine a reduced set of approximate keys from an xml-document .
