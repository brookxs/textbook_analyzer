a light weighted damage tracking quarantine and recovery scheme for mission-critical database-systems as online applications gain popularity in today 's e-business world , surviving dbms from an attack is becoming crucial because of the increasingly critical role that database servers are playing . although a number of research projects have been done to tackle the emerging data-corruption threats , existing mechanisms are still limited in meeting four highly desired requirements : near zero run time overhead , zero system down time . in this paper , we propose trace , a light weighted database damage tracking , quarantine , and recovery (dtqr) solution with negligible run time overhead .
