discovering interesting usage-patterns in text-collections : integrating text-mining with visualization this paper addresses the problem of making text-mining results more comprehensible to humanities scholars , journalists , intelligence-analysts , and other researchers , in order to support the analysis of text-collections . our system , featurelens 1 , visualizes a text-collection at several levels of granularity and enables users to explore interesting text patterns . the current implementation focuses on frequent-itemsets of n-grams , as they capture the repetition of exact or similar expressions in the collection . users can find meaningful co-occurrences of text patterns by visualizing them within and across documents in the collection . this also permits users to identify the temporal-evolution of usage such as increasing , decreasing or sudden appearance of text patterns . the interface could be used to explore other text-features as well . initial studies suggest that featurelens helped a literary scholar and 8 users generate new hypotheses and interesting insights using 2 text-collections .
