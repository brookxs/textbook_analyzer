towards real-time measurement of customer-satisfaction using automatically generated call transcripts customer-satisfaction is a very important indicator of how successful a contact-center is at providing services to the customers . contact centers typically conduct a manual survey with a randomly selected group of customers to measure customer-satisfaction . manual customer-satisfaction surveys , however , provide limited values due to high cost and the time lapse between the service and the survey . in this paper , we demonstrate that it is possible to automatically measure customer-satisfaction by analyzing call transcripts enabling companies to measure customer-satisfaction for every call in near real-time . we have identified various features from multiple knowledge sources indicating prosodic , linguistic and behavioral aspects of the speakers , and built machine-learning models that predict the degree of customer-satisfaction with high accuracy . the machine-learning-algorithms used in this work include decision-tree , naive-bayes , logistic-regression and support-vector-machines (svms) . experiments were conducted for a 5-point satisfaction measurement and a 2-point satisfaction measurement using customer calls to an automotive company . the experimental-results show that customer-satisfaction can be measured quite accurately both at the end of calls and in the middle of calls . the best performing 5-point satisfaction classification yields an accuracy of 66.09 \ % outperforming the dominantclass baseline by 15.16 \ % . the best performing 2-point classification shows an accuracy of 89.42 \ % and outperforms both the dominantclass baseline and the csrjudgment baseline by 17.7 \ % and 3.3 \ % respectively . furthermore , decision-tree and svms achieve higher f-measure than the csrjudgment baseline in identifying both satisfied customers and dissatisfied customers .
