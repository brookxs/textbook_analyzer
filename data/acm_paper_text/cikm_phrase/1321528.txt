a comparison of statistical-significance tests for information-retrieval-evaluation information-retrieval (ir) researchers commonly use three tests of statistical-significance : the student 's paired t-test , the wilcoxon signed rank test , and the sign test . other researchers have previously proposed using both the bootstrap and fisher 's randomization (permutation) test as non-parametric significance-tests for ir but these tests have seen little use . for each of these five tests , we took the ad-hoc-retrieval runs submitted to trecs 3 and 5-8 , and for each pair of runs , we measured the statistical-significance of the difference in their mean-average-precision . we discovered that there is little practical difference between the randomization , bootstrap , and t tests . both the wilcoxon and sign test have a poor ability to detect significance and have the potential to lead to false detections of significance . the wilcoxon and sign tests are simplified variants of the randomization-test and their use should be discontinued for measuring the significance of a difference between means .
