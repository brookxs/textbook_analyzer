time-based-language-models we explore the relationship between time and relevance using trec-ad-hoc queries . a type of query is identified that favors very recent-documents . we propose a time-based language model-approach to retrieval for these queries . we show how time can be incorporated into both query-likelihood models and relevance-models . these models were used for experiments comparing time-based-language-models to heuristic-techniques for incorporating document recency in the ranking . our results show that time-based models perform as well as or better than the best of the heuristic-techniques .
