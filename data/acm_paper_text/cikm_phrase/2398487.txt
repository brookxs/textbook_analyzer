preprocessing of informal mathematical-discourse in context ofcontrolled natural-language informal mathematical-discourse (imd) is characterized by the mixture of natural-language and symbolic expressions in the context of textbooks , publications in mathematics and mathematical proof . we focused the imd processing at the low level of discourse . in this paper , we proposed the preprocessing phase before the imd structure-analysis within the context of controlled-natural-language (cnl) . our contribution is defined in context of the imd processing and the use of machine-learning ; first , we present a cnl , a pure corpus and matemathical treebank for processing imd ; second , we present a preprocessing phase for imd analysis with connectives disambiguation and verbs treatment , finally , we found a satisfactory result on input-text parsing using a statistical parsing-model . we will propagate these results for classification of argumentative informal practices via the low level discourse in imd processing .
