collection-based compression using discovered long matching strings many collections of data contain items that are inherently similar . for example , archives contain files with incremental changes between releases . long-range inter-file similarities are not exploited by standard approaches to compression . we investigate compression using similarity from all parts of a collection , collection-based compression (cbc) . input-files are delta-encoded by reference to long string matches in a source collection . the expected space requirement of our encoding algorithm is sublinear with the collection-size , and the compression time-complexity is linear with the input file-size . we show that our scheme achieves better compression for large input-files than existing differential compression systems , and scales better . also , we achieve significant compression improvement compared to compressing each file individually using standard utilities : our scheme achieves several times the compression of gzip or 7-zip . the overall result is a dramatic improvement on compression available with existing approaches .
