meta-recommendation systems : user-controlled integration of diverse recommendations in a world where the number of choices can be overwhelming , recommender-systems help users find and evaluate items of interest . they do so by connecting users with information regarding the content of recommended items or the opinions of other individuals . such systems have become powerful tools in domains such as electronic-commerce , digital-libraries , and knowledge-management . in this paper , we address such systems and introduce a new class of recommender-system called meta-recommenders . meta-recommenders provide users with personalized control over the generation of a single recommendation list formed from a combination of rich-data using multiple-information-sources and recommendation techniques . we discuss experiments conducted to aid in the design of interfaces for a meta-recommender in the domain of movies . we demonstrate that meta-recommendations fill a gap in the current design of recommender-systems . finally , we consider the challenges of building real-world , usable meta-recommenders across a variety of domains .
