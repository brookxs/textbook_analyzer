efficient prediction of web accesses on a proxy-server web-access-prediction is an active research-topic with many applications . various approaches have been proposed for web-access-prediction in the domain of individual web-servers but they have to be tailored to the domain of proxy-servers to satisfy its special requirements in prediction efficiency and scalability . in this paper , the design and implementation of proxy-based prediction service (pps) is presented . for prediction efficiency , pps applies a new prediction-scheme which employs a two-layer navigation-model to capture both inter-site and intra-site access-patterns , incorporated with a bottom-up prediction mechanism that exploits reference locality in proxy logs . for system-scalability , pps manages the navigation-model in disk database and adopts a predictive cache-replacement-strategy for data-shipping between the model database and cache . we show the superiority of our prediction-scheme over existing approaches and validate our model-management and caching-strategies , with a detailed performance-study using real-world-data .
