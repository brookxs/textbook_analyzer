utilizing a geometry of context for enhanced implicit-feedback implicit-feedback algorithms utilize interaction between searchers and search systems to learn more about users ' needs and interests than expressed in query statements alone . this additional-information can be used to formulate improved queries or directly improve retrieval-performance . in this paper we present a geometric framework that utilizes multiple sources of evidence present in this interaction-context (e.g. , display-time , document retention) to develop enhanced implicit-feedback models personalized for each user and tailored for each search-task . we use rich-interaction logs (and associated metadata such as relevance-judgments) , gathered during a longitudinal user-study , as relevance stimuli to compare an implicit feedback algorithm developed using the framework with alternative algorithms . our findings demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and the potential value of incorporating multiple sources of interaction evidence when developing implicit-feedback algorithms .
