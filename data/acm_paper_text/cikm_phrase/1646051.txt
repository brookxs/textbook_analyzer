semi-nonnegative matrix factorization with global statistical consistency for collaborative-filtering collaborative-filtering , considered by many researchers as the most important technique for information-filtering , has been extensively studied by both academic and industrial communities . one of the most popular approaches to collaborative-filtering-recommendation algorithms is based on low-dimensional factor-models . the assumption behind such models is that a user 's preferences can be modeled by linearly combining item factor vectors using user-specific coefficients . in this paper , aiming at several aspects ignored by previous work , we propose a semi-nonnegative matrix factorization method with global statistical consistency . the major contribution of our work is twofold : (1) we endow a new understanding on the generation or latent compositions of the user-item rating matrix . under the new interpretation , our work can be formulated as the semi-nonnegative matrix factorization problem . (2) moreover , we propose a novel method of imposing the consistency between the statistics given by the predicted values and the statistics given by the data . we further develop an optimization-algorithm to determine the model-complexity automatically . the complexity of our method is linear with the number of the observed ratings , hence it is scalable to very-large datasets . finally , comparing with other state-of-the-art methods , the experimental-analysis on the eachmovie dataset illustrates the effectiveness of our approach .
