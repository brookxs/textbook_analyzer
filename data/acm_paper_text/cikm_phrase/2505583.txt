modeling-dynamics of meta-populations with a probabilistic-approach : global diffusion in social-media increasingly , diverse online-social-networks are locally and globally interconnected by sharing information in the-web ecosystem . accordingly , emergent macro-level phenomena have been observed , such as global spread of news across different types of social-media . such real-world diffusion is hard to define with a single social platform alone since dynamic influences between heterogeneous-social-networks are not negligible . also , the underlying structural property of networks is important , as it drives the diffusion-process in a stochastic way . in this paper , we propose a macro-level diffusion-model with a probabilistic-approach by combining both heterogeneity and structural connectivity of social-networks . as real-world phenomena , we take cases from news diffusion across news , social-networking-sites (sns) , and blog media using the icwsm '11 spinn3r dataset which contains over 386 million web-documents covering a one-month period in early 2011 . we find that influence between different media types is varied by context of information . news-media are the most influential in the arts and economy categories , while sns and blog media are in the politics and culture categories , respectively . also , controversial topics such as political protests and multiculturalism failure tend to spread concurrently across social-media , while entertainment topics such as film releases and celebrities are likely driven by internal interactions within single social platforms . we expect that the proposed model applies to a wider class of diffusion phenomena in diverse fields including the social-sciences , marketing , and neuroscience , and that it provides a way of interpreting dynamics of meta-populations in terms of strength and directionality of influences among them .
