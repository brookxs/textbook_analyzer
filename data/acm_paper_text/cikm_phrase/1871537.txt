a method for discovering components of human rituals from streams of sensor-data this paper describes an algorithm for determining if an event occurs persistently within an interval where the interval is periodic but the event is not . the goal of the algorithm is to identify events with this property and also determine the minimum interval in which they occur . this solution is geared towards discovering human routines by considering the triggering of simple sensors over a diverse set of spatial and temporal scales . after describing the problem and the proposed solution , in this paper we demonstrate using testbed data and simulations that this approach uncovers components of routines by identifying which events are parts of the same routine through their temporal-properties .
