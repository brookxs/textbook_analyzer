modeling-behavior , a step towards defining functionally correct views of complex-objects in concurrent-engineering multidisciplinary concurrent-engineering needs to model and manage different views of complex designs . previous attempts to address the problem of creating views of complex-objects in object-oriented-database systems focus on the structure of complex-objects ; little attention is paid to how complex object behavior is effected when creating views . we believe that designing functionally correct behavior for a complex object should be a major consideration when defining a view to guarantee correctness of the derived classes . in this paper , we study the problem for designing functionally correct views of complex-objects in concurrent-engineering . view behavioral-modeling requirements are presented . a behavior-model that satisfies these requirements is presented . this model is demonstrated on an example complex object that represents process-management .
