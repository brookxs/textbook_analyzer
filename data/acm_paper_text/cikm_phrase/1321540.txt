recognition and classification of noun-phrases in queries for effective retrieval it has been shown that using phrases properly in the document-retrieval leads to higher retrieval-effectiveness . in this paper , we define four types of noun-phrases and present an algorithm for recognizing these phrases in queries . the strengths of several existing tools are combined for phrase-recognition . our algorithm is tested using a set of 500 web-queries from a query-log , and a set of 238 trec queries . experimental-results show that our algorithm yields high phrase-recognition accuracy . we also use a baseline noun-phrase-recognition algorithm to recognize phrases from the trec queries . a document-retrieval experiment is conducted using the trec queries (1) without any phrases , (2) with the phrases recognized from a baseline noun-phrase-recognition algorithm , and (3) with the phrases recognized from our algorithm respectively . the retrieval-effectiveness of (3) is better than that of (2) , which is better than that of (1) . this demonstrates that utilizing phrases in queries does improve the retrieval-effectiveness , and better noun-phrase-recognition yields higher retrieval-performance .
