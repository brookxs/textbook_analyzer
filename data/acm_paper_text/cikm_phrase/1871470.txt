outcome aware ranking in interaction-networks in this paper , we present a novel ranking technique that we developed in the context of an application that arose in a service-delivery setting . we consider the problem of ranking agents of a service organization . the service agents typically need to interact with other service agents to accomplish the end goal of resolving customer requests . their ranking needs to take into account two aspects : firstly , their importance in the network-structure that arises as a result of their interactions , and secondly , the value generated by the interactions involving them . we highlight several other applications which have the common theme of ranking the participants of a value-creation process based on the network-structure of their interactions and the value generated by their interactions . we formally present the problem and describe the modeling-technique which enables us to encode the value of interaction in the graph . our ranking-algorithm is based on extension of eigen-value methods . we present experimental-results on real-life , public domain datasets from the-internet movie database . this makes our experiments replicable and verifiable .
