photofall : discovering weblog stories through photographs an effective means of retrieving relevant photographs from the-web is to search for terms that would likely appear in the surrounding text in multimedia-documents . in this paper , we investigate the complementary search-strategy , where relevant multimedia-documents are retrieved using the photographs they contain . we concentrate our efforts on the retrieval of large numbers of personal stories posted to internet weblogs that are relevant to a particular search topic . photographs are often included in posts of this sort , typically taken by the author during the course of the narrated events of the story . we describe a new story search-tool , photofall , which allows users to quickly find stories related to their topic of interest by judging the relevance of the photographs extracted from top search-results . we evaluate the accuracy of relevance-judgments made using this interface , and discuss the implications of the results for improving topic-based searches of multimedia-content .
