rws-diff : flexible and efficient change-detection in hierarchical-data the problem of generating a cost-minimal edit-script between two trees has many important applications . however , finding such a cost-minimal script is computationally hard , thus the only methods that scale are approximate ones . various approximate-solutions have been proposed recently . however , most of them still show quadratic or worse runtime-complexity in the tree size and thus do not scale well either . the only solutions with log-linear runtime-complexity use simple matching-algorithms that only find corresponding subtrees as long as these subtrees are equal . consequently , such solutions are not robust at all , since small changes in the leaves which occur frequently can make all subtrees that contain the changed leaves unequal and thus prevent the matching of large portions of the trees . this problem could be avoided by searching for similar instead of equal subtrees but current similarity approaches are too costly and thus also show quadratic complexity . hence , currently no robust log-linear method exists . we propose the random-walks similarity (rws) measure which can be used to find similar subtrees rapidly . we use this measure to build the rws-diff algorithm that is able to compute an approximately cost-minimal edit-script in log-linear time while having the robustness of a similarity-based approach . our evaluation reveals that random-walk similarity indeed increases edit-script quality and robustness drastically while still maintaining a runtime comparable to simple matching approaches .
