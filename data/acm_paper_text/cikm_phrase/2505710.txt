rank-energy selective query-forwarding for distributed-search systems scaling high-quality , cost-efficient query-evaluation is critical to search-system performance . although partial indexes reduce query-processing times , result quality may be jeopardized due to exclusion of relevant non-local documents . selectively forwarding queries between geographically distributed search sites may help . the basic idea of query-forwarding is that after a local site receives a query , it determines non-local sites to forward the query to and returns an aggregation of the local and non-local results . nevertheless , electricity costs remain substantial sources of operating expenses . we present a hybrid rank-energy query-forwarding model termed `` resq . '' the novel contribution is to simultaneously consider both ranking quality and spatially-temporally varying energy prices when making forwarding decisions . experiments with a large-scale query-log , publicly-available electricity price data , and real search site locations demonstrate that query-forwarding under resq achieves the result scalability of partial indexes with the cost-savings of energy-aware approaches (e.g. , an 87 % ranking guarantee with a 46 % savings in energy costs) .
