a graphical-browser for xml-schema documents recently , tools for browsing xml-schema documents have become popular , but they can not support advanced browsing functionalities . we have implemented a new graphical schema-browser which provides traversals not only along a composition hierarchy but also along a type-hierarchy defined in the documents . in this demonstration , we show how users can quickly and easily understand the semantic structures by freely navigating to any datatypes or elements located at any position in the hierarchies .
