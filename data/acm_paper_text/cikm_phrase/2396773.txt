mining high utility itemsets without candidate-generation high utility itemsets refer to the sets of items with high utility like profit in a database , and efficient mining of high utility itemsets plays a crucial role in many real-life applications and is an important research issue in data-mining area . to identify high utility itemsets , most existing algorithms first generate candidate itemsets by overestimating their utilities , and subsequently compute the exact utilities of these candidates . these algorithms incur the problem that a very-large number of candidates are generated , but most of the candidates are found out to be not high utility after their exact utilities are computed . in this paper , we propose an algorithm , called hui-miner (high-utility-itemset miner) , for high-utility-itemset mining . hui-miner uses a novel structure , called utility-list , to store both the utility information about an itemset and the heuristic information for pruning the search-space of hui-miner . by avoiding the costly generation and utility computation of numerous candidate itemsets , hui-miner can efficiently mine high utility itemsets from the utility-lists constructed from a mined database . we compared hui-miner with the state-of-the-art algorithms on various databases , and experimental-results show that hui-miner outperforms these algorithms in terms of both running-time and memory-consumption .
