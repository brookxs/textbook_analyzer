term-context models for information-retrieval at their heart , most if not all information-retrieval-models utilize some form of term frequency.the notion is that the more often a query-term occurs in a document , the more likely it is that document meets an information-need . we examine an alternative . we propose a model which assesses the presence of a term in a document not by looking at the actual occurrence of that term , but by a set of non-independent supporting terms , i.e. context . this yields a weighting for terms in documents which is different from and complementary to tf - based methods , and is beneficial for retrieval .
