cluster_based rank-query over multidimensional-data streams many data-stream monitoring-applications involve rank queries and hence a number of efficient evaluation algorithms are proposed recently . most of these techniques assume that rank queries are executed directly over the whole data-space . however , we observe that many applications often require to perform clustering over the data-streams before rank queries are run on each cluster . to address the problem , we propose a novel algorithm for integral clustering and ranking processing and we refer to such integrated queries as cluster-based rank queries . the algorithm includes two phases , namely the online phase which maintains the required data-structures and statistics , and the query phase which uses these data-structures to process queries . extensive experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is efficient in both space consumption and query-processing .
