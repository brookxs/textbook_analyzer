learning to link with wikipedia this paper describes how to automatically cross-reference documents with wikipedia : the largest knowledge-base ever known . it explains how machine-learning can be used to identify significant terms within unstructured-text , and enrich it with links to the appropriate wikipedia articles . the resulting link detector and disambiguator performs very well , with recall and precision of almost 75 \ % . this performance is constant whether the system is evaluated on wikipedia articles or `` real-world '' documents . this work has implications far beyond enriching documents with explanatory links . it can provide structured-knowledge about any unstructured fragment of text . any task that is currently addressed with bags of words - indexing , clustering , retrieval , and summarization to name a few - could use the techniques described here to draw on a vast network of concepts and semantics .
