language-model-based ranking for queries on rdf-graphs the success of knowledge-sharing communities like wikipedia and the advances in automatic-information-extraction from textual and web sources have made it possible to build large `` knowledge repositories '' such as dbpedia , freebase , and yago . these collections can be viewed as graphs of entities and relationships (er graphs) and can be represented as a set of subject-property-object (spo) triples in the semantic-web data-model rdf . queries can be expressed in the w3c-endorsed sparql language or by similarly designed graph-pattern search . however , exact-match query-semantics often fall short of satisfying the users ' needs by returning too many or too few results . therefore , ir-style ranking-models are crucially needed . in this paper , we propose a language-model-based approach to ranking the results of exact , relaxed and keyword-augmented graph pattern queries over rdf-graphs such as er graphs . our method estimates a query-model and a set of result-graph models and ranks results based on their kullback-leibler-divergence with respect to the query-model . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our ranking-model by a comprehensive user-study .
