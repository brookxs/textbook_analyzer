e-nsp : efficient negative-sequential-pattern mining based on identified positive patterns without database rescanning mining negative sequential patterns (nsp) is much more challenging than mining positive sequential-patterns (psp) due to the high computational-complexity and huge search-space required in calculating negative sequential candidates (nsc) . very few approaches are available for mining nsp , which mainly rely on re-scanning databases after identifying psp . as a result , they are very inefficient . in this paper , we propose an efficient-algorithm for mining nsp , called e-nsp , which mines for nsp by only involving the identified psp , without re-scanning databases . first , negative-containment is defined to determine whether or not a data sequence contains a negative sequence . second , an efficient approach is proposed to convert the negative-containment problem to a positive containment problem . the supports of nsc are then calculated based only on the corresponding psp . finally , a simple but efficient approach is proposed to generate nsc . with e-nsp , mining nsp does not require additional database scans , and the existing psp mining algorithms can be integrated into e-nsp to mine for nsp efficiently . e-nsp is compared with two currently available nsp mining algorithms on 14 synthetic and real-life datasets . intensive experiments show that e-nsp takes as little as 3 \ % of the runtime of the baseline approaches and is applicable for efficient mining of nsp in large-datasets .
