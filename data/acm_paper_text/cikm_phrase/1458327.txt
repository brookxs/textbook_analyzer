ghost : an effective graph-based framework for name-distinction name-ambiguity stems from the fact that many people or objects share identical names . in this paper , we focus on investigating the problem in digital-libraries to distinguish publications written by authors with identical names . we present an effective graph-based framework , ghost (abbr . graph-based framework for name-distinction) , to solve the problem systematically . we evaluated the framework on the real dblp dataset , and the experimental-results show that ghost outperforms the state-of-the-art method .
