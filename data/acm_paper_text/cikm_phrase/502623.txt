joint-optimization of cost and coverage of query plans in data-integration existing approaches for optimizing queries in data-integration use decoupled strategies -- attempting to optimize coverage and cost in two separate phases . since sources tend to have a variety of access limitations , such phased optimization of cost and coverage can unfortunately lead to expensive planning as well as highly inefficient plans . in this paper we present techniques for joint-optimization of cost and coverage of the query plans . our algorithms search in the space of parallel query plans that support multiple sources for each subgoal conjunct . the refinement of the partial plans takes into account the potential parallelism between source calls , and the binding compatibilities between the sources included in the plan . we start by introducing and motivating our query-plan representation . we then briefly review how to compute the cost and coverage of a parallel plan . next , we provide both a system-r style query-optimization algorithm as well as a greedy local-search algorithm for searching in the space of such query plans . finally we present a simulation-study that demonstrates that the plans generated by our approach will be significantly better , both in terms of planning cost , and in terms of plan-execution cost , compared to the existing approaches .
