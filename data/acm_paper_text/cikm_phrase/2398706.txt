exploring simultaneous keyword and key sentence-extraction : improve graph-based-ranking using wikipedia summarization and keyword-selection are two important tasks in nlp-community . although both aim to summarize the source articles , they are usually treated separately by using sentences or words . in this paper , we propose a two-level graph-based-ranking-algorithm to generate summarization and extract keywords at the same time . previous works have reached a consensus that important sentence is composed by important keywords . in this paper , we further study the mutual impact between them through context-analysis . we use wikipedia to build a two-level concept-based graph , instead of traditional term-based graph , to express their homogenous relationship and heterogeneous relationship . we run pagerank and hits rank on the graph to adjust both homogenous and heterogeneous relationships . a more reasonable relatedness value will be got for key sentence-selection and keyword-selection . we evaluate our algorithm on tac 2011 data-set . traditional term-based approach achieves a score of 0.255 in rouge-1 and a score of 0.037 and rouge-2 and our approach can improve them to 0.323 and 0.048 separately .
