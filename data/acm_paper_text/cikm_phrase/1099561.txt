generalized contextualization method for xml-information-retrieval a general re-weighting method , called contextualization , for more efficient element ranking in xml-retrieval is introduced . re-weighting is based on the idea of using the ancestors of an element as a context : if the element appears in a good context -- good interpreted as probability-of-relevance -- its weight is increased in relevance-scoring ; if the element appears in a bad context , its weight is decreased . the formal presentation of contextualization is given in a general xml-representation and manipulation frame , which is based on utilization of structural-indices . this provides a general approach independent of weighting schemas or query languages.contextualization is evaluated with the inex test-collection . we tested four runs : no contextualization , parent , root and tower contextualizations . the contextualization runs were significantly better than no contextualization . the root contextualization was the best among the re-weighted runs .
