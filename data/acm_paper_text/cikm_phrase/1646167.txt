exploit the tripartite-network of social-tagging for web-clustering in this poster , we investigate how to enhance web-clustering by leveraging the tripartite-network of social-tagging systems . we propose a clustering-method , called `` tripartite clustering '' , which cluster the three types of nodes (resources , users and tags) simultaneously based on the links in the social-tagging network . the proposed method is experimented on a real-world social-tagging dataset sampled from del.icio.us . we also compare the proposed clustering approach with k-means . all the clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained web-directory . the experimental-results show that tripartite clustering significantly outperforms the content-based k-means approach and achieves performance close to that of social annotation-based k-means whereas generating much more useful information .
