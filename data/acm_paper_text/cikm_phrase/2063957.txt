mining frequent patterns across multiple data-streams mining frequent patterns from data-streams has drawn increasing attention in recent years . however , previous mining algorithms were all focused on a single data-stream . in many emerging applications , it is of critical importance to combine multiple-data-streams for analysis . for example , in real-time news topic analysis , it is necessary to combine multiple news report streams from dierent media sources to discover collaborative frequent-patterns which are reported frequently in all media , and comparative frequent-patterns which are reported more frequently in a media than others . to address this problem , we propose a novel frequent-pattern-mining algorithm hybrid-streaming , h-stream for short . h-stream builds a new hybrid-frequent tree to maintain historical frequent and potential frequent-itemsets from all data-streams , and incrementally updates these itemsets for efficient collaborative and comparative pattern-mining . theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate the utility of the proposed method .
