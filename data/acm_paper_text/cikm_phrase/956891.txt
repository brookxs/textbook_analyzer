addressing the lack of direct-translation resources for cross-language-retrieval most cross-language-information-retrieval research concentrates on language-pairs for which direct , rich , and often multiple translation-resources already exist . however , for most language-pairs , translation via an intermediate-language is necessary . two distinct methods for dealing with the additional ambiguity introduced by the extra translation step have been proposed and individually , shown to improve retrieval-effectiveness . two previous works indicated that in combination , the methods were ineffective . this paper provides strong empirical evidence that the methods can be combined to produce consistent and often significant improvements in retrieval-effectiveness . the improvement is shown across a number of different intermediate-languages and test-collections .
