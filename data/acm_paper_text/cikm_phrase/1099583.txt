focused-crawling for both topical-relevance and-quality of medical-information subject-specific search facilities on health sites are usually built using manual inclusion and exclusion rules . these can be expensive to maintain and often provide incomplete coverage of web-resources . on the other hand , health-information obtained through whole-of-web search may not be scientifically based and can be potentially harmful.to address problems of cost , coverage and-quality , we built a focused-crawler for the mental-health topic of depression , which was able to selectively fetch higher quality relevant-information . we found that the relevance of unfetched pages can be predicted based on link anchor context , but the quality can not . we therefore estimated quality of the entire linking page , using a learned ir-style query of weighted single words and word-pairs , and used this to predict the quality of its links . the overall crawler priority was determined by the product of link-relevance and source quality.we evaluated our crawler against baseline crawls using both relevance-judgments and objective site-quality scores obtained using an evidence-based rating-scale . both a relevance focused-crawler and the quality focused-crawler retrieved twice as many relevant pages as a breadth-first control . the quality focused-crawler was quite effective in reducing the amount of low quality material fetched while crawling more high quality content , relative to the relevance focused crawler.analysis suggests that quality of content might be improved by post-filtering a very big breadth-first crawl , at the cost of substantially increased network-traffic .
