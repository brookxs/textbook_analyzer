scissor : scalable and efficient reachability-query processing in time-evolving hierarchies a time-evolving hierarchy (teh) consists of multiple snapshots of the hierarchy (collection of one or more trees) as it evolves over time . it is often important to test reachability between a given pair of vertices in an arbitrary (possibly past) snapshot of the hierarchy . while interval-based indexing has been a popular strategy for reachability testing in static hierarchies , a straightforward extension of this strategy to tehs is impractical because of the exorbitant indexing overheads . in this paper , we propose scissor (selective snapshot indexing with progressive solution refinement) , which , to the best of our knowledge is the first time and space efficient framework for answering reachability-queries in tehs . the main idea here is to maintain indexes only for a selective interspersed subset of teh snapshots . a query on a non-indexed snapshot will be answered by utilizing the index of a temporally-nearby indexed snapshot and analyzing the structural changes that have occurred between the two snapshots . we also present a experimental-study demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of the scissor framework in terms of both indexing costs and query latencies .
