context-aware-search personalization with concept preference as the size-of-the-web is growing rapidly , a well-recognized challenge for developing web-search-engines is to optimize the search result towards each user 's preference . in this paper , we propose and develop a new personalization framework that captures the user 's preference in the form of concepts obtained by mining web-search contexts . the search-context consists of both the user 's clickthroughs and query-reformulations that satisfy some specific information-need , which is able to provide more information than each individual query in a search-session . we also propose a method that discovers search contexts by one-pass of raw search-query log . using the information of the search-context , we develop eight strategies that derive conceptual preference judgment . a learning-to-rank approach is employed to combine the derived preference-judgments and then a context-aware user profile (caup) is created . we further employ caup to adapt a personalized-ranking function . experimental-results demonstrate that our approach captures accurate and comprehensive user 's preference and , in terms of top-n results quality , outperforms those existing concept-based personalization approaches without using search contexts .
