symbolic photograph content-based-retrieval photograph retrieval-systems face the difficulty to deal with the different ways to apprehend the content of images . we consider and demonstrate here the use of multiple index representations of photographs to achieve effective retrieval . the use of multiple-indexes allows integration of the complementary strengths of different indexing-and-retrieval models . the proposed representation supports multiple labels for regions and attributes , and handles inferences and relationships . we define links between indexing levels and the related-query modes . the experiment conducted on 2400 home photographs shows the behavior of the multiple indexing levels during retrieval .
