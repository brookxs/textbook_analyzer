mining entity translations from comparable-corpora : a holistic graph-mapping approach this paper addresses the problem of mining named-entity translations from comparable-corpora , specifically , mining english and chinese named entity translation . we first observe that existing approaches use one or more of the following named-entity similarity-metrics : entity , entity context , and relationship . inspired by this observation , in this paper , we propose a new holistic approach , by (1) combining all similarity types used and (2) additionally considering relationship context-similarity between pairs of named-entities , a missing quadrant in the taxonomy of similarity-metrics . we abstract the named-entity-translation problem as the matching of two named-entity graphs extracted from the comparable-corpora . specifically , named-entity graphs are first constructed from comparable-corpora to extract relationship between named-entities . entity similarity and entity context-similarity are then calculated from every pair of bilingual named-entities . a reinforcing method is utilized to reflect relationship similarity and relationship context-similarity between named-entities . according to our experimental-results , our holistic graph-based-approach significantly outperforms previous approaches .
