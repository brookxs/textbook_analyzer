user-browsing behavior-driven web-crawling to optimize the performance of web-crawlers , various page-importance measures have been studied to select and order urls in crawling . most sophisticated measures (e.g. breadth-first and pagerank) are based on link-structure . in this paper , we treat the problem from another perspective and propose to measure page-importance through mining user interest and behaviors from web browse logs . unlike most existing approaches which work on single url , in this paper , both the log-mining and the crawl-ordering are performed at the granularity of url-pattern . the proposed url pattern-based crawl orderings are capable to properly predict the importance of newly created (unseen) urls . promising experimental-results proved the feasibility of our approach .
