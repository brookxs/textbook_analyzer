efficient frequent-pattern-mining over data-streams this paper proposes a prefix-tree structure , called cps-tree (compact pattern stream tree) that efficiently discovers the exact set of recent frequent patterns from high-speed data-stream . the cps-tree introduces the concept of dynamic tree restructuring technique in handling stream-data that allows it to achieve highly compact frequency-descending tree-structure at runtime and facilitates an efficient fp-growth-based [1] mining technique .
