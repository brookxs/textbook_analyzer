a feature-word-topic model for image-annotation image-annotation is to automatically associate semantic labels with images in order to obtain a more convenient way for indexing and searching images on the web . this paper proposes a novel method for image-annotation based on feature-word and word-topic distributions . the introduction of topics enables us to efficiently take word-associations , such as {ocean , fish , coral} , into image-annotation . feature-word distributions are utilized to define weights in computation of topic distributions for annotation . by doing so , topic-models in text-mining can be applied directly in our method . experiments show that our method is able to obtain promising improvements over the state-of-the-art method - supervised multiclass labeling (sml)
