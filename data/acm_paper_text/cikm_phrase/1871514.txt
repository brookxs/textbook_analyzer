boosting social-network connectivity with link-revival online-social-networking platforms have become a popular channel of communications among people . however , most people can only keep in touch with a limited number of friends . this phenomenon results in a low-connectivity social-network in terms of communications , which is inefficient for information-propagation and social-engagement . in this paper , we introduce a new recommendation-service , called link-revival , that suggests users to re-connect with their old friends , such that the resulted connection will improve the social-network connectivity . to achieve high-connectivity improvement under the dynamic-social-network evolvement , we propose a graph prediction-based recommendation strategy , which selects proper candidates based on the prediction of their future behaviors . we then develop an effective model that exploits non-homogeneous poisson process and second-order self-similarity in prediction . through comprehensive experimental-studies on two real datasets (phone-call network and facebook wall-posts) , we demonstrate that our proposed approach can significantly increase the social-network connectivity , and that the approach outperforms other baseline solutions . the results also show that our solution is more suitable for online-social-networks like facebook , partially due to the stronger long range dependency and lower communication-costs in the interactions .
