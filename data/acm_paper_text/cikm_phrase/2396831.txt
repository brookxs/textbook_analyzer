efficient retrieval of recommendations in a matrix-factorization framework low-rank-matrix factorization (mf) methods provide one of the simplest and most effective approaches to collaborative-filtering . this paper is the first to investigate the problem of efficient retrieval of recommendations in a mf framework . we reduce the retrieval in a mf model to an apparently simple task of finding the maximum dot-product for the user vector over the set of item vectors . however , to the best of our knowledge the problem of efficiently finding the maximum dot-product in the general case has never been studied . to this end , we propose two techniques for efficient search -- (i) we index the item vectors in a binary spatial-partitioning metric-tree and use a simple branch and-bound algorithm with a novel bounding scheme to efficiently obtain exact solutions . (ii) we use spherical clustering to index the users on the basis of their preferences and pre-compute recommendations only for the representative-user of each cluster to obtain extremely efficient approximate-solutions . we obtain a theoretical error-bound which determines the quality of any approximate result and use it to control the approximation . both these simple techniques are fairly independent of each other and hence are easily combined to further improve recommendation retrieval-efficiency . we evaluate our algorithms on real-world collaborative-filtering datasets , demonstrating more than &#215; 7 speedup (with respect to the naive linear-search) for the exact solution and over &#215; 250 speedup for approximate-solutions by combining both techniques .
