location-prediction in social-media based on tie-strength we propose a novel network-based approach for location-estimation in social-media that integrates evidence of the social-tie strength between users for improved location-estimation . concretely , we propose a location estimator -- friendlylocation -- that leverages the relationship between the strength of the tie between a pair of users , and the distance between the pair . based on an examination of over 100 million geo-encoded tweets and 73 million twitter user-profiles , we identify several factors such as the number of followers and how the users interact that can strongly reveal the distance between a pair of users . we use these factors to train a decision-tree to distinguish between pairs of users who are likely to live nearby and pairs of users who are likely to live in different areas . we use the results of this decision-tree as the input to a maximum-likelihood-estimator to predict a user 's location . we find that this proposed method significantly improves the results of location-estimation relative to a state-of-the-art technique . our system reduces the average error distance for 80 % of twitter users from 40 miles to 21 miles using only information from the user 's friends and friends-of-friends , which has great significance for augmenting traditional social-media and enriching location-based-services with more refined and accurate location estimates .
