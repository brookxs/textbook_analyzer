clustering object moving patterns for prediction-based object-tracking sensor-networks prior works have shown that probabilistic suffix-trees (pst) could predict accurately the moving behaviors of objects for prediction-based object-tracking sensor-networks . however , maintaining psts for objects incurs a considerable amount of storage spaces for resource-constrained sensor-nodes . in this paper , we derive a distance-function between two psts and propose an algorithm to determine the similarity between them . by the distance between psts , we propose a clustering-algorithm to partition objects with similar moving behaviors into groups . furthermore , for each group , one pst is selected to predict movements of objects within one group . experimental-results show that our proposed approaches not only effectively reduce the storage-cost but also provide good prediction-accuracy .
