a densitometric approach to web-page-segmentation web-page-segmentation is a crucial step for many applications in information-retrieval , such as text-classification , de-duplication and full-text-search . in this paper we describe a new approach to segment html pages , building on methods from quantitative linguistics and strategies borrowed from the area of computer-vision . we utilize the notion of text-density as a measure to identify the individual text-segments of a web-page , reducing the problem to solving a 1d-partitioning task . the distribution of segment-level text-density seems to follow a negative hypergeometric-distribution , described by frumkina 's law . our extensive evaluation confirms the validity and-quality of our approach and its applicability to the-web .
