incremental query-evaluation for support-vector-machines support-vector-machines (svms) have been widely used in multimedia-retrieval to learn a concept in order to find the best matches . in such a svm active-learning environment , the system first processes k sampling queries and top - k uncertain queries to select the candidate data items for training . the user 's top - k relevant queries are then evaluated to compute the answer . this approach has shown to be effective . however , it suffers from the scalability problem associated with larger database sizes . to address this limitation , we propose an incremental query-evaluation technique for these three types of queries . based on the observation that most queries are not revised dramatically during the iterative evaluation , the proposed technique reuses the results of previous queries to reduce the computation-cost . furthermore , this technique takes advantage of a tuned index-structure to efficiently prune irrelevant-data . as a result , only a small portion of the data-set needs to be accessed for query-processing . this index-structure also provides an inexpensive means to process the set of candidates to evaluate the final query result . this technique can work with different kernel-functions and kernel parameters . our experimental-results indicate that the proposed technique significantly reduces the overall computation-cost , and offers a promising solution to the scalability issue .
