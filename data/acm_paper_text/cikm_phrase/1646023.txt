interactive , topic-based visual text summarization and analysis we are building an interactive , visual text analysis-tool that aids users in analyzing a large-collection of text . unlike existing work in text-analysis , which focuses either on developing sophisticated text analytic techniques or inventing novel visualization metaphors , ours is tightly integrating state-of-the-art text-analytics with interactive-visualization to maximize the value of both . in this paper , we focus on describing our work from two aspects . first , we present the design and development of a time-based , visual text summary that effectively conveys complex text-summarization results produced by the latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) model . second , we describe a set of rich-interaction tools that allow users to work with a created visual text summary to further interpret the summarization results in context and examine the text-collection from multiple-perspectives . as a result , our work offers two unique contributions . first , we provide an effective visual-metaphor that transforms complex and even imperfect text-summarization results into a comprehensible visual summary of texts . second , we offer users a set of flexible visual-interaction tools as the alternatives to compensate for the deficiencies of current text-summarization techniques . we have applied our work to a number of text-corpora and our evaluation shows the promise of the work , especially in support of complex text analyses .
