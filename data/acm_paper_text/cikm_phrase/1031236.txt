swam : a family of access-methods for similarity-search in peer-to-peer data networks peer-to-peer data networks (pdns) are large-scale , self-organizing , distributed-query-processing systems . familiar examples of pdn are peer-to-peer file-sharing networks , which support exact-match search queries to locate user-requested files . in this paper , we formalize the more general problem of <i> similarity-search </i> in pdns , and propose a <i> family </i> of distributed-access methods , termed <i> small-world access-methods (swam) </i> , for efficient execution of various similarity-search queries , namely exact-match , range , and k-nearest-neighbor queries . unlike its predecessors , i.e. , lh * and dhts , swam does not control the assignment of data objects to pdn nodes ; each node autonomously stores its own data . besides , swam supports all similarity-search queries on multiple attributes . swam guarantees that the query object will be found (if it exists in the network) in average time logarithmically proportional to the network size . moreover , once the query object is found , all the similar objects would be in its proximate network neighborhood and hence enabling efficient range and k-nearest-neighbor queries . as a specific instance of swam , we propose <i> swam-v </i> , a voronoi-based swam that indexes pdns with multi-attribute data objects . for a pdn with <i> n </i> nodes swam-v has query time , communication-cost , and computation-cost of <i> o </i> (log <i> n </i>) for exact-match queries , and <i> o </i> (log <i> n </i> + <b> s </b> <i> n </i>) and <i> o </i> (log <i> n </i> + <b> k </b>) for range-queries (with selectivity <b> s </b>) and <b> k </b> nn queries , respectively . our experiments show that swam-v consistently outperforms a similarity-search enabled version of can in query time and communication-cost by a factor of 2 to 3 .
