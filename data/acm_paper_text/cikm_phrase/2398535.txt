federated-search in-the-wild : the combined power of over a hundred search-engines federated-search has the potential of improving web-search : the user becomes less dependent on a single search provider and parts of the deep-web become available through a unified interface , leading to a wider variety in the retrieved search-results . however , a publicly available dataset for federated-search reflecting an actual web environment has been absent . as a result , it has been difficult to assess whether proposed systems are suitable for the-web setting . we introduce a new test-collection containing the results from more than a hundred actual search-engines , ranging from large general web-search-engines such as google and bing to small domain-specific engines . we discuss the design and analyze the effect of several sampling-methods . for a set of test queries , we collected relevance-judgements for the top 10 results of each search-engine . the dataset is publicly available and is useful for researchers interested in resource-selection for web-search collections , result-merging and size-estimation of uncooperative resources .
