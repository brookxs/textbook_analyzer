the efficient imputation-method for neighborhood-based collaborative-filtering as each user tends to rate a small proportion of available items , the resulted data-sparsity issue brings significant challenges to the research of recommender-systems . this issue becomes even more severe for neighborhood-based collaborative-filtering methods , as there are even lower numbers of ratings available in the neighborhood of the query item . in this paper , we aim to address the data-sparsity issue in the context of the neighborhood-based collaborative-filtering . given the (user , item) query , a set of key ratings are identified , and an auto-adaptive imputation-method is proposed to fill the missing-values in the set of key ratings . the proposed method can be used with any similarity-metrics , such as the pearson-correlation-coefficient and cosine-based similarity , and it is theoretically guaranteed to outperform the neighborhood-based collaborative-filtering approaches . results from experiments prove that the proposed method could significantly improve the accuracy of recommendations for neighborhood-based collaborative-filtering algorithms .
