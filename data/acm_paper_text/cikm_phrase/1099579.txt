exact-match search in sequence-data using suffix-trees we study suitable indexing-techniques to support efficient exact-match search in large biological-sequence databases . we propose a suffix-tree (st) representation , called sta-df , as an alternative to the array-representation of st (sta) proposed in [7] and utilized in [18] . to study the performance of sta and sta-df , we develop a memory efficient st-based exact-match (stem) search-algorithm . we implemented stem and both representations of st and conducted extensive experiments . our results indicate that the sta and sta-df representations are very similar in construction time , storage utilization , and search-time using stem . in terms of the access-patterns by stem , our results show that compared to sta , the sta-df representation exhibits better spatial and sequential locality-of-reference . this suggests that sta-df would require less number of disk i/os , and hence is more amenable to efficient and scalable disk-based-computation .
