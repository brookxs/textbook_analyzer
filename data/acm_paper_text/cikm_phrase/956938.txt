combining link-based and content-based methods for web-document-classification this paper studies how link-information can be used to improve classification results for web collections . we evaluate four different measures of subject similarity , derived from the-web link-structure , and determine how accurate they are in predicting document categories . using a bayesian-network model , we combine these measures with the results obtained by traditional content-based classifiers . experiments on a web-directory show that best results are achieved when links from pages outside the directory are considered . link-information alone is able to obtain gains of up to 46 points in f 1 , when compared to a traditional content-based classifier . the combination with content-based methods can further improve the results , but too much noise may be introduced , since the text of web-pages is a much less reliable source of information . this work provides an important insight on which measures derived from links are more appropriate to compare web-documents and how these measures can be combined with content-based algorithms to improve the effectiveness of web-classification .
