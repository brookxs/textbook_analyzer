geco : an online personal-data generator and corruptor we demonstrate geco , an online personal-data generator and corruptor that facilitates the creation of realistic personal-data ranging from names , addresses , and dates , to social-security and credit-card numbers , as well as numerical values such as salary or blood-pressure . using an intuitive web-interface , a user can create records containing such data according to their needs , and apply various corruption functions to generate duplicates of these records . synthetic personal-data are increasingly required in areas such as record de-duplication , fraud-detection , cloud-computing , and health-informatics , where data-quality issues can significantly affect the outcomes of data-integration , processing , and mining projects . privacy-concerns , however , often make it difficult for researchers to obtain real-data that contain personal details . compared to other data generators that have to be downloaded , installed and customized , geco allows the creation of personal-data with much less effort . in this demonstration we show (1) how different types of attributes , and dependencies between them , can be specified ; (2) how the generated data can be modified using various types of corruption functions ; and (3) how a user can contribute to geco by providing attribute generation functions and look-up files . we believe geco will be a valuable tool for researchers that require realistic personal-data to evaluate their algorithms with regard to efficiency-and-effectiveness .
