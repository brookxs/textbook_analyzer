context-sensitive synonym-discovery for web-search-queries we propose a simple yet effective approach to context-sensitive synonym-discovery for web-search-queries based on co-click analysis ; i.e. , analyzing queries leading to clicking same documents . in addition to deriving word_based synonyms , we also derive concept_based synonyms with the help of query-segmentation . evaluation results show that this approach dramatically outperforms the thesaurus_based synonym replacement method in keeping search-intent , from accuracy of 40 \ % to above 80 \ % .
