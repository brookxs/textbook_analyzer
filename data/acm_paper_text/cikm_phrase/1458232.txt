modeling multi-step relevance-propagation for expert-finding an expert-finding system allows a user to type a simple text query and retrieve names and contact-information of individuals that possess the expertise expressed in the query . this paper proposes a novel approach to expert-finding in large enterprises or intranets by modeling candidate experts (persons) , web-documents and various relations among them with so-called expertise graphs . as distinct from the state of-the-art approaches estimating personal expertise through one-step propagation of relevance probability from documents to the related candidates , our methods are based on the principle of multi-step relevance-propagation in topic specific expertise graphs . we model the process of expert-finding by probabilistic random-walks of three kinds : finite , infinite and absorbing . experiments on trec enterprise track data originating from two large organizations show that our methods using multi-step relevance-propagation improve over the baseline one-step propagation_based method in almost all cases .
