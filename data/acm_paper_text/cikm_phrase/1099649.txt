fast webpage-classification using url features we demonstrate the usefulness of the uniform-resource-locator (url) alone in performing web-page-classification . this approach is faster than typical web-page-classification , as the pages do not have to be fetched and analyzed . our approach segments the url into meaningful chunks and adds component , sequential and orthographic features to model salient patterns . the resulting features are used in supervised maximum-entropy-modeling . we analyze our approach 's effectiveness on two standardized domains . our results show that in certain scenarios , url-based methods approach the performance of current state-of-the-art full-text and link-based methods .
