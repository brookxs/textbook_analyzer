penguins in sweaters , or serendipitous entity-search on user-generated-content in many cases , when browsing the-web users are searching for specific information or answers to concrete questions . sometimes , though , users find unexpected , yet interesting and useful results , and are encouraged to explore further . what makes a result serendipitous ? we propose to answer this question by exploring the potential of entities extracted from two sources of user-generated-content -- wikipedia , a user-curated online encyclopedia , and yahoo!-answers , a more unconstrained question/answering forum -- in promoting serendipitous search . in this work , the content of each data source is represented as an entity network , which is further enriched with metadata about sentiment , writing quality , and topical category . we devise an algorithm based on lazy random-walk-with-restart to retrieve entity recommendations from the networks . we show that our method provides novel results from both datasets , compared to standard web-search-engines . however , unlike previous research , we find that choosing highly emotional entities does not increase user-interest for many categories of entities , suggesting a more complex relationship between topic matter and the desirable metadata attributes in serendipitous search .
