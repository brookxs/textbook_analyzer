a new mathematics-retrieval system the-web contains a large-collection of documents , some with mathematical expressions . because mathematical expressions are objects with complex structures and rather few distinct symbols , conventional text-retrieval-systems are not very successful in mathematics-retrieval . the lack of a definition for similarity between mathematical expressions , and the inadequacy of searching for exact matches only , makes the problem of mathematics-retrieval even harder . as a result , the few existing mathematics-retrieval systems are not very helpful in addressing users ' needs . we propose a powerful query-language for mathematical expressions that augments exact-matching with approximate-matching , but in a way that is controlled by the user . we also introduce a novel indexing-scheme that scales well for large-collections of expressions . based on this indexing-scheme , an efficient lookup-algorithm is proposed .
