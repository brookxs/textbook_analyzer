social-tags : meaning and suggestions this paper aims to quantify two common assumptions about social-tagging : (1) that tags are `` meaningful '' and (2) that the tagging-process is influenced by tag-suggestions . for (1) , we analyze the semantic properties of tags and the relationship between the tags and the content of the tagged page . our analysis is based on a corpus of search keywords , contents , titles , and tags applied to several thousand popular web-pages . among other results , we find that the more popular tags of a page tend to be the more meaningful ones . for (2) , we develop a model of how the influence of tag-suggestions can be measured . from a user-study with over 4,000 participants , we conclude that roughly one third of the tag applications may be induced by the suggestions . our results would be of interest for designers of social-tagging systems and are a step towards understanding how to best leverage social-tags for applications such as search and information-extraction .
