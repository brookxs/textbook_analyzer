information shared by many objects if kolmogorov-complexity [25] measures information in one object and information-distance measures information shared by two objects , how do we measure information shared by many objects ? this paper provides an initial pragmatic study of this fundamental data-mining question . firstly , e m (x 1 , x 2 , ... , x n) is defined to be the minimum amount of thermodynamic energy needed to convert from any x i to any x j . with this definition several theoretical problems have been solved . second , our newly proposed theory is applied to select a comprehensive review and a specialized review from many reviews : (1) core feature words , expanded words and dependent words are extracted respectively . (2) comprehensive and specialized reviews are selected according to the information among them . this method of selecting a single review can be extended to select multiple reviews as well . finally , experiments show that this comprehensive and specialized review-mining method based on our new theory can do the job efficiently .
