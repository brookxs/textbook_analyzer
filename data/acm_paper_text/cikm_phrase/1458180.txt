translation-enhancement : a new relevance-feedback method for cross-language-information-retrieval as an effective technique for improving retrieval-effectiveness , relevance-feedback (rf) has been widely studied in both monolingual and cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) settings . the studies of rf in clir have been focused on query-expansion (qe) , in which queries are reformulated before and/or after they are translated . however , rf in clir actually not only can help select better query terms , but also can enhance query-translation by adjusting translation-probabilities and even resolve some out-of-vocabulary terms . in this paper , we propose a novel rf method called translation-enhancement (te) , which uses the extracted translation relationships from relevant documents to revise the translation-probabilities of query terms and to identify extra translation alternatives if available so that the translated queries are more tuned to the current search . we studied te using pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) and interactive-relevance-feedback (irf) . our results show that te can significantly improve clir with both types of rf methods , and that the improvement is comparable to that of qe . more importantly , the effects of te and qe are complementary . their integration can produce further improvement , and makes clir more robust for a variety of queries .
