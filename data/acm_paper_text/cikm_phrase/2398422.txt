predicting the effectiveness of keyword-queries on databases keyword-query interfaces (kqis) for databases provide easy access to data , but often suffer from low ranking quality , i.e. low precision and/or recall , as shown in recent benchmarks . it would be useful to be able to identify queries that are likely to have low ranking quality to improve the user-satisfaction . for instance , the system may suggest to the user alternative queries for such hard queries . in this paper , we analyze the characteristics of hard queries and propose a novel framework to measure the degree of difficulty for a keyword-query over a database , considering both the structure and the content of the database and the query results . we evaluate our query-difficulty-prediction model against two relevance-judgment benchmarks for keyword-search on databases , inex and semsearch . our study shows that our model predicts the hard queries with high accuracy . further , our prediction algorithms incur minimal time overhead .
