discovering and exploiting keyword and attribute-value co-occurrences to improve p2p routing indices peer-to-peer (p2p) search requires intelligent decisions for query-routing : selecting the best peers to which a given query , initiated at some peer , should be forwarded for retrieving additional search-results . these decisions are based on statistical-summaries for each peer , which are usually organized on a per-keyword basis and managed in a distributed directory of routing indices . such architectures disregard the possible correlations among keywords . together with the coarse granularity of per-peer summaries , which are mandated for scalability , this limitation may lead to poor search result quality.this paper develops and evaluates two solutions to this problem , sk-stat based on single-key statistics only , and mk-stat based on additional multi-key statistics . for both cases , hash sketch synopses are used to compactly represent a peer 's data items and are efficiently disseminated in the p2p-network to form a decentralized directory . experimental-studies with gnutella and web-data demonstrate the viability and the trade-offs of the approaches .
