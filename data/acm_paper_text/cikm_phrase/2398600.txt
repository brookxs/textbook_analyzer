star-join : spatio-textual similarity-join location-based-services have attracted significant attention due to modern mobile-phones equipped with gps devices . these services generate large amounts of spatio-textual data which contain both spatial-location and textual descriptions . since a spatio-textual object may have different representations , possibly because of deviations of gps or different user descriptions , it calls for efficient methods to integrate spatio-textual data from different sources . in this paper we study a new research problem called spatio-textual similarity-join : given two sets of spatio-textual objects , we find the similar object pairs . to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to study this problem . we make the following contributions : (1) we develop a filter-and-refine framework and devise several efficient-algorithms . we first generate spatial and textual signatures for the objects and build inverted-index on top of these signatures . then we generate candidate pairs using the inverted-lists of signatures . finally we refine the candidates and generate the final result . (2) we study how to generate high-quality signatures for spatial-information . we develop an mbr-prefix_based signature to prune large numbers of dissimilar object pairs . (3) experimental-results on real and synthetic datasets show that our algorithms achieve high-performance and scale well .
