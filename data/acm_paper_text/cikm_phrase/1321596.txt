using social-annotations to improve language-model for information-retrieval this poster is concerned with the problem of exploring the use of social-annotations for improving language-models for information-retrieval (denoted as lmir) . two properties of social-annotations , namely keyword property and structure property are studied for this aim . the keyword property improves lmir by concatenating all the annotations of a document to generate a summary of the document . the structure property can boost lmir further when similarity among annotations and similarity among documents are taken into consideration simultaneously . the two properties of social-annotations are leveraged for the use of language-modeling with a mixture-model named as `` language-annotation model '' (denoted as lam) . evaluations using del.icio.us data show that lam outperforms the traditional lmir approaches significantly .
