ranking social-bookmarks using topic-models ranking of resources in social-tagging systems is a difficult problem due to the inherent sparsity of the data and the vocabulary problems introduced by having a completely unrestricted lexicon . in this paper we propose to use hidden topic-models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of this data to provide more accurate resource rankings with higher recall . we first describe latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) and then show how it can be used to rank resources in a social-bookmarking-system . we test the lda tagging-model and compare it with 3 non-topic model baselines on a large-data sample obtained from the delicious social-bookmarking site . our evaluations show that our lda-based method significantly outperforms all of the baselines .
