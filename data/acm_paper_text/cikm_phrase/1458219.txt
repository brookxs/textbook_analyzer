automatic online-news topic-ranking using media-focus and user-attention based on aging-theory news topics , which are constructed from news stories using the techniques of topic-detection-and-tracking (tdt) , bring convenience to users who intend to see what is going on through the-internet . however , it is almost impossible to view all the generated topics , because of the large amount . so it will be helpful if all topics are ranked and the top ones , which are both timely and important , can be viewed with high priority . generally , topic-ranking is determined by two primary factors . one is how frequently and recently a topic is reported by the media ; the other is how much attention users pay to it . both media-focus and user-attention varies as time goes on , so the effect of time on topic-ranking has already been included . however , inconsistency exists between both factors . in this paper , an automatic online-news topic-ranking algorithm is proposed based on inconsistency analysis between media-focus and user-attention . news stories are organized into topics , which are ranked in terms of both media-focus and user-attention . experiments performed on practical web datasets show that the topic-ranking result reflects the influence of time , the media and users . the main contributions of this paper are as follows . first , we present the quantitative-measure of the inconsistency between media-focus and user-attention , which provides a basis for topic-ranking and an experimental-evidence to show that there is a gap between what the media provide and what users view . second , to the best of our knowledge , it is the first attempt to synthesize the two factors into one algorithm for automatic online topic-ranking .
