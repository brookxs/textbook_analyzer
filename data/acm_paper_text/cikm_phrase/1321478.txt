automatic-feature-selection in the markov-random-field-model for information-retrieval previous applications of the markov random field model for information-retrieval have used manually chosen features . however , it is often difficult or impossible to know , a priori , the best set-of-features to use for a given task or data-set . therefore , there is a need to develop automatic-feature-selection techniques . in this paper we describe a greedy procedure for automatically selecting features to use within the markov random field model for information-retrieval . we also propose a novel , robust method for describing classes of textual-information-retrieval features . experimental-results , evaluated on standard trec test-collections , show that our feature-selection-algorithm produces models that are either significantly more effective than , or equally effective as , models with manually selected features , such as those used in the past .
