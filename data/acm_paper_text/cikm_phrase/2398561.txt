a unified optimization framework for auction and guaranteed-delivery in online-advertising this paper proposes a new unified optimization framework combining pay-per-click auctions and guaranteed-delivery in sponsored-search . advertisers usually have different (and sometimes mixed) marketing goals : brand awareness and direct response . different mechanisms are good at addressing different goals , e.g. , guaranteed-delivery was often used to build brand awareness and pay-per-click auctions was widely used for direct-marketing . our new method accommodates both in a unified-framework , with the search-engine revenue as an optimization objective . in this way , we can target a guaranteed number of ad clicks (or impressions) per campaign for advertisers willing to pay a premium and enable keyword-auctions for all others . specifically , we formulate this joint-optimization problem using linear-programming and a column-generation strategy for efficiency . to select the best column (a ranked list of ads) given a query , we propose a novel dynamic-programming-algorithm that takes the special structure of the ad allocation and pricing-mechanisms into account . we have tested the proposed framework and the algorithms on real ad data obtained from a commercial-search-engine . the results demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform several baselines in guaranteeing the number of clicks for the given advertisers , and in increasing the total revenue for the search-engine .
