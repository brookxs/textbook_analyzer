a fast and simple method for extracting relevant content from news webpages we propose nce , an efficient-algorithm to identify and extract relevant content from news webpages . we define relevant as the textual sections that more objectively describe the main event in the article . this includes the title and the main body section , and excludes comments about the story and presentation-elements . our experiments suggest that nce is competitive , in terms of extraction quality , with the best methods available in the literature . it achieves f 1 = 90.7 \ % in our test-corpus containing 324 news webpages from 22 sites . the main advantages of our method are its simplicity and its computational performance . it is at least an order of magnitude faster than methods that use visual-features . this characteristic is very suitable for applications that process a large number of pages .
