outlier-detection using centrality and center-proximity an outlier is an object that is considerably dissimilar with the remainder of the dataset . in this paper , we first propose the notion of centrality and center-proximity as novel outlierness measures which can be considered to represent the characteristics of all of the objects in the dataset . we then propose a graph-based outlier-detection method which can solve the problems of local density , micro-cluster , and fringe objects . finally , through extensive experiments , we show the effectiveness of the proposed method .
