spatio-temporal and events_based analysis of topic popularity in twitter we present the first comprehensive characterization of the diffusion of ideas on twitter , studying more than 5.96 million topics that include both popular and less popular topics . on a data-set containing approximately 10 million users and a comprehensive scraping of 196 million tweets , we perform a rigorous temporal and spatial analysis , investigating the time-evolving properties of the subgraphs formed by the users discussing each topic . we focus on two different notions of the spatial : the network-topology formed by follower-following links on twitter , and the geospatial location of the users . we investigate the effect of initiators on the popularity of topics and find that users with a high number of followers have a strong impact on topic popularity . we deduce that topics become popular when disjoint clusters of users discussing them begin to merge and form one giant component that grows to cover a significant fraction of the network . our geospatial analysis shows that highly popular topics are those that cross regional boundaries aggressively .
