predicting the optimal ad-hoc index for reachability-queries on graph-databases due to the recent advances in graph-databases , a large number of ad-hoc indexes for a fundamental query , in particular , reachability-query , have been proposed . the performances of these indexes on different graphs have known to be very different . worst still , deriving an accurate cost-model for selecting the optimal index of a graph-database appears to be a daunting task . in this paper , we propose a hierarchical prediction-framework , based on neural-networks and a set of graph features and a knowledge-base on past predictions , to determine the optimal index for a graph-database . for ease of presentation , we propose our framework with three structurally distinguishable indexes . our experiments show that our framework is accurate .
