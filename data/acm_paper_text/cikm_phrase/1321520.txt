efficient search ranking in social-networks in social-networks such as orkut , www.orkut.com , a large portion of the user queries refer to names of other people . indeed , more than 50 \ % of the queries in orkut are about names of other users , with an average of 1.8 terms per query . further , the users usually search for people with whom they maintain relationships in the network . these relationships can be modelled as edges in a friendship graph , a graph in which the nodes represent the users . in this context , search-ranking can be modelled as a function that depends on the distances among users in the graph , more specifically , of shortest-paths in the friendship graph . however , application of this idea to ranking is not straightforward because the large size of modern social-networks (dozens of millions of users) prevents efficient-computation of shortest-paths at query time . we overcome this by designing a ranking formula that strikes a balance between producing good results and reducing query-processing time . using data from the orkut social-network , which includes over 40 million users , we show that our ranking , augmented by this new signal , produces high quality results , while maintaining query-processing time small .
