a machine-learning-approach for improved bm25 retrieval despite the widespread use of bm25 , there have been few studies examining its effectiveness on a document description over single and multiple field combinations . we determine the effectiveness of bm25 on various document fields . we find that bm25 models relevance on popularity fields such as anchor-text and query click information no better than a linear function of the field attributes . we also find query click information to be the single most important field for retrieval . in response , we develop a machine-learning-approach to bm25-style retrieval that learns , using lambdarank , from the input attributes of bm25 . our model significantly improves retrieval-effectiveness over bm25 and bm25f . our data-driven-approach is fast , effective , avoids the problem of parameter-tuning , and can directly optimize for several common information retrieval measures . we demonstrate the advantages of our model on a very-large real-world web-data collection .
