a novel statistical chinese-language-model and its application in pinyin-to-character-conversion in this paper , we present a novel chinese-language-model , and study its-applications , in particular in chinese pinyin-to-character-conversion . in the new model , each word is associated with supporting context constructed by mining the frequent-sets of nearby phrases and their distances to the word . such information was usually overlooked in previous n-gram-model and its variants . we apply the model to chinese pinyin-to-character-conversion and find that it offers a better solution to chinese-input . the model has lower perplexity in our evaluation and higher prediction-accuracy than the state-of-the-art n-gram markov-model for chinese-language .
