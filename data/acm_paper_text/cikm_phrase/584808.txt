a fast filtering-scheme for large database cleansing existing data-cleansing methods are costly and will take very long time to cleanse large-databases . since large-databases are common nowadays , it is necessary to reduce the cleansing time . data-cleansing consists of two main components , detection-method and comparison method . in this paper , we first propose a simple and fast comparison method , ti-similarity , which reduces the time for each comparison . based on ti-similarity , we propose a new detection-method , rar , to further reduce the number of comparisons . with rar and ti-similarity , our new approach for cleansing large-databases is composed of two processes : filtering process and pruning process . in filtering process , a fast scan on the database is carried out with rar and ti-similarity . this process guarantees the detection of potential duplicate records but may introduce false-positives . in pruning process , the duplicate result from the filtering process is pruned to eliminate the false-positives using more trustworthy comparison methods . the performance-study shows that our approach is efficient and scalable for cleansing large-databases , and is about an order of magnitude faster than existing cleansing methods .
