automatically extracting structure and data from business-reports a considerable amount of clean semistructured-data is internally available to companies in the form of business-reports . however , business-reports are untapped for data-mining , data-warehousing , and querying because they are not in relational form . business-reports have a regular-structure that can be reconstructed . we present algorithms that automatically infer the regular-structure underlying business-reports and automatically generate wrappers to extract relational-data .
