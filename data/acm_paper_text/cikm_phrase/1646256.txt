maximal metric margin partitioning for similarity-search indexes we propose a partitioning scheme for similarity-search indexes that is called maximal metric margin partitioning (mmmp) . mmmp divides the data on the basis of its distribution pattern , especially for the boundaries of clusters . a partitioning surface created by mmmp is likely to be at maximum distances from the two cluster boundaries . mmmp is the first similarity-search index approach to focus on partitioning surfaces and data-distribution patterns . we also present an indexing-scheme , named the mmmp-index , which uses mmmp and small ball partitioning . the mmmp-index prunes many objects that are not relevant to a query , and it reduces the query-execution cost . our experimental-results show that mmmp effectively indexes clustered data and reduces the search-cost . for clustered vector-data , the mmmp-index reduces the computational cost to less than two thirds that of comparable schemes .
