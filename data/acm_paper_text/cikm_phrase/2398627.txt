infobox suggestion for wikipedia entities given the sheer amount of work and expertise required in authoring wikipedia articles , automatic-tools that help wikipedia contributors in generating and improving content are valuable . this paper presents our initial step towards building a full-fledged author assistant , particularly for suggesting infobox templates for articles . we build svm classifiers to suggest infobox template types , among a large number of possible types , to wikipedia articles without infoboxes . different from prior works on wikipedia article classification which deal with only a few label classes for named-entity-recognition , the much larger 337-class setup in our study is geared towards realistic deployment of infobox suggestion tool . we also emphasize testing on articles without infoboxes , due to that labeled and unlabeled-data exhibit different distributions of features , which departs from the typical assumption that they are drawn from the same underlying population .
