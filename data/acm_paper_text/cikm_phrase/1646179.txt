text-summarization-model based on the budgeted median problem we propose a multi-document generic summarization-model based on the budgeted median problem . our model selects sentences to generate a summary so that every sentence in the document-cluster can be assigned to and be represented by a sentence in the summary as much as possible . the advantage of this model is that it covers the entire relevant part of the document cluster through sentence assignment and can incorporate asymmetric relations between sentences such as textual-entailment .
