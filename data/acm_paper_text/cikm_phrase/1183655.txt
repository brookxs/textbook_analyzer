out-of-context noun-phrase semantic-interpretation with cross-linguistic evidence the acquisition of semantic-knowledge is paramount for any application that requires a deep-understanding of natural-language-text . motivated by the problem of building a noun phrase-level semantic-parser and adapting it to various applications , such as machine-translation and multilingual-question-answering , in this paper we present a domain-independent model for noun-phrase semantic-interpretation . we investigate the problem based on cross-linguistic evidence from a set of four romance languages : spanish , italian , french , and romanian . the focus on romance languages is well motivated . it is generally the case that english noun phrases translate into constructions of the form '' n p n '' in romance languages where , as we will show , the p (preposition) varies in ways that correlate with the semantics . thus , based on a set of 22 semantic-interpretation categories (such as part-whole , agent , possession) we present empirical-observations regarding the distribution of these semantic-categories in a cross-lingual corpus and their mapping to various syntactic-constructions in english and romance . furthermore , given a training-set of english noun phrases along with their translations in the four romance languages , our algorithm automatically learns classification-rules and applies them to unseen noun-phrase instances for semantic-interpretation . experimental-results are compared against a state-of-the-art model reported in the literature .
