towards non-directional xpath evaluation in a rdbms xml-query-languages use directional path-expressions to locate data in an xml-data collection . they are tightly-coupled to the structure of a data-collection , and can fail when evaluated on the same data in a different structure . this paper extends path-expressions with a new non-directional-axis called the rank-distance axis . given a context node and two positive integers ? and ? , the rank-distance axis returns those nodes that are ranked between ? and ? in terms of closeness from the context node in any direction . this paper shows how to evaluate the rank-distance axis in a tree-unaware xml-database . a tree-unaware implementation does not invade the database kernel to support xml-queries , instead it uses an existing rdbms such as microsoft 's sql-server as a back-end and provides a front-end layer to translate xml-queries to sql . this paper presents an overview of an algorithm that translates queries with a rank-distance axis to sql .
