composable xml integration grammars the proliferation of xml as a standard for data-representation and exchange in diverse , next-generation web-applications has created an emphatic need for effective xml data-integration tools . for several real-life scenarios , such xml-data integration needs to be <i> dtd-directed </i> -- in other words , the target , integrated xml-database must conform to a prespecified , user - or application-defined dtd . in this paper , we propose a novel formalism , <i> xml integration grammars (xigs) </i> , for specifying dtd-directed integration of xml-data . abstractly , an xig maps data from multiple xml sources to a target xml-document that conforms to a predefined dtd . an xig extracts source xml-data via queries expressed in a fragment of xquery , and controls target document-generation with tree-valued attributes and the target dtd . the novelty of xigs consists in not only their automatic support for dtd-conformance but also in their : an xig may embed local and remote xigs in its definition , and invoke these xigs during its evaluation . this yields an important modularity property for our xigs that allows one to divide a complex integration task into manageable sub-tasks and conquer each of them separately . to efficiently evaluate xigs we provide algorithms for merging xml-queries in an xig and for scheduling queries and embedded xigs . these lead to an effective framework , as well as a design-tool for xquery , for effectively specifying and computing complex , dtd-directed xml integration .
