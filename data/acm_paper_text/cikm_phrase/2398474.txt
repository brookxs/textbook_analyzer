meta path-based collective-classification in heterogeneous-information-networks collective-classification approaches exploit the dependencies of a group of linked objects whose class labels are correlated and need to be predicted simultaneously . in this paper , we focus on studying the collective-classification problem in heterogeneous-networks , which involves multiple-types of data objects interconnected by multiple-types of links . intuitively , two objects are correlated if they are linked by many paths in the network . by considering different linkage paths in the network , one can capture the subtlety of different types of dependencies among objects . we introduce the concept of meta-path based dependencies among objects , where a meta path is a path consisting a certain sequence of linke types . we show that the quality of collective-classification results strongly depends upon the meta paths used . to accommodate the large-network size , a novel solution , called hcc (meta-path based heterogenous collective-classification) , is developed to effectively assign labels to a group of instances that are interconnected through different meta-paths . the proposed hcc model can capture different types of dependencies among objects with respect to different meta paths . empirical-studies on real-world networks demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed meta path-based collective-classification approach .
