hyperthesis : the grna spell on the curse of bioinformatics applications-integration in this paper , we describe a graphical workflow-management-system called hyperthesis to address the challenges of integrating bioinformatics applications . hyperthesis is an integral component of the genomics research network-architecture (grna) . the grna was designed and developed to address the challenges of developing new bioinformatics applications . specifically , hyperthesis makes constructing workflows (pipelines of execution of applications) in the grna fast and intuitive for biologists and bio-programmers alike . it provides a large repository of interconnectable , parameterized workflow components for processing and relating diverse biological-data and software programs . it also enables us to add new workflow components as new algorithms develop in ones area-of-interest . hyperthesis has been fully implemented using java .
