group-ranking with application to image-retrieval many existing ranking-related information-processing applications can be summarized into one theoretical problem called group-ranking (gr) . a simple average-ranking approach is usually applied to gr . although the approach seems reasonable , no theoretical-analysis about its intrinsic mechanism has been presented , increasing the difficulty of evaluating the ranking results . this study provides a formal-analysis for gr . we first construct an objective-function for the gr problem , and discover that each gr problem can be transformed into a rank-aggregation problem whose objective-function is proved to be equal to the objective-function of gr . as a consequence , the average-ranking approach can be explained by two well-known rank-aggregation techniques . we incorporate two other effective rank-aggregation methods into the gr problem and obtain two new gr algorithms . we apply the gr algorithms into image-retrieval to diversify the image-search-results returned by search-engines . experimental-results show the effectiveness of the proposed gr algorithms .
