text-segmentation via topic-modeling : an analytical study in this paper , the task of text-segmentation is approached from a topic-modeling perspective . we investigate the use of latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) topic-model to segment a text into semantically coherent segments . a major benefit of the proposed approach is that along with the segment-boundaries , it outputs the topic distribution associated with each segment . this information is of potential use in applications like segment-retrieval and discourse-analysis . the new approach outperforms a standard baseline method and yields significantly better performance than most of the available unsupervised-methods on a benchmark-dataset .
