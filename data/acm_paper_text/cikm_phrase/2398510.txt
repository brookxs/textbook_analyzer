dynamic effects of ad impressions on commercial actions in display-advertising in this paper , we develop a time-series approach , based on dynamic linear-models (dlm) , to estimate the impact of ad impressions on the daily number of commercial actions when no user-tracking is possible . the proposed method uses aggregate data , and hence it is simple to implement without expensive infrastructure . specifically , we model the impact of daily number of ad impressions in daily number of commercial actions . we incorporate persistence of campaign effects on actions assuming a decay factor . we relax the assumption of a linear impact of ads on actions using the log-transformation . we also account for outliers with long-tailed-distributions fitted and estimated automatically without a pre-defined threshold . this is applied to observational-data post-campaign and does not require an experimental set-up . we apply the method to data from one commercial ad network on 2,885 campaigns for 1,251 products during six months , to calibrate and perform model-selection . we set up a randomized experiment for two campaigns where user-tracking is feasible . we find that the output of the proposed method is consistent with the results of a/b-testing with similar confidence-intervals .
