item categorization in the e-commerce domain hierarchical-classification is a challenging problem yet bears a broad application in real-world tasks . item categorization in the ecommerce domain is such an example . in a large-scale industrial setting such as ebay , a vast amount of items need to be categorized into a large number of leaf categories , on top of which a complex topic-hierarchy is defined . other than the scale challenges , item data is extremely sparse and skewed distributed over categories , and exhibits heterogeneous characteristics across categories . a common strategy for hierarchical-classification is the `` gates-and-experts '' methods , where a high-level classification is made first (the gates) , followed by a low-level distinction (the experts) . in this paper , we propose to leverage domain-specific feature-generation and modeling-techniques to greatly enhance the classification-accuracy of the experts . in particular , we innovatively derive features to encode various rich domain-knowledge and linguistic hints , and then adapt a svm-based model to distinguish several very confusing category groups appeared as the performance-bottleneck of a currently deployed live system at ebay . we use illustrative examples and empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach , particularly the merit of smartly designed domain-specific features .
