evaluation of phrasal query-suggestions this paper evaluates the uptake and efficacy of a unified approach to phrasal query-suggestions in the context of a high-precision search-engine . the search-engine performs ranked extended-boolean searches with the proximity operator <scp> near </scp> being the default operation . suggestions are offered to the searcher when the length of the result list falls outside predefined bounds . if the list is too long , the engine suggests narrowing the query through the use of super phrases ; if the list is too short , the engine suggests broadening the query through the use of proximal subphrases . we evaluated uptake of phrasal query-suggestions by analyzing search-log data from before and after the suggestion feature was added to a commercial version of the search-engine . we looked at approximately 1.5 million queries and found that , after they were added , suggestions represented nearly 30 \ % of the total queries . we evaluated efficacy through a controlled-study of 24 participants performing nine searches using three different search-engines . we found that the engine with phrase suggestions had better high-precision recall than both the same search-engine without suggestions and a search-engine with a similar interface but using an okapi-bm25 ranking-algorithm .
