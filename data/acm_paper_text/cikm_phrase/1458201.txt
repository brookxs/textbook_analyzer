adasum : an adaptive-model for summarization topic-representation mismatch is a key problem in topic-oriented-summarization for the specified topic is usually too short to understand/interpret . this paper proposes a novel adaptive-model for summarization , adasum , under the assumption that the summary and the topic-representation can be mutually boosted . adasum aims to simultaneously optimize the topic-representation and extract effective summaries . this model employs a mutual-boosting process to minimize the topic-representation mismatch for base summarizers . furthermore , a linear combination of base summarizers is proposed to further reduce the topic-representation mismatch from the diversity of base summarizers with a general learning-framework . we prove that the training-process of adasum can enhance the performance-measure used . experimental-results on duc 2007 dataset show that adasum significantly outperforms the baseline methods for summarization (e.g. mrp , lexrank , and gsps) .
