language-pyramid and multi-scale-text-analysis the classical bag-of-word (bow) model represents a document as a histogram of word occurrence , losing the spatial-information that is invaluable for many text-analysis tasks . in this paper , we present the language-pyramid (lap) model , which casts a document as a probabilistic distribution over the joint semantic-spatial space and motivates a multi-scale 2d local-smoothing framework for nonparametric text coding . lap efficiently encodes both semantic and spatial contents of a document into a pyramid of matrices that are smoothed both semantically and spatially at a sequence of resolutions , providing a convenient multi-scale imagic view for natural-language-understanding . the lap representation can be used in text-analysis in a variety of ways , among which we investigate two instantiations in the current paper : (1) multi-scale text kernels for document-categorization , and (2) multi-scale-language-models for ad-hoc text-retrieval . experimental-results illustrate that : for classification , lap outperforms bow by (up to) 4 \ % on moderate-length texts (rcv1 text benchmark) and 15 \ % on short-texts (yahoo! queries) ; and for retrieval , lap gains 12 \ % map improvement over uni-gram language-models on the ohsumed data-set .
