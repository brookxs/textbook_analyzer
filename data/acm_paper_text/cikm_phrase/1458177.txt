learning latent-semantic relations from clickthrough-data for query-suggestion for a given query raised by a specific user , the query-suggestion technique aims to recommend relevant queries which potentially suit the information-needs of that user . due to the complexity of the-web structure and the ambiguity of users ' inputs , most of the suggestion algorithms suffer from the problem of poor recommendation-accuracy . in this paper , aiming at providing semantically relevant queries for users , we develop a novel , effective and efficient two-level query-suggestion-model by mining clickthrough-data , in the form of two bipartite-graphs (user-query and query-url bipartite-graphs) extracted from the clickthrough-data . based on this , we first propose a joint matrix-factorization method which utilizes two bipartite-graphs to learn the low-rank query latent feature-space , and then build a query-similarity graph-based on the features . after that , we design an online ranking-algorithm to propagate similarities on the query-similarity graph , and finally recommend latent semantically relevant queries to users . experimental-analysis on the clickthrough-data of a commercial-search-engine shows the effectiveness and the efficiency of our method .
