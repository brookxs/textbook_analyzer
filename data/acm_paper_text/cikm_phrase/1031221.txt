exploiting hierarchical-relationships in conceptual-search as the number of available web-pages grows , users experience increasing difficulty finding documents relevant to their interests . one of the underlying reasons for this is that most search-engines find matches based on keywords , regardless of their meanings . to provide the user with more useful information , we need a system that disambiguates queries by including information about the user 's conceptual-framework . this is the goal of keyconcept , a conceptual-search engine . during indexing , keyconcept automatically classifies documents into concepts selected from a reference concept-hierarchy . during retrieval , keyconcept ranks documents based on a combination of keyword and conceptual-similarity . this paper describes the system-architecture and discusses the results of experiments that evaluate the effect of exploiting the hierarchical-relationships between concepts during retrieval . our results confirm that conceptual match significantly improves the precision of the search-results over keyword match alone . in addition , the use of the concept-hierarchy to prune irrelevant search-results also significantly increases precision .
