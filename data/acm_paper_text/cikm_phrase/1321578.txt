cto : concept-tree_based semantic-overlay for pure peer-to-peer-information-retrieval inspired by how search-behavior works in human society , we propose cto , a self-organized semantic-overlay based on concept-tree for p2p-ir infrastructure , which is efficient for full-text-search in pure p2p environment without any central control or powerful peer as hub node . especially , cto performs very well on searching the unpopular resources shared by a few peers . in our experiment , while searching for the scarce documents shared by the peers , cto achieves about 80 \ % recall rate when the search covers less than 5 \ % peers in the overlay . the search latency of cto is also very low , which is controlled in the range about 5 ~ 12 hops .
