joint-sentiment/topic-model for sentiment-analysis sentiment-analysis or opinion-mining aims to use automated-tools to detect subjective information such as opinions , attitudes , and feelings expressed in text . this paper proposes a novel probabilistic-modeling framework based on latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) , called joint-sentiment/topic-model (jst) , which detects sentiment and topic simultaneously from text . unlike other machine-learning-approaches to sentiment-classification which often require labeled-corpora for classifier-training , the proposed jst model is fully unsupervised . the model has been evaluated on the movie review dataset to classify the review sentiment polarity and minimum prior-information have also been explored to further improve the sentiment-classification accuracy . preliminary experiments have shown promising results achieved by jst .
