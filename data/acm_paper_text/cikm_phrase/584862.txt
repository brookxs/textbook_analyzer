the effectiveness study of various music-information-retrieval approaches in this paper , we describe the ultima project which aims to construct a platform for evaluating various approaches of music-information-retrieval . two kinds of approaches are adopted in this project . these approaches differ in various aspects , such as representations of music objects , index-structures , and approximate-query-processing strategies . for a fair comparison , we propose a measurement of the retrieval-effectiveness by recall-precision curves with a scaling factor adjustment . finally , the performance-study of the retrieval-effectiveness based on various factors of these approaches is presented .
