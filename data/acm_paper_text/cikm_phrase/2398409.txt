active-learning for relation type extension with local and global data views relation-extraction is the process of identifying instances of specified types of semantic-relations in text ; relation type extension involves extending a relation-extraction system to recognize a new type of relation . we present lgco-testing , an active-learning system for relation type extension based on local and global views of relation instances . locally , we extract features from the sentence that contains the instance . globally , we measure the distributional-similarity between instances from a 2 billion token corpus . evaluation on the ace 2004 corpus shows that lgco-testing can reduce annotation cost by 97 % while maintaining the performance level of supervised-learning .
