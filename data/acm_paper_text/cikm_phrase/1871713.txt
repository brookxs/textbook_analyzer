relevance-index size tradeoff in contextual-advertising in contextual-advertising , textual ads relevant to the content in a webpage are embedded in the page . content keywords are extracted offline by crawling webpages and then stored in an index for fast serving . given a page , ad-selection involves index-lookup , computing similarity between the keywords of the page and those of candidate ads and returning the top - k scoring ads . in this approach , there is a tradeoff between relevance and index-size where better relevance can be achieved if there are no limits on the index-size . however , the assumption of unlimited index-size is not practical due to the large number of pages on the web and stringent requirements on the serving latency . secondly , page visits on the web follows power-law-distribution where a significant proportion of the pages are visited infrequently , also called the tail pages . indexing tail pages is not efficient given that these pages are accessed very infrequently . we propose a novel mechanism to mitigate these problems in the same framework . the basic idea is to index the same keyword vector for a set of similar pages . the scheme involves learning a website specific hierarchy from (page , url) pairs of the website . next , keywords are populated on the nodes via bottom-up traversal over the hierarchy . we evaluate our approach on a human labeled dataset where our approach has higher ndcg compared to a recent approach even though the index-size of our approach is 7 times less than index-size of the recent approach .
