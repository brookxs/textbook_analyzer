towards a unified solution : data record region-detection and segmentation although the task of data-record-extraction from web-pages has been studied extensively , yet it fails to handle many pages due to their complexity in format or layout . in this paper , we propose a unified method to tackle this task by addressing several key issues in a uniform manner . a new search structure , named as record-segmentation tree (rst) , is designed , and several efficient search pruning strategies on the rst-structure are proposed to identify the records in a given web-page . another characteristic of our method which is significantly different from previous works is that it can effectively handle complicated and challenging data record regions . it is achieved by generating subtree groups dynamically from the rst-structure during the search-process . furthermore , instead of using string-edit-distance or tree-edit-distance , we propose a token-based edit-distance which takes each dom node as a basic unit in the cost calculation . extensive experiments are conducted on four data-sets , including flat , nested , and intertwine records . the experimental-results demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy compared with three state-of-the-art methods .
