scalable entity-matching computation with materialization entity-matching (em) is the task of identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity from different data sources . while em is widely used in data-integration and data-cleaning applications , the naive method for em incurs quadratic-cost with respect to the size of the datasets . to address this problem , this paper proposes a scalable em-algorithm that employs a pre-materialized structure . specifically , once the structure is built , our proposed algorithm can identify the em results with sub-linear cost . in addition , as the rules evolve , our algorithm can efficiently adapt to new-rules by selectively accessing records using the materialized structure . our evaluation results show that our proposed em-algorithm is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art method for extensive real-life datasets .
