user-activity profiling with multi-layer analysis in this paper , we are interested in discovering semantically meaningful communities from a single user 's perspective . we define a multi-layer analysis problem to derive a user 's activity-profile . such an activity-profile would include what activity areas a user is involved with , how important each activity is to the user , and who else is involved with the user on each activity as well as each participant 's participation level . we believe a semantically meaningful community (corresponding to an activity area) must also consider the topics of the social messages rather than only the social-links . while it is possible to use a hybrid-approach based on traditional topic-modeling , in this paper we propose a unified user-modeling approach based on direct clustering over the social messages taking into considerations of both social connections and topics of social messages . our clustering-algorithm can be performed in a unified way in a unsupervised fashion as well as semi-supervised fashion when the user wants to give our algorithm some seeding inputs on his viewpoints . moreover , when the new data comes , our algorithm can perform incremental-updates on the new data without re-clustering the old data . our experiments on social-media datasets available from both within an enterprise and public social network demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .
