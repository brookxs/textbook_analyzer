online-learning for multi-task feature-selection multi-task feature-selection (mtfs) is an important tool to learn the explanatory features across multiple related tasks . previous mtfs methods fulfill this task in batch-mode training . this makes them inefficient when data come in sequence or when the number of training-data is so large that they can not be loaded into the memory simultaneously . to tackle these problems , we propose the first online-learning framework for mtfs . a main advantage of the online algorithms is the efficiency in both time-complexity and memory-cost due to the closed-form-solutions in updating the model weights at each iteration . experimental-results on a real-world dataset attest to the merits of the proposed algorithms .
