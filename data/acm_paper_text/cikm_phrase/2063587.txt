s3k : seeking statement-supporting top-k witnesses traditional information-retrieval-techniques based on keyword-search help to identify a ranked set of relevant documents , which often contains many documents in the top ranks that do not meet the user 's intention . by considering the semantics of the keywords and their relationships , both precision-and-recall can be improved . using an ontology and mapping keywords to entities/concepts and identifying the relationship between them that the user is interested in , allows for retrieving documents that actually meet the user 's intention . in this paper , we present a framework that enables semantic-aware document-retrieval . user queries are mapped to semantic statements based on entities and their relationships . the framework searches for documents expressing these statements in different variations , e.g. , synonymous names for entities or different textual expressions for relations between them . the size of potential result sets makes ranking documents according to their relevance to the user an essential component of such a system . the ranking-model proposed in this paper is based on statistical language-models and considers aspects such as the authority of a document and the confidence in the textual pattern representing the queried information .
