domain-dependent/independent topic switching model for online-reviews with numerical ratings we propose a domain-dependent/independent topic switching model based on bayesian probabilistic-modeling for modeling online-product-reviews that are accompanied with numerical ratings provided by users . in this model , each word is allocated to a domain-dependent topic or a domain-independent topic , and the distribution of topics in an online-review is connected to an observed numerical rating via a linear regression-model . domain-dependent topics utilize domain-information observed with a corpus , and domain-independent topics utilize the framework of bayesian nonparametrics , which can estimate the number of topics in posterior distributions . the posterior-distribution is estimated via collapsed-gibbs-sampling . using real-data , our proposed model had smaller mean-square-error and smaller average mean error with a small model-size and achieved convergence in fewer iterations for a regression-task involving online-review ratings , outperforming a baseline-model that did not consider domains . moreover , the proposed model can also tell us whether the words are positive or negative in the form of continuous values . this feature allows us to extract domain-dependent and - independent sentiment words .
