group-formation mechanisms for transactions in isis distributed toolkits like isis provide means of replicating data but not means for making it persistent . this makes the use of transactions desirable , even in non-database applications . using isis can alleviate the programming cost of distributed-transaction-processing the multi-phase commit-protocols . using the isis transaction tool , however , imposes additional cost , and we examine the effect of group-formation strategies on the overhead . the paper presents three different group-formation mechanisms in isis and compares the costs associated with them .
