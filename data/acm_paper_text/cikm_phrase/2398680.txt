short-text domain-specific key terms/phrases extraction using an n-gram-model with wikipedia finding domain-specific key terms/phrases from a given set of documents is a challenging task . a domain may be defined as an area-of-interest over a collection of documents which may not be explicitly defined but implicitly observable in those documents . when considering a collection of documents related to academic-research , examples of key terms/phrases may be information-retrieval '' , `` marine-biology '' , etc. . in this paper a technique for extracting important key terms/phrases in a considered topical domain is proposed using external evidence from the titles of wikipedia articles and the wikipedia category graph . we performed some experiments over the document collection of web-sites of different post-graduate schools . our preliminary evaluations show promising results for the detection of domain-specific key terms/phrases from the given set of domain focused web pages .
