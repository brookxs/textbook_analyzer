robust models of mouse-movement on dynamic-web search-results pages understanding how users examine result pages across a broad range of information-needs is critical for search-engine design . cursor-movements can be used to estimate visual-attention on search-engine-results page (serp) components , including traditional snippets , aggregated results , and advertisements . however , these signals can only be leveraged for serps where cursor tracking was enabled , limiting their utility for informing the design of new serps . in this work , we develop robust , log-based mouse-movement models capable of estimating searcher attention on novel serp arrangements . these models can help improve serp design by anticipating searchers ' engagement patterns given a proposed arrangement . we demonstrate the efficacy of our method using a large set of mouse-tracking data collected from two independent commercial search engines .
