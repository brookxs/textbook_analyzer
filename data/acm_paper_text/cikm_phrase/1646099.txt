compressing tags to find interesting media groups on photo-sharing websites like flickr and zooomr , users are offered the possibility to assign tags to their uploaded pictures . using these tags to find interesting groups of semantically related pictures in the result-set of a given query is a problem with obvious applications . we analyse this problem from a minimum-description-length (mdl) perspective and develop an algorithm that finds the most interesting groups . the method is based on krimp , which finds small sets of patterns that characterise the data using compression . these patterns are sets of tags , often assignedtogether to photos . the better a database compresses , the more structure it contains and thus the more homogeneous it is . following this observation we devise a compression-based measure . our experiments on flickr data show that the most interesting and homogeneous groups are found . we show extensive examples and compare to clusterings on the flickr website .
