using games-with-a-purpose and bootstrapping to create domain-specific sentiment lexicons sentiment-detection analyzes the positive or negative polarity of text . the field has received considerable attention in recent years , since it plays an important role in providing means to assess user opinions regarding an organization 's products , services , or actions . approaches towards sentiment-detection include machine-learning-techniques as well as computationally less expensive-methods . both approaches rely on the use of language-specific sentiment lexicons , which are lists of sentiment terms with their corresponding sentiment value . the effort involved in creating , customizing , and extending sentiment lexicons is considerable , particularly if less common languages and domains are targeted without access to appropriate language-resources . this paper proposes a semi-automatic approach for the creation of sentiment lexicons which assigns sentiment values to sentiment terms via crowd-sourcing . furthermore , it introduces a bootstrapping-process operating on unlabeled domain documents to extend the created lexicons , and to customize them according to the particular use-case . this process considers sentiment terms as well as sentiment indicators occurring in the discourse surrounding a articular topic . such indicators are associated with a positive or negative context in a particular domain , but might have a neutral connotation in other domains . a formal evaluation shows that bootstrapping considerably improves the method 's recall . automatically created lexicons yield a performance comparable to professionally created language-resources such as the general inquirer .
