locality-sensitive-hashing revisited : filling the gap between theory and algorithm-analysis locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) is widely recognized as one of the most promising approaches to similarity-search in high-dimensional spaces . based on lsh , a considerable number of nearest-neighbor-search algorithms have been proposed in the past , with some of them having been used in many real-life applications . apart from their demonstrated superior performance in practice , the popularity of the lsh algorithms is mainly due to their provable performance-bounds on query cost , space consumption and failure-probability . in this paper , we show that a surprising gap exists between the lsh theory and widely practiced algorithm-analysis techniques . in particular , we discover that a critical assumption made in the classical lsh algorithm-analysis does not hold in practice , which suggests that using the existing methods to analyze the performance of practical lsh algorithms is a conceptual mismatch . to address this problem , a novel analysis-model is developed that bridges the gap between the lsh theory and the method for analyzing the lsh algorithm-performance . with the help of this model , we identify some important flaws in the commonly used analysis-methods in the lsh literature . the validity of this model is verified through extensive experiments with real datasets .
