soft-clustering criterion functions for partitional document-clustering : a summary of results recently published studies have shown that partitional-clustering algorithms that optimize certain criterion functions , which measure key aspects of inter - and intra-cluster similarity , are very effective in producing hard-clustering solutions for document datasets and outperform traditional partitional and agglomerative algorithms . in this paper we study the extent to which these criterion functions can be modified to include soft-membership functions and whether or not the resulting soft-clustering algorithms can further improve the clustering solutions . specifically , we focus on four of these hard criterion functions , derive their soft-clustering extensions , and present an experimental-evaluation involving twelve different datasets . our results show that introducing softness into the criterion functions tends to lead to better clustering results for most datasets .
