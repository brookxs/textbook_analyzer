a geometric interpretation and analysis of r-precision average-precision and r-precision are two of the most commonly cited measures of overall retrieval-performance , but their correlation , though well-known , has defied explanation . we recently devised a geometric interpretation of r-precision which suggests that under a reasonable set of assumptions , r-precision approximates the area under the precision-recall-curve , as does average-precision , thus explaining their correlation . in this paper , we consider these assumptions and our geometric interpretation of r-precision in order to further understand , and make reasonable use of , the information that r-precision provides . given our geometric interpretation of r-precision , we show that r-precision is highly informative by demonstrating that it can be used to (1) accurately infer precision-recall curves , (2) accurately infer other measures of retrieval-performance , and (3) devise new measures of retrieval-performance . through our analysis , we also state the conditions under which r-precision is informative .
