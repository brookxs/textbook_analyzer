right-protected data-publishing with hierarchical-clustering preservation the emergence of cloud-based storage-services is opening up new avenues in data-exchange and data-dissemination . this has amplified the interest in right-protection mechanisms for establishing ownership in case of data-leakage . current right-protection technologies , however , rarely provide strong guarantees on the dataset utility after the protection process . this work presents techniques that explicitly address this shortcoming and provably preserve the outcome of certain mining operations . in particular , we take special care to guarantee that the outcome of hierarchical-clustering operations remains the same before and after right protection . we encode data-ownership using watermarking principles . in the process , we derive fundamental bounds on the distortion incurred by the watermarking . we leverage our theoretical-analysis to design fast-algorithms for right protection without exhaustively searching the vast design-space .
