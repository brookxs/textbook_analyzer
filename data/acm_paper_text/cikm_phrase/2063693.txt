toward traffic-driven location-based-web-search the emergence of location-sharing services is rapidly accelerating the convergence of our online and offline activities . in one direction , foursquare , google latitude , facebook places , and related services are enriching real-world venues with the social and semantic connections among online users . in analogy to how clickstreams have been successfully incorporated into traditional web-ranking based on content and link analysis , we propose to mine traffic-patterns revealed through location-sharing services to augment traditional location-based-search . concretely , we study location-based traffic-patterns revealed through location-sharing services and find that these traffic-patterns can identify semantically related locations . based on this observation , we propose and evaluate a traffic-driven location clustering-algorithm that can group semantically related locations with high confidence . through experimental-study of 12 million locations from foursquare , we extend this result through supervised location categorization , wherein traffic-patterns can be used to accurately predict the semantic category of uncategorized locations . based on these results , we show how traffic-driven semantic-organization of locations may be naturally incorporated into location-based-web-search .
