mining diabetes complication and treatment patterns for clinical-decision-support the fast development of hospital-information-systems (his) produces a large volume of electronic-medical-records , which provides a comprehensive source for exploratory-analysis and statistics to support clinical decision-making . in this paper , we investigate how to utilize the heterogeneous medical-records to aid the clinical treatments of diabetes-mellitus . diabetes-mellitus , simply diabetes , is a group of metabolic diseases , which is often accompanied with many complications . we propose a symptom-diagnosis-treatment model to mine the diabetes complication patterns and to unveil the latent association mechanism between treatments and symptoms from large volume of electronic-medical-records . furthermore , we study the demographic statistics of patient population w.r.t. complication patterns in real-data and observe several interesting phenomena . the discovered complication and treatment patterns can help physicians better understand their specialty and learn previous experiences . our experiments on a collection of one-year diabetes clinical-records from a famous geriatric hospital demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches .
