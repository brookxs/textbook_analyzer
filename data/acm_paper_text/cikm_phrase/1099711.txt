a novel approach for privacy-preserving-video-sharing to support privacy-preserving-video-sharing , we have proposed a novel framework that is able to protect the video-content-privacy at the individual video-clip level and prevent statistical-inferences from video collections . to protect the video-content-privacy at the individual video-clip level , we have developed an effective algorithm to automatically detect privacy-sensitive video objects and video-events . to prevent the statistical-inferences from video collections , we have developed a distributed-framework for privacy-preserving classifier-training , which is able to significantly reduce the costs of data-transmission and reliably limit the privacy breaches by determining the optimal size of blurred test samples for classifier validation . our experiments on a specific domain of patient training and counseling videos show convincing results .
