insights into explicit-semantic-analysis since its debut the explicit-semantic-analysis (esa) has received much attention in the ir community . esa has been proven to perform surprisingly well in several tasks and in different contexts . however , given the conceptual motivation for esa , recent work has observed unexpected behavior . in this paper we look at the foundations of esa from a theoretical point-of-view and employ a general probabilistic-model for term-weights which reveals how esa actually works . based on this model we explain some of the phenomena that have been observed in previous work and support our findings with new experiments . moreover , we provide a theoretical grounding on how the size and the composition of the index collection affect the esa-based computation of similarity values for texts .
