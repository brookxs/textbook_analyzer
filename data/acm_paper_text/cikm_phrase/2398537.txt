task tours : helping users tackle complex-search-tasks complex-search-tasks such as planning a vacation often comprise multiple-queries and may span a number of search-sessions . when engaged in such tasks , users may require holistic support in determining the required task activities . unfortunately , current search-engines do not offer such support to their users . in this paper , we propose methods to automatically generate task tours comprising a starting task and a set of relevant related tasks , some or all of which may be necessary to satisfy a user 's information-needs . applications of the tours include helping users understand the required steps to complete a task , finding urls related to the active task , and alerting users to activities they may have missed . we demonstrate through experimentation with human judges and large-scale search-logs that our tours are of good quality and can benefit a significant fraction of search-engine users .
