very efficient mining of distance-based-outliers in this work a novel algorithm , named dolphin , for detecting distance-based-outliers is presented . the proposed algorithm performs only two sequential scans of the dataset . it needs to store into main-memory a portion of the dataset , to efficiently search for neighbors and early prune inliers . the strategy pursued by the algorithm allows to keep this portion very small . both theoretical justification and empirical evidence that the size of the stored data amounts only to a few percent of the dataset are provided . another important feature of dolphin is that the memory-resident data are indexed by using a suitable proximity-search approach . this allows to search for nearest-neighbors looking only at a small subset of the main-memory stored data . temporal and spatial cost-analysis show that the novel algorithm achieves both near linear cpu and i/o cost . dolphin has been compared with state-of-the-art methods , showing that it outperforms existing ones .
