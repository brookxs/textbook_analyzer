sql database-primitives for decision-tree-classifiers scalable data mining in large-databases is one of today 's challenges to database-technologies . thus , substantial effort is dedicated to a tight-coupling of database and data-mining systems leading to database-primitives supporting data-mining tasks . in order to support a wide range of tasks and to be of general usage these primitives should be rather building-blocks than implementations of specific algorithms . in this paper , we describe primitives for building and applying decision-tree-classifiers . based on the analysis of available algorithms and previous work in this area we have identified operations which are useful for a number of classification algorithms . we discuss the implementation of these primitives on top of a commercial dbms and present experimental-results demonstrating the performance benefit .
