using a graph-based ontological-user-profile for personalizing search in this poster , we describe a personalized-search approach , which involves a graph-based-user-profile issued from ontology and a session-boundary-recognition mechanism . the user-profile refers to the short term user-interest and is used for re-ranking the search-results of queries in the same search-session . the session-boundary-recognition is based on tracking changes in the dominant concepts held by the query and the user-profile . experimental-evaluation was carried out using the hard 2003 trec collection and shows that our approach is effective .
