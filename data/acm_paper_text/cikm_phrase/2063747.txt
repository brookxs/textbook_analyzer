practical representations for web and social graphs in this paper we focus on representing web and social graphs . our work is motivated by the need of mining information out of these graphs , thus our representations do not only aim at compressing the graphs , but also at supporting efficient navigation . this allows us to process bigger graphs in main-memory , avoiding the slowdown brought by resorting on external-memory . we first show how by just partitioning the graph and combining two existing techniques for web-graph compression , k 2 - trees [brisaboa , ladra and navarro , spire 2009] and repair-graph [claude and navarro , tweb 2010] , exploiting the fact that most links are intra-domain , we obtain the best time/space trade-off for direct and reverse navigation when compared to the-state-of-the-art . in social-networks , splitting the graph to achieve a good decomposition is not easy . for this case , we explore a new proposal for indexing mp k linearizations [maserrat and pei , kdd 2010] , which have proven to be an effective way of representing social-networks in little space by exploiting common dense-subgraphs . our proposal offers better worst-case bounds in space and time , and is also a competitive alternative in practice .
