detecting anomalies in graphs with numeric labels this paper presents yagada , an algorithm to search labelled graphs for anomalies using both structural-data and numeric attributes . yagada is explained using several security-related examples and validated with experiments on a physical-access-control database . quantitative-analysis shows that in the upper range of anomaly thresholds , yagada detects twice as many anomalies as the best-performing numeric discretization algorithm . qualitative-evaluation shows that the detected anomalies are meaningful , representing a combination of structural irregularities and numerical outliers .
