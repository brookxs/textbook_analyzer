on bundle configuration for viral-marketing in social-networks prior research on viral-marketing mostly focuses on promoting one single product item . in this work , we explore the idea of bundling multiple-items for viral-marketing and formulate a new research problem , called bundle configuration for spread maximization (bcsam) . efficiently obtaining an optimal product bundle under the setting of bcsam is very challenging . aiming to strike a balance between the quality of solution and the computational-overhead , we systematically explore various heuristics to develop a suite of algorithms , including &#954; - bundle configuration and aggregated bundle configuration . moreover , we integrate all the proposed ideas into one efficient-algorithm , called aggregated bundle configuration (abc) . finally , we conduct an extensive performance-evaluation on our proposals . experimental-results show that abc significantly outperforms its counterpart and two baseline approaches in terms of both computational-overhead and bundle quality .
