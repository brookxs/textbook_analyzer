web-scale multi-task feature-selection for behavioral-targeting a typical behavioral-targeting system optimizing purchase activities , called conversions , faces two main challenges : the web-scale amounts of user histories to process on a daily basis , and the relative sparsity of conversions . in this paper , we try to address these challenges through feature-selection . we formulate a multi-task (or group) feature-selection problem among a set of related tasks (sharing a common set-of-features) , namely advertising campaigns . we apply a group-sparse penalty consisting of a combination of an l1 and l2 penalty and an associated fast optimization-algorithm for distributed parameter estimation . our algorithm relies on a variant of the well known fast iterative thresholding algorithm (fista) , a closed-form solution for mixed norm programming and a distributed subgradient oracle . to efficiently handle web-scale user histories , we present a distributed-inference algorithm for the problem that scales to billions of instances and millions of attributes . we show the superiority of our algorithm in terms of both sparsity and roc performance over baseline feature-selection methods (both single-task - regularization and multi-task mutual-information gain) .
