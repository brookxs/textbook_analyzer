searching web-databases by structuring keyword-based-queries on-line information-services have become widespread in the web nowadays . however , web users are non-specialized and have a great variety of interests . thus , interfaces for web-databases must be simple and uniform . in this paper we present an approach , based on bayesian-networks , for querying web-databases using keywords only . according to this approach , the user inputs a query through a simple search-box interface . from the input query , one or more plausible structured-queries are derived and submitted to web-databases . the results are then retrieved and presented to the user as ranked answers . our approach reduces the complexity of existing on-line interfaces and offers a solution to the problem of querying several distinct web-databases with a single interface . the applicability of the proposed approach was demonstrated by experimental-results with 3 databases , obtained with a prototype search-system that implements it . we have found that from 77 \ % to 95 \ % of the time , one of the top three resulting structured-queries is the proper one . further , when the user selects one of these three top queries for processing , the ranked answers present average-precision figures from 60 \ % to about 100 \ % .
