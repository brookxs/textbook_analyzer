efficient set-correlation operator inside databases large-scale of short-text records are now prevalent , such as news highlights , scientific paper citations , and posted messages in a discussion-forum , which are often stored as set records in (hidden) databases . many interesting information-retrieval-tasks are correspondingly raised on the correlation-query over these short-text records , such as finding hot-topics over news highlights and searching related scientific papers on a certain topic . however , current relational-database-management-systems (rdbms) do not directly provide support on set correlation-query . thus , in this paper , we address both the effectiveness and efficiency issues of set correlation-query over set records in databases . first , we present a framework of set correlation-query inside databases . to our best knowledge , only the pearson 's correlation can be implemented to construct token correlations by using rdbms facilities . thereby , we propose a novel correlation-coefficient to extend pearson 's correlation , and provide a pure-sql implementation inside databases . we further propose optimal strategies to set up correlation filtering threshold , which can greatly reduce the query time . our theoretical-analysis proves that , with a proper setting of filtering threshold , we can improve the query-efficiency with a little effectiveness loss . finally , we conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed correlation-query and optimization strategies .
