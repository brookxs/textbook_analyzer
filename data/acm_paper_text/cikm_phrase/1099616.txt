localized routing trees for query-processing in sensor-networks in this paper , we propose a novel energy-efficient approach , a localized-routing-tree (lrt) coupled with a route redirection (rr) strategy , to support various types of queries . lrts take care of the sensors near the sink and reduce the energy-consumption of these sensors , and rr reduces the energy-cost of data receptions . compared to the existing approaches , simulation-studies show that lrt together with rr has significant improvement on the query capacity .
