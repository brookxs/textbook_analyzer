automatically classifying database workloads the type of the workload on a database-management-system (dbms) is a key consideration in tuning the system . allocations for resources such as main-memory can be very different depending on whether the workload type is online-transaction-processing (oltp) or decision-support-system (dss) . in this paper , we present an approach to automatically identifying a dbms workload as either oltp or dss . we build a classification-model based on the most significant workload characteristics that differentiate oltp from dss , and then use the model to identify any change in the workload type . we construct a workload classifier from the browsing and ordering profiles of the tpc-w benchmark . experiments with an industry-supplied workload show that our classifier accurately identifies the mix of oltp and dss work within an application workload .
