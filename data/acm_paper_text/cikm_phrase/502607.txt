keeping found things found on the web this paper describes the results of an observational-study into the methods people use to manage web-information for re-use . people observed in our study used a diversity of methods and associated tools . for example , several participants emailed web addresses (urls) along with comments to themselves and to others . other methods observed included printing out web-pages , saving web-pages to the hard drive , pasting the address for a web-page into a document and pasting the address into a personal-web site . ironically , two web-browser tools that have been explicitly developed to help users track web-information - the bookmarking tool and the history-list - were not widely used by participants in this study . a functional-analysis helps to explain the observed diversity of methods . methods vary widely in the functions they provide . for example , a web address pasted into a self-addressed email can provide an important reminding function together with a context of relevance : the email arrives in an inbox which is checked at regular intervals and the email can include a few lines of text that explain the url 's relevance and the actions to be taken . on the other hand , for most users in the study , the bookmarking tool (`` favorites '' or `` bookmarks '' depending on the browser) provided neither a reminding function nor a context of relevance . the functional-analysis can help to assess the likely success of various tools , current and proposed .
