a function-based access-control-model for xml-databases xml-documents are frequently used in applications such as business-transactions and medical-records involving sensitive-information . typically , parts of documents should be visible to users depending on their roles . for instance , an insurance agent may see the billing information part of a medical document but not the details of the patient 's medical history . access-control on the basis of data-location or value in an xml-document is therefore essential . in practice , the number of access-control rules is on the order of millions , which is a product of the number of document types (in 1000 's) and the number of user-roles (in 100 's) . therefore , the solution requires high scalability-and-performance . current approaches to access-control over xml-documents have suffered from scalability problems because they tend to work on individual documents . in this paper , we propose a novel approach to xml-access-control through rule-functions that are managed separately from the documents . a rule function is an executable-code fragment that encapsulates the access rules (paths and predicates) , and is shared by all documents of the same document-type . at runtime , the rule-functions corresponding to the access request are executed to determine the accessibility of document fragments . using synthetic and real-data , we show the scalability of the scheme by comparing the accessibility-evaluation cost of two rule function models . we show that the rule-functions generated on user basis is more efficient for xml-databases .
