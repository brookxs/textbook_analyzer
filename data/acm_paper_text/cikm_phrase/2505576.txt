mining-based compression approach of propositional formulae in this paper , we propose a first application of data mining techniques to propositional-satisfiability . our proposed mining_based compression approach aims to discover and to exploit hidden structural-knowledge for reducing the size of propositional formulae in conjunctive-normal-form (cnf) . it combines both frequent-itemset-mining techniques and tseitin 's encoding for a compact-representation of cnf formulae . the experimental-evaluation of our approach shows interesting reductions of the sizes of many application-instances taken from the last sat competitions .
