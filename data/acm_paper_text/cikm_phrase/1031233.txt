clustermap : labeling clusters in large-datasets via visualization with the rapid increase of data in many areas , clustering on large-datasets has become an important problem in data-analysis . since cluster-analysis is a highly iterative-process , cluster-analysis on large-datasets prefers short iteration on a relatively small representative set . thus , a two-phase framework `` sampling/summarization - iterative cluster-analysis '' is often applied in practice . since the clustering result only labels the small representative set , there are problems with extending the result to the entire large dataset , which are almost ignored by the traditional clustering research . this extending is often named as labeling process . labeling irregular shaped clusters , distinguishing outliers and extending cluster boundary are the main problems in this stage . we address these problems and propose a visualization-based approach to dealing with them precisely . this approach partially involves human into the process of defining and refining the structure `` clustermap '' . based on this structure , the clustermap algorithm scans the large dataset to adapt the boundary extension and generate the cluster-labels for the entire dataset . experimental result shows that clustermap can preserve cluster quality considerably with low computational cost , compared to the distance-comparison-based labeling algorithms .
