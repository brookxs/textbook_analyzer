detecting topic-evolution in scientific-literature : how can citations help ? understanding how topics in scientific-literature evolve is an interesting and important problem . previous work simply models each paper as a bag-of-words and also considers the impact of authors . however , the impact of one document on another as captured by citations , one important inherent element in scientific-literature , has not been considered . in this paper , we address the problem of understanding topic-evolution by leveraging citations , and develop citation-aware approaches . we propose an iterative topic-evolution learning-framework by adapting the latent-dirichlet-allocation model to the citation-network and develop a novel inheritance-topic-model . we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches and compare with the-state-of-the-art approaches on a large-collection of more than 650,000 research papers in the last 16 years and the citation-network enabled by citeseerx . the results clearly show that citations can help to understand topic-evolution better .
