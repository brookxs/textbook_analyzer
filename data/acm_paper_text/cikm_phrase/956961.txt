extracting unstructured-data from template generated web-documents we propose a novel approach that identifies web-page templates and extracts the unstructured-data . extracting only the body of the page and eliminating the template increases the retrieval-precision for the queries that generate irrelevant results . we believe that by reducing the number of irrelevant results ; the users are encouraged to go back to a given site to search . our experimental-results on several different web-sites and on the whole cnnfn collection demonstrate the feasibility of our approach .
