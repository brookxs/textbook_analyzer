evidence of quality of textual-features on the web-2.0 the growth of popularity of web-2.0-applications greatly increased the amount of social-media content available on the internet . however , the unsupervised , user-oriented nature of this source of information , and thus , its potential lack of quality , have posed a challenge to information-retrieval (ir) services . previous work focuses mostly only on tags , although a consensus about its effectiveness as supporting information for ir services has not yet been reached . moreover , other textual-features of the-web 2.0 are generally overseen by previous research . in this context , this work aims at assessing the relative quality of distinct textual-features available on the web-2.0 . towards this goal , we analyzed four features (title , tags , description and comments) in four popular applications (citeulike , last.fm , yahoo! video , and youtube) . firstly , we characterized data from these applications in order to extract evidence of quality of each feature with respect to usage , amount of content , descriptive and discriminative power as well as of content diversity across features . afterwards , a series of classification experiments were conducted as a case-study for quality-evaluation . characterization and classification results indicate that : 1) when considered separately , tags is the most promising feature , achieving the best classification results , although its absence in a non-negligible fraction of objects may affect its potential use ; and 2) each feature may bring different pieces of information , and combining their contents can improve classification .
