fusiondb : conflict-management system for small-science databases in this paper , we demonstrate the fusiondb system ; an extended relational database engine for managing conflicts in small-science databases . in small sciences , groups -- each consists of few scientists -- may share and exchange parts of their own databases among each other to foster collaboration . the goal of such sharing , especially when done at early stages of the discovery process , is not to build a warehouse or a unified schema , instead the goal is to compare and verify results , detect and assess conflicts , and possibly modify or re-design the discovery process . fusiondb is designed to meet the requirements and address the challenges of such sharing model . we will demonstrate the key functionalities of fusiondb including : (1) detecting conflicts using a rule-based-model over heterogeneous-schemas , (2) assessing conflicts and providing probabilistic estimates for values ' correctness , (3) extended querying capabilities in the presence of conflicts , and (4) providing curation operations to help scientists resolve and investigate conflicts according to different priorities . fusiondb is realized on top of postgresql dbms .
