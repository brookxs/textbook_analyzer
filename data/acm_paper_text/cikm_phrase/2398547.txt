consento : a new framework for opinion_based entity-search and summarization search-engines have become an important decision-making tool today . decision-making queries are often subjective , such as `` a good birthday present for my girlfriend '' , `` best action movies in 2010 '' , to name a few . unfortunately , such queries may not be answered properly by conventional search systems . in order to address this problem , we introduce consento , a consensus search-engine designed to answer subjective queries . consento performs segment indexing , as opposed to document-indexing , to capture semantics from user opinions more precisely . in particular , we define a new indexing unit , maximal coherent semantic unit (mcsu) . an mcsu represents a segment of a document , which captures a single coherent semantic . we also introduce a new ranking-method , called consensusrank that counts online-comments referring to an entity as a weighted-vote . in order to validate the efficacy of the proposed framework , we compare consento with standard retrieval-models and their recent extensions for opinion_based entity-ranking . experiments using movie and hotel data show the effectiveness of our framework .
