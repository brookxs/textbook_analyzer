edsc : efficient density-based subspace-clustering subspace-clustering mines clusters hidden in subspaces of high-dimensional-data sets . density-based approaches have been shown to successfully mine clusters of arbitrary shape even in the presence of noise in full space clustering . exhaustive-search of all density-based subspace clusters , however , results in infeasible runtimes for large high-dimensional-data sets . this is due to the exponential number of possible subspace projections in addition to the high computational cost of density-based-clustering . in this paper , we propose lossless efficient detection of density-based subspace clusters . in our edsc (efficient density-based subspace-clustering) algorithm we reduce the high computational cost of density-based subspace-clustering by a complete multistep filter-and-refine algorithm . our first hypercube filter step avoids exhaustive-search of all regions in all subspaces by enclosing potentially density-based clusters in hypercubes . our second filter step provides additional pruning based on a density monotonicity property . in the final refinement step , the exact unbiased density-based subspace-clustering result is detected . as we prove that pruning is lossless in both filter steps , we guarantee completeness of the result . in thorough experiments on synthetic and real-world data-sets , we demonstrate substantial efficiency gains . our lossless edsc approach outperforms existing density-based subspace-clustering algorithms by orders of magnitude .
