misuse-detection for information-retrieval-systems we present a novel approach to detect misuse within an information-retrieval-system by gathering and maintaining knowledge of the behavior of the user rather than anticipating attacks by unknown assailants . our approach is based on building and maintaining a profile of the behavior of the system user through tracking , or monitoring of user-activity within the information-retrieval-system . any new activity of the user is compared to the user-profile to detect a potential misuse for the authorized user . we propose four different methods to detect misuse in information-retrieval-systems . our experimental-results on $ 2 $ gb collection favorably demonstrate the validity of our approach .
