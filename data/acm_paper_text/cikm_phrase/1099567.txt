intelligent creation of notification events in information-systems : concept , implementation and evaluation an important feature of information-systems is the ability to inform users about changes of the stored information . therefore , systems have to ` know ' what changes a user wants to be informed about . this is well known from the field of publish - / subscribe architectures . in this paper , we propose a solution for information-system designers of how to extend their information-model in a way that the notification mechanism can consider semantic-knowledge when determining which parties to inform . two different kinds of implementations are introduced and evaluated : one based on aspect-oriented-programming (aop) , the other one based on traditional database-triggers . the evaluation of both approaches leads to a combined approach preserving the advantages of both techniques , using model-driven-architecture (mda) to create the triggers from a uml-model enhanced with stereotypes .
