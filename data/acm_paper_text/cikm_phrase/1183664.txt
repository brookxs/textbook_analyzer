a data-stream language and system designed for power and extensibility by providing an integrated and optimized support for user-defined aggregates (udas) , data-stream-management-systems (dsms) can achieve superior power and generality while preserving compatibility with current sql standards . this is demonstrated by the stream mill system that , through is expressive stream language (esl) , efficiently supports a wide range of applications - including very advanced ones such as data-stream-mining , streaming-xml-processing , time-series queries , and rfid event-processing . esl supports physical and logical windows (with optional slides and tumbles) on both built-in aggregates and udas , using a simple framework that applies uniformly to both aggregate-functions written in an external procedural languages and those natively written in esl . the constructs introduced in esl extend the power and generality of dsms , and are conducive to uda-specific optimization and efficient execution as demonstrated by several experiments .
