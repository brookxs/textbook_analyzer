automatic-construction of multifaceted browsing interfaces databases of text and text-annotated data constitute a significant fraction of the information available in electronic-form . searching and browsing are the typical ways that users locate items of interest in such databases . interfaces that use multifaceted-hierarchies represent a new powerful browsing paradigm which has been proven to be a successful complement to keyword searching . thus far , multifaceted-hierarchies have been created manually or semi-automatically , making it difficult to deploy multifaceted interfaces over a large number of databases . we present automatic and scalable methods for creation of multifaceted interfaces . our methods are integrated with traditional relational-databases and can scale well for large-databases . furthermore , we present methods for selecting the best portions of the generated hierarchies when the screen-space is not sufficient for displaying all the hierarchy at once . we apply our technique to a range of large-data-sets , including annotated images , television programming schedules , and web-pages . the results are promising and suggest directions for future-research .
