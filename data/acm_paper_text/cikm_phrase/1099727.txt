query-expansion using random-walk models it has long been recognized that capturing term-relationships is an important aspect of information-retrieval . even with large amounts of data , we usually only have significant evidence for a fraction of all potential term pairs . it is therefore important to consider whether multiple sources of evidence may be combined to predict term relations more accurately . this is particularly important when trying to predict the probability of relevance of a set of terms given a query , which may involve both lexical and semantic-relations between the terms.we describe a markov-chain framework that combines multiple-sources-of-knowledge on term associations . the stationary-distribution of the model is used to obtain probability-estimates that a potential expansion term reflects aspects of the original query . we use this model for query-expansion and evaluate the effectiveness of the model by examining the accuracy and robustness of the expansion methods , and investigate the relative effectiveness of various sources of term evidence . statistically significant differences in accuracy were observed depending on the weighting of evidence in the random-walk . for example , using co-occurrence data later in the walk was generally better than using it early , suggesting further improvements in effectiveness may be possible by learning walk behaviors .
