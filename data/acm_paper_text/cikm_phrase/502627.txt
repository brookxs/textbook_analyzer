evaluation of item-based top - n recommendation-algorithms the explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender-systems -- a personalized-information filtering technology used to identify a set of n items that will be of interest to a certain user . user-based-collaborative-filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender-systems to date , and is extensively used in many commercial recommender-systems . unfortunately , the computational-complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers that in typical commercial-applications can grow to be several millions . to address these scalability concerns item-based recommendation techniques have been developed that analyze the user-item-matrix to identify relations between the different items , and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.in this paper we present one such class of item-based recommendation-algorithms that first determine the similarities between the various items and then used them to identify the set of items to be recommended . the key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items , and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item . our experimental-evaluation on five different datasets show that the proposed item-based algorithms are up to 28 times faster than the traditional user-neighborhood based recommender-systems and provide recommendations whose quality is up to 27 \ % better .
