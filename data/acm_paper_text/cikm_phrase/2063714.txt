memory-less unsupervised-clustering for data-streaming by versatile ellipsoidal function the challenge of clustering on data-stream is the ability to deal with the continuous incoming data which are unlimited and unable to store all of them . to manage the storage crisis , the data must be processed in a single pass or only once after the arrival and are thrown away outer . all previously clustered data must be mathematically captured in terms of group features since those data are already non-existent . the proposed data-stream-clustering algorithm is divided into two main phases , namely on-line and off-line . in the on-line phase , new micro-cluster features are proposed . our micro-cluster features better represent the arriving data than the traditional micro-cluster features . in the off-line phase , the prepared micro-clusters are categorized by their densities . the proposed method can generate the final clusters with different shapes and densities . based on entropy , purity , jaccard-coefficient , and rand statistic measures , our algorithm being applied on synthetic and real-data outperforms the other previous data-stream-clustering algorithms .
