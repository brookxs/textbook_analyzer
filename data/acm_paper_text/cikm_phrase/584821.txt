an object-oriented extension of xml for autonomous web-applications while the idea of extending xml to include object-oriented features has been gaining popularity in general , the potential of inheritance in document-design has not been well recognized in contemporary research . in this paper we demonstrate that xml with dynamic inheritance aids better document designs and decreased management overheads and support increased autonomy . as an extended application , we point out that dynamic inheritance also helps effective automated web portal and ontology designs.we present an object-oriented extension to the language of xml to include dynamic inheritance and describe a middle layer that implements our system . we explain our system with several practical examples .
