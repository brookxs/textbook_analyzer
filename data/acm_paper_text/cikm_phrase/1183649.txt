multi-evidence , multi-criteria , lazy associative document classification we present a novel approach for classifying documents that combines different pieces of evidence (e.g. , textual-features of documents , links , and citations) transparently , through a data-mining technique which generates rules associating these pieces of evidence to predefined classes . these rules can contain any number and mixture of the available evidence and are associated with several quality-criteria which can be used in conjunction to choose the `` best '' rule to be applied at classification time . our method is able to perform evidence enhancement by link forwarding/backwarding (i.e. , navigating among documents related through citation) , so that new pieces of link-based evidence are derived when necessary . furthermore , instead of inducing a single model (or rule-set) that is good on average for all predictions , the proposed approach employs a lazy method which delays the inductive process until a document is given for classification , therefore taking advantage of better qualitative evidence coming from the document . we conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed approach using documents from the acm digital-library and from a brazilian web-directory . our approach was able to outperform in both collections all classifiers based on the best available evidence in isolation as well as state-of-the-art multi-evidence classifiers . we also evaluated our approach using the standard webkb collection , where our approach showed gains of 1 \ % in accuracy , being 25 times faster . further , our approach is extremely efficient in terms of computational performance , showing gains of more than one order of magnitude when compared against other multi-evidence classifiers .
