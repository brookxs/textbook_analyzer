on relevance , time and query-expansion we present the results of our exploratory-analysis on the relationship that exists between relevance and time . we observe how the amount of documents published in a given interval of time is related to the probability of relevance , and , using the time-series-analysis , we show the existence of a correlation between time and relevance . as an initial application of this analysis , we study query-expansion exploiting the detection of publication time peaks over the blog06 collection . we finally propose an effective approach for the query-expansion in the blog-search domain . our approach is based on the documents publication trend being so completely independent of any external resource .
