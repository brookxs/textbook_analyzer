ontology-module-extraction for ontology-reuse : an ontology-engineering perspective problems resulting from the management of shared , distributed knowledge has led to ontologies being employed as a solution , in order to effectively integrate information across applications . this is dependent on having ways to share and reuse existing ontologies ; with the increased availability of ontologies on the web , some of which include thousands of concepts , novel and more efficient methods for reuse are being devised . one possible way to achieve efficient ontology-reuse is through the process of ontology-module-extraction . a novel approach to ontology-module-extraction is presented that aims to achieve more efficient reuse of very-large-ontologies ; the motivation is drawn from an ontology-engineering perspective . this paper provides a definition of ontology modules from the reuse perspective and an approach to module extraction based on such a definition . an abstract graph-model for module extraction has been defined , along with a module extraction-algorithm . the novel contribution of this paper is a module extraction-algorithm that is independent of the language in which the ontology is expressed . this has been implemented in modtool ; a tool that produces ontology modules via extraction . experiments were conducted to compare modtool to other modularisation methods .
