representing interests as a hyperlinked document-collection we describe a latent-variable-model for representing a user 's interests as a hyperlinked document-collection . by collecting hyper-text documents that a user-views , creates or updates whilst at their computer , we are able to use not only the content of these documents but also the inter-connectivity of the collection to model the user 's interests . the model uses probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis and probabilistic hypertext induced topic-selection and decomposes the user 's document-collection into a set of factors each of which represents a user 's interest . this model can be used to personalise information-access tasks such as a personalised-search engine or a personalised news-service . our latent-variable-model 's performance is compared with that of a more conventional vector-space clustering-algorithm .
