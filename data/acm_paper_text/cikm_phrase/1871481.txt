preference-query evaluation over expensive attributes most database-systems allow query-processing over attributes that are derived at query runtime (e.g. , user-defined-functions and remote-data calls to web-services) , making them expensive to compute relative to relational-data stored in a heap or index . in addition , core support for efficient preference-query-processing has become an important objective in database-systems . this paper addresses an important problem at the intersection of these two query-processing objectives : efficient preference-query evaluation involving expensive attributes . we explore an efficient framework for processing skyline and multi-objective queries in a database when the data involves a mix of `` cheap '' and `` expensive '' attributes . our solution involves a three-phase approach that evaluates a correct final preference answer while aiming to minimizing the number of expensive attributes computations . unlike previous works for distributed preference algorithms that assume sorted access over each attribute , our framework assumes expensive attribute requests are stateless , i.e. , know nothing previous requests . thus , the proposed approach is more in line with realistic system-architectures . our framework is implemented inside the query-processor of postgresql , and evaluated over both synthetic and real-data sets involving computation of expensive attributes over real web-service data (e.g. , microsoft mappoint) .
