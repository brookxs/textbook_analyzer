detecting offensive tweets via topical feature-discovery over a large-scale twitter corpus in this paper , we propose a novel semi-supervised-approach for detecting profanity-related offensive content in twitter . our approach exploits linguistic regularities in profane language via statistical topic modeling on a huge twitter corpus , and detects offensive tweets using automatically these generated features . our approach performs competitively with a variety of machine-learning (ml) algorithms . for instance , our approach achieves a true-positive-rate (tp) of 75.1 % over 4029 testing tweets using logistic-regression , significantly outperforming the popular keyword matching baseline , which has a tp of 69.7 % , while keeping the false-positive-rate (fp) at the same level as the baseline at about 3.77 % . our approach provides an alternative to large-scale hand annotation efforts required by fully supervised-learning approaches .
