minimal common container of tree patterns tree patterns represent important fragments of xpath . in this paper , we show that some classes of tree patterns exhibit such a property that , given a finite number of tree patterns p 1 , ... , p n , there exists another pattern p (tree-pattern or dag-pattern) such that p 1 , ... , p n , are all contained in p , and for any tree-pattern q belonging to a given class c , p 1 , ... , p n , are contained in q implies p is contained in q .
