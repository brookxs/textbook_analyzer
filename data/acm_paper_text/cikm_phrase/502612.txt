induction of integrated view for xml-data with heterogeneous dtds this paper proposes a novel approach to integrating heterogeneous xml dtds . with this approach , an information-agent can be easily extended to integrate heterogeneous xml-based contents and perform federated-search . based on a tree-grammar inference-technique , this approach derives an integrated view of xml dtds in an information-integration framework . the derivation takes advantages of naming and structural similarities among dtds in similar domains . the complete approach consists of three main steps . (1) dtd clustering clusters dtds in similar domains into classes . (2) schema learning applies a tree-grammar inference-technique to generate a set of tree-grammar rules from the dtds in a class from the previous step . (3) minimization optimizes the rules generated in the previous step and transforms them into an integrated view . we have implemented the proposed approach into a system called deep and tested the system on artificial and real domains . the experimental-results reveal that this system can effectively and efficiently integrate radically different dtds .
