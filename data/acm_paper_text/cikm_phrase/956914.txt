flexible intrinsic-evaluation of hierarchical-clustering for tdt the topic-detection-and-tracking (tdt) evaluation program has included a `` cluster-detection '' task since its inception in 1996 . systems were required to process a stream of broadcast-news stories and partition them into non-overlapping clusters . a system 's effectiveness was measured by comparing the generated clusters to `` truth '' clusters created by human-annotators . starting in 2003 , tdt is moving to a more realistic model that permits overlapping-clusters (stories may be on more than one topic) and encourages the creation of a hierarchy to structure the relationships between clusters (topics) . we explore a range of possible evaluation models for this modified tdt clustering task to understand the best approach for mapping between the human-generated `` truth '' clusters and a much richer hierarchical-structure . we demonstrate that some obvious evaluation-techniques fail for degenerate cases . for a few others we attempt to develop an intuitive sense of what the evaluation numbers mean . we settle on some approaches that incorporate a strong balance between cluster errors (misses and false-alarms) and the distance it takes to travel between stories within the hierarchy .
