the visual funding navigator : analysis of the nsf funding information this paper presents an interactive-visualization toolkit for navigating and analyzing the national-science-foundation (nsf) funding information . our design builds upon an improved 2.5 d treemap layout and the stacked-graph to contribute customized techniques for visually navigating and interacting with the hierarchical-data of nsf programs and proposals . furthermore , an incremental layout method is adopted to handle information on a large-scale . the improved treemap visualization will help to visually analyze the static funding related data and the stacked-graph is utilized to analyze the time-series-data . through these visual-analysis techniques , research-trends of nsf , popular nsf programs are quickly identified .
