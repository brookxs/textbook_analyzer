effective and efficient similarity-search in time-series we present dsa - derivative time-series segment approximation , a novel representation-model for time-series designed for effective and efficient similarity-search . dsa substantially exploits derivative estimation , segmentation and dimensionality-reduction to meet at least the requirements of high sensitivity to main features (trends) of time-series and robustness to outliers . experiments show that dsa is drastically faster and still as good or better than the prominent state-of-the-art similarity methods .
