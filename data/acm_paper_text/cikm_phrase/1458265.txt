transaction-reordering with application to synchronized-scans traditional workload-management methods mainly focus on the current system status while information about the interaction between queued and running transactions is largely ignored . an exception to this is the transaction-reordering method , which reorders the transaction sequence submitted to the rdbms and improves the transaction-throughput by considering both the current system status and information about the interaction between queued and running transactions . the existing transaction-reordering method only considers the reordering opportunities provided by analyzing the lock conflict information among multiple transactions . this significantly limits the applicability of the transaction-reordering method . in this paper , we extend the existing transaction-reordering method into a general transaction-reordering framework that can incorporate various factors as the reordering criteria . we show that by analyzing the resource-utilization information of transactions , the transaction-reordering method can also improve the system-throughput by increasing the resource-sharing opportunities among multiple transactions . we provide a concrete example on synchronized-scans and demonstrate the advantages of our method through experiments with a commercial parallel rdbms .
