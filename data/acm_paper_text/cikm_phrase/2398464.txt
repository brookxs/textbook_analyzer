a simple approach to the design of site-level extractors using domain-centric principles we consider the problem of extracting , in a domain-centric fashion , a given set of attributes from a large number of semi-structured websites . previous approaches [7 , 5] to solve this problem are based on page level inference . we propose a distinct new approach that directly chooses attribute extractors for a site using a scoring mechanism that is designed at the domain level via simple classification-methods using a training-set from a small number of sites . to keep the number of candidate extractors in each site manageably small we use two observations that hold in most domains : (a) imprecise annotators can be used to identify a small set of candidate extractors for a few attributes (anchors) ; and (b) non-anchor attributes lie in close proximity to the anchor attributes . experiments on three domains (events , books and restaurants) show that our approach is very effective in spite of its simplicity .
