imbalanced sentiment-classification sentiment-classification has undergone significant development in recent years . however , most existing studies assume the balance between negative and positive samples , which may not be true in reality . in this paper , we investigate imbalanced sentiment-classification instead . in particular , a novel clustering-based stratified under-sampling framework and a centroid-directed smoothing strategy are proposed to address the imbalanced class and feature distribution problems respectively . evaluation across different datasets shows the effectiveness of both the under-sampling framework and the smoothing strategy in handling the imbalanced problems in real sentiment-classification applications .
