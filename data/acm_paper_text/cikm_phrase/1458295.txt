coreex : content-extraction from online-news articles we developed and tested a heuristic technique for extracting the main article from news site web-pages . we construct the dom-tree of the page and score every node based on the amount of text , the number of links it contains and additional heuristics . the method is site-independent and does not use any language-based features . we tested our algorithm on a set of 1120 news article pages from 27 domains . our algorithm achieved over 97 \ % precision and 98 \ % recall , and an average processing speed of under 15ms per page .
