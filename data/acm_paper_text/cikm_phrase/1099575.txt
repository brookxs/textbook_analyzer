securing xml-data in third-party distribution-systems web-based third-party architectures for data-publishing are today receiving growing attention , due to their scalability and the ability to efficiently manage large numbers of users and great amounts of data . a third-party-architecture relies on a distinction between the owner and the publisher of information . the owner is the producer of information , whereas publisher provides data-management services and query-processing functions for (a portion of) the owner 's information . in such architecture , there are important security concerns especially if we do not want to make any assumption on the trustworthy of the publishers . although approaches have been proposed [4 , 5] providing partial-solutions to this problem , no comprehensive framework has been so far developed able to support all the most important security-properties in the presence of an untrusted publisher . in this paper , we develop an xml-based solution to such problem , which makes use of non-conventional digital-signature techniques and queries over encrypted-data .
