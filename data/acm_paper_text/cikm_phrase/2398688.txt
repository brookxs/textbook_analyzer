predicting ctr of new ads via click-prediction predicting ctr of ads on the search result page is an urgent topic . the reason for this is that choosing the right advertisement greatly affects revenue of the search-engine and advertisers and user 's satisfaction . for ads with the large click history it is quite clear how to predict ctr by utilizing statistical-data . but for new ads with a poor click history such approach is not robust and reliable . we suggest a model for predicting ctr of such new ads . contrary to the previous models of predicting ctr of new ads , our model uses events - clicks and skips1 instead of the observed ctr . in addition we have implemented several novel features , that resulted into the increase of the performance of our model . offline and online experiments on the real search-engine system demonstrated that our model outperforms the baseline and the approaches suggested in previous papers .
