learning spectral-embedding via iterative eigenvalue thresholding learning data-representation is a fundamental problem in data-mining and machine-learning . spectral-embedding is one popular method for learning effective data representations . in this paper we propose a novel framework to learn enhanced spectral-embedding , which not only considers the geometrical structure of the data-space , but also takes advantage of the given pairwise-constraints . the proposed formulation can be solved by an iterative eigenvalue thresholding (iet) algorithm . specially , we convert the problem of learning spectral-embedding with pairwise-constraints into the one of completing an `` ideal '' kernel matrix . and we introduce the spectral-embedding of graph-laplacian as the auxiliary-information and cast it as a small-scale positive semidefinite (psd) matrix optimization-problem with nuclear-norm regularization . then , we develop an iet algorithm to solve it efficiently . moreover , we also present an effective semi-supervised-clustering (ssc) approach with learned spectral-embedding (lse) . finally , we validate the proposed iet algorithm and lse approach by extensive experiments on real-world-data sets .
