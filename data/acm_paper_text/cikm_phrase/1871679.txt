learning-to-rank with groups an essential issue in document-retrieval is ranking , and the documents are ranked by their expected relevance to a given query . multiple labels are used to represent different level of relevance for documents to a given query , and the corresponding label values are used to quantify the relevance of the documents . according to the training-set for a given query , the documents can be divided into several groups . specifically , the documents with the same label are assigned to the same group . if the documents in the group with higher relevance label can always be ranked higher over the ones in groups with lower relevance label by a ranking-model , it is reasonable to expect perfect ranking-performance . inspired by this idea , we propose a novel framework for learning-to-rank , which depends on two new samples . the first one is one-group constituted by one document with higher level label and a group of documents with lower level label ; the second one is group-group constituted by a group of documents with higher level label and a group of documents with lower level label . a novel loss-function is proposed based on the likelihood loss similar to listmle . we demonstrate the advantages of our approaches on the letor 3.0 data-set . experimental-results show that our approaches are effective in improving the ranking-performance .
