mining social-networks using heat-diffusion processes for marketing candidates selection social-network marketing techniques employ pre-existing social-networks to increase brands or products awareness through word-of-mouth promotion . full understanding of social-network marketing and the potential candidates that can thus be marketed to certainly offer lucrative opportunities for prospective sellers . due to the complexity of social-networks , few models exist to interpret social-network marketing realistically . we propose to model social-network marketing using heat-diffusion processes . this paper presents three diffusion-models , along with three algorithms for selecting the best individuals to receive marketing samples . these approaches have the following advantages to best illustrate the properties of real-world social-networks : (1) we can plan a marketing strategy sequentially in time since we include a time-factor in the simulation of product adoptions ; (2) the algorithm of selecting marketing candidates best represents and utilizes the clustering property of real-world social-networks ; and (3) the model we construct can diffuse both positive and negative comments on products or brands in order to simulate the complicated communications within social-networks . our work represents a novel approach to the analysis of social network-marketing , and is the first work to propose how to defend against negative comments within social-networks . complexity-analysis shows our model is also scalable to very-large social-networks .
