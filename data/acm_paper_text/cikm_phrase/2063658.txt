content-driven detection of campaigns in social-media we study the problem of detecting coordinated free-text campaigns in large-scale social-media . these campaigns -- ranging from coordinated spam messages to promotional and advertising campaigns to political astro-turfing -- are growing in significance and reach with the commensurate rise of massive-scale social-systems . often linked by common `` talking points '' , there has been little research in detecting these campaigns . hence , we propose and evaluate a content-driven framework for effectively linking free-text posts with common `` talking points '' and extracting campaigns from large-scale social-media . one of the salient aspects of the framework is an investigation of graph-mining techniques for isolating coherent campaigns from large message-based graphs . through an experimental-study over millions of twitter-messages we identify five major types of campaigns -- spam , promotion , template , news , and celebrity campaigns -- and we show how these campaigns may be extracted with high precision and recall .
