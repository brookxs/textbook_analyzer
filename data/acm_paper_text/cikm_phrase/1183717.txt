cache-oblivious nested-loop joins we propose to adapt the newly emerged cache-oblivious-model to relational-query processing . our goal is to automatically achieve an overall performance comparable to that of fine-tuned algorithms on a multi-level memory hierarchy . this automaticity is because cache-oblivious-algorithms assume no knowledge about any specific parameter-values , such as the capacity and block-size of each level of the hierarchy . as a first step , we propose recursive-partitioning to implement cache-oblivious nested-loop joins (nljs) without indexes , and recursive-clustering and buffering to implement cache-oblivious nljs with indexes . our theoretical results and empirical evaluation on three different architectures show that our cache-oblivious nljs match the performance of their manually optimized , cache-conscious counterparts .
