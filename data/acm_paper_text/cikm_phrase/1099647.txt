discretization_based learning-approach to information-retrieval we have designed a representation-scheme , which is based on the discrete representation of a document-ranking function , which is capable of reproducing and enhancing the properties of such popular-ranking functions as tf.idf , bm25 or those based on language-models . our tests have demonstrated the capability of our approach to achieve the performance of the best known scoring-functions solely through training , without using any known heuristic or analytic formulas .
