introducing semantics in conceptual-schema reuse although standard-components ' manufacture and reuse is common practice in many engineering domains (e.g. electrical and mechanical-engineering) , this is not yet the case with respect to software-development . ironically , in such a highly automated domain , users still fail to find available components that match their needs faster than developing them again . the gap between what designers expect from reuse (and how it should be offered) , and the actual reuse attempts remains the main barrier . this paper deals with conceptual-schema construction in terms of reuse and the respective semantic requirements . it proposes a semantic-retrieval mechanism based on imprecise-queries for the reuse of conceptual-schema components .
