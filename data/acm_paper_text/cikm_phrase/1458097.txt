error-driven generalist + experts (edge) : a multi-stage ensemble framework for text-categorization we introduce a multi-stage ensemble framework , error-driven generalist + expert or edge , for improved classification on large-scale text categorization problems . edge first trains a generalist , capable of classifying under all classes , to deliver a reasonably accurate initial category-ranking given an instance . edge then computes a confusion graph for the generalist and allocates the learning-resources to train experts on relatively small-groups of classes that tend to be systematically confused with one another by the generalist . the experts ' votes , when invoked on a given instance , yield a reranking of the classes , thereby correcting the errors of the generalist . our evaluations showcase the improved classification and ranking-performance on several large-scale text categorization datasets . edge is in particular efficient when the underlying learners are efficient . our study of confusion graphs is also of independent interest .
