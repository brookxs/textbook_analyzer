comparing the effectiveness of hits and salsa this paper compares the effectiveness of two well-known query-dependent link-based-ranking algorithms , `` hyperlink-induced topic search '' (hits) and the `` stochastic approach for link-structure analysis '' (salsa) . the two algorithms are evaluated on a very-large web graph induced by 463 million crawled web-pages and a set of 28,043 queries and 485,656 results labeled by human judges . we employed three different performance-measures - mean-average-precision (map) , mean reciprocal rank (mrr) , and normalized-discounted-cumulative-gain (ndcg) . we found that as an isolated feature , salsa substantially outperforms hits . this is quite surprising , given that the two algorithms operate over the same neighborhood-graph induced by the query result set . we also studied the combination of salsa and hits with bm25f , a state-of-the-art text-based scoring-function that incorporates anchor-text . we found that the combination of salsa and bm25f outperforms the combination of hits and bm25f . finally , we broke down our query set by query-specificity , and found that salsa (and to a lesser extent hits) is most effective for general queries .
