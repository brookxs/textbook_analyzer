supporting ranking pattern-based aggregate-queries in sequence-data cubes sequence-data processing has been studied extensively in the literature . in recent years , the warehousing and online-analytical processing (olap) of archived sequence-data have received growing attentions . in particular , the concept of sequence-olap is recently proposed with the objective of evaluating various kinds of so-called pattern-based aggregate (pba) queries so that various kinds of data analytical tasks on sequence-data can be carried out efficiently . this paper studies the evaluation of ranking pba queries , which rank the results of pba queries and return only the top-ranked ones to users . we discuss how ranking pba queries drastically improve the usability of s-olap systems and present techniques that can evaluate various kinds of ranking pba queries efficiently .
