information-extraction from biomedical-literature : methodology , evaluation and an application journals and conference-proceedings represent the dominant mechanisms of reporting new biomedical results . the unstructured nature of such publications makes it difficult to utilize data-mining or automated knowledge discovery techniques . annotation (or markup) of these unstructured documents represents the first step in making these documents machine analyzable . in this paper we first present a system called bioannotator for identifying and annotating biological terms in documents . bioannotator uses domain_based dictionary-look-up for recognizing known terms and a rule-engine for discovering new terms . the combination and dictionary-look-up and rules result in good performance (87 \ % precision and 94 \ % recall on the genia 1.1 corpus for extracting general biological terms based on an approximate-matching criterion) . to demonstrate the subsequent mining and knowledge-discovery activities that are made feasible by bioannotator , we also present a system called medsummarizer that uses the extracted terms to identify the common concepts in a given group of genes .
