optimizing candidate check costs for bitmap indices in this paper , we propose a new strategy for optimizing the placement of bin boundaries to minimize the cost-of-query evaluation using bitmap indices with binning . for attributes with a large number of distinct values , often the most efficient index scheme is a bitmap-index with binning . however , this type of index may not be able to fully resolve some user queries . to fully resolve these queries , one has to access parts of the original data to check whether certain candidate records actually satisfy the specified conditions . we call this procedure the candidate check , which usually dominates the total query-processing time . given a set of user queries , we seek to minimize the total time required to an-swer the queries by optimally placing the bin boundaries . we show that our dynamic-programming_based algorithm can efficiently determine the bin boundaries . we verify our analysis with some real user queries from the sloan-digital-sky-survey . for queries that require significant amount of time to perform candidate check , using our optimal bin boundaries reduces the candidate check time by a factor of 2 and the total query-processing time by 40 \ % .
