high-performing feature-selection for text-classification this paper reports a controlled-study on a large number of filter feature-selection methods for text-classification . over 100 variants of five major feature-selection criteria were examined using four well-known classification algorithms : a naive-bayesian (nb) approach , a rocchio-style classifier , a k-nearest-neighbor (knn) method and a support-vector-machine (svm) system . two benchmark collections were chosen as the testbeds : reuters-21578 and small portion of reuters-corpus version 1 (rcv1) , making the new results comparable to published results . we found that feature-selection methods based on chi 2 statistics consistently outperformed those based on other criteria (including information-gain) for all four classifiers and both data-collections , and that a further increase in performance was obtained by combining uncorrelated and high-performing feature-selection methods.the results we obtained using only 3 \ % of the available features are among the best reported , including results obtained with the full feature-set .
