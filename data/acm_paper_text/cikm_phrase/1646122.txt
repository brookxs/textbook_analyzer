subspace maximum-margin-clustering in text-mining , we are often confronted with very high dimensional data . clustering with high-dimensional-data is a challenging problem due to the curse-of-dimensionality . in this paper , to address this problem , we propose an subspace maximum-margin-clustering (smmc) method , which performs dimensionality-reduction and maximum-margin-clustering simultaneously within a unified-framework . we aim to learn a subspace , in which we try to find a cluster-assignment of the data points , together with a hyperplane classifier , such that the resultant margin is maximized among all possible cluster assignments and all possible subspaces . the original problem is transformed from learning the subspace to learning a positive-semi-definite matrix , in order to avoid tuning the dimensionality of the subspace . the transformed problem can be solved efficiently via cutting-plane technique and constrained-concave-convex-procedure (cccp) . since the sub-problem in each iteration of cccp is joint convex , alternating minimization is adopted to obtain the global optimum . experiments on benchmark data sets illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the-state-of-the-art clustering-methods as well as many dimensionality-reduction_based clustering approaches .
