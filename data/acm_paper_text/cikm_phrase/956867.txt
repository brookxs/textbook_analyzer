a study of parameter-tuning for term-frequency-normalization most current term-frequency-normalization approaches for information-retrieval involve the use of parameters . the tuning of these parameters has an important impact on the overall performance of the information-retrieval-system . indeed , a small variation in the involved parameter (s) could lead to an important variation in the precision/recall values . most current tuning approaches are dependent on the document-collections . as a consequence , the effective parameter value can not be obtained for a given new collection without extensive training-data . in this paper , we propose a novel and robust method for the tuning of term-frequency-normalization parameter (s) , by measuring the normalization effect on the within document-frequency of the query terms . as an illustration , we apply our method on amati \ & van rijsbergen 's so-called normalization 2 . the experiments for the ad-hoc trec-6 ,7,8 tasks and trec-8 ,9,10 web tracks show that the new method is independent of the collections and able to provide reliable and good performance .
