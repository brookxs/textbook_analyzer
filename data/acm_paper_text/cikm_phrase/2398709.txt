evaluating reward and risk for vertical-selection the aggregation of search-results from heterogeneous-verticals (news , videos , blogs , etc) has become an important consideration in search . when aiming to select suitable verticals , from which items are selected to be shown along with the standard `` ten blue links '' , there exists the potential to both help (selecting relevant verticals) and harm (selecting irrelevant verticals) the existing result-set . in this paper , we present an approach that considers both reward and risk within the task of vertical-selection (vs) . we propose a novel risk-aware vs evaluation-metric that incorporates users ' risk-levels and users ' individual preference of verticals . using the proposed metric , we present a detailed analysis of both reward and risk of current resource-selection approaches within a multi-label-classification framework . the results bring insights into the effectiveness and robustness of current vertical-selection approaches .
