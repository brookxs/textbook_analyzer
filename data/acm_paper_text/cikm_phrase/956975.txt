finding more useful information faster from web-search-results in this paper , we propose a prototype-system for automatic-generation of concept-hierarchies to be used as an overview of search-results . the system sends a user 's query to five search-engines and receives a returned list of relevant-web pages . the system then extracts query-oriented concept terms from snippets that come with the returned hits . concept terms are organized into a concept-hierarchy using a co-occurrence-based-classification technique . finally , concepts in returned documents are dynamically highlighted according to terms in the selected concept branch that lead to the chosen document . the user-study shows that concept-hierarchies do provide easy navigation and browsing of web returned documents . the results also show that users can find a document of interest no matter how low it is ranked in the retrieved list .
