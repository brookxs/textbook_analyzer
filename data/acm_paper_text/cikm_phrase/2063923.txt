a partitioning-method for symbolic interval-data based on kernelized metric to solve the problem of situations with nonlinearly separable clusters , kernel-clustering methods have been proposed . symbolic-data-analysis (sda) has emerged to deal with variables that can have intervals , histograms , and even functions as values , in order to consider the variability and/or uncertainty innate to the data . in this paper , we present a k-means-clustering method based in kernelized squared l 2 distance for symbolic interval-type data . experiments with real and syntectic symbolic interval-type data-sets are considered .
