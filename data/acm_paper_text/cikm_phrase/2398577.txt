sort-based query-adaptive loading of r-trees bulk-loading of r-trees has been an important problem in academia and industry for more than twenty years . current algorithms create r-trees without any information about the expected query-profile . however , query profiles are extremely useful for the design of efficient indexes . in this paper , we address this deficiency and present query-adaptive algorithms for building r-trees optimally designed for a given query-profile . since optimal r-tree loading is np-hard (even without tuning the structure to a query-profile) , we provide efficient , easy to implement heuristics . our sort-based algorithms for query-adaptive loading consist of two steps : first , sorting-orders are identified resulting in better r-trees than those obtained from standard space-filling-curves . second , for a given sorting order , we propose a dynamic-programming-algorithm for generating r-trees in linear runtime . our experimental-results confirm that our algorithms generally create significantly better r-trees than the ones obtained from standard sort-based loading algorithms , even when the query-profile is unknown .
