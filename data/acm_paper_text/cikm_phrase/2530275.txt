towards concept-based translation-models using search-logs for query-expansion query-logs have been successfully used to improve web-search . one of the directions exploits user clickthrough-data to extract related terms to a query to perform query-expansion (qe) . how-ever , term relations have been created between isolated terms without considering their context , giving rise to the problem of term ambiguity . to solve this problem , we propose several ways to place terms in their contexts . on the one hand , contiguous terms can form a phrase ; and on the other hand , terms at proximi-ty can provide less strict but useful contextual constraints mutual-ly . relations extracted between such more constrained groups of terms are expected to be less noisy than those between single terms . in this paper , the constrained groups of terms are called concepts . we exploit user-query-logs to build statistical-translation models between concepts , which are then used for qe . we perform experiments on the-web search-task using a real-world data-set . results show that the concept-based statistical-translation-model trained on clickthrough-data outperforms signif-icantly other state-of-the-art qe systems .
