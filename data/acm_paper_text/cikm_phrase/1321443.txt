learning to join everything text , speech , images , video , dna-sequences provide information about entities that people can recognize when looking at a particular instance . but those entities and their attributes and relationships are not directly accessible to queries that join across types of sources . information-extraction methods based on supervised-machine-learning recognize mentions of entities and relationships of predefined types in different kinds of sources , which can then be used to answer some useful types of queries . however , supervised-learning relies on hand-annotated training-sets that are difficult to create and limit what types of entities and relationships can be joined for new-applications . these limitations have prompted research into unsupervised-extraction methods that rely on correlations among sources rather than hand-annotated training-sets . while these methods are not yet as accurate as those based on supervised-learning , they have the potential for a new query-by-example approach to information-integration in which seed-sets of query answers are expanded into ranked-lists of potential answers by learning occurrence patterns from the seed answers . i will give examples of both types of methods from our research on biomedical-information-extraction , leading to some ideas on a possible convergence of search and databases through machine-learning .
