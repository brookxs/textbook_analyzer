a survey of pre-retrieval query-performance predictors the focus of research on query-performance-prediction is to predict the effectiveness of a query given a search-system and a collection of documents . if the performance of queries can be estimated in advance of , or during the retrieval stage , specific measures can be taken to improve the overall performance of the system . in particular , pre-retrieval predictors predict the query-performance before the retrieval step and are thus independent of the ranked list of results ; such predictors base their predictions solely on query terms , the collection statistics and possibly external-sources such as wordnet . in this poster , 22 pre-retrieval predictors are categorized and assessed on three different trec test-collections .
