interactive-relevance-feedback with graded-relevance and sentence-extraction : simulated user-experiments research on relevance-feedback (rfb) in information-retrieval (ir) has given mixed results . success in rfb seems to depend on the searcher 's willingness to provide feedback and ability to identify relevant documents or query keys . the paper is based on simulating many user-scenarios regarding the amount and-quality of rfb . in addition , we experiment with query-biased sentence-extraction for query-reformulation . the baselines are initial no-feedback queries and queries based on pseudo-relevance-feedback . the core question is : under which conditions would rfb based on sentence-extraction be successful ? the answer depends on user 's behavior , implementation of feedback query-formulation , and the evaluation-methods . a small amount of feedback from a short browsing window seems to improve the final ranking the most . longer browsing allows more feedback and better queries but also consumes the available relevant documents .
