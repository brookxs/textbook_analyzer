learnext : learning to predict tourists movements in this paper , we tackle the problem of predicting the `` next '' geographical position of a tourist given her history (i.e. , the prediction is done accordingly to the tourist 's current trail) by means of supervised-learning techniques , namely gradient boosted regression-trees and ranking-svm . the learning is done on the basis of an object-space represented by a 68 dimension feature-vector , specifically designed for tourism related data . furthermore , we propose a thorough comparison of several methods that are considered state-of-the-art in touristic recommender and trail prediction-systems as well as a strong popularity baseline . experiments show that the methods we propose outperform important competitors and baselines thus providing strong evidence of the performance of our solutions .
