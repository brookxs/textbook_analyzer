evaluating top-k-queries over incomplete-data streams we study the problem of continuous-monitoring of top-k-queries over multiple non-synchronized streams . assuming a sliding-window model , this general problem has been a well addressed research-topic in recent years . most approaches , however , assume synchronized streams where all attributes of an object are known simultaneously to the query-processing engine . in many streaming scenarios though , different attributes of an item are reported in separate non-synchronized streams which do not allow for exact score calculations . we present how the traditional notion of object dominance changes in this case such that the k dominance-set still includes all and only those objects which have a chance of being among the top-k-results in their life time . based on this , we propose an exact-algorithm which builds on generating multiple instances of the same object in a way that enables efficient object pruning . we show that even with object pruning the necessary storage for exact evaluation of top-k-queries is linear in the size of the sliding-window . as data should reside in main-memory to provide fast answers in an online fashion and cope with high stream rates , storing all this data may not be possible with limited-resources . we present an approximate-algorithm which leverages correlation statistics of pairs of streams to evict more objects while maintaining accuracy . we evaluate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments .
