lead-lag analysis via sparse co-projection in correlated text-streams correlated topical trend-detection is very useful in analyzing public and social-media influence . in this paper , we propose an algorithm that can both detect the correlation and discover the corresponding keywords that trigger the correlation . to detect the correlation , we use a projection vector to project two text-streams onto the same space , and then use a least-square cost-function to regress one text-stream over the other with different time lags . to extract the corresponding keywords , we impose the non-negative sparsity constraints over the projection parameters . in addition , we present an accelerated algorithm based on nesterov 's method to efficiently solve the optimization-problem . in our experiments , we use both syntehtic and real-data sets to demonstrate the advantages and capabilities of the proposed algorithm over cca on the follower link-prediction problem .
