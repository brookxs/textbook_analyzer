a model-based-approach for rfid data stream cleansing in recent years , rfid technologies have been used in many applications , such as inventory checking and object tracking . however , raw rfid data are inherently unreliable due to physical-device limitations and different kinds of environmental noise . currently , existing work mainly focuses on rfid data cleansing in a static environment (e.g. inventory checking) . it is therefore difficult to cleanse rfid-data-streams in a mobile-environment (e.g. object-tracking) using the existing solutions , which do not address the data missing issue effectively . in this paper , we study how to cleanse rfid-data-streams for object-tracking , which is a challenging problem , since a significant percentage of readings are routinely dropped . we propose a probabilistic-model for object-tracking in a mobile-environment . we develop a bayesian-inference_based approach for cleansing rfid data using the model . in order to sample data from the movement distribution , we devise a sequential sampler that cleans rfid data with high accuracy and efficiency . we validate the effectiveness and robustness of our solution through extensive simulations and demonstrate its performance by using two real rfid applications of human-tracking and conveyor belt monitoring .
