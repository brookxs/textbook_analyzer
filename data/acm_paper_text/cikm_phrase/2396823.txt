delineating social-network data-anonymization via random edge perturbation social-network data-analysis raises concerns about the privacy of related entities or individuals . to address this issue , organizations can publish data after simply replacing the identities of individuals with pseudonyms , leaving the overall structure of the social-network unchanged . however , it has been shown that attacks based on structural identification (e.g. , a walk-based attack) enable an adversary to re-identify selected individuals in an anonymized network . in this paper we explore the capacity of techniques based on random edge perturbation to thwart such attacks . we theoretically establish that any kind of structural identification attack can effectively be prevented using random edge perturbation and show that , surprisingly , important properties of the whole network , as well as of subgraphs thereof , can be accurately calculated and hence data-analysis tasks performed on the perturbed data , given that the legitimate data recipient knows the perturbation probability as well . yet we also examine ways to enhance the walk-based attack , proposing a variant we call probabilistic attack . nevertheless , we demonstrate that such probabilistic attacks can also be prevented under sufficient perturbation . eventually , we conduct a thorough theoretical study of the probability of success of any} structural attack as a function of the perturbation probability . our analysis provides a powerful tool for delineating the identification risk of perturbed social-network data ; our extensive experiments with synthetic and real datasets confirm our expectations .
