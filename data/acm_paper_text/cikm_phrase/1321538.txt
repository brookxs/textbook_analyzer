type nanotheories : a framework for term-comparison we present in this paper type nanotheories (tn) , a framework for representing the knowledge necessary for performing similarity comparisons between pairs of terms of the same type . tn itself uses another methodology , namely support outcomes , which is also introduced . many ir and nlp-applications use redundancy as a factor to increase confidence , and tn-based comparisons can determine redundancy better than simple string comparisons . results include a showing of a 14 \ % increase in confidence-weighted score for an end-to-end qa-system and an up to 68 \ % improvement over baseline in an answer-key equivalencing experiment .
