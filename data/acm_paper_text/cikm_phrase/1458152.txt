rewriting of visibly-pushdown-languages for xml-data integration in this paper , we focus on xml-data integration by studying rewritings of xml target schemas in terms of source schemas . rewriting is very important in data-integration-systems where the system is asked to find and assemble xml-documents from the data sources and produce documents which satisfy a target schema . as schema representation , we consider visibly-pushdown-automata (vpas) which accept visibly-pushdown-languages (vpls) . the latter have been shown to coincide with the-family of (word-encoded) regular-tree-languages which are the basis of formalisms for specifying xml-schemas . furthermore , practical semi-formal xml-schema specifications (defined by simple pattern conditions on xml) compile into vpas which are exponentially more concise than other representations based on tree-automata . notably , vpls enjoy a `` well-behavedness '' which facilitates us in addressing rewriting problems for xml-data integration . based on vpas , we positively solve these problems , and present detailed complexity analyses .
