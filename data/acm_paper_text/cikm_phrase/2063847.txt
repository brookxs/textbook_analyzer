extract knowledge from semi-structured websites for search-task-simplification simplifying the key tasks of search-engine users by directly retrieving to them structured-knowledge according to their queries is attracting much attention from both industry and academia . a bottleneck of this challenging problem is how to extract the structured-knowledge from the noisy and complex web-scale websites automatically . in this paper , we propose an unsupervised automatic-wrapper-induction algorithm , named as scalable knowledge extractor from websites (skes) . skes induces the wrapper in a divide-and-conquer mode , i.e. , it divides the general wrapper into several sub-wrappers to learn from the data independently . moreover , through employing techniques such as tag path representation of web-pages , skes is verified to be efficient and noise-tolerant by the experimental-results . furthermore , based on our automatically extracted knowledge , we also built a prototype to serve structured-knowledge to end-users for simplifying their key search-tasks . very positive feedbacks were received on the prototype .
