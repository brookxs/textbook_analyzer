corankbayes : bayesian-learning to rank under the co-training framework and its application in keyphrase-extraction recently , learning-to-rank algorithms have become a popular and effective tool for ordering objects (e.g. terms) according to their degrees of importance . the contribution of this paper is that we propose a simple and fast learning-to-rank model rankbayes and embed it in the co-training framework . the detailed proof is given that na ve-bayes algorithm can be used to implement a learning-to-rank model . to solve the problem of two-model inconsistency , an ingenious approach is put forward to rank all the phrases by making use of the labeled results of two rankbayes models . experimental-results show that the proposed approach is promising in solving ranking problems .
