automatic-query-expansion based on divergence in this paper we are mainly concerned with discussion of a formal-model , based on the basic concept of divergence from information-theory , for automatic-query-expansion . the basic principles and ideas on which our study is based are described . a theoretical-framework is established , which allows the comparison and evaluation of different term-scoring functions for identifying good terms for query-expansion . the approaches proposed in this paper have been implemented and evaluated on collections from trec . preliminary results show that our approaches are viable and worthy of continued investigation .
