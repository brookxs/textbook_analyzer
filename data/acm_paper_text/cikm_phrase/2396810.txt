a filter-based protocol for continuous-queries over imprecise location-data in typical location-based-services (lbs) , moving-objects (e.g. , gps-enabled-mobile-phones) report their locations through a wireless-network . an lbs server can use the location-information to answer various types of continuous-queries . due to hardware limitations , location-data reported by the moving-objects are often uncertain . in this paper , we study efficient methods for the execution of continuous possible nearest-neighbor-query (cponnq) that accesses imprecise location-data . a cponnq is a standing-query (which is active during a period of time) such that , at any time point , all moving-objects that have non-zero probabilities of being the nearest-neighbor of a given query point are reported . to handle the continuous nature of a cponnq , a simple solution is to require moving-objects to continuously report their locations to the lbs server , which evaluates the query at every time step . to save communication bandwidth and mobile devices ' batteries , we develop two filter-based protocols for cponnq evaluation . our protocols install `` filter bounds '' on moving-objects , which suppress unnecessary location reporting and communication between the server and the moving-objects . through extensive experiments , we show that our protocols can effectively reduce communication-costs while maintaining a high query-quality .
