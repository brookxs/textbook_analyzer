a matrix-based approach for semi-supervised document co-clustering in order to derive high quality information from text , the field of text-mining has advanced swiftly from simple document-clustering to co-clustering documents and words . however , document co-clustering without any prior-knowledge or background-information is a challenging problem . in this paper , we propose a semi-supervised non-negative-matrix-factorization (ss-nmf) based framework for document co-clustering . our method computes a new word-document matrix by incorporating user provided constraints through distance-metric-learning . using an iterative-algorithm , we perform tri-factorization of the new matrix to infer the document and word clusters . through extensive experiments conducted on publicly available data-sets , we demonstrate the superior performance of ss-nmf for document co-clustering .
