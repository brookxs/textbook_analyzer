corpus microsurgery : criteria optimization for medical cross-language-ir automatic subset-selection from a parallel-corpus significantly cross-lingual-information-retrieval (clir) performance , in addition to increasing its efficiency . our selection-method extracts relevant training-data by incorporating additional criteria (i.e. estimated corpus-quality , taxonomy projection and size) in addition to lexical-based criteria . the challenge lies in combining these criteria using a meaningful scoring-function that can be used for ranking parallel-sentence candidates . we choose weighted geometric-mean for its soft-and properties , and we optimize criteria weights by wrapping the clir task in an optimization shell . due to the indeterminate nature of the search-space convexity properties , we have explored continuous reactive tabu-search (crts) , a global-optimization method . we use a large parallel-corpus in the medical-domain to examine the effect of adaptation criteria and their combination on clir performance . in our experiments , 100 selected sentences yield 90 \ % of the performance obtained with 5,000 times more in-domain parallel-sentences . our optimized criteria weights considerably outperform the uniform-distribution baseline , as well as lexical-similarity adaptation .
