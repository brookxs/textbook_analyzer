alternative representations and abstractions for moving sensors databases moving sensors refers to an emerging class of data-intensive-applications that inpacts disciplines such as communication , health-care , scientific-applications , etc. . these applications consist of a fixed number of sensors that move and produce streams of data as a function of time . they may require the system to match these streams against stored streams to retrieve relevant data (patterns) . with communication , for example , a speaking impaired individual might utilize a haptic-glove that translates hand signs into written (spoken) words . the glove consists of sensors for different finger joints . these sensors report their location and values as a function of time , producing streams of data . these streams are matched against a repository of spatio-temporal streams to retrieve the corresponding english character or word.the contributions of this study are two fold . first , it introduces a framework to store and retrieve `` moving sensors '' data . the framework advocates physical data independence and software-reuse . second , we investigate alternative representations for storage and retrieve of data in support of query-processing . we quantify the tradeoff associated with these alternatives using empirical-data robocup-soccer matches .
