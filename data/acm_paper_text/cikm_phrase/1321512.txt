an experimental-study of the impact of information-extraction accuracy on semantic-search performance researchers have shown that various natural-language-processing-techniques can be used in document-analysis to impact search-performance . for the most part , they examined how an analysis system with certain performance characteristics can be leveraged to improve document and/or passage search-results . we have previously shown that semantic-queries which utilize named-entity and relation information extracted from the corpus can lead to significant improvement in search-performance . in this paper , we extend our previous efforts and examine how search-performance degrades in the face of imperfect named-entity and relation-extraction . our study was carried out by developing gold-standard annotated-corpora and applying different error-models to the gold-standard annotations to simulate errors made by automatic recognizers . we identify automatic-recognizer characteristics that make them more amenable to our search-tasks , show that recognizer recall has more significant impact on semantic-search performance than its precision , and demonstrate that significant improvement in both map and exact precision scores can be achieved by adopting automatic named entity and relation recognizers with near state-of-the-art performance .
