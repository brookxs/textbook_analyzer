a decentralized recommender-system for effective web-credibility assessment an overwhelming and growing amount of data is available online . the problem of untrustworthy online-information is augmented by its high economic potential and its dynamic nature , e.g. transient domain-names , dynamic-content , etc. . in this paper , we address the problem of assessing the credibility of web pages by a decentralized social recommender system . specifically , we concurrently employ i) item-based-collaborative-filtering (cf) based on specific web-page features , ii) user-based cf based on friend ratings and iii) the ranking of the page in search-results . these factors are appropriately combined into a single assessment based on adaptive weights that depend on their effectiveness for different topics and different fractions of malicious ratings . simulation-experiments with real-traces of web-page credibility evaluations suggest that our hybrid-approach outperforms both its constituent components and classical content-based classification approaches .
