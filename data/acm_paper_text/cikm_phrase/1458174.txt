can phrase-indexing help to process non-phrase queries ? modern web-search-engines , while indexing billions of web-pages , are expected to process queries and return results in a very short time . many approaches have been proposed for efficiently computing top-k-query results , but most of them ignore one key factor in the ranking-functions of commercial search engines - term-proximity , which is the metric of the distance between query terms in a document . when term-proximity is included in ranking-functions , most of the existing top-k-algorithms will become inefficient . to address this problem , in this paper we propose to build a compact phrase index to speed up the search-process when incorporating the term-proximity factor . the compact phrase index can help more accurately estimate the score upper-bounds of unknown documents . the size of the phrase-index is controlled by including a small portion of phrases which are possibly helpful for improving search-performance . phrase-index has been used to process phrase queries in existing work . it is , however , to the best of our knowledge , the first time that phrase-index is used to improve the performance of generic queries . experimental-results show that , compared with the state-of-the-art top-k computation approaches , our approach can reduce average query-processing time to 1/5 for typical setttings .
