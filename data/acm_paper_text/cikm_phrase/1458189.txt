wildcards for lightweight information-integration in virtual-desktops we present a flexible information integration approach which addresses the dynamic-integration needs in a personal desktop environment where only partial mappings are defined between the sources to be integrated . our approach is based on query-rewriting using substitution rules . in addition to exploiting defined mappings , we employ substitution strategies , which are inspired by the idea of using wildcards in querying and filtering tasks . starting from a triple based query-language as used for querying rdf-data , unmapped ontological elements are substituted in a controlled way with variables , leading to a controlled form of query-relaxation . in addition , the approach also provides evidences for refining the existing mapping based on the results of executing the relaxed queries . different strategies for replacing non-matched ontology elements with variables are presented and evaluated over real-world-data sets .
