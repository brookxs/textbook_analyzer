finding food entity-relationships using user-generated data in recipe service rakuten recipe is a recipe site where users can submit their recipes and share with the others . since recipe contents are generated by users , they usually contain many misspellings , abbreviations , synonyms , hypernyms and hyponyms . identifying and normalizing these words is essential to retrieve relevant recipes to user 's request . in this paper , we introduce a new approach to finding related words in a recipe domain using the data-structure . based on the observation that people usually write the main ingredient in the first position of ingredient lists of each recipe and such a ingredient is strongly related to the categories where recipes belong , we calculate relation scores of word-pairs using real service data , which contains 790 categories and 405,519 recipes . the experimental result showed that we successfully found semantically related word-pairs with f-score of 0.93 .
