external evaluation-measures for subspace-clustering knowledge-discovery-in-databases requires not only development of novel mining techniques but also fair and comparable quality-assessment based on objective-evaluation measures . especially in young research areas where no common measures are available , researchers are unable to provide a fair evaluation . typically , publications glorify the high quality of one approach only justified by an arbitrary evaluation-measure . however , such conclusions can only be drawn if the evaluation-measures themselves are fully understood . in this paper , we provide the basis for systematic evaluation in the emerging research area of subspace-clustering . we formalize general quality-criteria for subspace-clustering measures not yet addressed in the literature . we compare the existing external evaluation-methods based on these criteria and pinpoint limitations . we propose a novel external evaluation-measure which meets the requirements in form of quality properties . in thorough experiments we empirically show characteristic properties of evaluation-measures . overall , we provide a set of evaluation-measures that fulfill the general quality-criteria as recommendation for future evaluations . all measures and datasets are provided on our website and are integrated in our evaluation-framework .
