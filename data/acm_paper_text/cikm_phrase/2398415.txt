supporting factual statements with evidence from the-web fact verification has become an important task due to the increased popularity of blogs , discussion-groups , and social-sites , as well as of encyclopedic collections that aggregate content from many contributors . we investigate the task of automatically retrieving supporting-evidence from the-web for factual statements . using wikipedia as a starting point , we derive a large-corpus of statements paired with supporting web-documents , which we employ further as training-and-test-data under the assumption that the contributed references to wikipedia represent some of the most relevant-web documents for supporting the corresponding statements . given a factual statement , the proposed system first transforms it into a set of semantic terms by using machine-learning-techniques . it then employs a quasi-random strategy for selecting subsets of the semantic terms according to topical likelihood . these semantic terms are used to construct queries for retrieving web-documents via a web-search api . finally , the retrieved documents are aggregated and re-ranked by employing additional measures of their suitability to support the factual statement . to gauge the quality of the retrieved evidence , we conduct a user-study through amazon-mechanical-turk , which shows that our system is capable of retrieving supporting web-documents comparable to those chosen by wikipedia contributors .
