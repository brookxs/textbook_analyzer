context-modeling for ranking and tagging bursty-features in text-streams bursty-features in text-streams are very useful in many text-mining applications . most existing studies detect bursty-features based purely on term-frequency changes without taking into account the semantic contexts of terms , and as a result the detected bursty-features may not always be interesting or easy to interpret . in this paper we propose to model the contexts of bursty-features using a language-modeling-approach . we then propose a novel topic diversity-based metric using the context-models to find newsworthy bursty-features . we also propose to use the context-models to automatically assign meaningful tags to bursty-features . using a large-corpus of a stream of news-articles , we quantitatively show that the proposed context language models for bursty-features can effectively help rank bursty-features based on their newsworthiness and to assign meaningful tags to annotate bursty-features .
