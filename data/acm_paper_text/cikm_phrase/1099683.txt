feature-based recommendation-system the explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender-systems -- a personalized-information filtering technology used to identify a set of n items that will be of interest to a certain user . user-based and model-based collaborative-filtering are the most successful technology for building recommender-systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender-systems . the basic assumption in these algorithms is that there are sufficient historical-data for measuring similarity between products or users . however , this assumption does not hold in various application-domains such as electronics retail , home shopping network , on-line retail where new products are introduced and existing products disappear from the catalog . another such application-domains is home improvement retail-industry where a lot of products (such as window treatments , bathroom , kitchen or deck) are custom made . each product is unique and there are very little duplicate products . in this domain , the probability of the same exact two products bought together is close to zero . in this paper , we discuss the challenges of providing recommendation in the domains where no sufficient historical-data exist for measuring similarity between products or users . we present feature-based recommendation-algorithms that overcome the limitations of the existing top-n-recommendation algorithms . the experimental-evaluation of the proposed algorithms in the real life data-sets shows a great promise . the pilot project deploying the proposed feature-based recommendation-algorithms in the on-line retail web-site shows 75 \ % increase in the recommendation revenue for the first 2 month period .
