ranking with semi-supervised distance-metric-learning and its application to housing potential estimation this paper proposes a semi-supervised distance-metric-learning algorithm for the ranking problem . instead of giving the computer what are the important factors that affect the final rank value , we only give several most certainly ranked points which implicitly contain the knowledge of the ranking factors . then the computer can automatically use the most certain points and plenty of unlabeded data to learn an informative metric for ranking . this metric not only can help to regress an order in the observed data , but also can be used to retrieve the data by querying new test points . moreover , the lower-rank distance-metric can be used to visualize high-dimensional-data . we also present an application to the housing potential estimation problem . it is shown that the algorithm is efficient to help consultants to refine their consulting work .
