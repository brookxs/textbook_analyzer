the face of quality in crowdsourcing-relevance-labels : demographics , personality and labeling accuracy information-retrieval-systems require human contributed relevance-labels for their training and evaluation . increasingly such labels are collected under the anonymous , uncontrolled conditions of crowdsourcing , leading to varied output quality . while a range of quality-assurance and control techniques have now been developed to reduce noise during or after task-completion , little is known about the workers themselves and possible relationships between workers ' characteristics and the quality of their work . in this paper , we ask how do the relatively well or poorly-performing crowds , working under specific task conditions , actually look like in terms of worker characteristics , such as demographics or-personality traits . our findings show that the face of a crowd is in fact indicative of the quality of their work .
