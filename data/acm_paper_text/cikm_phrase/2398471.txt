discovering personally semantic places from gps-trajectories a place is a locale that is frequently visited by an individual user and carries important semantic meanings (e.g. home , work , etc.) . many location-aware-applications will be greatly enhanced with the ability of the automatic-discovery of personally semantic places . the discovery of a user 's personally semantic places involves obtaining the physical locations and semantic meanings of these places . in this paper , we propose approaches to address both of the problems . for the physical place extraction-problem , a hierarchical-clustering algorithm is proposed to firstly extract visit points from the gps-trajectories , and then these visit points can be clustered to form physical places . for the semantic place-recognition problem , bayesian-networks (encoding the temporal-patterns in which the places are visited) are used in combination with a customized poi (i.e. place of interest) database (containing the spatial features of the places) to categorize the extracted physical places into pre-defined types . an extensive set of experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches based on a dataset of real-world gps-trajectories .
