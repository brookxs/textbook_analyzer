parameter-sensitivity in the probabilistic-model for ad-hoc-retrieval the term-frequency-normalisation parameter-sensitivity is an important issue in the probabilistic-model for information-retrieval . a high parameter-sensitivity indicates that a slight change of the parameter value may considerably affect the retrieval-performance . therefore , a weighting-model with a high parameter-sensitivity is not robust enough to provide a consistent retrieval-performance across different collections and queries . in this paper , we suggest that the parameter-sensitivity is due to the fact that the query-term weights are not adequate enough to allow informative query terms to differ from non-informative ones . we show that query-term-reweighing , which is part of the relevance-feedback process , can be successfully used to reduce the parameter-sensitivity . experiments on five text-retrieval-conference (trec) collections show that the parameter-sensitivity does remarkably decrease when query terms are reweighed .
