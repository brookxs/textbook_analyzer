online multitasking and user-engagement users often access and re-access more than one site during an online session , effectively engaging in multitasking . in this paper , we study the effect of online multitasking on two widely used engagement metrics designed to capture users browsing-behavior with a site . our study is based on browsing data of 2.5 m users across 760 sites encompassing diverse types of services such as social-media , news and mail . to account for multitasking we need to redefine how user sessions are represented and we need to adapt the metrics under study . we introduce a new representation of user sessions : tree-streams -- as opposed to the commonly used click-streams -- present a more accurate picture of the browsing-behavior of a user that includes how users switch between sites (e.g. , hyperlinking , teleporting , backpaging) . we then discuss a number of insights on multitasking patterns , and show how these help to better understand how users engage with sites . finally , we define metrics that characterize multitasking during online sessions and show how they provide additional insights to standard engagement metrics .
