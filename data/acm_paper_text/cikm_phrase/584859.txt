geoplot : spatial-data-mining on video-libraries are `` tornado '' touchdowns related to `` earthquakes '' ? how about to `` floods '' , or to `` hurricanes '' ? in informedia [14] , using a gazetteer on news-video clips , we map news onto points on the globe and find correlations between sets of points . in this paper we show how to find answers to such questions , and how to look for patterns on the geo-spatial relationships of news events . the proposed tool is `` geoplot '' , which is fast to compute and gives a lot of useful information which traditional text-retrieval can not find.we describe our experiments on 2-year worth of video-data (~ 20 gbytes) . there we found that geoplot can find unexpected correlations that text-retrieval would never find , such as those between `` earthquake '' and `` volcano '' , and `` tourism '' and `` wine '' . in addition , geoplot provides a good visualization of a data-set 's characteristics . characteristics at all scales are shown in one plot and a wealth of information is given , for example , geo-spatial clusters , characteristic scales , and intrinsic (fractal) dimensions of the events ' locations .
