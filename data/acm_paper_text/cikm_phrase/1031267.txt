document-clustering based on cluster-validation this paper presents a cluster-validation_based document-clustering algorithm , which is capable of identifying both important feature words and true model-order (cluster-number) . important feature subset is selected by optimizing a cluster-validity criterion subject to some constraint . for achieving model-order-identification capability , this feature-selection procedure is conducted for each possible value of cluster-number . the feature subset and cluster-number which maximize the cluster-validity criterion are chosen as our answer . we have applied our algorithm to several datasets from 20newsgroup corpus . experimental-results show that our algorithm can find important feature subset , estimate the model-order and yield higher micro-averaged precision than other four document-clustering algorithms which require cluster-number to be provided .
