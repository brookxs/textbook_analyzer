an effective statistical-approach to blog post opinion-retrieval finding opinionated blog posts is still an open problem in information-retrieval , as exemplified by the recent trec blog tracks . most of the current solutions involve the use of external resources and manual efforts in identifying subjective features . in this paper , we propose a novel and effective dictionary-based statistical-approach , which automatically derives evidence for subjectivity from the blog collection itself , without requiring any manual effort . our experiments show that the proposed approach is capable of achieving remarkable and statistically significant improvements over robust baselines , including the best trec baseline run . in addition , with relatively little computational costs , our proposed approach provides an effective performance in retrieving opinionated blog posts , which is as good as a computationally expensive approach using natural-language-processing-techniques .
