black-swan : augmenting statistics with event data a large number of statistical-indicators (gdp , life expectancy , income , etc.) collected over long periods of time as well as data on historical events (wars , earthquakes , elections , etc.) are published on the world-wide-web . by augmenting statistical outliers with relevant historical occurrences , we provide a means to observe (and predict) the influence and impact of events . the vast amount and size of available data-sets enable the detection of recurring connections between classes of events and statistical outliers with the help of association-rule-mining . the results of this analysis are published at http://www.blackswanevents.org and can be explored interactively .
