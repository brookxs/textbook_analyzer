term associations in query-expansion : a structural linguistic perspective many successful-query expansion techniques ignore information about the term dependencies that exist within natural-language . however , researchers have recently demonstrated that consistent and significant improvements in retrieval-effectiveness can be achieved by explicitly modelling term dependencies within the query-expansion process . this has created an increased interest in dependency-based models . state-of-the-art dependency-based approaches primarily model term associations known within structural linguistics as syntagmatic associations , which are formed when terms co-occur together more often than by chance . however , structural linguistics proposes that the meaning of a word is also dependent on its paradigmatic associations , which are formed between words that can substitute for each other without effecting the acceptability of a sentence . given the reliance on word-meanings when a user formulates their query , our approach takes the novel step of modelling both syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations within the query-expansion process based on the (pseudo) relevant documents returned in web-search . the results demonstrate that this approach can provide significant improvements in web-retrieval effectiveness when compared to a strong benchmark retrieval-system .
