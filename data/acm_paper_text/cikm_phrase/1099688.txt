intelligent gp fusion from multiple sources for text-classification this paper shows how citation-based information and structural content (e.g. , title , abstract) can be combined to improve classification of text-documents into predefined categories . we evaluate different measures of similarity -- five derived from the citation-information of the collection , and three derived from the structural content -- and determine how they can be fused to improve classification effectiveness . to discover the best fusion framework , we apply genetic-programming (gp) techniques . our experiments with the acm-computing-classification-scheme , using documents from the acm digital-library , indicate that gp can discover similarity-functions superior to those based solely on a single type of evidence . effectiveness of the similarity-functions discovered through simple-majority-voting is better than that of content-based as well as combination-based support-vector-machine classifiers . experiments also were conducted to compare the performance between gp techniques and other fusion techniques such as genetic-algorithms (ga) and linear fusion . empirical-results show that gp was able to discover better similarity-functions than ga or other fusion techniques .
