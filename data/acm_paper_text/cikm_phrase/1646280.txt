retrieval-constraints and word-frequency distributions : a log-logistic model for ir we first present in this paper an analytical view of heuristic retrieval-constraints which yields simple tests to determine whether a retrieval-function satisfies the constraints or not . we then review empirical-findings on word-frequency distributions and the central role played by burstiness in this context . this leads us to propose a formal-definition of burstiness which can be used to characterize probability-distributions wrt this phenomenon . we then introduce the-family of information-based ir-models which naturally captures heuristic retrieval-constraints when the underlying probability-distribution is bursty and propose a new ir model within this family , based on the log-logistic distribution . the experiments we conduct on three different collections illustrate the good behavior of the log-logistic ir model : it significantly outperforms the jelinek-mercer and dirichlet-prior language-models on all three collections , with both short and long queries and for both the map and the precision-at-10 documents . it also outperforms the inl2 dfr model for the map , and yields results on a par with it for the precision-at-10 .
