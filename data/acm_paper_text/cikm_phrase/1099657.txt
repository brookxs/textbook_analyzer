evaluation of a mca-based approach to organize data-cubes in the olap context , exploration of huge and sparse-data cubes is a tedious task that does not always lead to efficient results . we propose to use a multiple-correspondence-analysis (mca) in order to enhance data-cube-representations and make them more suitable for visualization and thus , easier to analyze . we also provide an original quality criterion to measure the relevance of the obtained data-representations . experimental-results we led on real-data samples have shown the interest and the efficiency of our approach .
