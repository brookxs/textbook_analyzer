liquidxml : adaptive xml content redistribution we propose to demonstrate liquidxml , a platform for managing large-corpora of xml-documents in large-scale p2p-networks . all liquidxml peers may publish xml-documents to be shared with all the network peers . the challenge then is to efficiently (re -) distribute the published content in the network , possibly in overlapping , redundant fragments , to support efficient processing of queries at each peer . the novelty of liquidxml relies in its adaptive method of choosing which data fragments are stored where , to improve performance . the `` liquid '' aspect of xml-management is twofold : xml-data flows from many sources towards many consumers , and its distribution in the network continuously adapts to improve query-performance .
