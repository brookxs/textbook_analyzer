efficient query rewrite for structured web-queries web-search-engines incorporate results from structured-data sources to answer semantically rich user queries , i.e. samsung 50 inch led tv can be answered from a table of television data . however , users are not domain-experts and quite often enter values that do not match precisely the underlying data , so a-literal execution will return zero results . a search-engine would prefer to return at least a minimum number of results as close to the original query as possible while providing a time-bound execution guarantee . in this paper , we formalize these requirements , show the problem is np-hard and present approximation-algorithms that produce rewrites that work in practice . we empirically validate our algorithms on large-scale-data from a major search-engine .
