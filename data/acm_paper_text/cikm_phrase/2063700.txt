from names to entities using thematic context distance name-ambiguity arises from the polysemy of names and causes uncertainty about the true identity of entities referenced in unstructured-text . this is a major problem in areas like information-retrieval or knowledge-management , for example when searching for a specific entity or updating an existing knowledge-base . we approach this problem of named-entity-disambiguation (ned) using thematic information derived from latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) to compare the entity mention 's context with candidate entities in wikipedia represented by their respective articles . we evaluate various distances over topic distributions in a supervised-classification setting to find the best suited candidate entity , which is either covered in wikipedia or unknown . we compare our approach to a state-of-the-art-method and show that it achieves significantly better results in predictive performance , regarding both entities covered in wikipedia as well as uncovered entities . we show that our approach is in general language-independent as we obtain equally good results for named-entity-disambiguation using the english , the german and the french wikipedia .
