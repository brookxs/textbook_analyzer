role-explicit query-identification and intent role-annotation understanding the information-need or intent encoded within a query has long been regarded as an essential factor of effective information-retrieval . for better query-representation and understanding , two intent roles (kernel-object and modifier) are introduced to structurally parse a class of role-explicit queries , which constitute a majority of common user queries . furthermore , we focus on two research problems : rp-1 : given a role-explicit query , how to identify the kernel-object and modifier , namely intent role-annotation ; rp-2 : how to determine whether an arbitrary-query is role-explicit or not . to solve rp-1 , we propose a simplified word n-gram role-model (swnr) , which quantifies the generating probability of a role-explicit query and performs intent role-annotation effectively . using a set of discriminative-features , we build classifiers to address rp-2 in a supervised manner . the experimental-results show that : (1) swnr can achieve a satisfactory performance , more than 73 % in terms of different metrics ; (2) the classifiers can achieve more than 90 % precision in identifying role-explicit queries ; (3) compared with traditional techniques for query-representation and understanding , e.g. , name-entity-recognition in query and class-level query-intent-inference , intent role-annotation provides a more flexible framework and a number of applications can benefit from annotating role-explicit queries , such as intent mining and diversified document-ranking .
