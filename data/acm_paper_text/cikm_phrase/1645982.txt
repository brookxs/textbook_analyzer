data-driven compound-splitting method for english compounds in domain-names significant amount of literature is available on compound-splitting of long words albeit for non-english languages - especially european . not surprisingly , there has been not much work for english as it is not a compounding language like some of its european counterparts . however , internet domain-names in general are compound english words , e.g. bankofamerica.com '' . compound-splitting can be effectively employed to extract information from domain-names . in this paper , an data-driven-learning technique for splitting english-compound words is described which among others uses features like normalized frequency , length of parts and n-gram . the splitting f-measure is higher than the published approaches . we applied this technique on a real life web-search application where the queries are mistyped domain-names routed through sources like isps and browsers . relevant and meaningful keywords were extracted out and shown to the user as a value added search option . results show a very high click-through-rate and increased commercial value .
