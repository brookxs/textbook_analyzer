mining linguistic cues for query-expansion : applications to drug interaction search given a drug under development , what are other drugs or biochemical compounds that it might interact with ? early answers to this question , by mining the literature , are valuable for pharmaceutical companies , both monetarily and in avoiding public-relations nightmares . inferring drug-drug-interactions is also important in designing combination therapies for complex diseases including cancers . we study this problem as one of mining linguistic cues for query-expansion . by using (only) positive instances of drug interactions , we show how we can extract linguistic cues which can then be used to expand and reformulate queries to improve the effectiveness of drug interaction search . our approach integrates many learning paradigms : partially-supervised-classification , association measures for collocation mining , and feature-selection in supervised-learning . we demonstrate compelling results on using positive examples from the drugbank database to seed medline searches for drug interactions . in particular , we show that purely data-driven linguistic cues can be effectively mined and applied to realize a successful domain-specific-query-expansion framework .
