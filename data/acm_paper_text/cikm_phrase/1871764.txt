learning to blend rankings : a monotonic-transformation to blend rankings from heterogeneous-domains there have been great needs to develop effective methods for combining multiple rankings from heterogeneous-domains into one single rank list arising from many recent web-search applications , such as integrating web-search-results from multiple engines , facets , or verticals . we define this problem as learning to blend rankings from multiple domains . we propose a class of learning-to-blend methods that learn a monotonically increasing transformation for each ranking so that the rank-order in each domain is preserved and the transformed values are comparable across multiple rankings . the transformation-learning can be tackled by solving a quadratic-programming problem . the novel machine-learning method for blending multiple ranking lists is evaluated with queries sampled from a commercial-search-engine and a promising improvement of discounted-cumulative-gain has been observed .
