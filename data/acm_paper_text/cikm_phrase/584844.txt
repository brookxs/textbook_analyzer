partial-rollback in object-oriented/object-relational database-management-systems in a database-management-system (dbms) , partial-rollback is an important mechanism for canceling only part of the operations executed in a transaction back to a savepoint . partial-rollback complicates buffer-management because it should restore the state of the buffers as well as that of the database . several relational dbmss (rdbmss) currently provide this mechanism using page buffers . however , object-oriented or object-relational dbmss (oo/ordbmss) can not utilize the partial-rollback scheme of rdbmss as is because , unlike rdbmss , many of them use a dual-buffer consisting of an object buffer and a page buffer . in this paper , we propose a thorough study of partial-rollback schemes of oo/ordbmss with a dual-buffer . first , we classify the partial-rollback schemes of oo/ordbmss into a single buffer-based scheme and a dual buffer-based scheme by the number of buffers used to process-rollback . next , we propose four alternative partial-rollback schemes : a page buffer-based scheme , an object buffer-based scheme , a dual buffer-based scheme using a soft log , and a dual buffer-based scheme using shadows . we then evaluate their performance through simulations . the results show that the dual buffer-based partial-rollback scheme using shadows provides the best performance . partial-rollback in oo/ordbms has not been addressed in the literature ; yet , it is a useful mechanism that must be implemented . the proposed schemes are practical ones that can be implemented in such dbmss .
