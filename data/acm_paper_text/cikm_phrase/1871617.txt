yet another write-optimized dbms layer for flash-based solid-state-storage flash-based solid-state-storage (flashsss) has write-oriented problems such as low write-throughput , and limited life-time . especially , flashssds have a characteristic vulnerable to random-writes , due to its control-logic utilizing parallelism between the flash-memory chips . in this paper , we present a write-optimized layer of dbmss to address the write-oriented problems of flashsss in on-line transaction-processing environments . the layer consists of a write-optimized buffer , a corresponding log space , and an in-memory mapping-table , closely associated with a novel logging scheme called incremental-logging (icl) . the icl scheme enables dbmss to reduce page-writes at the least expense of additional page-reads , while replacing random-writes into sequential-writes . through experiments , our approach demonstrated up-to an order of magnitude performance-enhancement in i/o processing-time compared to the original dbms , increasing the longevity of flashsss by approximately a factor of two .
