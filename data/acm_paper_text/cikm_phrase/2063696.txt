optimising ontology stream-reasoning with truth-maintenance-system so far researchers in the description-logics / ontology communities mainly consider ontology reasoning services for static ontologies . the rapid-development of the-semantic-web and its emerging data ask for reasoning technologies for dynamic knowledge streams . existing work on stream-reasoning is focused on lightweight languages such as rdf and rdfs . in this paper , we introduce the notion of ontology stream management-system (osms) and present a stream-reasoning approach based on truth-maintenance-system (tms) . we present optimised el + + algorithm to reduce memory-consumption . our evaluations show that the optimisation improves tms-enabled el + + reasoning to deal with relatively large volumes of data and update efficiently .
