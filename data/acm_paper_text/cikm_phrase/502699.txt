a domain-independent environment for creating information-extraction modules text-mining is a growing area-of-interest within the field of data-mining and knowledge-discovery . given a collection of text-documents , most approaches to text-mining perform knowledge-discovery operations either on external tags associated with each document , or on the set of all words within each document . both approaches suffer from limitations . this paper focuses on an intermediate approach , one that we call text-mining via information-extraction , in which knowledge-discovery takes place on focused , relevant terms , phrases and facts , as extracted from the documents .
