maximum normalized spacing for efficient visual-clustering in this paper , for efficient clustering of visual image-data that have arbitrary mixture-distributions , we propose a simple distance-metric-learning method called maximum normalized spacing (mns) which is a generalized principle based on maximum spacing [12] and minimum-spanning-tree (mst) . the proposed normalized spacing (ns) can be viewed as a kind of adaptive-distance metric for contextual dissimilarity-measure which takes into account the local distribution of the data vectors . image-clustering is a difficult task because there are multiple nonlinear manifolds embedded in the data-space . many of the existing clustering-methods often fail to learn the whole structure of the multiple manifolds and they are usually not very effective . combining both the internal and external statistics of clusters to capture the density structure of manifolds , mns is capable of efficient and effective solving the clustering problem for the complex multi-manifold datasets in arbitrary metric-spaces . we apply this mns method into the practical problem of multi-view image-clustering and obtain good results which are helpful for image-browsing systems . using the coil-20 [19] and coil-100 [18] multi-view image-databases , our experimental-results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mns clustering-method and this clustering-method is more efficient than the traditional clustering-methods .
