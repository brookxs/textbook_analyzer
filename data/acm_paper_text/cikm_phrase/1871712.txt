supervised identification and linking of concept mentions to a domain-specific-ontology we propose a pipelined supervised-learning-approach named sdoi to the task of interlinking the concepts mentioned within a document to the concepts within an ontology . concept-mention identification is performed by training a sequential-tagging model . each identified concept-mention is then associated with a set of candidate ontology concepts along with a feature-vector based on features proposed in the literature and novel ones based on new data sources , such as from the training-corpus itself . an iterative-algorithm is defined for handling collective features . we show a lift in performance over applicable baselines against the ability to identify the concept mentions within the 139 kdd-2009 conference paper abstracts , and to link these concept mentions to a domain-specific-ontology for the field of data-mining . additional experiments of 22 icdm-2009 abstracts suggest that the trained models are portable both in terms of accuracy and in their ability to reduce annotation time .
