cache-aware load-balancing for question-answering the need for high-performance and throughput question-answering (qa) systems demands for their migration to distributed-environments . however , even in such cases it is necessary to provide the distributed-system with cooperative-caches and load-balancing facilities in order to achieve the desired goals . until now , the literature on qa has not considered such a complex-system as a whole . currently , the load-balancer regulates the assignment of tasks based only on the cpu and i/o loads without considering the status of the system cache . this paper investigates the load-balancing problem proposing two novel algorithms that take into account the distributed-cache status , in addition to the cpu and i/o load in each processing node . we have implemented , and tested the proposed algorithms in a fully fledged distributed qa-system . the two algorithms show that the choice of using the status of the cache was determinant in achieving good performance , and high-throughput for qa-systems .
