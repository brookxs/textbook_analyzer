speech-user-interfaces for information-retrieval the research proposed here concentrates on the problem of designing and developing a spoken query-retrieval (sqr) system to access large document databases via voice . the main challenge is to identify and address issues related to designing an effective and efficient speech-user-interface (sui) , especially if the aim is to facilitate spoken queries of large document databases . furthermore , the task of presenting large query result sets aurally should be performed such that the user 's short-term-memory is not overloaded . in this paper , a framework allowing information-retrieval to large document databases via voice is presented and findings from a research-study using the framework will be discussed as well .
