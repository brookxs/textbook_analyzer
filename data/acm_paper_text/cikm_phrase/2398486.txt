prism : discovering and prioritizing severe technical issues from product discussion-forums online-forums provide a channel for users to report and discuss problems related to products and troubleshooting , for faster resolution . these could garner negative publicity if left unattended by the companies . manually monitoring these massive amounts of discussions is laborious . this paper makes the first attempt at collecting issues that require immediate action by the product supplier by analyzing the immense information on forums . features that are specific to forum discussions , in conjunction with linguistic cues help in capturing and better prioritizing issues . any attempt to collect training-data for learning a classifier for this task will require enormous labeling effort . hence , this paper adopts a co-training approach , which uses minimal manual labeling , coupled with linguistic-features extracted using a set-expansion algorithm to discover severe problems . further , most distinct and recent issues are obtained by incorporating a measure of ` centrality ' , ` diversity ' and temporal aspect of the forum threads . we show that this helps in better prioritizing longstanding issues and identify issues that need to be addressed immediately .
