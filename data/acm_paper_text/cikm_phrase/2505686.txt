selection fusion in semi-structured retrieval semi-structured retrieval aims at providing focused answers to the users queries . a successful retrieval experience in semi-structured environment would mean a satisfactory combination of (a) matching or scoring and (b) selection of appropriate and focused fragments of the text . the need to retrieve items of different sizes arises today with users querying the retrieval-systems with varied use-case , user-interface and screen-size requirements . which means that different selection scenario serve different requirements and constraints . hence we propose , a novel type of fusion ; the textit {selection fusion} -- a fusion methodology which fuses an all-purpose and comprehensive ranking of elements with a specific selection-scheme , and also enables evaluation of the ranking in many selection perspectives . with the standard wikipedia xml test-collection , we are able to demonstrate that a strong and competitive baseline ranking-system improves retrieval quality irrespective of the selection-criteria . our baseline ranking-system is based on data-fusion over the official submitted runs at inex 2009 .
