inferring anchor links across multiple heterogeneous-social-networks online-social-networks can often be represented as heterogeneous-information-networks containing abundant information about : who , where , when and what . nowadays , people are usually involved in multiple social-networks simultaneously . the multiple accounts of the same user in different networks are mostly isolated from each other without any connection between them . discovering the correspondence of these accounts across multiple social-networks is a crucial prerequisite for many interesting inter-network applications , such as link-recommendation and community-analysis using information from multiple networks . in this paper , we study the problem of anchor link-prediction across multiple heterogeneous-social-networks , i.e. , discovering the correspondence among different accounts of the same user . unlike most prior work on link-prediction and network-alignment , we assume that the anchor links are one-to-one relationships (i.e. , no two edges share a common endpoint) between the accounts in two social-networks , and a small number of anchor links are known beforehand . we propose to extract heterogeneous features from multiple heterogeneous networks for anchor link-prediction , including user 's social , spatial , temporal and text-information . then we formulate the inference-problem for anchor links as a stable-matching problem between the two sets of user accounts in two different networks . an effective solution , mna (multi-network anchoring) , is derived to infer anchor links w.r.t. the one-to-one constraint . extensive experiments on two real-world heterogeneous-social-networks show that our mna model consistently outperform other commonly-used baselines on anchor link-prediction .
