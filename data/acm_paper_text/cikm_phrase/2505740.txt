scalable diversification of multiple search-results the explosion of big-data emphasizes the need for scalable data diversification , especially for applications based on web , scientific , and business databases . however , achieving effective diversification in a multi-user-environment is a rather challenging task due to the inherent high processing costs of current data diversification techniques . in this paper , we address the concurrent diversification of multiple search-results using various approximation techniques that provide orders of magnitude reductions in processing cost , while maintaining comparable quality of diversification as compared to sequential methods . our extensive experimental-evaluation shows the scalability exhibited by our proposed methods under various workload settings .
