efficient and effective server-sided distributed-clustering clustering has become an increasingly important task in modern application-domains where the data are originally located at different sites . in order to create a central clustering , all clients have to transmit their data to a central server . due to technical limitations and security-aspects , at the central site often only vague object-descriptions are available . the server then has to carry out the clustering based on vague and uncertain-data . in a recent paper , an approach for clustering uncertain-data was proposed based on the concept of medoid clusterings . the idea of this approach is to create first several sample clusterings . then based on suitable distance-functions between clusterings the most average clustering , i.e. the medoid-clustering , was determined . in this paper , we extend this approach for partitioning clustering-algorithms and propose to compute a centroid-clustering based on these input sample clusterings . these centroid clusterings are new artificial clusterings which minimize the distance to all the sample clusterings .
