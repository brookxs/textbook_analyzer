faceted-search and browsing of audio content on spoken-web spoken-web is a web of voicesites that can be accessed by a phone . the content in a voicesite is audio . therefore spoken-web provides an alternate to the world-wide-web (www) in developing-regions where low internet penetration and low literacy are barriers to accessing the conventional www . searching of audio content in spoken-web through an audio query-result interface presents two key challenges : indexing of audio content is not accurate , and the presentation of results in audio is sequential , and therefore cumbersome . in this paper , we apply the concepts of faceted-search and browsing to the spokenweb search-problem . we use the concepts of facets to index the meta-data associated with the audio content . we provide a mechanism to rank the facets based on the search-results . we develop an interactive-query interface that enables easy browsing of search-results through the top ranked facets . to our knowledge , this is the first system to use the concepts of facets in audio-search , and the first solution that provides an audio-search for the rural population . we present quantitative results to illustrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the faceted-search and qualitative results to highlight the usability of the interactive-browsing system . the experiments have been conducted on more than 4000 audio documents collected from a live spokenweb voicesite and evaluations were carried out with 40 farmers who are the target users of the voicesite .
