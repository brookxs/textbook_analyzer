weighted linear-kernel with tree transformed features for malware-detection malware-detection from network-traffic flows is a challenging problem due to data irregularity issues such as imbalanced-class-distribution , noise , missing-values , and heterogeneous-types of features . to address these challenges , this paper presents a two-stage-classification approach for malware-detection . the framework initially employs random-forest as a macro-level classifier to separate the malicious from non-malicious network-flows , followed by a collection of one-class support-vector-machine classifiers to identify the specific type of malware . a novel tree-based feature-construction approach is proposed to deal with data imperfection issues . as the performance of the support-vector-machine-classifier often depends on the kernel-function used to compute the similarity between every pair of data points , designing an appropriate kernel is essential for accurate identification of malware classes . we present a simple algorithm to construct a weighted linear-kernel on the tree transformed features and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting malware from real network traffic-data .
