viper : augmenting automatic-information-extraction with visual perceptions in this paper we address the problem of unsupervised web-data-extraction . we show that unsupervised web-data-extraction becomes feasible when supposing pages that are made up of repetitive patterns , as it is the case , e.g. , for search-engine result pages . hereby the extraction rules are generated automatically without any training or human-interaction , by means of operating on the dom-tree respectively the flat tag token sequence of a single page.our contribution to automatic data extraction through this paper is twofold . first , we identify and rank potential repetitive patterns with respect to the user 's visual-perception of the-web page , well aware that location and size of matching elements within a web-page constitute important criteria for defining relevance . second , matching sub-sequences of the pattern with the highest weightiness are aligned with global multiple-sequence-alignment techniques . experimental-results show that our system is able to achieve high accuracy in distilling and aligning regularly structured-objects inside complex web-pages .
