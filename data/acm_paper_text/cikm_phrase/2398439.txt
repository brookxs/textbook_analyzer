efficient provenance-storage for relational queries provenance information is vital in many application areas as it helps explain data-lineage and derivation . however , storing fine-grained provenance information can be expensive . in this paper , we present a framework for storing provenance information relating to data derived via database queries . in particular , we first propose a provenance tree-data structure which matches the query-structure and thereby presents a possibility to avoid redundant storage of information regarding the derivation-process . then we investigate two approaches for reducing storage costs . the first approach utilizes two ingenious rules to achieve reduction on provenance trees . the second one is a dynamic-programming solution , which provides a way of optimizing the selection of query-tree nodes where provenance information should be stored . the optimization-algorithm runs in polynomial-time in the query size and is linear in the size of the provenance information , thus enabling provenance tracking and optimization without incurring large overheads . experiments show that our approaches guarantee significantly lower storage costs than existing approaches .
