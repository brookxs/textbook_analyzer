trained trigger-language-model for sentence-retrieval in qa : bridging the vocabulary gap we propose a novel language-model for sentence-retrieval in question-answering (qa) systems called trained trigger-language-model . this model addresses the word-mismatch-problem in information-retrieval . the proposed model captures pairs of trigger and target words while training on a large-corpus . the word-pairs are extracted based on both unsupervised and supervised approaches while different notions of triggering are used . in addition , we study the impact of corpus-size and domain for a supervised-model . all notions of the trained trigger model are finally used in a language model-based sentence-retrieval framework . our experiments on trec qa collection verify that the proposed model significantly improves the sentence-retrieval performance compared to the state-of-the-art translation-model and class model which address the same problem .
