algebraic equivalences among nested relational expressions algebraic optimization is both theoretically and practically important for query-processing in (nested) relational-databases . in this paper , we consider this issue and investigate some algebraic-properties concerning the nested relational operators . we also outline a heuristic-optimization algorithm for nested relational expressions by adopting algebraic transformation-rules developed in this paper and previous related work .
