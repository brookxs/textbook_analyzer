multiversion divergence control of time fuzziness epsilon serializability (esr) has been proposed to manage and control inconsistency in extending the classic transaction-processing . esr increases system-concurrency by tolerating a bounded amount of inconsistency . in this paper , we present multiversion divergence control (mvdc) algorithms that support esr with not only value but also time fuzziness in multiversion databases . unlike value fuzziness , accumulating time fuzziness is semantically different . a simple summation of the length of two time-intervals may either underestimate the total time fuzziness , resulting in incorrect execution , or overestimate the total time fuzziness , unnecessarily degrading the effectiveness of mvesr . we present a new operation , called timeunion , to accurately accumulate the total time fuzziness . because of the accurate control of time and value fuzziness by the mvdc algorithm , mvesr is very suitable for the use of multiversion databases for real-time-applications that may tolerate a limited degree of data inconsistency but prefer more data recency .
