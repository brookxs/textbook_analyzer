minimal document-set-retrieval this paper presents a novel formulation and approach to the minimal document-set-retrieval problem . minimal document-set-retrieval (mdsr) is a promising information-retrieval-task in which each query topic is assumed to have different subtopics ; the task is to retrieve and rank relevant-document sets with maximum-coverage but minimum redundancy of subtopics in each set . for this task , we propose three document-set-retrieval and ranking-algorithms : novelty_based method , cluster_based method and subtopic extraction_based method . in order to evaluate the system-performance , we design a new evaluation-framework for document-set ranking which evaluates both relevance between set and query topic , and redundancy within each set . finally , we compare the performance of the three algorithms using the trec interactive track dataset . experimental-results show the effectiveness of our algorithms .
