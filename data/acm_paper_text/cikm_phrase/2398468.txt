efficient extraction of ontologies from domain-specific text-corpora extracting ontological relationships (e.g. , isa and hasa) from free-text repositories (e.g. , engineering documents and instruction manuals) can improve users ' queries , as well as benefit applications built for these domains . current methods to extract ontologies from text usually miss many meaningful relationships because they either concentrate on single-word terms and short phrases or neglect syntactic relationships between concepts in sentences . we propose a novel pattern-based algorithm to find ontological relationships between complex concepts by exploiting parsing-information to extract multi-word concepts and nested concepts . our procedure is iterative : we tailor the constrained sequential-pattern-mining framework to discover new patterns . our experiments on three real-data sets show that our algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms previous representative ontology-extraction algorithms .
