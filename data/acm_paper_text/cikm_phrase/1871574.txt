ranking related entities : components and analyses related entity finding is the task of returning a ranked list of homepages of relevant entities of a specified type that need to engage in a given relationship with a given source entity . we propose a framework for addressing this task and perform a detailed analysis of four core components ; co-occurrence models , type filtering , context-modeling and homepage finding . our initial focus is on recall . we analyze the performance of a model that only uses co-occurrence-statistics . while this method identifies the potential set of related entities , it fails to rank them effectively . two types of error emerge : (1) entities of the wrong type pollute the ranking and (2) while somehow associated to the source entity , some retrieved entities do not engage in the right relation with it . to address (1) , we add type filtering based on category-information available in wikipedia . to correct for (2) , we complement our related entity finding method with contextual-information , represented as language-models derived from documents in which source and target entities co-occur . to complete the pipeline , we find homepages of top ranked entities by combining a language-modeling-approach with heuristics based on wikipedia 's external-links . our method achieves very high recall scores on the end-to-end task , providing a solid starting point for expanding our focus to improve precision . our framework can effectively incorporate additional heuristics and these extensions lead to state-of-the-art performance .
