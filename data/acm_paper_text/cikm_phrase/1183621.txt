distributed spatio-temporal-similarity-search in this paper we introduce the distributed spatio-temporal-similarity-search problem : given a query trajectory q , we want to find the trajectories that follow a motion similar to q , when each of the target trajectories is segmented across a number of distributed nodes . we propose two novel algorithms , ub-k and ublb-k , which combine local computations of lower-and-upper-bounds on the matching between the distributed subsequences and q . such an operation generates the desired result without pulling together all the distributed subsequences over the fundamentally expensive communication-medium . our solutions find applications in a wide array of domains , such as cellular-networks , wild life monitoring and video-surveillance . our experimental-evaluation using realistic data demonstrates that our framework is both efficient and robust to a variety of conditions .
