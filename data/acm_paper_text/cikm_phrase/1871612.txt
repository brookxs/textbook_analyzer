an efficient data-centric-storage scheme considering storage and query hot-spots in sensor-networks in wireless-sensor-networks , various schemes have been proposed to efficiently store and process sensed data . among them , the data-centric-storage (dcs) scheme is one of the most well-known . the dcs scheme distributes data regions and stores the data in the sensor that is responsible for the region . in this paper , we propose a new dcs_based scheme , called time-parameterized data-centric-storage (tpdcs) , that avoids the problems of storage-hot-spots and query hotspots . to decentralize the skewed data and queries , the data regions are assigned by a time-dimension as well as data dimensions in our proposed scheme . therefore , tpdcs extends the lifetime of sensor networks . it is shown through various experiments that our scheme outperforms the existing schemes .
