topic-driven reader comments summarization readers of a news article often read its comments contributed by other readers . by reading comments , readers obtain not only complementary information about this news article but also the opinions from other readers . however , the existing ranking-mechanisms for comments (e.g. , by recency or by user rating) fail to offer an overall picture of topics discussed in comments . in this paper , we first propose to study topic-driven reader comments summarization (torcs) problem . we observe that many news-articles from a news stream are related to each other ; so are their comments . hence , news-articles and their associated comments provide context-information for user commenting . to implicitly capture the context-information , we propose two topic-models to address the torcs problem , namely , master-slave topic-model (mstm) and extended master-slave topic-model (extm) . both models treat a news article as a master document and each of its comments as a slave document . mstm model constrains that the topics discussed in comments have to be derived from the commenting news article . on the other hand , extm model allows generating words of comments using both the topics derived from the commenting news article , and the topics derived from all comments themselves . both models are used to group comments into topic clusters . we then use two ranking-mechanisms maximal-marginal-relevance (mmr) and rating &#38; length (rl) to select a few most representative comments from each comment cluster . to evaluate the two models , we conducted experiments on 1005 yahoo! news-articles with more than one million comments . our experimental-results show that extm significantly outperforms mstm by perplexity . through a user-study , we also confirm that the comment summary generated by extm achieves better intra-cluster topic cohesion and inter-cluster topic diversity .
