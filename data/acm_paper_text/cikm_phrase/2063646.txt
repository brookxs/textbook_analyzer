indexes for highly repetitive document-collections we introduce new compressed inverted-indexes for highly repetitive document-collections . they are based on run-length , lempel-ziv , or grammar-based compression of the differential inverted-lists , instead of gap-encoding them as is the usual practice . we show that our compression methods significantly reduce the space achieved by classical compression , at the price of moderate slowdowns . moreover , many of our methods are universal , that is , they do not need to know the versioning structure of the collection . we also introduce compressed self-indexes in the comparison . we show that techniques can compress much further , using a small fraction of the space required by our new inverted-indexes , yet they are orders of magnitude slower .
