easiest-first search : towards comprehension-based web-search although web-search-engines have become information gateways to the-internet , for queries containing technical-terms , search-results often contain pages that are difficult to be understood by non-expert-users . therefore , re-ranking search results in a descending order of their comprehensibility should be effective for non-expert-users . in our approach , the comprehensibility of web-pages is estimated considering both the document readability and the difficulty of technical-terms in the domain of search queries . to extract technical-terms , we exploit the domain-knowledge extracted from wikipedia . our proposed method can be applied to general web-search-engines as wikipedia includes nearly every field of human-knowledge . we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by user-experiments .
