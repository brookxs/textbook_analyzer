group-by skyline-query processing in relational engines the skyline-operator was first proposed in 2001 for retrieving interesting tuples from a dataset . since then , 100 + skyline-related papers have been published ; however , we discovered that one of the most intuitive and practical type of skyline-queries , namely , group-by skyline-queries remains unaddressed . group-by skyline-queries find the skyline for each group of tuples . in this paper , we present a comprehensive study on processing group-by skyline-queries in the context of relational engines . specifically , we examine the composition of a query-plan for a group-by skyline-query and develop the missing cost-model for the bbs algorithm . experimental-results show that our techniques are able to devise the best query plans for a variety of group-by skyline-queries . our focus is on algorithms that can be directly implemented in today 's commercial database systems without the addition of new access-methods (which would require addressing the associated challenges of maintenance with updates , concurrency-control , etc.) .
