bootstrapping for example-based data-extraction the effortless generation of wrappers for web-data sources is a crucial task if proper access to the huge amount of semi-structured-data on the web is to be granted . in particular , the development of strategies for wrapper-generation based on user-given examples is currently one of the most promising research-directions in web-data-extraction . in this paper we show how to use a pre-existing data-repository to automatically generate examples and allow full automated example-based data-extraction . to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach we provide a number of results obtained from experiments we carried out and discuss how our ideas can be used to improve extraction rates and for providing resilience and adaptiveness for example-based generated wrappers .
