merging techniques for performing data-fusion on the web-data-fusion on the web refers to the merging , into a unified single list , of the ranked document lists , which are retrieved in response to a user-query by more than one web-search-engine . it is performed by metasearch engines and their merging algorithms utilise the information present in the ranked-lists of retrieved documents provided to them by the underlying search-engines , such as the rank positions of the retrieved documents and their retrieval scores . in this paper , merging techniques are introduced that take into account not only the rank positions , but also the title and the summary accompanying the retrieved documents . furthermore , the data-fusion process is viewed as being similar to the combination of belief in uncertain-reasoning and is modelled using dempster-shafer 's theory-of-evidence . our evaluation experiments indicate that the above merging techniques yield improvements in the effectiveness and that their effectiveness is comparable to that of the approach that merges the ranked-lists by downloading and analysing the-web documents .
