from bits and bytes to information and knowledge unstructured-data is a valuable source of information and implicit-knowledge . yet , the bits and bytes of , e.g. , text , image , or click-stream data need to be interpreted in order to transform them into business-intelligence and actionable information . clearly , this process needs to be automated to the largest possible extend in order to be scalable to the typical volumes of data . one way to accomplish this is through the use of machine-learning and statistical-modelling techniques . this talk will provide an overview of recent progress and new-trends in machine-learning and discuss their relevance for developing intelligent-tools for search , information-filtering , categorization , and knowledge-extraction .
