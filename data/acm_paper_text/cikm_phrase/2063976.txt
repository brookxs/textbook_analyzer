block-based load-balancing for entity-resolution with mapreduce the effectiveness and scalability of mapreduce-based implementations of complex data-intensive tasks depend on an even redistribution of data between map and reduce tasks . in the presence of skewed data , sophisticated redistribution approaches thus become necessary to achieve load-balancing among all reduce tasks to be executed in parallel . for the complex problem of entity-resolution with blocking , we propose blocksplit , a load-balancing approach that supports blocking techniques to reduce the search-space of entity-resolution . the evaluation on a real cloud-infrastructure shows the value and effectiveness of the proposed approach .
