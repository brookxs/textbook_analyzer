the-semantic-web : managing knowledge for planet earth the-semantic-web (sweb) is a vision - actually , a number of visions - which is beginning to show some signs of potential reality . the core of the vision is a synergy between machine-accessible knowledge and the global reach of the-web . the deployment of knowledge technologies on a planet-wide open-network brings new challenges and opportunities , many of them not yet fully realized . this talk briefly surveys the current-state of play in sweb standards and technology , including some of the rather heated controversies , and tries to give a high-level view of some of these challenges and opportunities . some traditional hard problems in km may largely evaporate ; but new ones will take their place .
