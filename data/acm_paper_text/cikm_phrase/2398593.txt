efficient estimation of dynamic density-functions with an application to outlier-detection in this paper , we propose a new method to estimate the dynamic density over data-streams , named kde-track as it is based on a conventional and widely used kernel-density-estimation (kde) method . kde-track can efficiently estimate the density with linear-complexity by using interpolation on a kernel model , which is incrementally updated upon the arrival of streaming-data . both theoretical-analysis and experimental-validation show that kde-track outperforms traditional kde and a baseline method cluster-kernels on estimation-accuracy of the complex density structures in data-streams , computing time and memory-usage . kde-track is also demonstrated on timely catching the dynamic density of synthetic and real-world-data . in addition , kde-track is used to accurately detect outliers in sensor-data and compared with two existing methods developed for detecting outliers and cleaning sensor-data .
