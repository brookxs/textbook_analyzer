understanding retweeting behaviors in social-networks retweeting is an important action (behavior) on twitter , indicating the behavior that users re-post microblogs of their friends . while much work has been conducted for mining textual content that users generate or analyzing the social-network structure , few publications systematically study the underlying mechanism of the retweeting behaviors . in this paper , we perform an interesting analysis for the problem on twitter . we have found that almost 25.5 \ % of the tweets posted by users are actually retweeted from friends ' blog spaces . our investigation unveils that for the retweet behaviors , some statistics still follows the power-law-distribution , while some others violate the state-of-the-art distribution for web . based on these important observations , we propose a factor-graph model to predict users ' retweeting behaviors . experimental-results on the twitter data-set show that our method can achieve a precision of 28.81 \ % and recall of 37.33 \ % for prediction of the retweet behaviors .
