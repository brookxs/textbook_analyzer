data-fusion with estimated weights this paper proposes an adptive approach for data-fusion of information-retrieval-systems , which exploits estimated performances of all component input systems without relevance-judgement or training . the estimation is conducted prior to the fusion but uses the same data as fusion applies . the experiment shows that our algorithms are competitive with , and often outperform combmnz , one of the most effective algorithms in use .
