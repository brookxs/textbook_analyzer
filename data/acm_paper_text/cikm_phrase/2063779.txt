automated feature-generation from structured-knowledge the prediction-accuracy of any learning-algorithm highly depends on the quality of the selected features ; but often , the task of feature-construction-and-selection is tedious and nonscalable . in recent years , however , there have been numerous projects with the goal of constructing general-purpose or domain-specific-knowledge bases with entity-relationship-entity triples extracted from various web sources or collected from user-communities , e.g. yago , dbpedia , freebase , umls , etc. . this paper advocates the simple and yet far-reaching idea that the structured-knowledge contained in such knowledge-bases can be exploited to automatically extract features for general learning tasks . we introduce an expressive graph-based language for extracting features from such knowledge-bases and a theoretical-framework for constructing feature-vectors from the extracted features . our experimental-evaluation on different learning-scenarios provides evidence that the features derived through our framework can considerably improve the prediction-accuracy , especially when the labeled-data at hand is sparse .
