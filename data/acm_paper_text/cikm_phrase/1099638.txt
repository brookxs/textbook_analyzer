slicing * - tree_based web-page transformation for small-displays we propose a new web page transformation method for browsing on mobile-devices with small-displays . in our approach , an original web-page that does not fit into the screen is transformed into a set of pages , each of which fits into the screen . this transformation is done through slicing the original page . the resulting set of transformed pages form a multi-level tree structure , called a slicing * - tree , in which an internal node consists of a thumbnail image with hyperlinks and a leaf node is a block from the original web-page . our slicing * - tree_based web-page transformation eases web-browsing on small-displays by providing screen-fitting visual-context and reducing page scrolling effort .
