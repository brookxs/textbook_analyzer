intent-aware query-similarity query-similarity calculation is an important problem and has a wide range of applications in ir , including query-recommendation , query-expansion , and even advertisement matching . existing work on query-similarity aims to provide a single similarity-measure without considering the fact that queries are ambiguous and usually have multiple search-intents . in this paper , we argue that query-similarity should be defined upon search-intents , so-called intent-aware query-similarity . by introducing search-intents into the calculation of query-similarity , we can obtain more accurate and also informative similarity-measures on queries and thus help a variety of applications , especially those related to diversification . specifically , we first identify the potential search-intents of queries , and then measure query-similarity under different intents using intent-aware representations . a regularized-topic-model is employed to automatically learn the potential intents of queries by using both the words from search result snippets and the regularization from query co-clicks . experimental-results confirm the effectiveness of intent-aware query-similarity on ambiguous-queries which can provide significantly better similarity-scores over the traditional approaches . we also experimentally verified the utility of intent-aware similarity in the application of query-recommendation , which can suggest diverse queries in a structured way to search users .
