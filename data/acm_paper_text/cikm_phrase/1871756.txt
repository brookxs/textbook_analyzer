regularization and feature-selection for networked features in the standard formalization of supervised-learning problems , a datum is represented as a vector of features without prior-knowledge about relationships among features . however , for many real-world problems , we have such prior-knowledge about structure relationships among features . for instance , in microarray-analysis where the genes are features , the genes form biological-pathways . such prior-knowledge should be incorporated to build a more accurate and interpretable model , especially in applications with high-dimensionality and low sample sizes . towards an efficient incorporation of the structure relationships , we have designed a classification-model where we use an undirected-graph to capture the relationship of features . in our method , we combine both l 1 norm and laplacian_based l 2 norm regularization with logistic-regression . in this approach , we enforce model sparsity and smoothness among features to identify a small subset of grouped features . we have derived efficient-optimization algorithms based on coordinate decent for the new formulation . using comprehensive experimental-study , we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed learning-methods .
