weakly-supervised relation-classification for information-extraction this paper approaches the relation classification-problem in information-extraction framework with bootstrapping on top of support-vector-machines . a new bootstrapping-algorithm is proposed and empirically evaluated on the ace-corpus . we show that the supervised svm-classifier using various lexical and syntactic-features can achieve promising classification-accuracy . more importantly , the proposed <i> bootproject </i> algorithm based on random feature-projection can significantly reduce the need for labeled-training-data with only limited sacrifice of performance .
