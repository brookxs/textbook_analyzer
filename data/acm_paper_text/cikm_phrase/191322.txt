kqml as an agent-communication-language this paper describes the design of and experimentation with the knowledge query and manipulation language (kqml) , a new language and protocol for exchanging information and knowledge . this work is part of a larger effort , the arpa knowledge-sharing effort which is aimed at developing techniques and methodology for building large-scale knowledge-bases which are sharable and reusable . kqml is both a message-format and a message-handling protocol to support run-time knowledge-sharing among agents . kqml focuses on an extensible set of performatives , which defines the permissible speech-acts agents may use and comprise a substrate on which to develop higher-level models of interagent interaction such as contract nets and negotiation . in addition , kqml provides a basic architecture for knowledge-sharing through a special class of agent called communication facilitors which coordinate the interactions of other agents . the ideas which underlie the evolving design of kqml are currently being explored through experimental prototype systems which are being used to support several testbeds in such areas as concurrent-engineering , intelligent-design and intelligent-planning and scheduling .
