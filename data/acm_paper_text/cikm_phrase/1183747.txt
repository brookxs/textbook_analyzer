information-retrieval from relational-databases using semantic-queries relational-databases are widely used today as a mechanism for providing access to structured-data . they , however , are not suitable for typical information-finding tasks of end-users . there is often a semantic-gap between the queries users want to express and the queries that can be answered by the database . in this paper , we propose a system that bridges this semantic-gap using domain-knowledge contained in ontologies . our system extends relational-databases with the ability to answer semantic-queries that are represented in sparql , an emerging semantic-web query-language . users express their queries in sparql , based on a semantic-model of the data , and they get back semantically relevant results . we define different categories of results that are semantically relevant to the users ' query and show how our system retrieves these results . we evaluate the performance of our system on sample relational-databases , using a combination of standard and custom ontologies .
