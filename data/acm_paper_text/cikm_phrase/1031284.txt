distributional term representations : an experimental-comparison a number of content-management tasks , including term-categorization , term-clustering , and automated thesaurus generation , view natural-language <i> terms </i> (e.g. words , noun-phrases) as first-class objects , i.e. as objects endowed with an internal-representation which makes them suitable for explicit-manipulation by the corresponding algorithms . the information-retrieval (ir) literature has traditionally used an extensional (aka <i> distributional </i>) representation for terms according to which a term is represented by the `` bag of documents '' in which the term occurs . the computational-linguistics (cl) literature has independently developed an alternative distributional representation for terms , according to which a term is represented by the `` bag of terms '' that co-occur with it in some document . this paper aims at discovering which of the two representations is most effective , i.e. brings about higher effectiveness once used in tasks that require terms to be explicitly represented and manipulated . we carry out experiments on (i) a term-categorization task , and (ii) a term-clustering task ; this allows us to compare the two different representations in closely controlled experimental conditions . we report the results of experiments in which we categorize/cluster under 42 different classes the terms extracted from a corpus of more than 65,000 documents . our results show a substantial difference in effectiveness between the two representation styles ; we give both an intuitive explanation and an information-theoretic justification for these different behaviours .
