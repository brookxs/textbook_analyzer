topic-oriented collaborative-crawling a major concern in the implementation of a distributed web crawler is the choice of a strategy for partitioning the-web among the nodes in the system . our goal in selecting this strategy is to minimize the overlap between the activities of individual nodes . we propose a topic-oriented approach , in which the-web is partitioned into general subject areas with a crawler assigned to each . we examine design-alternatives for a topic-oriented distributed crawler , including the creation of a web-page classifier for use in this context . the approach is compared experimentally with a hash-based partitioning , in which crawler assignments are determined by hash-functions computed over urls and page contents . the experimental-evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach , addressing issues of communication-overhead , duplicate content detection , and page-quality assessment .
