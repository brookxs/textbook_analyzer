eigen-trend : trend-analysis in the blogosphere based on singular value decompositions the blogosphere - the totality of blog-related web-sites - has become a great source of trend-analysis in areas such as product survey , customer-relationship , and marketing . existing approaches are based on simple counts , such as the number of entries or the number of links . in this paper , we introduce a novel concept , coined eigen-trend , to represent the temporal trend in a group of blogs with common interests and propose two new techniques for extracting eigen-trends in blogs . first , we propose a trend-analysis technique based on the singular-value-decomposition . extracted eigen-trends provide new insights into multiple trends on the same keyword . second , we propose another trend-analysis technique based on a higher-order-singular-value-decomposition . this analyzes the blogosphere as a dynamic-graph structure and extracts eigen-trends that reflect the structural changes of the blogosphere over time . experimental-studies based on synthetic-data sets and a real blog-data set show that our new techniques can reveal a lot of interesting trend information and insights in the blogosphere that are not obtainable from traditional count-based methods .
