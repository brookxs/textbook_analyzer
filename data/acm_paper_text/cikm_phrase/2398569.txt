sonetrank : leveraging social-networks to personalize search earlier works on personalized-web-search focused on the click-through graphs , while recent works leverage social-annotations , which are often unavailable . on the other hand , many users are members of the social-networks and subscribe to social-groups . intuitively , users in the same group may have similar relevance-judgments for queries related to these groups . sonetrank utilizes this observation to personalize the-web search-results based on the aggregate relevance-feedback of the users in similar groups . sonetrank builds and maintains a rich graph-based-model , termed social aware search graph , consisting of groups , users , queries and results click-through information . sonetrank 's personalization scheme learns in a principled way to leverage the following three signals , of decreasing strength : the personal document preferences of the user , of the users of her social-groups relevant to the query , and of the other users in the network . sonetrank also uses a novel approach to measure the amount of personalization with respect to a user and a query , based on the query-specific richness of the user 's social profile . we evaluate sonetrank with users on amazon-mechanical-turk and show a significant improvement in ranking compared to state-of-the-art techniques .
