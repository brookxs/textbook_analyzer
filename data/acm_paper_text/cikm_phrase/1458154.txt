pruning nested xquery queries we present in this paper an approach for xquery optimization that exploits minimization opportunities raised in composition-style nesting of queries . more precisely , we consider the simplification of xquery queries in which the intermediate-result constructed by a subexpression is queried by another subexpression . based on a large subset of xquery , we describe a rule-based algorithm that recursively prunes query expressions , eliminating useless intermediate results . our algorithm takes as input an xquery expression that may have navigation within its subexpressions and outputs a simplified , equivalent xquery expression , and is thus readily usable as an optimization module in any existing xquery processor . we demonstrate by experiments the impact of our rewriting approach on query-evaluation costs and we prove formally its correctness .
