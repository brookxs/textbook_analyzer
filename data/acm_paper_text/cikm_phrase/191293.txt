the egg/yolk reliability hierarchy : semantic-data-integration using sorts with prototypes integration of disparate heterogeneous-databases requires translation of types . because a type in one system often has no exact counterpart in the others , fully reliable integration requires deep-understanding of the subject domain , with conceptual-analysis of type meanings . so far , reliable translation has had to be done by hand . in practice , few types are so crucial as to require full reliability . the egg/yolk hierarchy ranks types by the tolerable rashness in translation , based on prototypes in each type . each defined-class (egg) has a subclass of typical members (yolk) defined . we exploit cui , cohn and randell 's qualitative spatial simulation-program to create the hierarchy of all possible relations between source and target egg/yolk types , ranked by reliability . our eventual ranking is based on a poset combining four different preference criteria .
