exploring relevance for clicks mining feedback information from user click-through-data is an important issue for modern web-retrieval systems in terms of architecture-analysis , performance-evaluation and algorithm optimization . for commercial search engines , user click-through-data contains useful information as well as large amount of inevitable noises . this paper proposes an approach to recognize reliable and meaningful user-clicks (referred to as relevant clicks , rcs) in click-through-data . by modeling user click-through-behavior on search result lists , we propose several features to separate rcs from click noises . a learning-algorithm is presented to estimate the quality of user clicks . experimental-results on large-scale dataset show that : 1) our model effectively identifies rcs in noisy click-through-data ; 2) different from previous click-through analysis efforts , our approach works well for both hot queries and long-tail queries .
