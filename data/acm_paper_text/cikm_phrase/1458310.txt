a latent-variable-model for query-expansion using the hidden-markov-model we propose a novel probabilistic-method based on the hidden-markov-model (hmm) to learn the structure of a latent-variable-model (lvm) for query-language modeling . in the proposed lvm , the combinations of query terms are viewed as the latent-variables and the segmented chunks from the feedback documents are used as the observations given these latent-variables . our extensive experiments shows that our method significantly outperforms a number of strong baselines in terms of both effectiveness and robustness .
