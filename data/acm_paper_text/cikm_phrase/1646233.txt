multi-aspect opinion-polling from textual reviews this paper presents an unsupervised-approach to aspect-based opinion-polling from raw textual reviews without explicit-ratings . the key contribution of this paper is three-fold . first , a multi-aspect bootstrapping-algorithm is proposed to learn from unlabeled-data aspect-related terms of each aspect to be used for aspect-identification . second , an unsupervised-segmentation model is proposed to address the challenge of identifying multiple single-aspect units in a multi-aspect sentence . finally , an aspect-based opinion-polling algorithm is presented . experiments on real chinese restaurant reviews show that our opinion-polling method can achieve 75.5 \ % precision performance .
