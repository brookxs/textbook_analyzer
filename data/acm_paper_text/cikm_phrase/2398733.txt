cager : a framework for cross-page search existing search-engines have page as the unit of information of retrieval . they typically return a ranked list of pages , each being a search result containing the query keywords . this within-one-page constraint disallows utilization of relationship-information that is often available and greatly beneficial . to utilize relationship-information and improve search precision , we explore cross-page search , where each answer is a logical page consisting of multiple closely related-pages that collectively contain the query keywords . we have implemented a prototype cager , providing cross-page search and visualization over real dataset .
