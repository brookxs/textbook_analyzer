representing documents with named-entities for story-link-detection (sld) several information-organization , access , and filtering systems can benefit from different kind of document representations than those used in traditional information-retrieval (ir) . topic-detection-and-tracking (tdt) is an example of such an application . in this paper we demonstrate that named-entities serve as better choices of units for document-representation over all words . in order to test this hypothesis we study the effect of words-based and entity-based representations on story-link-detection (sld) - a core task in tdt research . the experiments on tdt corpora show that entity-based representations give significant improvements for sld . we also propose a mechanism to expand the set of named-entities used for document-representation , which enhances the performance in some cases . we then take a step further and analyze the limitations of using only named-entities for the document representation . our studies and experiments indicate that adding additional topical terms can help in addressing such limitations .
