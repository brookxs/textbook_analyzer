mapping web-pages to database records via link-paths in this paper we propose a new knowledge management task which aims to map web-pages to their corresponding records in a structured database . for example , the dblp database contains records for many computer scientists , and most of these persons have public web-pages ; if we can map the database-record with the appropriate web-page then the new information could be used to further describe the person 's database-record . to accomplish this goal we employ link-paths which contain anchor-texts from multiple paths through the-web ending at the-web page in question . we hypothesize that the information from these link-paths can be used to generate an accurate web-page to database-record mapping . experiments on two large , real-world data-sets , dblp and imdb for the structured-data and computer-science faculty members ' web-pages and official movie homepages for the-web page data , show that our method does provide an accurate mapping . finally , we conclude by issuing a call for further research on this promising new task .
