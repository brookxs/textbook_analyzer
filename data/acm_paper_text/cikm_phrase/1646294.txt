measuring system-performance and topic-discernment using generalized adaptive-weight mean standard approaches to evaluating and comparing information-retrieval-systems compute simple averages of performance-statistics across individual topics to measure the overall system-performance . however , topics vary in their ability to differentiate among systems based on their retrieval-performance . at the same time , systems that perform well on discriminative queries demonstrate notable qualities that should be reflected in the systems ' evaluation and ranking . this motivated research on alternative performance-measures that are sensitive to the discriminative value of topics and the performance consistency of systems . in this paper we provide a mathematical-formulation of a performance-measure that postulates the dependence between the system and topic characteristics . we propose the generalized adaptive-weight mean (gawm) measure and show how it can be computed as a fixed-point of a function for which the brouwer fixed-point-theorem applies . this guarantees the existence of a scoring-scheme that satisfies the starting axioms and can be used for ranking of both systems and topics . we apply our method to trec experiments and compare the gawm with the standard averages used in trec .
