model-based feedback in the language-modeling-approach to information-retrieval the language-modeling-approach to retrieval has been shown to perform well empirically . one advantage of this new approach is its statistical foundations . however , feedback , as one important component in a retrieval-system , has only been dealt with heuristically in this new retrieval approach : the original query is usually literally expanded by adding additional terms to it . such expansion-based feedback creates an inconsistent interpretation of the original and the expanded query . in this paper , we present a more principled approach to feedback in the language-modeling-approach . specifically , we treat feedback as updating the query-language-model based on the extra evidence carried by the feedback documents . such a model-based feedback strategy easily fits into an extension of the language-modeling-approach . we propose and evaluate two different approaches to updating a query-language-model based on feedback documents , one based on a generative probabilistic model of feedback documents and one based on minimization of the kl-divergence over feedback documents . experiment results show that both approaches are effective and outperform the rocchio feedback approach .
