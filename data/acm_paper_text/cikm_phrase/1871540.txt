selected new training-documents to update user-profile relevance-feedback (rf) has been proven very effective for improving retrieval-accuracy . adaptive information filtering (aif) technology has benefited from the improvements achieved in all the tasks involved over the last decades . a difficult problem in aif has been how to update the system with new feedback efficiently and effectively . in current feedback methods , the updating processes focus on updating system-parameters . in this paper , we developed a new approach , the adaptive relevance features discovery (arfd) . it automatically updates the system 's knowledge based on a sliding-window over positive and negative feedback to solve a nonmonotonic problem efficiently . some of the new training-documents will be selected using the knowledge that the system currently obtained . then , specific-features will be extracted from selected training-documents . different methods have been used to merge and revise the weights of features in a vector-space . the new model is designed for relevance features discovery (rfd) , a pattern-mining_based approach , which uses negative-relevance-feedback to improve the quality of extracted features from positive-feedback . learning-algorithms are also proposed to implement this approach on reuters-corpus volume 1 and trec topics . experiments show that the proposed approach can work efficiently and achieves the encouragement performance .
