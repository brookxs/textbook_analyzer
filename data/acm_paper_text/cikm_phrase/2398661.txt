an evaluation of corpus-driven measures of medical concept similarity for information-retrieval-measures of semantic-similarity between medical concepts are central to a number of techniques in medical-informatics , including query-expansion in medical-information-retrieval . previous work has mainly considered thesaurus-based path measures of semantic-similarity and has not compared different corpus-driven approaches in depth . we evaluate the effectiveness of eight common corpus-driven measures in capturing semantic-relatedness and compare these against human judged concept pairs assessed by medical professionals . our results show that certain corpus-driven measures correlate strongly (approx 0.8) with human judgements . an important finding is that performance was significantly affected by the choice of corpus used in priming the measure , i.e. , used as evidence from which corpus-driven similarities are drawn . this paper provides guidelines for the implementation of semantic-similarity-measures for medical-informatics and concludes with implications for medical-information-retrieval .
