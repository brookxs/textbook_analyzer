structured-data classification by means of matrix-factorization singular-value-decomposition (svd) has been extensively used in the classification context as a preprocessing step aiming to reduce the number of features of the input space . traditional classification algorithms are then applied on the new space to generate accurate models . in this paper , we propose a different use of svd . in our approach svd is the building-block of a new classification-algorithm , called cmf , and not that of a feature-reduction algorithm . in particular , we propose a new classification-algorithm where the classification-model corresponds to the k largest right singular vectors of the factorization of the training-dataset obtained by applying svd . the selected singular vectors allows representing the main `` characteristics '' of the training-data and can be used to provide accurate predictions . the experiments performed on 15 structured uci datasets show that cmf is efficient and , despite its simplicity , it is more accurate than many state-of-the-art classification algorithms .
