scalable clustering of signed-networks using balance normalized cut we consider the general $ k $ - way clustering problem in signed social networks where relationships-between-entities can be either positive or negative . motivated by social balance-theory , the clustering problem in signed-networks aims to find mutually antagonistic groups such that entities within the same group are friends with each other . a recent method proposed in [13] extended the spectral-clustering algorithm to the signed network setting by considering the signed graph-laplacian . this has been shown to be equivalent to finding clusters that minimize the 2-way signed ratio-cut . in this paper , we show that there is a fundamental weakness when we directly extend the signed laplacian to the k-way clustering problem . to overcome this weakness , we formulate new k-way objectives for signed-networks . in particular , we propose a criterion that is analogous to the normalized cut , called balance normalized cut , which is not only theoretically sound but also experimentally effective in k-way clustering . in addition , we prove that these objectives are equivalent to weighted kernel-k-means objectives by choosing an appropriate kernel matrix . employing this equivalence , we develop a multilevel-clustering framework for signed-networks . in this framework , we coarsen the graph-level by level and refine the clustering results at each level via a k-means_based algorithm so that the signed clustering objectives are optimized . this approach gives good quality clustering results , and is also highly efficient and scalable . in experiments , we see that our multilevel approach is competitive to other state-of-the-art methods , while it is much faster and more scalable . in particular , the largest graph we have considered in our experiments contains 1 million nodes and 100 million edges -- this graph can be clustered in less than four hundred seconds using our algorithm .
