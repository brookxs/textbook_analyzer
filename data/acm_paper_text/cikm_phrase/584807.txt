batch data-warehouse-maintenance in dynamic-environments data-warehouse view-maintenance is an important issue due to the growing use of warehouse technology for information-integration and data-analysis . given the dynamic nature of modern distributed-environments , both data updates and schema changes are likely to occur in different data sources . in applications that the real-time refreshment of data-warehouse extent under source changes is not critical , the source updates are usually maintained in a batch fashion to reduce the maintenance overhead . however , most prior work can only deal with batch source data updates . in this paper , we provide a solution strategy that is capable of batching both source data updates and schema changes . we propose techniques to first preprocess the initial source updates to summarize delta changes for each source . we then design a view-adaptation algorithm to adapt the warehouse view under these delta changes . we have implemented our solutions and incorporated into an existing data-warehouse prototype-system . the experimental-studies demonstrate excellent performance achievable by our batch techniques .
