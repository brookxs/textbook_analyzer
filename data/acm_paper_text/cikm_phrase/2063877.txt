topic-modeling for named-entity queries named-entities are observed in a large portion of web-search-queries (named-entity queries) , where each entity can be associated with many different query terms that refer to various aspects of this entity . organizing these query terms into topics helps understand major search-intents about entities and the discovered topics are useful for applications such as query-suggestion . furthermore , we notice that named-entities can often be organized into categories and those from the same category share many generic topics . therefore , working on a category of named-entities instead of individual ones helps avoid the problems caused by the sparsity and noise in the data . in this paper , named-entity topic-model (netm) is proposed to discover generic topics for a category of named-entities , where the quality of the generic topics is improved through the model-design and the parameter initialization . experiments based on query-log-data show that netm discovers high-quality topics and outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques by 12.8 \ % based on f1 measure .
