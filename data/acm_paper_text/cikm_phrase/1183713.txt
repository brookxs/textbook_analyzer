document-re-ranking using cluster-validation and label-propagation this paper proposes a novel document-re-ranking approach in information-retrieval , which is done by a label propagation-based semi-supervised-learning algorithm to utilize the intrinsic structure underlying in the large document data . since no labeled relevant or irrelevant documents are generally available in ir , our approach tries to extract some pseudo labeled documents from the ranking list of the initial retrieval . for pseudo relevant documents , we determine a cluster of documents from the top ones via cluster validation-based k-means-clustering ; for pseudo irrelevant ones , we pick a set of documents from the bottom ones . then the ranking of the documents can be conducted via label-propagation . evaluation on benchmark-corpora shows that the approach can achieve significant improvement over standard baselines and performs better than other related approaches .
