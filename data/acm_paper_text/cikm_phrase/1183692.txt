concept-based document-readability in domain-specific information-retrieval domain-specific information-retrieval has become in demand . not only domain-experts , but also average non-expert-users are interested in searching domain-specific (e.g. , medical and health) information from online-resources . however , a typical problem to average users is that the search-results are always a mixture of documents with different levels of readability . non-expert-users may want to see documents with higher readability on the top of the list . consequently the search-results need to be re-ranked in a descending order of readability . it is often not practical for domain-experts to manually label the readability of documents for large-databases . computational-models of readability needs to be investigated . however , traditional readability formulas are designed for general purpose text and insufficient to deal with technical-materials for domain-specific information-retrieval . more advanced algorithms such as textual-coherence model are computationally expensive for re-ranking a large number of retrieved documents . in this paper , we propose an effective and computationally tractable concept-based model of text-readability . in addition to textual genres of a document , our model also takes into account domain-specific knowledge , i.e. , how the domain-specific concepts contained in the document affect the document 's readability . three major readability formulas are proposed and applied to health and medical-information-retrieval . experimental-results show that our proposed readability formulas lead to remarkable improvements in terms of correlation with users ' readability ratings over four traditional readability measures .
