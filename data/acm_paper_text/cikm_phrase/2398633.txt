tracing clusters in evolving-graphs with node attributes data sources representing social-networks with additional attribute information about the nodes are widely available in today 's applications . recently , combined clustering-methods were introduced that consider graph information and attribute information simultaneously to detect meaningful clusters in such networks . in many cases , such attributed-graphs also evolve over time . therefore , there is a need for clustering-methods that are able to trace clusters over different time steps and analyze their evolution over time . in this paper , we extend our combined clustering-method db-csc to the analysis of evolving combined clusters .
