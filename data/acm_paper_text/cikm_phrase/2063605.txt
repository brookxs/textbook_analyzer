interactive sense feedback for difficult-queries ambiguity of query terms is a common cause of inaccurate retrieval results . existing work has mostly focused on studying how to improve retrieval-accuracy by automatically resolving word-sense-ambiguity . however , fully automatic sense-identification and disambiguation is a very challenging task . in this work , we propose to involve a user in the process of disambiguation through interactive sense feedback and study the potential effectiveness of this novel feedback strategy . we propose several general methods to automatically identify the major senses of query terms based on global-analysis of document-collection and generate concise-representations of the discovered senses to the users . this feedback strategy does not rely on initial retrieval results , and thus can be especially useful for improving the results of difficult-queries . we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed methods for sense-identification and presentation through simulation-experiments and user-studies , which both indicate that sense feedback strategy is a promising alternative to the existing interactive-feedback techniques such as relevance-feedback and term-feedback .
