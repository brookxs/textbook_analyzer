preserving location and absence-privacy in geo-social networks online-social-networks often involve very-large numbers of users who share very-large volumes of content . this content is increasingly being tagged with geo-spatial and temporal coordinates that may then be used in services . for example , a service may retrieve photos taken in a certain region . the resulting geo-aware social-networks (geosns) pose privacy threats beyond those found in location-based-services . content published in a geosn is often associated with references to multiple-users , without the publisher being aware of the privacy-preferences of those users . moreover , this content is often accessible to multiple-users . this renders it difficult for geosn users to control which information about them is available and to whom it is available . this paper addresses two privacy threats that occur in geosns : location-privacy and absence-privacy . the former concerns the availability of information about the presence of users in specific locations at given times , while the latter concerns the availability of information about the absence of an individual from specific locations during given periods of time . the challenge addressed is that of supporting privacy while still enabling useful services . we believe this is the first paper to formalize these two notions of privacy and to propose techniques for enforcing them . the techniques offer privacy guarantees , and the paper reports on empirical performance studies of the techniques .
