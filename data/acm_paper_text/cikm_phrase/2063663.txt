using query-log and social-tagging to refine queries based on latent topics an important way to improve users ' satisfaction in web-search is to assist them to issue more effective queries . one such approach is query-refinement (reformulation) , which generates new queries according to the current query issued by users . a common procedure for conducting refinement is to generate some candidate queries first , and then a scoring-method is designed to assess the quality of these candidates . currently , most of the existing methods are context based . they rely heavily on the context relation of terms in the historical queries , and can not detect and maintain the semantic consistency of queries . in this paper , we propose a graphical-model to score queries . the proposed model exploits a latent-topic space , which is automatically derived from the query-log , to assess the semantic dependency of terms in a query . in the graphical-model , both term-context dependency and topic context-dependency are considered . this also makes it feasible to score some queries which do not have much available historical term-context information . we also utilize social-tagging data in the candidate query-generation process . based on the observation that different users may tag the same resource with different tags of similar meaning , we propose a method to mine these term pairs for new candidate query-construction .
