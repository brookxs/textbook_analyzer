real-time aggregate monitoring with differential-privacy sharing real-time aggregate statistics of private-data has given much benefit to the public to perform data-mining for understanding important phenomena , such as influenza outbreaks and traffic-congestion . however , releasing time-series-data with standard differential-privacy mechanism has limited utility due to high correlation between data values . we propose fast , an adaptive-system to release real-time aggregate statistics under differential-privacy with improved utility . to minimize overall privacy cost , fast adaptively samples long time-series according to detected data dynamics . to improve the accuracy of data-release per time-stamp , filtering is used to predict data-values at non-sampling points and to estimate true values from noisy observations at sampling points . our experiments with three real-data sets confirm that fast improves the accuracy of time-series release and has excellent performance even under very small privacy cost .
