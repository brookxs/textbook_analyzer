an adaptive-algorithm for learning changes in user-interests in this paper , we describe a new scheme to learn dynamic user 's interests in an automated information filtering and gathering system running on the internet . our scheme is aimed to handle multiple domains of long-term and short-term user 's interests simultaneously , which is learned through positive and negative user 's relevance-feedback . we developed a 3-descriptor approach to represent the user 's interest categories . using a learning-algorithm derived for this representation , our scheme adapts quickly to significant changes in user-interest , and is also able to learn exceptions to interest categories .
