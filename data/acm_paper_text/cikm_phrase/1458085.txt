unsolved problems in search : (and how we approach them) search-applications have become ubiquitous and very successful . major advances have been made in understanding how to deliver effective results very efficiently for a class of queries . as the range of applications broaden to include web-search , desktop-search , enterprise-search , vertical-search , social-search , etc. , the number of new research-challenges has appeared to grow rather than shrink . many of these challenges are variations on underlying themes and principles that information-retrieval has focused on for more than 40 years . in this talk , several unsolved problems arising from new search applications will be discussed and some potential paths to solutions for these problems will be outlined .
