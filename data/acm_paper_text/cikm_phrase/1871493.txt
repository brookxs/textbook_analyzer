multilevel manifold-learning with application to spectral-clustering in the past decade , a number of nonlinear-dimensionality-reduction methods using an affinity-graph have been developed for manifold-learning . this paper explores a multilevel-framework with the goal of reducing the cost of unsupervised manifold-learning and preserving the embedding quality at the same time . an application to spectral-clustering is also presented . experimental-results indicate that our multilevel approach is an appealing alternative to standard techniques .
