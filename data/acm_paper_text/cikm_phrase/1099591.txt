collective multi-label-classification common approaches to multi-label-classification learn independent classifiers for each category , and employ ranking or thresholding schemes for classification . because they do not exploit dependencies between labels , such techniques are only well-suited to problems in which categories are independent . however , in many domains labels are highly interdependent . this paper explores multi-label conditional-random-field (crf) classification-models that directly parameterize label co-occurrences in multi-label-classification . experiments show that the models outperform their single-label counterparts on standard text-corpora . even when multi-labels are sparse , the models improve subset classification-error by as much as 40 \ % .
