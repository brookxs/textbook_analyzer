securely sharing neuroimagery shared scientific-data , such as neuroimagery , offers great benefits to science . however , data owners must exercise custodial responsibilities which can conflict with the unhindered sharing of their data . given simple choices of sharing widely or not at all , the result will frequently be no sharing . we hypothesize that neuroimagery sharing will be enhanced if data owners are provided with well-defined intermediate levels of data visibility . in this paper , we describe a broadly applicable data-sharing model , structured sharing communities (ssc) , in which data becomes incrementally visible to communities structured as a complete partial-order ; the associated properties of privacy and fairness regulate access to shared data . within ssc , a customized policy space is defined capturing the sharing relationships among specific collaborators .
