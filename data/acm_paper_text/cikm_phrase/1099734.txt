novelty-detection based on sentence-level patterns the detection of new information in a document-stream is an important component of many potential applications . in this paper , a new novelty-detection approach based on the identification of sentence-level patterns is proposed . given a user 's information-need , some patterns in sentences such as combinations of query words , named-entities and phrases , may contain more important and relevant-information than single words . therefore , the proposed novelty-detection approach focuses on the identification of previously unseen query-related patterns in sentences . specifically , a query is preprocessed and represented with patterns that include both query words and required answer types . these patterns are used to retrieve sentences , which are then determined to be novel if it is likely that a new answer is present . an analysis of patterns in sentences was performed with data from the trec 2002 novelty track and experiments on novelty-detection were carried out on data from the trec 2003 and 2004 novelty tracks . the experimental-results show that the proposed pattern-based approach significantly outperforms all three baselines in terms of precision-at-top-ranks .
