xoo7 : applying oo7 benchmark to xml-query-processing tool if xml is to play the critical role of the lingua franca for internet-data interchange that many predict , it is necessary to start designing and adopting benchmarks allowing the comparative performance-analysis of the tools being developed and proposed . the effectiveness of existing xml-query-languages has been studied by many , with a focus on the comparison of linguistic-features , implicitly reflecting the fact that most xml tools exist only on paper . in this paper , with a focus on efficiency and concreteness , we propose a pragmatic first step toward the systematic benchmarking of xml-query-processing platforms with an initial focus on the data (versus document) point-of-view . we propose xoo7 , an xml version of the oo7 benchmark . we discuss the applicability of xoo7 , its strengths , limitations and the extensions we are considering . we illustrate its use by presenting and discussing the performance-comparison against xoo7 of three different query-processing platforms for xml .
