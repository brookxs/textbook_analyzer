a comparative-study on classifying the functions of web-page blocks in this paper , we study the problem of learning block-classification models to estimate block functions . we distinguish general models , which are learned across multiple sites , and site-specific models , which are learned within individual sites . we further consider several factors that affect the learning-process and model effectiveness . these factors include the layout-features , the content-features , the classifiers , and the term-selection methods . we have empirically evaluated the performance of the models when the factors are varied . our main results are that layout-features do better than content-features for learning both general and site-specific models .
