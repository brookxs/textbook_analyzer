proximity 2 - aware ranking for textual , temporal , and geographic queries temporal and geographic-information-needs are frequent and important but not well served by standard ir systems . recent approaches address such needs by extracting and normalizing temporal and geographic expressions from documents . they calculate specific scores for the temporal and / or geographic parts of a query . however , all approaches assume independence between the different query parts . in this paper , we present a new model to rank documents according to combined textual , temporal , and geographic queries . the independence-assumption between the query parts is eliminated by calculating proximity scores . thus , documents are regarded to be more relevant if terms and expressions satisfying the different query parts occur close to each other in a document . as our evaluations based on the ntcir-geotime data show , our proposed model outperforms baseline models that do not use proximity information .
