social-recommendation incorporating topic-mining and social trust analysis we study the problem of social-recommendation incorporating topic-mining and social trust analysis . different from other works related to social-recommendation , we merge topic-mining and social trust analysis-techniques into recommender-systems for finding topics from the tags of the items and estimating the topic-specific social trust . we propose a probabilistic-matrix-factorization (ttmf) algorithm and try to enhance the recommendation-accuracy by utilizing the estimated topic-specific social trust relations . moreover , ttmf is also convenient to solve the item cold-start-problem by inferring the feature (topic) of new items from their tags . experiments are conducted on three different data-sets . the results validate the effectiveness of our method for improving recommendation-performance and its applicability to solve the cold-start-problem .
