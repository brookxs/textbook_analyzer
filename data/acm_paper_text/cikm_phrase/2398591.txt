credibility-based product-ranking for c2c transactions a fundamental issue for c2c transactions is how to rank the products based on the reviews written by the previous customers . in this paper , we present an approach to improve products ranking by tackling the noisy ratings that exist in the practical systems . the first problem is the credibility of the customers . we design an iterative-algorithm to measure the customer credibility . in the algorithm , we use a feedback strategy to increase or decrease the customer credibility . we increase the credibility for a customer if the customer gives a high (low) score to a good (bad) product and decrease the value if the customer gives a low (high) score to a good (bad) product . the second problem is the inconsistency between the review comments and scores . to deal with it , we train a classifier on a training-data that is constructed automatically . the trained classifier is used to predict the scores of the comments . finally , we calculate the scores of products by considering the customer credibility and the predicted scores . the experimental-results show that our proposed approach provides better products ranking than the baseline systems .
