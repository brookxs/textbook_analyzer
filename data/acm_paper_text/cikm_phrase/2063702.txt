accounting for data-dependencies within a hierarchical-dirichlet-process mixture-model we propose a hierarchical nonparametric topic-model , based on the hierarchical-dirichlet-process (hdp) , that accounts for dependencies among the data . the hdp mixture-models are useful for discovering an unknown semantic-structure (i.e. , topics) from a set of unstructured-data such as a corpus of documents . for simplicity , hdp makes an exchangeability assumption that any permutation of the data points would result in the same joint-probability of the data being generated . this exchangeability assumption poses a problem for some domains where there are clear and strong dependencies among the data . a model that allows for non-exchangeability of data can capture these dependencies and assign higher probabilities to clusters that account for data-dependencies , for example , inferring topics that reflect the temporal-patterns of the data . our model incorporates the distance dependent chinese restaurant process (ddcrp) , which clusters data with an inherent bias toward clusters of data points that are near to one another , into a hierarchical construction analogous to the hdp , and we call this new prior the distance dependent chinese restaurant franchise (ddcrf) . when tested with temporal-datasets , the ddcrf mixture-model shows clear improvements in data fit compared to the hdp in terms of heldout likelihood and complexity . the resulting set of topics shows the sequential emergence and disappearance patterns of topics .
