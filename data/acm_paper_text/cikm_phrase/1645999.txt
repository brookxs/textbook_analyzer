message-family-propagation for ising-mean-field based on iteration-tree ising-mean-field is a basic variational-inference method for ising-model , which can provide an effective approximate-solution for large-scale inference-problem . the main idea is to transform a probabilistic-inference problem into a functional extremum problem by variational-calculus , and solve the functional extremum problem to obtain approximate marginal distributions . the process of solving the functional extremum is an important step and a computational core for variational-inference . but the traditional full variational iteration methods make the variable information intercross with each other deeply . from the view of incomplete variational iterations , we propose a message-family-propagation method for ising-mean-field to compute a marginal distribution family of object variable . first we define the concepts of iteration-tree and pruning iteration-tree to describe the iteration computation process of ising-mean-field inference . then we design the message-family-propagation method based on the iteration trees . the method propagates mean-field message families and belief message families from bottom to top of the iteration-tree , and presents a marginal distribution family of variable in root-node . finally we prove the marginal distribution bound theorem , which shows that the marginal distribution family computed by the method in the pruning iteration-tree contains the exact marginal stribution . theoretical and experimental-results illustrate that the message-family-propagation method is valid and the marginal distribution bounds are tight .
