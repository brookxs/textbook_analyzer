computer-image-retrieval by features : selecting the best facial features for suspect-identification systems correct suspect-identification of known offenders by witnesses deteriorates rapidly as more are examined in mugshot albums . feature approaches , where mugshots are displayed in order of similarity to witnesses ' descriptions , increase identification success by reducing this number . system-performance depends on selection of system features . four methods of selecting features are evaluated empirically : theory , random , hill-climbing algorithm , and hybrid . the theory asserts success depends on five properties of system features : informativeness , orthogonality , sufficiency , consistency , and observability . comparing system-performance on the best 10 features selected (from a pool of 90) by each method supports our contention . in four experimental tests of a system with 1000 official mugshots , over 90 \ % of witness searches resulted in photos of target suspects retrieved in the first ten mugshots displayed for examination (using all 90 system features) . on average , suspects were retrieved in the first 54 , 7 , 22 , and 70 mugshots when using only the best 10 model features . hybrid and hill-climbing algorithms did not improve on this performance , and performance of randomly selected sets of 10 features was poor .
