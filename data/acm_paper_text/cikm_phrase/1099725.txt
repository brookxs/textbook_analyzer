query-expansion using term-relationships in language-models for information-retrieval language-modeling (lm) has been successfully applied to information-retrieval (ir) . however , most of the existing lm approaches only rely on term occurrences in documents , queries and document-collections . in traditional unigram_based models , terms (or words) are usually considered to be independent . in some recent studies , dependence models have been proposed to incorporate term-relationships into lm , so that links can be created between words in the same sentence , and term-relationships (e.g. synonymy) can be used to expand the document model . in this study , we further extend this family of dependence models in the following two ways : (1) term-relationships are used to expand query-model instead of document-model , so that query-expansion process can be naturally implemented ; (2) we exploit more sophisticated inferential relationships extracted with information-flow (if) . information-flow relationships are not simply pairwise term-relationships as those used in previous studies , but are between a set of terms and another term . they allow for context-dependent query-expansion . our experiments conducted on trec collections show that we can obtain large and significant improvements with our approach . this study shows that lm is an appropriate framework to implement effective query-expansion .
