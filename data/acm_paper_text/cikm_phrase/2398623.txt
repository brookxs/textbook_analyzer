learning to predict the cost-per-click for your ad words in internet ad campaign , ranking of an ad on search result pages depends on a cost-per-click (cpc) of ad words offered by an advertiser and a quality score estimated by a search-engine . bidding for ad words with a higher cpc is more competitive than bidding for the same ad words with a lower cpc in the ad ranking competition . however , offering a higher cpc will increase a burden on advertisers . in contrast , offering a lower cpc may decrease the exposure rate of their ads . thus , how to select an appropriate cpc for ad words is indispensable for advertisers . in this paper , we extract different semantic levels of features , such as named-entities , topic terminologies , and individual words from a large-scale real-world ad words corpus , and explore various learning based prediction algorithms . the thorough experimental-results show that the cpc prediction-models considering more ad words semantics achieve better prediction-performance , and the prediction-model using the support-vector-regression (svr) and features from all semantic levels performs the best .
