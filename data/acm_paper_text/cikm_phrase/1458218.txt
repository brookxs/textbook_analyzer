a two-stage text-mining model for information-filtering mismatch and overload are the two fundamental issues regarding the effectiveness of information-filtering . both term-based and pattern (phrase) based approaches have been employed to address these issues . however , they all suffer from some limitations with regard to effectiveness . this paper proposes a novel solution that includes two stages : an initial topic filtering stage followed by a stage involving pattern-taxonomy mining . the objective of the first stage is to address mismatch by quickly filtering out probable irrelevant documents . the threshold used in the first stage is motivated theoretically . the objective of the second stage is to address overload by apply pattern-mining techniques to rationalize the data relevance of the reduced document set after the first stage . substantial experiments on rcv1 show that the proposed solution achieves encouraging performance .
