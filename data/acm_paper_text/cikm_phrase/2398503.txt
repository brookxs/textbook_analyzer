degree relations of triangles in real-world networks and graph-models triangles are an important building-block and distinguishing feature of real-world networks , but their structure is still poorly understood . despite numerous reports on the abundance of triangles , there is very little information on what these triangles look like . we initiate the study of degree-labeled triangles , - specifically , degree homogeneity versus heterogeneity in triangles . this yields new insight into the structure of real-world graphs . we observe that networks coming from social and collaborative situations are dominated by homogeneous triangles , i.e. , degrees of vertices in a triangle are quite similar to each other . on the other hand , information-networks (e.g. , web-graphs) are dominated by heterogeneous triangles , i.e. , the degrees in triangles are quite disparate . surprisingly , nodes within the top 1 % of degrees participate in the vast majority of triangles in heterogeneous graphs . we investigate whether current graph-models reproduce the types of triangles that are observed in real-data and observe that most models fail to accurately capture these salient-features .
