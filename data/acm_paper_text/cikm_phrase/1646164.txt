context-sensitive document ranking ranking is a main research issue in ir-styled keyword-search over a set of documents . in this paper , we study a new keyword-search problem , called context-sensitive document ranking , which is to rank documents with an additional context that provides additional-information about the application-domain where the documents are to be searched and ranked . the work is motivated by the fact that additional-information associated with the documents can possibly assist users to find more relevant documents when they are unable to find the needed documents from the documents alone . in this paper , a context is a multi-attribute graph , which can represent any information maintained in a relational-database . the context-sensitive-ranking is related to several research-issues , how to score documents , how to evaluate the additional-information obtained in the context that may contribute the document ranking , how to rank the documents by combining the scores/costs from the documents and the context . more importantly , the relationships between documents and the information stored in a relational-database may be uncertain , because they are from different data sources and the relationships are determined systematically using similarity-match which causes uncertainty . in this paper , we concentrate ourselves on these research-issues , and provide our solution on how to rank the documents in a context where there exist uncertainty between the documents and the context . we confirm the effectiveness of our approaches by conducting extensive experimental-studies using real datasets .
