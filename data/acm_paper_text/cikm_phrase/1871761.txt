ranking of evolving stories through meta-aggregation in this paper we focus on the problem of ranking news stories within their historical context by exploiting their content-similarity . we observe that news stories evolve and thus have to be ranked in a time and query dependent manner . we do this in two steps . first , the mining step discovers metastories , which constitute meaningful groups of similar stories that occur at arbitrary points in time . second , the ranking step uses well known measures of content-similarity to construct implicit-links among all metastories , and uses them to rank those metastories that overlap the time-interval provided in a user-query . we use real-data from conventional and social-media sources (weblogs) to study the impact of different meta-aggregation techniques and similarity-measures in the final ranking . we evaluate the framework using both objective and subjective criteria , and discuss the selection of clustering-method and similarity-measure that lead to the best ranking results .
