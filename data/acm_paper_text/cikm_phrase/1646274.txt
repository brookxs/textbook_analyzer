answer-typing for information-retrieval answer-typing is commonly thought of as finding appropriate responses to given questions . we extend the notion of answer-typing to information-retrieval to ensure results contain plausible answers to queries . identification of a large class of applicable queries is performed using a discriminative-classifier , and discriminative preference-ranking methods are employed for the selection of type-appropriate terms . experimental-results show that type-appropriate terms identified by the model are superior to terms most commonly associated with the query , providing strong evidence that answer-typing techniques can find meaningful and appropriate terms . further experiments show that snippets containing correct answers are ranked higher by our model than by the baseline google-search-engine in those instances in which a query does indeed seek a short answer .
