tase : a time-aware-search engine most web-pages contain temporal-information , which can be utilized by search-engines to improve searching performance for users . however , traditional search-engines have little support in processing temporal-textual web-queries . aiming at solving this problem , in this paper we present and implement a prototype-system for time-sensitive queries , which is called tase (time-aware-search engine) . tase extracts both the explicit and implicit temporal expressions for each web-page , and calculates the relevant score between the-web page and each temporal-expression , and then re-rank search-results based on the temporal-textual relevance between web-pages and the queries . it is demonstrated that tase can improve the effectiveness of temporal-textual web-queries .
