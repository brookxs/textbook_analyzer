ir principles for content-based-indexing-and-retrieval of functional brain images in this paper , we explore the concept of a `` library of brain images '' , which implies not only a repository of brain images , but also efficient search and retrieval mechanisms that are based on models derived from ir practice . as a preliminary study , we have worked with a collection of functional-mri brain images assembled in the study of several distinct cognitive tasks . we adapt several classical ir methods (inverted-indexing , tfidf and latent-semantic-indexing (lsi)) to content-based brain image-retrieval . our results show that efficient and accurate-retrieval of brain images is possible , and that representations motivated by the ir perspective are somewhat more effective than are methods based on retaining the full image information .
