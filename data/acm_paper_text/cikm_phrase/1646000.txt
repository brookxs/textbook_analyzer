efficient itemset-generator discovery over a stream sliding-window mining generator patterns has raised great research interest in recent years . the main purpose of mining itemset generators is that they can form equivalence-classes together with closed-itemsets , and can be used to generate simple classification-rules according to the mdl-principle . in this paper , we devise an efficient-algorithm called streamgen to mine frequent-itemset generators over a stream sliding-window . we adopt a novel enumeration tree-structure to help keep the information of mined generators and the border between generators and non-generators , and propose some optimization-techniques to speed up the mining process . we further extend the algorithm to directly mine a set of high quality classification-rules over stream sliding-windows while keeping high-performance . the extensive performance-study shows that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms which perform similar tasks in terms of both runtime and memory-usage efficiency , and has high utility in terms of classification .
