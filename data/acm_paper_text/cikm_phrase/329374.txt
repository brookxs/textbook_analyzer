ontology-based web site mapping for information-exploration centralized search-process requires that the whole collection reside at a single site . this imposes a burden on both the system storage of the site and the network-traffic near the site . it thus comes to require the search-process to be distributed . recently , more and more web-sites provide the ability to search their local collection of web-pages . query brokering systems are used to direct queries to the promising sites and merge the results from these sites . creation of meta-information of the sites plays an important role in such systems . in this article , we introduce an ontology-based web site mapping-method used to produce conceptual meta-information , the vector-space approach , and present a serial of experiments comparing it with na ve-bayes approach . we found that the vector-space approach produces better accuracy in ontology-based web site mapping .
