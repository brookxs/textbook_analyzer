efficient l p - norm multiple-feature metric-learning for image-categorization previous metric-learning approaches are only able to learn the metric based on single concatenated multivariate feature-representation . however , for many real-world problems with multiple-feature representation such as image-categorization , the model trained by previous approaches will degrade because of sparsity brought by significant dimension growth and uncontrolled influence from each feature channel . in this paper , we propose an efficient distance-metric-learning model which adapts distance-metric-learning on multiple-feature representations . the aim is to learn the mahalanobis matrices for each independent feature and their non-sparse lp-norm weight coefficients simultaneously by maximizing the margin of the overall learned distance-metric among the pairs from the same class and the distance of pairs from different classes . we further extend this method to nonlinear kernel learning and category specific metric-learning , which demonstrate the applicability of using many existing kernels for image-data and exploring the hierarchical semantic-structures for large-scale image datasets . experiments on various datasets demonstrate the promising power of our method .
