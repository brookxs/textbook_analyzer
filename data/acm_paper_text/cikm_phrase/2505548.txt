anchormf : towards effective event-context identification online-social-networks (osns) such as twitter provide a good platform for event discussions . recent research [26] [25] as shown that event discussions in osns are diverse and innovative and encourage public-engagement in events . although much research has been conducted in osns to track and detect events , there has been limited research on detecting or understanding the event-context . event-context helps to better predict users ' participation in events , identify relations among events , and recommend friends who share similar event-context . in this work , we have developed anchormf , a matrix-factorization_based technique that aims to identify event-context by leveraging a prevalent feature in osns , the anchor information . our anchormf work makes three key contributions : (1) a formal-definition of the event-context identification problem ; (2) anchor selection and incorporation into the-matrix factorization process for effective event-context identification ; and (3) demonstration of applying event-context for user-event participation prediction , relevant events retrieval , and friendship recommendation . evaluation based on 1.1 million twitter users over a one-month data-collection period shows that anchormf achieves a 20.0 % improvement in terms of user-event participation prediction .
