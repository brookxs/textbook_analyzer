healthtrust : trust-based retrieval of you tube 's diabetes channels the-internet has become one of the main sources of consumer-health-information . health-consumers have access to ever-growing health-information resources , especially since the rise of the social-media . for example , over 20.000 videos have been uploaded by american hospitals on to youtube . to find health videos is challenging because of factors like tags spamming and misleading information . previous studies have found difficulties when searching for good health videos in youtube , including false information (e.g. , herbal cures for diabetes or cancer) . our objective was to extract information about the trustworthiness of the diabetes youtube 's channels using link-analysis of the diabetes online-community by developing an algorithm , called healthtrust , based on hyperlink-induced topic search (hits) for ranking the most authoritative diabetes channels . the ranked list of channels from healthtrust was compared with the list of the most relevant diabetes channels from youtube . two healthcare professionals made a blinded classification of channels based on whether they would recommend the channel to a patient . healthtrust performed better for retrieving channels recommended by the professional reviewers . healthtrust performed several times better than youtube for filtering out the worst channels (i.e. , those not recommended by any expert reviewer) .
