distributed social graph-embedding distributed recommender-systems are becoming increasingly important for they address both scalability and the big brother syndrome . link-prediction is one of the core mechanism in recommender-systems and relies on extracting some notion of proximity between entities in a graph . applied to social-networks , defining a proximity metric between users enable to predict potential relevant future relationships . in this paper , we propose socs (social coordinate systems} , a fully distributed-algorithm that embeds any social-graph in an euclidean-space , which can easily be used to implement link-prediction . to the best of our knowledge , socs is the first system explicitly relying on graph-embedding . inspired by recent works on non-isomorphic embeddings , the socs embedding preserves the community-structure of the original graph , while being easy to decentralize . nodes thus get assigned coordinates that reflect their social position . we show-through experiments on real and synthetic-data sets that these coordinates can be exploited for efficient link-prediction .
