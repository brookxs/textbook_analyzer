optimizing plurality for human-intelligence tasks in a crowdsourcing system , human-intelligence tasks (hits) (e.g. , translating sentences , matching photos , tagging videos with keywords) can be conveniently specified . hits are made available to a large pool of workers , who are paid upon completing the hits they have selected . since workers may have different capabilities , some difficult hits may not be satisfactorily performed by a single worker . if more workers are employed to perform a hit , the quality of the hit 's answer could be statistically improved . given a set of hits and a fixed `` budget '' , we address the important problem of determining the number of workers (or plurality) of each hit so that the overall answer-quality is optimized . we propose a dynamic-programming (dp) algorithm for solving the plurality assignment-problem (pap) . we identify two interesting properties , namely , monotonicity and diminishing return , which are satisfied by a hit if the quality of the hit 's answer increases monotonically at a decreasing rate with its plurality . we show for hits that satisfy the two properties (e.g. , multiple-choice-question hits) , the pap is approximable . we propose an efficient greedy-algorithm for such case . we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets to evaluate our algorithms . our experiments show that our greedy-algorithm provides close-to-optimal solutions in practice .
