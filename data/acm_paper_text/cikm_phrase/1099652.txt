document-quality models for web ad-hoc-retrieval the quality of document-content , which is an issue that is usually ignored for the traditional ad-hoc-retrieval task , is a critical issue for web-search . web-pages have a huge variation in quality relative to , for example , newswire articles . to address this problem , we propose a document-quality language-model-approach that is incorporated into the basic query likelihood retrieval-model in the form of a prior-probability . our results demonstrate that , on average , the new model is significantly better than the baseline (query likelihood model) in terms of precision at the top ranks .
