a new cache-replacement-algorithm for the integration of web-caching and prefectching web-caching and web-prefetching are two important techniques to reduce the noticeable response-time perceived by users . note that by integrating web-caching and web-prefetching , these two techniques can complement each other since web-caching technique exploits the temporal-locality whereas web-prefetching technique utilizes the spatial-locality of web-objects . however , without circumspect design , the integration of these two techniques might cause significant performance-degradation to each other . in view of this , we propose in this paper an innovative cache-replacement-algorithm , which not only considers the caching effect in the web environment but also evaluates the prefetching rules provided by various prefetching schemes . specifically , we formulate a normalized profit function to evaluate the profit from caching an object (i.e. , either a non-implied object or an implied object according to some prefetching rule) . based on the normalized profit function devised , we devise an innovative web cache replacement-algorithm , referred to as algorithm iwcp (standing for the integration of web-caching and prefetching) . using an event-driven-simulation , we evaluate the performance of algorithm iwcp under several circumstances . the experimental-results show that algorithm iwcp consistently outperforms the companion schemes in various performance-metrics .
