graph-based transfer-learning transfer-learning is the task of leveraging the information from labeled examples in some domains to predict the labels for examples in another domain . it finds abundant practical applications , such as sentiment prediction , image-classification and network-intrusion-detection . in this paper , we propose a graph-based transfer-learning framework . it propagates the label-information from the source-domain to the target-domain via the example-feature-example tripartite graph , and puts more emphasis on the labeled examples from the target-domain via the example-example bi-partite graph . our framework is semi-supervised and non-parametric in nature and thus more flexible . we also develop an iterative-algorithm so that our framework is scalable to large-scale-applications . it enjoys the theoretical property of convergence . compared with existing transfer-learning methods , the proposed framework propagates the label-information to both the features irrelevant to the source-domain and the unlabeled-examples in the target omain via the common features in a principled way . experimental-results on 3 real-data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm .
