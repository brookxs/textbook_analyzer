continuous-data stream query in the cloud cloud-computing represents one of the most important research-directions for modern computing-systems . existing research efforts on cloud-computing were all focused on designing advanced storage and query techniques for static data . none of them consider the problem that data in a cloud may appear as continuous and rapid data-streams . to address this problem , in this paper we propose a new lcn-index framework to handle continuous-data stream queries in the cloud . lcn-index uses the map-reduce computing-paradigm to process all the queries . in the mapping stage , it divides all the queries into a batch of predicate sets which are then deployed onto mapping nodes using interval predicate index . in the reducing stage , it merges results from the mapping nodes using multi attribute hash index . in so doing , a data-stream can be efficiently evaluated by traversing through the lcn-index framework . experiments demonstrate the utility of the proposed method .
