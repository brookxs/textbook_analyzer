towards a provenance framework for sub-image processing for astronomical data while there has been advances in observational equipment that generate huge high quality images , the processing of these images remains a major bottleneck . we show that provenance data collected during the processing of data can be reused to perform selective processing of data and support network collaboration without clogging distribution networks . we introduce the idea of sub-image processing (simp) in the context of processing a subset of pixels of an image and the use of provenance data to assemble pipelines and to select processing metadata for simp . we describe an implementation of simp in astro-wise
