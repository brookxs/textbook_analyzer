automatically suggesting topics for augmenting text-documents we present a method for automated topic-suggestion . given a plain-text input document , our algorithm produces a ranking of novel topics that could enrich the input document in a meaningful way . it can thus be used to assist human authors , who often fail to identify important topics relevant to the context of the documents they are writing . our approach marries two algorithms originally designed for linking documents to wikipedia articles , proposed by milne and witten [15] and west et al. [22] . while neither of them can suggest novel topics by itself , their combination does have this capability . the key step towards finding missing topics consists in generalizing from a large background-corpus using principal-component-analysis . in a quantitative-evaluation we conclude that our method achieves the precision of human editors when input documents are wikipedia articles , and we complement this result with a qualitative-analysis showing that the approach also works well on other types of input documents .
