characterization of tpc-h queries for a column-oriented database on a dual-core amd athlon processor in this paper , we characterize the performance of the tpc-h benchmark for a popular column-oriented database called monetdb running on a dual-core amd athlon machine . specifically , we measure the performance of key microarchitectural components and analyze in detail the nature of various stalls namely cache stalls , branch-misprediction stalls and resource stalls . we compare our results with published results on the characterization of tpc-h for row-oriented databases . as opposed to the previous approaches , we use thread-level monitoring of database threads to study the performance of the database in isolation from the rest of the system .
