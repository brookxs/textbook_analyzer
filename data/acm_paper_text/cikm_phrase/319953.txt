simple qsf-trees : an efficient and scalable spatial-access-method the development of high-performance spatial-access-methods that can support complex operations of large spatial databases continues to attract considerable attention . this paper introduces qsf - trees , an efficient and scalable structure for indexing spatial-objects , which has some important advantages over r * - trees . qsf - trees eliminate overlapping of index regions without forcing object clipping or sacrificing the selectivity of spatial-operations . the method exploits the semantics of topological-relations between spatial-objects to further reduce the number of index nodes visited during the search . a series of experiments involving randomly-generated spatial-objects was conducted to compare the structure with two variations of r * - trees . the experiments show qsf - trees to be more efficient and more scalable to the increase in the data-set size , the size of spatial-objects , and the number of dimensions of the spatial universe .
