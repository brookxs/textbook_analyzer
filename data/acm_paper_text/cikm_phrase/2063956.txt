more or better : on trade-offs in compacting textual problem solution repositories in this paper , we look into the problem of filtering problem solution repositories (from sources such as community-driven question-answering-systems) to render them more suitable for usage in knowledge-reuse systems . we explore harnessing the fuzzy nature of usability of a solution to a problem , for such compaction . fuzzy usabilities lead to several challenges ; notably , the trade-off between choosing generic or better solutions . we develop an approach that can heed to a user specification of the trade-off between these criteria and introduce several quality measures based on fuzzy usability estimates to ascertain the quality of a problem-solution repository for usage in a case-based-reasoning system . we establish , through a detailed empirical-analysis , that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on virtually all quality measures .
