improved index-compression techniques for versioned document-collections current information-retrieval-systems use inverted-index structures for efficient-query-processing . due to the extremely large size of many data-sets , these index-structures are usually kept in compressed form , and many techniques for optimizing compressed size and query-processing speed have been proposed . in this paper , we focus on versioned document-collections , that is , collections where each document is modified over time , resulting in multiple versions of the document . consecutive versions of the same document are often similar , and several researchers have explored ideas for exploiting this similarity to decrease index-size . we propose new index-compression techniques for versioned document-collections that achieve reductions in index-size over previous methods . in particular , we first propose several bitwise compression techniques that achieve a compact index-structure but that are too slow for most applications . based on the lessons-learned , we then propose additional techniques that come close to the sizes of the bitwise technique while also improving on the speed of the best previous methods .
