structure and semantics for expressive text kernels several text-categorization applications require a representation beyond the standard bag-of-words paradigm . kernel-based-learning has approached this problem by (i) considering information about syntactic-structure or by (ii) incorporating knowledge about the semantic similarity of term features . we propose a generalized framework consisting of a family of kernels that jointly incorporate syntactic and semantic similarity and demonstrate the power of this approach in a series of experiments .
