a probabilistic-approach to correlation queries in uncertain time-series-data numerous real-life applications , such as wireless-sensor-networks and location-based-services , generate large amount of uncertain time-series , where the exact value at each timestamp is unavailable or unknown . in this paper , we formalize the notion of correlation for uncertain time-series-data and consider a family of probabilistic , threshold-based correlation queries over such data . the proposed formulation extends the notion of correlation developed for standard , certain time-series . we show that uncertain correlation is a random-variable approaching normal-distribution . we also formalize the notion of uncertain time-series normalization which is at the core of our correlation-query processing-approach , while it proves to be an important pre-processing technique in particular for pattern-discovery tasks . the results of our numerous experiments indicate that , unlike in the standard time-series , there is a trade-off between false-alarms and hit ratios , which can be controlled by the probability threshold provided by users . our results also offer users a guideline for choosing proper threshold values .
