learning a two-stage svm/crf sequence classifier-learning a sequence classifier means learning to predict a sequence of output tags based on a set of input data items . for example , recognizing that a handwritten word is `` cat '' , based on three images of handwritten letters and on general knowledge of english letter combinations , is a sequence-classification task . this paper describes a new two-stage approach to learning a sequence classifier that is (i) highly accurate , (ii) scalable , and (iii) easy to use in data-mining-applications . the two-stage approach combines support-vector-machines (svms) and conditional-random-fields (crfs) . it is (i) highly accurate because it benefits from the maximum-margin nature of svms and also from the ability of crfs to model correlations between neighboring output tags . it is (ii) scalable because the input to each svm is a small training set , and the input to the crf has a small number of features , namely the svm outputs . it is (iii) easy to use because it combines existing published software in a straightforward way . in detailed experiments on the task of recognizing handwritten words , we show that the two-stage approach is more accurate , or faster and more scalable , or both , than leading other methods for learning sequence classifiers , including max-margin markov-networks (m3ns) and standard crfs .
