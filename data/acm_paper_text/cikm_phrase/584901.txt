using specification-driven concepts for distributed-data-management and dissemination at the mitre corporation-center for advanced aviation system-development (caasd) , software-engineers work closely with both analyst and domain-experts to develop software simulations in the air-traffic-management domain . in this environment , software simulations are applications that take large amounts of real-world operational information , and through calculations , derivations , and display extends the original information to produce some new insight into the domain . this new insight or knowledge typically comes in the form of a pertinent set of data . based on this set of information other research groups can further extend this knowledge . the challenge in this environment is a distributed-data-management system that will allow a distributed set of researchers to share their extended knowledge . this paper presents the motivation and design of such an architecture to support this collaborative knowledge/data sharing environment . this run-time configurable-architecture is implemented using web-based-technologies such as the extensible-markup-language (xml) , java-servlets , extensible stylesheets (xsl) , and a relational-database-management-system (rdbms) .
