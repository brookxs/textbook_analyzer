classifying networked-entities with modularity kernels statistical-machine-learning techniques for data-classification usually assume that all entities are i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) . however , real-world entities often interconnect with each other through explicit or implicit-relationships to form a complex-network . although some graph-based-classification methods have emerged in recent years , they are not really suitable for complex-networks as they do not take the degree-distribution of network into consideration . in this paper , we propose a new technique , modularity kernel , that can effectively exploit the latent community-structure of networked-entities for their classification . a number of experiments on hypertext datasets show that our proposed approach leads to excellent classification-performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods .
