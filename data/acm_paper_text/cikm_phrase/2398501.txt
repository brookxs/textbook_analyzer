community-based classification of noun-phrases in twitter many event-monitoring systems rely on counting known keywords in streaming-text data to detect sudden spikes in frequency . but the dynamic and conversational nature of twitter makes it hard to select known keywords for monitoring . here we consider a method of automatically finding noun-phrases (nps) as keywords for event-monitoring in twitter . finding nps has two aspects , identifying the boundaries for the subsequence of words which represent the np , and classifying the np to a specific broad category such as politics , sports , etc. . to classify an np , we define the feature-vector for the np using not just the words but also the author 's behavior and social-activities . our results show that we can classify many nps by using a sample of training-data from a knowledge-base .
