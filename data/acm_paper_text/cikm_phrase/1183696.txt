ranking-robustness : a novel framework to predict query-performance in this paper , we introduce the notion of ranking-robustness , which refers to a property of a ranked list of documents that indicates how stable the ranking is in the presence of uncertainty in the ranked documents . we propose a statistical measure called the robustness score to quantify this notion . we demonstrate that the robustness score significantly and consistently correlates with query-performance in a variety of trec test-collections including the gov2 collection . we compare the robustness score with the clarity score method which is the state-of-the-art technique for query-performance-prediction . our experimental-results show that the robustness score performs better than or at least as good as the clarity score . we find that the clarity score is barely correlated with query-performance on the gov2 collection while the correlation between the robustness score and query-performance remains significant . we also notice that a combination of the two usually results in more prediction power .
