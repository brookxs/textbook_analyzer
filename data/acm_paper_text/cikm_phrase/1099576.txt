the case for access-control on xml relationships with the emergence of xml as the de facto standard to exchange and disseminate information , the problem of regulating access to xml-documents has attracted a considerable attention in recent years . existing models attach authorizations to nodes of an xml-document but disregard relationships between them . however , ancestor and sibling relationships may reveal information as sensitive as the one carried out by the nodes themselves (e.g. , classification) . this paper advocates the integration of relationships as first class citizen in the access-control-models for xml and makes the following contributions . first , it characterizes important relationship authorizations and identifies the mechanisms required to translate them accurately in an authorized view of a source document . second , it introduces a rule-based formulation for expressing these classes of relationship authorizations and defines an associated conflict-resolution strategy . rather than being yet-another xml-access-control model , the proposed approach allows a seamless-integration of relationship authorizations in existing xml-access-control model .
