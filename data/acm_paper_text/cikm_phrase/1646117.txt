retrieval experiments using pseudo-desktop collections desktop-search is an important part of personal-information-management (pim) . however , research in this area has been limited by the lack of shareable test-collections , making cumulative progress difficult . in this paper , we define desktop-search as a semi-structured-document-retrieval problem and introduce a methodology to automatically build a reusable collection (the pseudo-desktop) that has many of the same properties as a real desktop collection . we then present a comprehensive evaluation of retrieval-methods for semi-structured-document-retrieval on several pseudo-desktop collections and the trec enterprise collection . our results show that a probabilistic-retrieval-model using the mapping relation between a query-term and a document field (prm-s) has the best performance in collections with more structure , such as email , and that the query-likelihood language-model is better for other document types . we further analyze the observed differences using generated queries and suggest ways to improve prm-s , which makes the performance gains more significant and consistent .
