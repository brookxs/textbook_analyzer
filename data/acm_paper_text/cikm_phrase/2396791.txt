graph-classification : a diversified discriminative-feature selection approach a graph-models complex structural-relationships among objects , and has been prevalently used in a wide range of applications . building an automated graph-classification model becomes very important for predicting unknown graphs or understanding complex structures between different classes . the graph-classification framework being widely used consists of two steps , namely , feature-selection and classification . the key issue is how to select important subgraph features from a graph-database with a large number of graphs including positive graphs and negative graphs . given the features selected , a generic classification-approach can be used to build a classification-model . in this paper , we focus on feature-selection . we identify two main issues with the most widely used feature-selection approach which is based on a discriminative score to select frequent-subgraph features , and introduce a new diversified discriminative score to select features that have a higher diversity . we analyze the properties of the newly proposed diversified discriminative score , and conducted extensive performance-studies to demonstrate that such a diversified discriminative score makes positive/negative graphs separable and leads to a higher classification-accuracy .
