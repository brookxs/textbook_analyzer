mining and ranking streams of news stories using cross-stream sequential-patterns we present a new method for mining and ranking streams of news stories using cross-stream sequential-patterns and content-similarity . in particular , we focus on stories reporting the same event across the streams within a given time-window , where an event is defined as a specific thing that happens at a specific time and place . for every discovered cluster of stories reporting the same event we create an itemset-sequence consisting of stream identifiers of the stories in the cluster , where the sequence is ordered according to the timestamps of the stories . furthermore , we record exact timestamps and content similarities between the respective stories . given such a collection of itemset-sequences we use it for two tasks : (i) to discover recurrent temporal publishing patterns between the news-streams in terms of frequent-sequential-patterns and content-similarity and (ii) to rank the streams of news stories with respect to timeliness of reporting important events and content authority . we demonstrate the applicability of the presented method on a multi-stream of news stories was gathered from rss-feeds of major world news agencies .
