on the design of lda models for aspect-based opinion-mining aspect-based opinion-mining , which aims to extract aspects and their corresponding ratings from customers reviews , provides very useful information for customers to make purchase decisions . in the past few years several probabilistic-graphical-models have been proposed to address this problem , most of them based on latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) . while these models have a lot in common , there are some characteristics that distinguish them from each other . these fundamental differences correspond to major decisions that have been made in the design of the lda models . while research papers typically claim that a new model outperforms the existing ones , there is normally no `` one-size-fits-all '' model . in this paper , we present a set of design-guidelines for aspect-based opinion-mining by discussing a series of increasingly sophisticated lda models . we argue that these models represent the essence of the major published methods and allow us to distinguish the impact of various design-decisions . we conduct extensive experiments on a very-large real life dataset from epinions.com (500k reviews) and compare the performance of different models in terms of the likelihood of the held-out test-set and in terms of the accuracy of aspect-identification and rating-prediction .
