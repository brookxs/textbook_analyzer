disinformation techniques for entity-resolution we study the problem of disinformation . we assume that an `` agent '' has some sensitive-information that the `` adversary '' is trying to obtain . for example , a camera company (the agent) may secretly be developing its new camera-model , and a user (the adversary) may want to know in advance the detailed specs of the model . the agent 's goal is to disseminate false information to `` dilute '' what is known by the adversary . we model the adversary as an entity-resolution (er) process that pieces together available information . we formalize the problem of finding the disinformation with the highest benefit given a limited budget for creating the disinformation and propose efficient-algorithms for solving the problem . we then evaluate our disinformation planning algorithms on real and synthetic-data and compare the robustness of existing er algorithms . in general , our disinformation techniques can be used as a framework for testing er robustness .
