on the selectivity of multidimensional-routing-indices recently , the problem of efficiently supporting advanced query operators , such as nearest-neighbor or range-queries , over multidimensional-data in widely distributed-environments has attracted much attention . in unstructured peer-to-peer (p2p) networks , peers store data in an autonomous manner , thus multidimensional-routing-indices (mri) are required , in order to route user queries efficiently to only those peers that may contribute to the query result set . focusing on a hybrid unstructured p2p network , in this paper , we analyze the parameters for building mri of high selectivity . in the case where similar data are located at different parts of the network , mri exhibit extremely poor performance , which renders them ineffective . we present algorithms that boost the query-routing performance by detecting similar peers and reassigning these peers to other parts of the hybrid network in a distributed and scalable way . the resulting mri are able to eagerly discard routing paths during query-processing . we demonstrate the advantages of our approach experimentally and show that our framework enhances a state-of-the-art approach for similarity-search in terms of reduced network-traffic and number of contacted peers .
