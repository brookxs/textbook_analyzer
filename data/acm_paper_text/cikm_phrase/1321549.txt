generating concise association-rules association-rule-mining has made many achievements in the area of knowledge-discovery . however , the quality of the extracted association-rules is a big concern . one problem with the quality of the extracted association-rules is the huge size of the extracted rule-set . as a matter of fact , very often tens of thousands of association-rules are extracted among which many are redundant thus useless . mining non-redundant rules is a promising approach to solve this problem . the min-max exact basis proposed by pasquier et al [pasquier05] has showed exciting results by generating only non-redundant rules . in this paper , we first propose a relaxing definition for redundancy under which the min-max exact basis still contains redundant rules ; then we propose a condensed representation called reliable exact basis for exact association-rules . the rules in the reliable exact basis are not only non-redundant but also more succinct than the rules in min-max exact basis . we prove that the redundancy eliminated by the reliable exact basis does not reduce the belief to the reliable exact basis . the size of the reliable exact basis is much smaller than that of the min-max exact basis . moreover , we prove that all exact association-rules can be deduced from the reliable exact basis . therefore the reliable exact basis is a lossless representation of exact association-rules . experimental-results show that the reliable exact basis significantly reduces the number of non-redundant rules .
