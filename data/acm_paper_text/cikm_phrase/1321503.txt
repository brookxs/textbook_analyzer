latent-semantic fusion model for image-retrieval and annotation this paper studies the effect of latent-semantic-analysis (lsa) on two different tasks : multimedia-document retrieval (mdr) and automatic-image-annotation (aia) . the contributions of this paper are twofold . first , to the best of our knowledge , this work is the first study of the influence of lsa on the retrieval of a significant number of multimedia-documents (i.e. collection of 20000 tourist images) . second , it shows how different image representations (region-based and keypoint-based) can be combined by lsa to improve automatic-image-annotation . the document collections used for these experiments are the corel photo-collection and imageclef 2006 collection .
