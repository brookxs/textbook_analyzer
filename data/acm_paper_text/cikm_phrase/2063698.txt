harvesting facts from textual web sources by constrained label-propagation there have been major advances on automatically constructing large knowledge-bases by extracting relational facts from web and text sources . however , the world is dynamic : periodic events like sports competitions need to be interpreted with their respective timepoints , and facts such as coaching a sports team , holding political or business positions , and even marriages do not hold forever and should be augmented by their respective timespans . this paper addresses the problem of automatically harvesting temporal-facts with such extended time-awareness . we employ pattern-based gathering techniques for fact candidates and construct a weighted pattern-candidate graph . our key contribution is a system called pravda based on a new kind of label-propagation algorithm with a judiciously designed loss-function , which iteratively processes the graph to label good temporal-facts for a given set of target relations . our experiments with online-news and wikipedia articles demonstrate the accuracy of this method .
