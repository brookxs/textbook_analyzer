incorporating topical support documents into a small training set in text-categorization this paper explores the incorporation of topical support documents into a training-set as a means of compensating for a shortage of positive training-data in text-categorization . to support topical representation , our method applies a simple transformation to documents , i.e. , making new documents from existing positive documents by squaring a conventional term-weight . the topical support documents thus created not only are expected to preserve the topic , but even improve the topical representation by emphasizing terms with higher weights . experiments with support-vector-machines showed the effectiveness on rcv1 collection with a small number of positive training-data . our topical-support-representation achieved 52.01 \ % and 8.83 \ % improvements for 33 and 56 categories of rcv1 topic in micro-averaged f1 with less than 100 and 300 positive documents in learning , respectively . result analyses based on robustness indicate that topical support documents contribute to a steady and stable improvement .
