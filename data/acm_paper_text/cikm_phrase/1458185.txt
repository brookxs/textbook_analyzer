predicting individual disease risk based on medical history the monumental cost of health-care , especially for chronic-disease treatment , is quickly becoming unmanageable . this crisis has motivated the drive towards preventative medicine , where the primary concern is recognizing disease risk and taking action at the earliest signs . however , universal testing is neither time nor cost efficient . we propose care , a collaborative assessment and recommendation engine , which relies only on a patient 's medical history using icd-9-cm codes in order to predict future diseases risks . care uses collaborative-filtering to predict each patient 's greatest disease risks based on their own medical history and that of similar patients . we also describe an iterative version , icare , which incorporates ensemble concepts for improved performance . these novel systems require no specialized information and provide predictions for medical conditions of all kinds in a single run . we present experimental-results on a medicare dataset , demonstrating that care and icare perform well at capturing future disease risks .
