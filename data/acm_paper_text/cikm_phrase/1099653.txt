cooperative-caching for k-nn search in ad-hoc-networks mobile-ad-hoc-networks have multiple limitations in performing similarity-based nearest-neighbor-search - dynamic-topology , frequent disconnections , limited power , and restricted bandwidth . cooperative-caching is an effective technique to reduce network-traffic and increase accessibility . in this paper , we propose to solve the k-nearest-neighbor search-problem in ad-hoc-networks using a semantic-based caching-scheme which reflects the content-distribution in the network . the proposed scheme describes the semantic similarity among data objects using constraints , and employs cooperative-caching to estimate the content-distribution in the network . the query resolution based on the cooperative-caching scheme is non-flooding and hierarchy-free .
