summarization of social-activity over time : people , actions and concepts in dynamic-networks we present a framework for automatically summarizing social group-activity over time . the problem is important in understanding large-scale online-social-networks , which have diverse social-interactions and exhibit temporal-dynamics . in this work we construct summarization by extracting activity themes . we propose a novel unified temporal multi-graph framework for extracting activity themes over time . we use non-negative-matrix-factorization (nmf) approach to derive two interrelated latent spaces for users and concepts . activity themes are extracted from the derived latent spaces to construct group-activity summary . experiments on real-world flickr datasets demonstrate that our technique outperforms baseline algorithms such as lsi , and is additionally able to extract temporally representative activities to construct meaningful group-activity summary .
