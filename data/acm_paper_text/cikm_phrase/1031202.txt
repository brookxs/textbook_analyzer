a framework for refining similarity-queries using learning-techniques in numerous applications that deal with similarity-search , a user may not have an exact idea of his information-need and/or may not be able to construct a query that exactly captures his notion of similarity . a promising approach to mitigate this problem is to enable the user to submit a rough approximation of the desired query and use the feedback on the relevance of the retrieved objects to refine the query . in this paper , we explore such a refinement strategy for a general class of sql similarity-queries . our approach casts the refinement problem as that of learning concepts using examples . this is achieved by viewing the tuples on which a user provides feedback as a labeled training set for a learner . under this setup , sql-query-refinement consists of two learning tasks , namely learning the structure of the sql-query and learning the relative-importance of the query components . the paper develops appropriate machine-learning-approaches suitable for these two learning tasks . the primary contribution of the paper is a general refinement framework that decides when each learner is invoked in order to quickly learn the user-query . experimental analyses over many real life datasets and queries show that our strategy outperforms the existing approaches significantly in terms of retrieval-accuracy and query simplicity .
