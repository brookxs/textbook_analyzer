web-centric language-models we investigate language-models for informational and navigational web-search . retrieval on the web is a task that differs substantially from ordinary ad-hoc-retrieval . we perform an analysis of prior-probability of relevance for a wide range of non-content features , shedding further light on the importance of non-content features for web-retrieval . this directly explains the success or failure of various techniques , e.g. , why the link topology is particularly helpful to single out important sites . language-models can naturally incorporate multiple document representations , as well as non-content-information . for the former , we employ mixture-language-models based on document full-text , incoming anchor-text , and document titles . for the latter , we study a range of priors based on document-length , url structure , and link topology . we look at three types of topics -- distillation , home-page , and named page -- as well as for a mixed query set . we find that the mixture-models lead to considerable improvement of retrieval-effectiveness for all topic-types . the web-centric priors generally lead to further improvement of retrieval-effectiveness .
