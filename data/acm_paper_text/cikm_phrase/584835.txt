detecting similar documents using salient terms we describe a system for rapidly determining document-similarity among a set of documents obtained from an information-retrieval (ir) system . we obtain a ranked list of the most important terms in each document using a rapid phrase recognizer system . we store these in a database and compute document-similarity using a simple database-query . if the number of terms found to not be contained in both documents is less than some predetermined threshold compared to the total number of terms in the document , these documents are determined to be very similar . we compare this to the shingles approach .
