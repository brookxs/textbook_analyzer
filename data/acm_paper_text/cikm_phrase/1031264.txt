rstar : an rdf-storage and query-system for enterprise resource management modern corporations operate in an extremely complex environment and strongly depend on all kinds of information-resources across the enterprise . unfortunately , with the growth of an enterprise , its information resources are not only heterogeneous but also distributed in physically different systems and databases . how to effectively exploit information across the enterprise is becoming a critical but hard problem . in recent years , metadata which is the detailed description of the data is used to efficiently exploit information-resources in the web . the world-wide-web consortium (w3c) recommends the resource-description-framework (rdf) as a standard for the definition and use of metadata descriptions of resources in the web . in this paper , we present an rdf-storage and query-system called rstar for enterprise resource management . rstar uses a relational-database as the persistent data store and defines rstar query-language (rsql) for resource retrieval . currently , most of existing rdf-storage and query systems are evaluated on small data-sets and no detailed performance-analysis is given for such systems . therefore , we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale-data set to investigate the performance problem in rdf-storage . such analysis will be helpful for designing rdf-storage and query systems as well as for understanding not well-solved issues in rdf_based enterprise resource management . in addition , experiences and lessons-learned in our implementation are presented for further research-and-development .
