on identifying representative-relevant-documents using relevance-feedback can significantly improve the effectiveness of ad-hoc (query-based) retrieval . however , retrieval-performance can significantly vary with respect to the given set of relevant documents . our goal is to establish a quantitative-analysis of what makes a relevant-document a good representative of the relevant-documents set regardless of the retrieval approach employed . that is , we would like to estimate the extent to which a relevant-document can effectively help in finding (other) relevant documents using some relevance-feedback method employed over the corpus . we present various representativeness estimates ; some of which treat documents independently and some utilize inter-document similarities . empirical-evaluation shows that relevant documents that are centrally located within the similarity space of the relevant-documents set tend to be good representatives . in addition , we show that there exist highly representative-clusters of similar relevant documents , and devise methods for ranking clusters based on their presumed representativeness . finally , we study the connection between representativeness and trec 's gradual relevance-judgments .
