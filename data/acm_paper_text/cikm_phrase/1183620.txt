efficient processing of complex similarity-queries in rdbms through query-rewriting multimedia and complex-data are usually queried by similarity-predicates . whereas there are many works dealing with algorithms to answer basic similarity-predicates , there are not generic algorithms able to efficiently handle similarity complex-queries combining several basic similarity-predicates . in this work we propose a simple and effective set of algorithms that can be combined to answer complex similarity-queries , and a set of algebraic rules useful to rewrite similarity-query expressions into an adequate format for those algorithms . those rules and algorithms allow relational-database-management-systems to turn complex-queries into efficient query execution plans . we present experiments that highlight interesting scenarios . they show that the proposed algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than the traditional similarity algorithms . moreover , they are linearly scalable considering the database-size .
