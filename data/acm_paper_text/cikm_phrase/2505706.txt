learning to handle negated language in medical-records search negated language is frequently used by medical practitioners to indicate that a patient does not have a given medical condition . traditionally , information-retrieval-systems do not distinguish between the positive and negative contexts of terms when indexing documents . for example , when searching for patients with angina , a retrieval-system might wrongly consider a patient with a medical-record stating `` no evidence of angina '' to be relevant . while it is possible to enhance a retrieval-system by taking into account the context of terms within the indexing representation of a document , some non-relevant medical-records can still be ranked highly , if they include some of the query terms with the intended context . in this paper , we propose a novel learning-framework that effectively handles negated language . based on features related to the positive and negative contexts of a term , the framework learns how to appropriately weight the occurrences of the opposite context of any query-term , thus preventing documents that may not be relevant from being retrieved . we thoroughly evaluate our proposed framework using the trec 2011 and 2012 medical-records track test-collections . our results show significant improvements over existing strong baselines . in addition , in combination with a traditional query-expansion and a conceptual-representation approach , our proposed framework could achieve a retrieval-effectiveness comparable to the performance of the best trec 2011 and 2012 systems , while not addressing other challenges in medical-records search , such as the exploitation of semantic-relationships between medical-terms .
