improve retrieval-accuracy for difficult-queries using negative-feedback how to improve search accuracy for difficult-topics is an under-addressed , yet important research question . in this paper , we consider a scenario when the search-results are so poor that none of the top-ranked documents is relevant to a user 's query , and propose to exploit negative-feedback to improve retrieval-accuracy for such difficult-queries . specifically , we propose to learn from a certain number of top-ranked non-relevant documents to rerank the rest unseen documents . we propose several approaches to penalizing the documents that are similar to the known non-relevant documents in the language-modeling framework . to evaluate the proposed methods , we adapt standard trec collections to construct a test-collection containing only difficult-queries . experiment results show that the proposed approaches are effective for improving retrieval-accuracy of difficult-queries .
