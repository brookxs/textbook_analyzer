a fine-grained taxonomy of tables on the web we propose a classification taxonomy over a large crawl of html tables on the web , focusing primarily on those tables that express structured-knowledge . the taxonomy separates tables into two top-level classes : a) those used for layout purposes , including navigational and formatting ; and b) those containing relational knowledge , including listings , attribute/value , matrix , enumeration , and form . we then propose a classification-algorithm for automatically detecting a subset of the classes in our taxonomy , namely layout tables and attribute/value tables . we report on the performance of our system over a large sample of manually annotated html tables on the web .
