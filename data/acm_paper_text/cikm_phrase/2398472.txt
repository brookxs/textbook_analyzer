mining coherent anomaly collections on web-data the recent boom of weblogs and social-media has attached increasing importance to the identification of suspicious users with unusual behavior , such as spammers or fraudulent reviewers . a typical spamming strategy is to employ multiple dummy accounts to collectively promote a target , be it a url or a product . consequently , these suspicious accounts exhibit certain coherent anomalous behavior identifiable as a collection . in this paper , we propose the concept of coherent anomaly collection (cac) to capture this kind of collections , and put forward an efficient-algorithm to simultaneously find the top-k disjoint cacs together with their anomalous behavior-patterns . compared with existing approaches , our new algorithm can find disjoint anomaly collections with coherent extreme behavior without having to specify either their number or sizes . results on real twitter data show that our approach discovers meaningful and informative hashtag spammer groups of various sizes which are hard to detect by clustering-based methods .
