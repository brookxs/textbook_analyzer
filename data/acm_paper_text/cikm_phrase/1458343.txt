workload-based optimization of integration-processes the efficient execution of integration-processes between distributed , heterogeneous-data-sources and applications is a challenging research area of data-management . these integration-processes are an abstraction for workflow-based integration tasks , used in eai servers and wfms . the major problem are significant workload changes during runtime . the performance of integration-processes strongly depends on those dynamic workload characteristics , and hence workload-based optimization is important . however , existing approaches of workflow-optimization only address the rule-based-optimization and disregard changing workload characteristics . to overcome the problem of inefficient process-execution in the presence of workload shifts , here , we present an approach for the workload-based optimization of instance-based integration-processes and show that significant execution-time reductions are possible .
