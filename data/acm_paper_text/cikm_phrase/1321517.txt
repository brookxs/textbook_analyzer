mining web multi-resolution community-based popularity for information-retrieval the pagerank-algorithm is used in web-information-retrieval to calculate a single list of popularity scores for each page in the web . these popularity scores are used to rank-query results when presented to the user . by using the structure of the entire web to calculate one score per document , we are calculating a general popularity score , not particular to any community . therefore , the pagerank scores are more suited to general queries . in this paper , we introduce a more general form of pagerank , using web multi-resolution community-based popularity scores , where each document obtains a popularity score dependent on a given web-community . when a query is related to a specific community , we choose the associated set of popularity scores and order the query results accordingly . using web-community based popularity scores , we achieved an 11 \ % increase in precision over pagerank .
