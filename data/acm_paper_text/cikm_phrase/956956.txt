sql text-parsing for information-retrieval the concept of using a relational-database to perform information-retrieval (ir) search functions is well established . prior work demonstrates the capability to perform common functions and advanced ranking-algorithms using standard , unchanged sql . the previous work does not address the preprocessing of unstructured-text within the relational-model . in fact , the parsing of the unstructured-data into a structured-data set was done outside of the database , usually using sequential-programming languages such as c . this work proves that ir preprocessing does not require proprietary application code to build the framework necessary for searching document-databases . furthermore , the resulting environment is relational and integrates with other data sources within an organization .
