a tag-centric discriminative-model for web-objects classification this paper studies web-object classification-problem with the novel exploration of social-tags . more and more web-objects are increasingly annotated with human interpretable labels (i.e. , tags) , which can be considered as an auxiliary attribute to assist the object-classification . automatically classifying web-objects into manageable semantic-categories has long been a fundamental pre-process for indexing , browsing , searching , and mining heterogeneous web-objects . however , such heterogeneous web-objects often suffer from a lack of easy-extractable and uniform descriptive features . in this paper , we propose a discriminative tag-centric model for web-object classification by jointly modeling the objects category labels and their corresponding social-tags and un-coding the relevance among social-tags . our approach is based on recent techniques for learning large-scale discriminative-models . we conduct experiments to validate our approach using real-life data . the results show the feasibility and good performance of our approach .
