identification of gene function using prediction-by-partial-matching (ppm) language-models in this paper , we describe the utilization of text-encoding and prediction-by-partial-matching language-modeling to identify gene functions within abstracts of biomedical papers . the national center for biotechnology-information has `` generif '' - a collection of the best possible functional representations for a subset of abstracts from pubmed . we use generif to test the efficiency of our technique . we discuss the methodology adopted to construct models necessary to enable the text-mining toolkit to distinguish between gene functions and the rest of the abstract (non gene functions) . we also describe the similarity_based approach we deploy on the list of automatically annotated functions to generate the most likely gene function representative of the paper . the results indicate that our combined approach to identify gene functions in scientific abstracts performs very well on both precision-and-recall , and therefore presents exciting opportunities for use in extracting other entities embedded in scientific-text .
