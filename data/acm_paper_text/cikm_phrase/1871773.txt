crawling the-web for structured-documents structured-information-retrieval is gaining a lot of interest in recent years , as this kind of information is becoming an invaluable asset for professional communities such as software-engineering . most of the research has focused on xml-documents , with initiatives like inex to bring together and evaluate new techniques focused on structured-information . despite the use of xml-documents is the immediate choice , the-web is filled with several other types of structured-information , which account for millions of other documents . these documents may be collected directly using standard web-search-engines like google and yahoo , or following specific search-patterns in online repositories like sourceforge . this demo describes a distributed and focused-web-crawler for any kind of structured-documents , and we show with it how to exploit general-purpose resources to gather large amounts of real-world structured-documents off the-web . this kind of tool could help building large test collections of other types of documents , such as java source-code for software-oriented search-engines or rdf for semantic-searching .
