learning-to-rank user-intent personalized-retrieval models aim at capturing user-interests to provide personalized results that are tailored to the respective information-needs . user-interests are however widely spread , subject to change , and can not always be captured well , thus rendering the deployment of personalized models challenging . we take a different approach and study ranking-models for user-intent . we exploit user-feedback in terms of click-data to cluster ranking-models for historic queries according to user-behavior and intent . each cluster is finally represented by a single ranking-model that captures the contained search-interests expressed by users . once new queries are issued , these are mapped to the clustering and the retrieval-process diversifies possible intents by combining relevant ranking-functions . empirical evidence shows that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches on a large corporate query-log .
