utilizing re-finding for personalized-information-retrieval individuals often use search-engines to return to web-pages they have previously visited . this behaviour , called re-finding , accounts for about 38 \ % of all queries . while researchers have shown how re-finding differs from traditionally studied new-findings , research on how to predict and utilize re-finding is limited . in this paper we explore re-finding for personalized-search . we compared three machine-learning-algorithms (decision-trees , bayesian multinomial regression and support-vector-machines) to identify re-findings . we then propose several re-ranking methods to utilize the prediction , including promoting predicted re-finding urls and combining re-finding prediction with relevance-estimation . the experimental-results demonstrate that using re-finding predictions can improve retrieval-performance for personalized-search .
