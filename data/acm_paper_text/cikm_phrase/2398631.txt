graph-based collective-classification for tweets in this paper , we address the problem of classifying tweets into topical categories . because of the short , noisy and ambiguous nature of tweets , we propose to collectively conduct the classification by exploiting the context-information (i.e. related tweets) other than individually as in conventional text-classification methods . in particular , we augment the content-based representation of text with tweets sharing same #hashtag or url , which results in a tweet graph . we then formulate the tweet classification-task under a graph-optimization framework . we investigate three popular approaches , namely , loopy-belief-propagation (lbp) , relaxation-labeling (rl) , and iterative-classification algorithm (ica) . extensive experiment results show that the graph-based tweet classification-approach remarkably improves the performance , while the ica model with relationship of sharing the same #hashtag gives the best result on separate tweet graph .
