an integer-programming approach for frequent-itemset hiding the rapid growth of transactional data brought , soon enough , into attention the need of its further exploitation . in this paper , we investigate the problem of securing sensitive knowledge from being exposed in patterns extracted during association-rule-mining . instead of hiding the produced rules directly , we decide to hide the sensitive frequent-itemsets that may lead to the production of these rules . as a first step , we introduce the notion of distance between two databases and a measure for quantifying it . by trying to minimize the distance between the original database and its sanitized version (that can safely be released) , we propose a novel , exact-algorithm for association-rule-hiding and evaluate it on real-world datasets demonstrating its effectiveness towards solving the problem .
