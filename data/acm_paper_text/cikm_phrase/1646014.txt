bitmap-indexes for relational xml twig query-processing due to an increasing volume of xml-data , it is considered prudent to store xml-data on an industry-strength database-system instead of relying on a domain-specific application or a file-system . for shredded xml-data stored in the relational-tables , however , it may not be straightforward to apply existing algorithms for twig-query processing , because most of the algorithms require xml-data to be accessed in a form of streams of elements grouped by their tags and sorted in a particular order . in order to support xml-query-processing within the common framework of relational-database-systems , we first propose several bitmap-indexes for supporting holistic-twig-joins on xml-data stored in the relational-tables . since bitmap-indexes are well supported in most of the commercial and open-source database systems , the proposed bitmap-indexes and twig-query processing-algorithms can be incorporated into the relational-query processing framework with more ease . the proposed query-processing algorithms are efficient in terms of both time and space , since the compressed bitmap indexes stay compressed during query-processing . in addition , we propose a hybrid index which computes twig-query solutions with only bit-vectors , without accessing labeled xml elements stored in the relational-tables .
