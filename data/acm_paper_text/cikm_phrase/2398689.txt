an examination of content farms in web-search using crowdsourcing on the web , content farms produce articles engineered such that search-engines rank them highly , in order to turn a profit from online-advertising . recently , content farms have increasingly been the target of demotion strategies by web-search-engines , since content farm articles are often considered to be of suspect quality . in this paper , we study the prevalence of content farms in the results returned by three major web-search-engines over time . in particular , we develop a crowdsourced approach to identify content farm articles from the results returned by these search-engines . our results show that between the period of march and august 2011 , the number of content farm articles observed on a number of indicative queries was reduced by up to 55 % in the top ranks .
