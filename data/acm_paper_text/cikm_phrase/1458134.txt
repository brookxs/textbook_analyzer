real-time new-event-detection for video streams online detection of video-clips that present previously unseen events in a video-stream is still an open challenge to date . for this online-new-event-detection (oned) task , existing studies mainly focus on optimizing the detection-accuracy instead of the detection efficiency . as a result , it is difficult for existing systems to detect new events in real-time , especially for large-scale video collections such as the video-content available on the web . in this paper , we propose several scalable techniques to improve the video-processing speed of a baseline oned system by orders of magnitude without sacrificing much detection-accuracy . first , we use text-features alone to filter out most of the non-new-event clips and to skip those expensive but unnecessary steps including image-feature-extraction and image-similarity computation . second , we use a combination of indexing and compression methods to speed up text-processing . we implemented a prototype of our optimized oned system on top of ibm 's system-s . the effectiveness of our techniques is evaluated on the standard trecvid 2005 benchmark , which demonstrates that our techniques can achieve a 480-fold speedup with detection-accuracy degraded less than 5 \ % .
