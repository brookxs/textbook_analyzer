clustering short-text using ncut-weighted non-negative-matrix-factorization non-negative-matrix-factorization (nmf) has been successfully applied in document-clustering . however , experiments on short-texts , such as microblogs , q &#38; a documents and news titles , suggest unsatisfactory performance of nmf . an major reason is that the traditional term-weighting-schemes , like binary weight and tfidf , can not well capture the terms ' discriminative power and importance in short-texts , due to the sparsity of data . to tackle this problem , we proposed a novel term-weighting-scheme for nmf , derived from the normalized cut (ncut) problem on the term affinity-graph . different from idf , which emphasizes discriminability on document level , the ncut weighting measures terms ' discriminability on term level . experiments on two data-sets show our weighting-scheme significantly boosts nmf 's performance on short-text clustering .
