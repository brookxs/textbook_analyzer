managing interoperability and complexity in health systems - mixhs '12 data-management and knowledge-engineering have long been important research fields in computer-science , and rapid progress in recent years have increasingly seen these technologies successfully applied to solve complex biomedical challenges and support health-services professionals in the course of their intellectually-demanding clinical duties , such as through the use of decision-support or expert-systems . yet , as the biomedical knowledge available in the modern digital world grows exponentially , there is a pressing need for a focused forum to promote technology and knowledge-transfer from basic-research to biomedical-applications as well as allowing for implementers of healthcare-systems to share their experiences with the research-community . the managing interoperability and complexity in health systems , mixhs workshops are designed for such a purpose with the view that multi-disciplinary approaches within a holistic forum is essential to rise to the ever new challenges of biomedical knowledge complexity and interoperability of health systems and services .
