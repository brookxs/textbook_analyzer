adaptive distributed indexing for structured-peer-to-peer-networks structured-peer-to-peer-networks support keyword-search by building a distributed-index over the collective-content shared by all peers . building the index and processing queries involve data-transfer among peers , thus it is important to keep both of these activities bandwidth-efficient . however , this goal is difficult to attain , as smaller , less precise indices reduce index-building and access costs but increase query-processing cost , which potentially increases overall cost . we study the trade-off between indexing cost and query-processing cost in a structured-peer-to-peer-network and propose a cost-reducing , adaptive , distributed-indexing technique based on the term distributions in local shared contents and user-query-logs . using this information , we reduce costs by tuning the precision of the index . the approach we take is to group local documents and to index the groups instead of either individual documents or entire peer collections . we control total cost by controlling the number and contents of groups . we propose a probabilistic-model to estimate the cost of grouping , which allows us to identify the optimal number of groups to be created . in addition , we propose a cost-based distance-function to guide the document grouping-process . experimental-results show that our adaptive-indexing technique reduces cost by up to 47 \ % compared with peer-level grouping and by up to 73 \ % compared with document-level grouping .
