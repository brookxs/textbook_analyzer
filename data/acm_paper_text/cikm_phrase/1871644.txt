directly optimizing evaluation-measures in learning-to-rank based on the clonal-selection-algorithm one fundamental issue of learning-to-rank is the choice of loss-function to be optimized . although the evaluation-measures used in information-retrieval (ir) are ideal ones , in many cases they ca n't be used directly because they do not satisfy the smooth property needed in conventional machine-learning-algorithms . in this paper a new method named rankcsa is proposed , which tries to use ir-evaluation measure directly . it employs the clonal-selection-algorithm to learn an effective ranking-function by combining various evidences in ir . experimental-results on the letor benchmarh datasets demonstrate that rankcsa outperforms the baseline methods in terms of p@n, map and ndcg@n .
