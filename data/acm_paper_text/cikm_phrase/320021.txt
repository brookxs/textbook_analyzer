an adaptive view element framework for multi-dimensional-data management we present an adaptive wavelet view element framework for managing different types of multi-dimensional-data in storage-and-retrieval applications . we consider the problems of multi-dimensional-data compression , multi-resolution subregion access , selective materialization , progressive retrieval and similarity-searching . the framework uses wavelets to partition the multi-dimensional-data into view elements that form the building-blocks for synthesizing views of the data . the view elements are organized and managed using different view element graphs . the graphs are used to guide cost-based view element-selection algorithms for optimizing compression , access , retrieval and search-performance . we present the adaptive wavelet view element framework and describe its application in managing multi-dimensional-data such as 1-d time-series-data , 2-d images , video sequences , and multi-dimensional-data cubes . we present experimental-results that demonstrate that the adaptive wavelet view element framework improves performance of compressing , accessing , and retrieving multi-dimensional-data compared to non-adaptive methods .
