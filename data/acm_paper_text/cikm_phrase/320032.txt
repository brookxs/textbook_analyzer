performance and implications of semantic-indexing in a distributed-environment a research prototype is presented for semantic-indexing and retrieval in information-retrieval . the prototype is motivated by a desire to provide a more efficient and effective information-retrieval-system compared to the current-state of the art . an overview of the interspace architecture layers is discussed . an object-model supporting semantic operations is developed . the model contains a rich set of classes and relationships of the data for the semantic indexing module . the basis of our semantic-indexing is done by the creation of concept-space . a concept-space is an index of a collection that uses document statistics to capture the relationships between concepts . it is useful for boosting text-search , by term-suggestion of alternative terms semantically related to query terms . over the years , we have developed generic technology for concept-spaces computation on large-collections across many subjects . recent computations on discipline-scale collections have been made on high-end supercomputers . this paper describes our implementation and implications of the computation in a distributed-computing-environment . experimental-results using different collection sizes and number of processes are presented to show the feasibility of this approach . we also show that laboratory and community collections are already easily computable using a group of pcs in a lab via a message-passing model . we conclude that pc-clusters will shortly be able to compute semantic indexes for any real collections .
