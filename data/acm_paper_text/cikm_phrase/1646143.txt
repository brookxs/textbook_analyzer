structure-aware indexing for keyword-search in databases most of existing methods of keyword-search over relational-databases find the steiner-trees composed of relevant tuples as the answers . they identify the steiner-trees by discovering the rich structural-relationships between tuples , and neglect the fact that such structural-relationships can be pre-computed and indexed . tuple units that are composed of most relevant tuples are proposed to address this problem . tuple units can be precomputed and indexed . existing methods identify a single tuple-unit to answer keyword-queries . they , however , may involve false-negatives as in many cases a single tuple-unit can not answer a keyword-query . instead , multiple tuple units should be integrated to answer keyword-queries . to address this problem , in this paper , we study how to integrate multiple related tuple units to effectively answer keyword-queries . we devise novel indices and incorporate the structural-relationships between different tuple units into the indices . we use the indices to efficiently and progressively identify the top-k relevant answers . we have implemented our method in real database-systems , and the experimental-results show that our approach achieves high search efficiency and accuracy , and outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly .
