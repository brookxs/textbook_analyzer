improved string-matching under noisy-channel conditions many document-based applications , including popular web-browsers , email viewers , and word processors , have a ` find on this page ' feature that allows a user to find every occurrence of a given string in the document . if the document text being searched is derived from a noisy process such as optical-character-recognition (ocr) , the effectiveness of typical string-matching can be greatly reduced . this paper describes an enhanced string-matching algorithm for degraded text that improves recall , while keeping precision at acceptable levels . the algorithm is more general than most approximate-matching algorithms and allows string-to-string edits with arbitrary costs . we develop a method for evaluating our technique and use it to examine the relative effectiveness of each sub-component of the algorithm . of the components we varied , we find that using confidence information from the recognition-process lead to the largest improvements in matching accuracy .
