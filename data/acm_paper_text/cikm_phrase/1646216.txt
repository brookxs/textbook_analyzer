xcfs : an xml-documents clustering approach using both the structure and the content this paper introduces a clustering approach , xml clustering using frequent substructures (xcfs) that considers both the structural and the content information of xml-documents in clustering . xcfs uses frequent substructures in the form of a novel representation , closed frequent embedded (cfe) subtrees to constrain the content in the clustering process . the empirical-analysis ascertains that xcfs can effectively cluster even very-large xml datasets and outperforms other existing methods .
