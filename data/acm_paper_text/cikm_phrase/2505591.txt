towards metric fusion on multi-view data : a cross-view_based graph random-walk-approach many real-world-objects described by multiple attributes or features can be decomposed as multiple `` views '' (e.g. , an image can be described by a color view or a shape view) , which often provides complementary information to each other . learning a metric (similarity-measures) for multi-view data is primary due to its wide applications in practices . however , leveraging multi-view information to produce a good metric is a great challenge and existing techniques are concerned with pairwise similarities , leading to undesirable fusion metric and high computational-complexity . in this paper , we propose a novel metric fusion technique via cross-view graph random-walk , named mfrw , regarding a multi-view based similarity-graphs (with each similarity-graph constructed under each view) . instead of using pairwise similarities , we seek a high-order metric yielded by graph random-walks over constructed similarity-graphs . observing that `` outlier views '' may exist in the fusion process , we incorporate the coefficient matrices representing the correlation strength between any two views into mfrw , named wmfrw . the principle of textsf {wmfrw} is implemented by exploring the `` common latent structure '' between views . the empirical-studies conducted on real-world databases demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency .
