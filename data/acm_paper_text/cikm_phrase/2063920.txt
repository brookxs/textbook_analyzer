representing document as dependency-graph for document-clustering in traditional clustering-methods , a document is often represented as `` bag-of-words '' (in bow model) or n-grams (in suffix-tree document-model) without considering the natural-language relationships between the words . in this paper , we propose a novel approach dgdc (dependency graph-based document-clustering algorithm) to address this issue . in our algorithm , each document is represented as a dependency-graph where the nodes correspond to words which can be seen as meta-descriptions of the document ; whereas the edges stand for the relations between pairs-of-words . a new similarity-measure is proposed to compute the pairwise similarity of documents based on their corresponding dependency-graphs . by applying the new similarity-measure in the group-average agglomerative hierarchial clustering (gahc) algorithm , the final clusters of documents can be obtained . the experiments were carried out on five public document datasets . the empirical-results have indicated that the dgdc algorithm can achieve better performance in document-clustering tasks compared with other approaches based on the bow model and suffix-tree document-model .
