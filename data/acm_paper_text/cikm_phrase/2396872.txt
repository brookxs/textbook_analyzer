what is the iq of your data-transformation system ? mapping and translating data across different representations is a crucial problem in information-systems . many formalisms and tools are currently used for this purpose , to the point that developers typically face a difficult question : `` what is the right tool for my translation-task ? '' in this paper , we introduce several techniques that contribute to answer this question . among these , a fairly general definition of a data-transformation system , a new and very efficient similarity-measure to evaluate the outputs produced by such a system , and a metric to estimate user efforts . based on these techniques , we are able to compare a wide range of systems on many translation tasks , to gain interesting insights about their effectiveness , and , ultimately , about their `` intelligence '' .
