feature-selection with conditional-mutual-information maximin in text-categorization feature-selection is an important component of text-categorization . this technique can both increase a classifier 's computation speed , and reduce the overfitting problem . several feature-selection methods , such as information-gain and mutual-information , have been widely used . although they greatly improve the classifier 's performance , they have a common drawback , which is that they do not consider the mutual relationships among the features . in this situation , where one feature 's predictive-power is weakened by others , and where the selected features tend to bias towards major categories , such selection-methods are not very effective . in this paper , we propose a novel feature-selection-method for text-categorization called <i> conditional-mutual-information maximin </i> (cmim) . it can select a set of individually discriminating and weakly dependent features . the experimental-results show that cmim can perform much better than traditional feature-selection methods .
