fast and reliable anomaly-detection in categorical-data spotting anomalies in large multi-dimensional databases is a crucial task with many applications in finance , health-care , security , etc. . we introduce comprex , a new approach for identifying anomalies using pattern-based compression . informally , our method finds a collection of dictionaries that describe the norm of a database succinctly , and subsequently flags those points dissimilar to the norm -- with high compression cost -- as anomalies . our approach exhibits four key features : 1) it is parameter-free ; it builds dictionaries directly from data , and requires no user-specified parameters such as distance-functions or density and similarity thresholds , 2) it is general ; we show it works for a broad range of complex databases , including graph , image and relational-databases that may contain both categorical and numerical-features , 3) it is scalable ; its running-time grows linearly with respect to both database-size as well as number of dimensions , and 4) it is effective ; experiments on a broad range of datasets show large improvements in both compression , as well as precision in anomaly-detection , outperforming its state-of-the-art competitors .
