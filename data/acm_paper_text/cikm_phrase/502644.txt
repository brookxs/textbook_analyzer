efficient incremental-view-maintenance in data-warehouses in the data-warehouse environment , the concept of a materialized-view is nowadays common and important in an objective of efficiently supporting olap-query processing . materialized-views are generally derived from select-project-join of several base-relations . these materialized-views need to be updated when the base-relations change . since the propagation of updates to the views may impose a significant overhead , it is very important to update the warehouse views efficiently . though various view-maintenance strategies have been discussed so far , they typically require too much access to base-relations , resulting in the performance degradation.in this paper we propose an efficient incremental-view-maintenance strategy called delta propagation that can minimize the total size of base-relations accessed by analyzing the properties of base-relations . we first define the delta expression and a delta propagation tree which are core concepts of the strategy . then , a dynamic-programming-algorithm that can find the optimal delta expression are proposed . we also present various experimental-results that show the usefulness and efficiency of the strategy .
