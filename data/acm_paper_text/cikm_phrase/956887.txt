learning cross-document structural-relationships using boosting multi-document discoure analysis has emerged with the potential of improving various information retrieval applications . based on the newly proposed cross-document-structure theory (cst) , this paper describes an empirical-study that uses boosting to classify cst relationships between sentence pairs extracted from topically related documents . we show that the binary classifier for determining existence of structural-relationships significantly outperforms the baseline . we also achieve promising results on the multi-class case in which the full taxonomy of relationships are considered .
