sigma encoded inverted-files compression of term-frequency lists and very long document-id lists within an inverted-file search-engine are examined . several compression-schemes are compared including elias ? and ? codes , golomb encoding , variable byte encoding , and a class of word-based encoding-schemes including simple-9 , relative-10 and carryover-12 . it is shown that these compression methods are not well suited to compressing these kinds of lists of numbers . of those tested , carryover-12 is preferred because it is both effective at compression and fast at decompression . a novel technique , sigma encoding prior to compression , is proposed and tested . sigma encoding utilizes a parameterized dictionary to reduce the number of bits necessary to store an integer . this method shows an about 0.3 bit per integer improvement over carryover-12 while costing only about 3 extra clock-cycles per integer to decompress .
