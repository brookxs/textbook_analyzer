defining isochrones in multimodal spatial networks an isochrone in a spatial-network is the minimal , possibly disconnected subgraph that covers all locations from where a query point is reachable within a given time span and by a given arrival time . in this paper we formally define isochrones for multimodal spatial networks with different transportation modes that can be discrete or continuous in , respectively , space and time . for the computation of isochrones we propose the multimodal incremental network expansion (mine) algorithm , which is independent of the actual network size and depends only on the size of the isochrone . an empirical-study using real-world-data confirms the analytical results .
