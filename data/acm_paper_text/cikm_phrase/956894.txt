exploring group-mobility for replica data-allocation in a mobile-environment the growth in wireless-communication technologies attracts a considerable amount of attention in mobile-ad-hoc-networks . since mobile-hosts in an ad-hoc-network usually move freely , the topology of the network changes dynamically and disconnection occurs frequently . these characteristics make a mobile-ad-hoc-network be likely to be separated into several disconnected partitions , and the data-accessibility is hence reduced . several schemes are proposed to alleviate the reduction of data-accessibility by replicating data items . however , little research effort was elaborated upon exploiting the group-mobility where the group-mobility refers to the phenomenon that several mobile-nodes tend to move together . in this paper , we address the problem of replica-allocation in a mobile-ad-hoc-network by exploring group-mobility . we first analyze the group-mobility model and derive several theoretical results . in light of these results , we propose a replica-allocation scheme to improve the data-accessibility . several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme . the experimental-results show that the proposed scheme is able to not only obtain higher data-accessibility but also produce lower network-traffic than prior schemes .
