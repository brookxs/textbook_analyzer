image-clustering fusion technique based on bfs with the increasing in number and size of databases dedicated to the storage of visual-content , the need for effective retrieval-systems has become crucial . the proposed method makes a significant contribution to meet this need through a technique in which sets of clusters are fused together to create an unique and more significant set of clusters . the images are represented by some features and then are grouped by these features , that are considered one by one . a probability-matrix is then built and explored by the breadth first search-algorithm with the aim of select an unique set of clusters . experimental-results , obtained using two different datasets , show the effectiveness of the proposed technique . furthermore , the proposed approach overcomes the drawback of tuning a set of parameters that fuse the similarity-measurement obtained by each feature to get an overall similarity between two images .
