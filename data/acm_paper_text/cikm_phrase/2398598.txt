impact neighborhood indexing (ini) in diffusion graphs a graph neighborhood consists of a set of nodes that are nearby or otherwise related to each other . while existing definitions consider the structure (or topology) of the graph , we note that they fail to take into account the information-propagation and diffusion characteristics , such as decay and reinforcement , common in many networks . in this paper , we first define the propagation efficiency of nodes and edges . we use this to introduce the novel concept of zero-erasure (or impact) neighborhood (zen) of a given node , n , consisting of the set of nodes that receive information from (or are impacted by) n without any decay . based on this , we present an impact neighborhood indexing (ini) algorithm that creates data-structures to help quickly identify impact neighborhood of any given node . experiment results confirm the efficiency-and-effectiveness of the proposed ini algorithms .
