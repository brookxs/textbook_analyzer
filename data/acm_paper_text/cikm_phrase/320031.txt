an effective mechanism for index update in structured-documents indexing-and-retrieval of structured-documents have been drawing attention increasingly since they enable to retrieve and access a certain part of a document easily . so far , several methods have been proposed in the setting that documents are rarely changed . these can be applied for the books or journals possessed in libraries , but hardly work for the documents that are subject to change frequently in the business domain . this paper aims at enabling incremental-update of indices whenever parts of documents are changed . for this , it employs the index-organized table that has been developed for the full-text-retrieval in oracle . it creates several index-organized tables that are essential in implementing the bottom up scheme strategy , which has been developed for manipulating structured-documents efficiently . along with an experiment , the technique presented here does not add much index overhead to the original one taken to the index organized table . in addition , the updates of indices are performed quickly as soon as parts of documents are changed .
