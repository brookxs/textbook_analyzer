domain-independent entity-coreference in rdf-graphs in this paper , we present a novel entity-coreference algorithm for semantic-web instances . the key issues include how to locate context-information and how to utilize the context appropriately . to collect context-information , we select a neighborhood (consisting of triples) of each instance from the rdf graph . to determine the similarity between two instances , our algorithm computes the similarity between comparable property values in the neighborhood graphs . the similarity of distinct uris and blank nodes is computed by comparing their outgoing links . to provide the best possible domain-independent matches , we examine an appropriate way to compute the discriminability of triples . to reduce the impact of distant nodes , we explore a distance-based discounting approach . we evaluated our algorithm using different instance categories in two datasets . our experiments show that the best results are achieved by including both our triple discrimination and discounting approaches .
