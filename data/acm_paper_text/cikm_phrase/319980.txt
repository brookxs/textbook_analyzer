architecture of a metasearch-engine that supports user-information-needs when a query is submitted to a metasearch-engine , decisions are made with respect to the underlying search-engines to be used , what modifications will be made to the query , and how to score the results . these decisions are typically made by considering only the user 's keyword-query , neglecting the larger information-need . users with specific needs , such as research papers or homepages , are not able to express these needs in a way that affects the decisions made by the metasearch-engine . in this paper , we describe a metasearch-engine architecture that considers the user 's information-need for each decision . users with different needs , but the same keyword-query , may search different sub-search engines , have different modifications made to their query , and have results ordered differently . our architecture combines several powerful approaches together in a single general purpose metasearch-engine .
