hierarchy evolution for improved classification hierarchical-classification has been shown to have superior performance than flat-classification . it is typically performed on hierarchies created by and for humans rather than for classification-performance . as a result , classification based on such hierarchies often yields suboptimal results . in this paper , we propose a novel genetic algorithm-based method on hierarchy adaptation for improved classification . our approach customizes the typical ga to optimize classification hierarchies . in several text-classification tasks , our approach produced hierarchies that significantly improved upon the accuracy of the original hierarchy as well as hierarchies generated by state-of-the-art methods .
