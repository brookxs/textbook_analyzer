a structure-sensitive framework for text-categorization this paper presents a framework called structure sensitive categorization (sscat) , that exploits document-structure for improved categorization . there are two parts to this framework , viz . (1) documents often have layout structure , such that logically coherent text is grouped together into fields using some mark-up-language . we use a log-linear-model , which associates one or more features with each field . weights associated with the field features are learnt from training-data and these weights quantify the per-class importance of the field features in determining the category for the document . (2) we employ a technique that exploits the parse-tree of fields that are phrasal constructs , such as title and associates weights with words in these constructs while boosting weights of important-words called focus words . these weights are learnt from example instances of phrasal constructs , marked with the corresponding focus words . the learning is accomplished by training a classifier that uses linguistic-features obtained from the text 's parse-structure . the weighted words , in fields with phrasal constructs , are used in obtaining features for the corresponding fields in the overall framework . sscat was tested on the supervised categorization-task of over one million products from yahoo! 's on-line-shopping data . with an accuracy of over 90 \ % , our classifier outperforms naive-bayes and support-vector-machines . this not only shows the effectiveness of sscat but also strengthens our belief that linguistic-features based on natural-language structure can improve tasks such as text-categorization .
