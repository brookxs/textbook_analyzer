extracting adjective facets from community q&a corpus in this paper , we propose a method for helping users explore information via web-searches by using a question-and-answer (q&a) corpus archived in a-community q&a site . when users do not have clear information-needs and have little knowledge about the task domain , it is difficult for them to create queries that adequately reflect their information-needs . we focused on terms like `` famous temples , '' `` historical townscapes , '' and `` delicious sweets , '' which we call `` adjective facets '' , and developed a method of extracting these facets from question-and-answer archives at a community q&a site . we evaluated the effectiveness of our adjective facets by comparing them with several baselines .
