using a compact-tree to index and query xml-data-indexing xml is crucial for efficient xml query-processing . we propose a compact-tree (ctree) for xml-indexing , which provides not only concise path-summaries at group level but also detailed child-parent relationships at element level . based on ctree , we are able to measure how well xml-data is structured . we also propose a three-step query-processing method . its efficiency is achieved by : (1) summarizing large xml-data structures into a condensed ctree ; (2) pruning irrelevant groups to significantly reduce the search-space ; (3) eliminating join operations between the matches for value predicates and those for structure constraints and (4) using ctree properties such as regular groups to reduce query-processing time . our experiments reveal that ctree is an effective data structure for managing xml-data .
