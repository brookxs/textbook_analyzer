reconstructing ddc for interactive-classification the automated-text-categorization (tc) has made prominent progress in recent years . however , seldom work is done on automatic-classification with library-classification systems , the largest and most sophisticated classification-systems people ever built , such as the dewey-decimal-classification (ddc) . the library-classification is a very laborious and time-consuming job that requires qualification and good training . the large-scale-classification schemes , such as the ddc , impose several obstacles to the state-of-art tc technologies , including very deep hierarchy , data-sparseness , and skewed category distribution . these problems characterize large-corpora of real-world-applications and it is very hard , if not impossible , to obtain satisfactory results . in this paper , we propose a novel algorithm to reconstruct classification-schemes according to the document density and category distribution , and to transform the category-hierarchy into a balanced virtual taxonomy by merging sparse categories , lopping dense branches and flattening the hierarchy . to make the classification-performance acceptable to real-world-applications , we also propose an interactive-classification model that only needs two or three times of user-interaction . extensive experiments are conducted on a 10-year bibliographic-data collection of the library-of-congress to verify the proposed methodology .
