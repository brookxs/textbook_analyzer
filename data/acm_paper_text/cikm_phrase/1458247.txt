proqid : partial restarts of queries in distributed-databases in a number of application areas , distributed-database-systems can be used to provide persistent-storage of data while providing efficient access for both local and remote data . with an increasing number of sites (computers) involved in a query , the probability of failure at query time increases . recovery has previously only focused on database-updates while query failures have been handled by complete restart of the query . this technique is not always applicable in the context of large-queries and queries with deadlines . in this paper we present an approach for partial restart of queries that incurs minimal extra network-traffic during query recovery . based on results from experiments on an implementation of the partial restart technique in a distributed-database system , we demonstrate its applicability and significant reduction of query cost in the presence of failures .
