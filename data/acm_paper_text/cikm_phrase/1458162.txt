clustered subset-selection and its-applications on it-service metrics motivated by the enormous amounts of data collected in a large it service-provider organization , this paper presents a method for quickly and automatically summarizing and extracting meaningful insights from the data . termed clustered subset-selection (css) , our method enables program-guided data explorations of high-dimensional-data matrices . css combines clustering and subset-selection into a coherent and intuitive method for data-analysis . in addition to a general-framework , we introduce a family of css algorithms with different clustering components such as k-means and close-to-rank-one (cro) clustering , and subset-selection components such as best rank-one approximation and rank-revealing qr (rrqr) decomposition . from an empirical perspective , we illustrate that css is achieving significant improvements over existing subset-selection methods in terms of approximation errors . compared to existing subset-selection techniques , css is also able to provide additional insight about clusters and cluster representatives . finally , we present a case-study of program-guided data explorations using css on a large amount of it-service-delivery data-collection .
