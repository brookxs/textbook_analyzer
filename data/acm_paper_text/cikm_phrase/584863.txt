harmonic models for polyphonic music retrieval most work in the ad-hoc music-retrieval field has focused on the retrieval of monophonic documents using monophonic queries . polyphony adds considerably more complexity . we present a method by which polyphonic music documents may be retrieved by polyphonic music queries . a new harmonic description technique is given , wherein the information from all chords , rather than the most significant chord , is used . this description is then combined in a new and unique way with markov statistical-methods to create models of both documents and queries . document-models are compared to query-models and then ranked by score . though test-collections for music are currently scarce , we give the first known recall-precision graphs for polyphonic music retrieval , and results are favorable .
