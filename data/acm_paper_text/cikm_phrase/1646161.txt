mining-frequent-itemsets in time-varying-data streams mining-frequent-itemsets in data-streams is beneficial to many real-world-applications but is also a challenging task since data-streams are unbounded and have high arrival rates . moreover , the distribution of data-streams can change over time , which makes the task of maintaining frequent-itemsets even harder . in this paper , we propose a false-negative oriented algorithm , called twim , that can find most of the frequent-itemsets , detect distribution changes , and update the mining results accordingly . experimental-results show that our algorithm performs as good as other false-negative algorithms on data-streams without distribution-change , and has the ability to detect changes over time-varying-data streams in - time with a high accuracy rate .
