providing grades and feedback for student summaries by ontology-based-information-extraction automatic-grading systems for summaries and essays have been studied for years . most commercial and research implementations are based in statistical-methods , such as latent-semantic-analysis (lsa) , which can provide high accuracy on similarity between the essay and the graded or standard essays , but they can offer very limited-feedback . in the present work , we propose a novel method to provide both grades and meaningful feedback for student summaries by ontology-based-information-extraction (obie) . we use ontological concepts and relationships to create extraction rules to identify correct statements . based on ontology constraints (e.g. , disjointness between concepts) , we define patterns that are logically inconsistent with the ontology to create rules to extract incorrect statements . experiments show that the grades given to 18 student summaries on ecosystems by obie are correlated to human gradings . obie also provide meaningful feedback on the errors those students made in their summaries .
