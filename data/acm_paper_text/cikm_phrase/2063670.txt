local-computation of pagerank : the ranking side imagine you are a social-network user who wants to search , in a list of potential candidates , for the best candidate for a job on the basis of their pagerank-induced importance ranking . is it possible to compute this ranking for a low-cost , by visiting only small subnetworks around the nodes that represent each candidate ? the fundamental problem underpinning this question , i.e. computing locally the pagerank ranking of k nodes in an $ n $ - node graph , was first raised by chen et al. (cikm 2004) and then restated by bar-yossef and mashiach (cikm 2008) . in this paper we formalize and provide the first analysis of the problem , proving that any local-algorithm that computes a correct ranking must take into consideration ? (? (kn)) nodes -- even when ranking the top $ k $ nodes of the graph , even if their pagerank scores are `` well separated '' , and even if the algorithm is randomized (and we prove a stronger ? (n) bound for deterministic-algorithms) . experiments carried out on large , publicly available crawls of the-web and of a social-network show that also in practice the fraction of the graph to be visited to compute the ranking may be considerable , both for algorithms that are always correct and for algorithms that employ (efficient) local score approximations .
