a neighborhood-based approach for clustering of linked document-collections this paper addresses the problem of automatically structuring linked document-collections by using clustering . in contrast to traditional clustering , we study the clustering problem in the light of available link-structure information for the data-set (e.g. , hyperlinks among web-documents or co-authorship among bibliographic-data entries) . our approach is based on iterative-relaxation of cluster assignments , and can be built on top of any clustering-algorithm . this technique results in higher cluster purity , better overall accuracy , and make self-organization more robust .
