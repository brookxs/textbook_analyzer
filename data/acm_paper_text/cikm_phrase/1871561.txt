personalized-search by tag-based user-profile and resource profile in collaborative-tagging-systems with the increase of resource-sharing web-sites such as youtube 1 and flickr 2 , personalized-search becomes more important and challenging , as users demand higher retrieval quality . to achieve this goal , personalized-search needs to take users ' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration . collaborative-tagging (also known as folksonomy [11]) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags , which provide a simple but powerful way for organizing , retrieving and sharing different types of social resources . in this paper , we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized-search . to handle these limitations , we propose a new method to model user-profiles and resource profiles in a collaborative-tagging environment . a novel search-method using such users ' and resources ' profiles is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource search . we implement a prototype-system named as fmrs . experiments using fmrs data-set and movielens data-set show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods .
