establishing value mappings using statistical-models and user-feedback in this paper , we present a `` value-mapping '' algorithm that does not rely on syntactic similarity or semantic-interpretation of the values . the algorithm first constructs a statistical model (e.g. , co-occurrence-frequency or entropy vector) that captures the unique characteristics of values and their co-occurrence . it then finds the matching values by computing the distances between the models while refining the models using user-feedback through iterations . our experimental-results suggest that our approach successfully establishes value mappings even in the presence of opaque data-values and thus can be a useful addition to the existing data-integration techniques .
