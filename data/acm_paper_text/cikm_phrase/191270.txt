query-expansion using domain-adapted , weighted thesaurus in an extended boolean-model in this paper , we address there important issues with query-expansion using a thesaurus ; how to give weights to the terms in expanded queries , how to select additional search-terms in the thesaurus , and how to enrich the terms in the manual thesaurus (namely , thesaurus reconstruction) . to weight the terms in expanded queries , we construct the weighted thesaurus that has a similarity value between the terms in the thesaurus , using statistical co-occurrence in a corpus . to enrich the terms in the manual thesaurus , domain dependent terms which occur in a corpus are inserted into the weighted thesaurus using the co-occurrence-information . in this paper , the reconstructed thesaurus with weights is defined as a domain-adapted , weighted thesaurus . then we explain query-expansion using the domain-adapted , weighted thesaurus in an extended boolean-retrieval model . to select additional search-terms during query-expansion , our model uses semi-automatic query-expansion and a restriction method . in the experiments , our system had almost twice the recall of the boolean-retrieval system not using the thesaurus or the query-expansion retrieval-system using the original thesaurus . and also , the precision of our system was almost the same precision as the other systems .
