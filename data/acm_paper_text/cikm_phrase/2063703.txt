summarizing web-forum threads based on a latent-topic propagation process with an increasingly amount of information in web-forums , quick comprehension of threads in web-forums has become a challenging research problem . to handle this issue , this paper investigates the task of web-forum thread-summarization (wfts) , aiming to give a brief statement of each thread that involving multiple dynamic topics . when applied to the task of wfts , traditional summarization methods are cramped by topic dependencies , topic drifting and text sparseness . consequently , we explore an unsupervised topic propagation-model in this paper , the post propagation-model (ppm) , to burst through these problems by simultaneously modeling the semantics and the reply relationship existing in each thread . each post in ppm is considered as a mixture of topics , and a product of dirichlet distributions in previous posts is employed to model each topic dependencies during the asynchronous discussion . based on this model , the task of wfts is accomplished by extracting most significant sentences in a thread . the experimental-results on two different forum data-sets show that wfts based on the ppm outperforms several state-of-the-art summarization methods in terms of rouge metrics .
