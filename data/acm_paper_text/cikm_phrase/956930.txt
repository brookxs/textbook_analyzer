building xml statistics for the hidden-web there have been several techniques proposed for building statistics for static xml-data . however , very little work has been done in the area of building xml statistics for data sources that export xml-views of data that is stored in relational or other databases . for such data sources , we need statistics that are built in an on-line manner , by observing the xml-queries to the data sources and their results . in this paper , we present a technique for building on-line xml statistics by observing the xpath-queries issued to a data source and their result sizes . these xpath-queries select parts of the virtual xml-document representing the xml view of the data at the data source . we convert these xpath-queries to a more abstract and generalized form that we call annotated path-expressions . we present a technique for storing these annotated path-expressions and information about their selectivity for use in estimating the selectivity of future xpath-queries . we also present an experimental-evaluation of our proposed approach .
