talmud : transfer-learning for multiple domains most collaborative-recommender-systems (rs) operate in a single domain (such as movies , books , etc.) and are capable of providing recommendations based on historical usage-data which is collected in the specific domain only . cross-domain recommenders address the sparsity-problem by using machine-learning (ml) techniques to transfer knowledge from a dense domain into a sparse target-domain . in this paper we propose a transfer-learning technique that extracts knowledge from multiple domains containing rich-data (e.g. , movies and music) and generates recommendations for a sparse target-domain (e.g. , games) . our method learns the relatedness between the different source domains and the target-domain , without requiring overlapping users between domains . the model integrates the appropriate amount of knowledge from each domain in order to enrich the target-domain data . experiments with several datasets reveal that , using multiple sources and the relatedness between domains improves accuracy of results .
