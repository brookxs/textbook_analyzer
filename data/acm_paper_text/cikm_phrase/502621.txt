predicting the cost-quality-trade-off for information-retrieval queries : facilitating database-design and query-optimization efficient , flexible , and scalable integration of full text information-retrieval (ir) in a dbms is not a trivial case . this holds in particular for query-optimization in such a context . to facilitate the bulk-oriented behavior of database-query-processing , a priori knowledge of how to limit the data efficiently prior to query-evaluation is very valuable at optimization-time . the usually imprecise nature of ir querying provides an extra opportunity to limit the data by a trade-off with the quality of the answer . in this paper we present a mathematically derived model to predict the quality implications of neglecting information before query-execution . in particular we investigate the possibility to predict the retrieval quality for a document-collection for which no training information is available , which is usually the case in practice . instead , we construct a model that can be trained on other document-collections for which the necessary quality information is available , or can be obtained quite easily . we validate our model for several document-collections and present the experimental-results . these results show that our model performs quite well , even for the case were we did not train it on the test-collection itself .
