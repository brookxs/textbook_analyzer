a geographic study of tie-strength in social-media in this paper , we investigate the interplay of distance and tie-strength through an examination of 20 million geo-encoded tweets collected from twitter and 6 million user-profiles . concretely , we investigate the relationship between the strength of the tie between a pair of users , and the distance between the pair . we identify several factors -- including following , mentioning , and actively engaging in conversations with another user -- that can strongly reveal the distance between a pair of users . we find a bimodal distribution in twitter , with one peak around 10 miles from people who live nearby , and another peak around 2500 miles , further validating twitter 's use as both a social-network (with geographically nearby friends) and as a news distribution network (with very distant relationships) .
