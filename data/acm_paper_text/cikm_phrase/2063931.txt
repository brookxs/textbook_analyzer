towards expert-finding by leveraging relevant categories in authority-ranking how to improve authority-ranking is a crucial research problem for expert-finding . in this paper , we propose a novel framework for expert-finding based on the authority information in the target category as well as the relevant categories . first , we develop a scalable method for measuring the relevancy between categories through topic-models . then , we provide a link-analysis approach for ranking user authority by considering the information in both the target category and the relevant categories . finally , the extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world q&a data-sets clearly show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods with a significant margin .
