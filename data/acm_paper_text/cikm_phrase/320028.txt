towards data-warehouse-design this paper focuses on data-warehouse modelling . the conceptual-model we defined , is based on object concepts extended with specific concepts like generic-classes , temporal classes and archive classes . the temporal classes are used to store the detailed evolutions and the archive classes store the summarised data evolutions . we also provide a flexible concept allowing the administrator to define historised parts and non-historised parts into the warehouse schema . moreover , we introduce constraints which configure the data-warehouse behaviour and these various parts . to validate our propositions , we describe a prototype dedicated to the data-warehouse-design .
