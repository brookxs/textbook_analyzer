personalized recommender-system based on item taxonomy and folksonomy item folksonomy or tag-information is popularly available on the web now . however , since tags are arbitrary words given by users , they contain a lot of noise such as tag synonyms , semantic ambiguities and personal tags . such noise brings difficulties to improve the accuracy of item recommendations . in this paper , we propose to combine item taxonomy and folksonomy to reduce the noise of tags and make personalized item recommendations . the experiments conducted on the dataset collected from amazon.com demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approaches . the results suggested that the recommendation-accuracy can be further improved if we consider the viewpoints and the vocabularies of both experts and users .
