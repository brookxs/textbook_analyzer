importance weighted passive learning importance weighted active-learning (iwal) introduces a weighting-scheme to measure the importance of each instance for correcting the sampling-bias of the probability distributions between training and test datasets . however , the weighting-scheme of iwal involves the distribution of the test-data , which can be straightforwardly estimated in active-learning by interactively querying users for labels of selected test instances , but difficult for conventional learning where there are no interactions with users , referred as passive learning . in this paper , we investigate the insufficient sampling-bias problem , i.e. , bias occurs only because of insufficient samples , but the sampling process is unbiased . in doing this , we present two assumptions on the sampling-bias , based on which we propose a practical weighting-scheme for the empirical loss-function in conventional passive learning , and present iwpl , an importance weighted passive learning-framework . furthermore , we provide iwsvm , an importance weighted svm for validation . extensive experiments demonstrate significant advantages of iwsvm on benchmarks and synthetic datasets .
