as-index : a structure for string search using n-grams and algebraic-signatures as-index is a new index-structure for exact string search in disk resident databases . it uses hashing , unlike known alternatives , whether baesd on trees or tries . it typically indexes every n-gram in the database , though non-dense indexing is also possible . the hash-function uses the algebraic-signatures of all n-grams . use of hashing provides for constant index access-time for arbitrarily long patterns , unlike other structures whose search-cost is at best logarithmic . the storage overhead of as-index is basically 500 - 600 \ % , similar to that of alternatives or smaller . we show the index-structure , our use of algebraic-signatures and the search-algorithm . we discuss the design trade-offs and present the theoretical and experimental performance analysis . we compare the as-index to main alternatives . we conclude that as-index is an attractive structure and we indicate directions for future work .
