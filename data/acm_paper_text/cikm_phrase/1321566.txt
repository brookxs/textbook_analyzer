a cdd-based formal-model for expert-finding searching an organization 's document-repositories for experts is a frequently faced problem in intranet information-management . this paper proposes a candidate-centered model which is referred as candidate description document (cdd) - based retrieval-model . the expertise evidence about an expert candidate scattered over repositories is mined and aggregated automatically to form a profile called the candidate 's cdd , which represents his knowledge . we present the model from its foundations through its logical development and argue in favor of this model for expert-finding . we devise and compare the different strategies for exploring a variety of expertise evidence . the experiments on trec enterprise corpora demonstrate that the cdd-based model achieves significant and consistent improvement on performance through comparative-studies with non-cdd methods .
