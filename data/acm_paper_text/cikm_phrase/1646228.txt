caofes : an ontological-framework for web-service retrieval semantic-web-search involves retrieval of user-specific web artifacts by utilizing their semantic-descriptions . a very specific web artifact that has evolved in recent times is web-services . web-services can be semantically described in languages like owl-s . however , such languages are limited with respect to their expressivity of context . they also lack a formal ontological-framework where efficient web service retrieval can be conducted . in this paper we model a service-request scenario within the-web as an event-driven-system . services as well as user requests are modeled as events . we propose an ontological-framework called context-aware ontology-framework for events and services (caofes) where such event-driven web-service retrieval can be efficiently executed by a novel reasoning-technique .
