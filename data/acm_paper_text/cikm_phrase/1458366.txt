a coarse-grain grid-based subspace-clustering method for online multi-dimensional-data streams this paper proposes a subspace-clustering algorithm which combines grid-based-clustering with frequent-itemset-mining . given a d-dimensional data-stream , the on-going distribution statistics of its data elements in every one-dimensional data-space is monitored by a list of fine-grain grid-cells called a sibling list , so that all the one-dimensional clusters are accurately identified . by tracing a set of frequently co-occurred one-dimensional clusters , it is possible to find a coarse-grain dense rectangular space in a higher dimensional subspace . an st-tree is introduced to continuously monitor dense rectangular spaces in all the subspaces of the d dimensions . among the spaces , those ones whose densities are greater than or equal to a user defined minimum support threshold s min are corresponding to final clusters .
