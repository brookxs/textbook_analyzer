computing term-similarity by large probabilistic isa knowledge computing semantic-similarity between two terms is essential for a variety of text-analytics and understanding applications . however , existing approaches are more suitable for semantic-similarity between words rather than the more general multi-word-expressions (mwes) , and they do not scale very well . therefore , we propose a lightweight and effective approach for semantic-similarity using a large-scale semantic-network automatically acquired from billions of web-documents . given two terms , we map them into the concept-space , and compare their similarity there . furthermore , we introduce a clustering approach to orthogonalize the concept-space in order to improve the accuracy of the similarity-measure . extensive studies demonstrate that our approach can accurately compute the semantic similarity between terms with mwes and ambiguity , and significantly outperforms 12 competing methods .
