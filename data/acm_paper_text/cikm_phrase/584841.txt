xclust : clustering xml-schemas for effective integration it is increasingly important to develop scalable integration-techniques for the growing number of xml-data sources . a practical starting point for the integration of large numbers of document-type-definitions (dtds) of xml sources would be to first find clusters of dtds that are similar in structure and semantics . reconciling similar dtds within such a cluster will be an easier task than reconciling dtds that are different in structure and semantics as the latter would involve more restructuring . we introduce xclust , a novel integration-strategy that involves the clustering of dtds . a matching-algorithm based on the semantics , immediate descendents and leaf-context similarity of dtd elements is developed . our experiments to integrate real-world dtds demonstrate the effectiveness of the xclust approach .
