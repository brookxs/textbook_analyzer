kernel-methods , syntax-and-semantics for relational text-categorization previous work on natural-language-processing for information-retrieval has shown the inadequateness of semantic and syntactic-structures for both document-retrieval and categorization . the main reason is the high-reliability and effectiveness of language-models , which are sufficient to accurately solve such retrieval tasks . however , when the latter involve the computation of relational semantics between text fragments simple statistical-models may result ineffective . in this paper , we show that syntactic and semantic structures can be used to greatly improve complex categorization tasks such as determining if an answer correctly responds to a question . given the high complexity of representing semantic/syntactic structures in learning-algorithms , we applied kernel-methods along with support-vector-machines to better exploit the needed relational information . our experiments on answer classification on web and trec-data show that our models greatly improve on bag-of-words .
