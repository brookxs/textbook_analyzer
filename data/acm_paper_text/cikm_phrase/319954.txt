transformation-based spatial-join spatial-join finds pairs of spatial-objects having a specific spatial-relationship in spatial-database systems . a number of spatial-join-algorithms have recently been proposed in the literature . most of them , however , perform the join in the original space . joining in the original space has a drawback of dealing with sizes of objects and thus has difficulty in developing a formal algorithm that does not rely on heuristics . in this paper , we propose a spatial-join algorithm based on the transformation-technique . an object having a size in the two-dimensional original space is transformed into a point in the four-dimensional transform space , and the join is performed on these point objects . this can be easily extended to n-dimensional cases . we show the excellence of the proposed approach through analysis and extensive experiments . the results show that the proposed algorithm has a performance generally better than that of the r * - based algorithm proposed by brinkhoff et al. . this is a strong indicating that corner transformation preserves clustering among objects and that spatial-operations can be performed better in the transform space than in the original space . this reverses the common belief that transformation will adversely affect clustering . we believe that our result will provide a new insight towards transformation-based spatial-query-processing .
