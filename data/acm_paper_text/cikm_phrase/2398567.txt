gte : a distributional second-order co-occurrence approach to improve the identification of top relevant dates in web-snippets in this paper , we present an approach to identify top relevant dates in web-snippets with respect to a given implicit temporal query . our approach is two-fold . first , we propose a generic temporal-similarity measure called gte , which evaluates the temporal-similarity between a query and a date . second , we propose a classification-model to accurately relate relevant dates to their corresponding query terms and withdraw irrelevant ones . we suggest two different solutions : a threshold-based classification strategy and a supervised classifier based on a combination of multiple similarity-measures . we evaluate both strategies over a set of real-world-text queries and compare the performance of our web snippet approach with a query-log approach over the same set of queries . experiments show that determining the most relevant dates of any given implicit temporal query can be improved with gte combined with the second order similarity-measure infosimba , the dice-coefficient and the threshold-based strategy compared to (1) first-order similarity-measures and (2) the query-log_based approach .
