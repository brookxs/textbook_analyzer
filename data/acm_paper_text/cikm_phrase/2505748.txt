mining a search-engine 's corpus without a query pool many websites (e.g. , wedmd.com , cnn.com) provide keyword-search interfaces over a large-corpus of documents . meanwhile , many third parties (e.g. , investors , analysts) are interested in learning big-picture analytical information over such a document-corpus , but have no direct way of accessing it other than using the highly restrictive web-search interface . in this paper , we study how to enable third-party data-analytics over a search-engine 's corpus without the cooperation of its owner - specifically , by issuing a small number of search queries through the-web interface . almost all existing techniques require a pre-constructed query pool - i.e. , a small yet comprehensive collection of queries which , if all issued through the search-interface , can recall almost all documents in the corpus . the problem with this requirement is that a `` good '' query pool can only be constructed by someone with very specific knowledge (e.g. , size , topic , special terms used , etc.) of the corpus , essentially leading to a chicken-and-egg-problem . in this paper , we develop qg-sampler and qg-estimator , the first practical pool-free techniques for sampling and aggregate (e.g. , sum , count , avg) estimation over a search-engine 's corpus , respectively . extensive real-world-experiments show that our algorithms perform on-par with the state-of-the-art pool-based techniques equipped with a carefully tailored query pool , and significantly outperforms the latter when the query pool is a mismatch .
