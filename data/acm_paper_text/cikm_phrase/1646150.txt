matching stream patterns of various lengths and tolerances continuously identifying pre-defined patterns in a streaming-time-series has strong demand in various applications . while most existing works assume the patterns are in equal length and tolerance , this work focuses on the problem where the patterns have various lengths and tolerances , a common situation in the real-world . the challenge of this problem roots on the strict space and time requirements of processing the arriving and expiring data in high-speed stream , combined with difficulty of coping with a large number of patterns with various lengths and tolerances . we introduce a novel concept of converging envelope which bounds the tolerance of a group of patterns in various tolerances and equal length and thus dramatically reduces the number of patterns for similarity-computation . the basic idea of converging envelope has potential to more general index problems . to index patterns in various lengths and tolerances , we partition patterns into sub-patterns in equal length and an multi-tree index is developed in this paper .
