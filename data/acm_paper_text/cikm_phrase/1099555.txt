leonardo 's laptop : human-needs and the new computing technologies the old computing was about what computers could do ; the new computing is about what people can do.to accelerate the shift from the old to the new computing designers need to : reduce computer user-frustration . recent studies show 46 \ % of time is lost to crashes , confusing instructions , navigation problems , etc. . public pressure for change could promote design improvements and increase reliability , thereby dramatically enhancing user-experiences . promote universal-usability . interfaces must be tailorable to a wide range of hardware , software , and networks , and users . when broad services such as voting , healthcare , and education are envisioned , the challenge to designers is substantial . envision a future in which human-needs more directly shape technology-evolution . four circles of human-relationships and four human activities map out the human-needs for mobility , ubiquity , creativity , and community . the world wide med and million-person communities will be accessible through desktop , palmtop and fingertip devices to support e-learning , e-business , e-healthcare , and e-government . leonardo da vinci could help as an inspirational muse for the new computing . his example could push designers to improve quality through scientific study and more elegant visual-design . leonardo 's example can guide us to the new computing , which emphasizes empowerment , creativity , and collaboration . information-visualization and personal photo interfaces will be shown : photomesa (www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/photomesa) and photofinder (www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/photolib) . for more : http://mitpress.mit.edu/leonardoslaptop and http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/newcomputing .
