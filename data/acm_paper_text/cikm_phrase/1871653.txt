weighting common syntactic-structures for natural-language_based information-retrieval natural-language-processing (nlp) techniques are believed to hold the potential to assist `` bag-of-words '' information-retrieval (ir) in terms of retrieval-accuracy . in this paper , we report a natural-language_based ir approach where the common syntactic-structures between documents and the query is regarded to as a query-dependent feature for documents . specifically , a `` structural weight '' is proposed for query terms , which can be seen as a weight to model the degree of term 's involvement in the common syntactic-structures . this structural weight is used together with the tf-idf-weighting scheme , which results in a new ranking-function . the accumulation of this structural weight of all the query terms in the new ranking-function will be seen as a measure of how much a document and a query share the common syntactic-structures . the experimental-results show that by using this ranking-function , significant improvements in the retrieval-performance are achieved .
