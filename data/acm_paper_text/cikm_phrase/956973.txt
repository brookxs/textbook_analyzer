relevant-query feedback in statistical-language-modeling in traditional relevance-feedback , researchers have explored relevant-document feedback , wherein , the query-representation is updated based on a set of relevant documents returned by the user . in this work , we investigate relevant-query feedback , in which we update a document 's representation based on a set of relevant queries . we propose four statistical-models to incorporate relevant-query feedback.to validate our models , we considered anchor-text of incoming links to a given document as feedback queries and performed experiments on the home-page retrieval-task of trec 2001 . our results show that three of our four models outperform the query-likelihood baseline by at least 35 \ % in mrr score on a test-set .
