discovering authorities in question answer communities by using link-analysis question-answer-portals such as naver and yahoo!-answers are quickly becoming rich sources of knowledge on many topics which are not well served by general web-search-engines . unfortunately , the quality of the submitted answers is uneven , ranging from excellent detailed answers to snappy and insulting remarks or even advertisements for commercial content . furthermore , user-feedback for many topics is sparse , and can be insufficient to reliably identify good answers from the bad ones . hence , estimating the authority of users is a crucial task for this emerging domain , with potential applications to answer-ranking , spam-detection , and incentive-mechanism design . we present an analysis of the link-structure of a general-purpose question-answering-community to discover authoritative-users , and promising experimental-results over a dataset of more than 3 million answers from a popular community qa site . we also describe structural differences between question topics that correlate with the success of link-analysis for authority discovery .
