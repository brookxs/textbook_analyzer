improving retrievability of patents with cluster-based pseudo-relevance-feedback documents selection high findability of documents within a certain cut-off rank is considered an important-factor in recall-oriented application-domains such as patent or legal-document-retrieval . findability is hindered by two aspects , namely the inherent bias favoring some types of documents over others introduced by the retrieval-model , and the failure to correctly capture and interpret the context of conventionally rather short queries . in this paper , we analyze the bias impact of different retrieval-models and query-expansion strategies . we furthermore propose a novel query-expansion strategy based on document-clustering to identify dominant relevant documents . this helps to overcome limitations of conventional query-expansion strategies that suffer strongly from the noise introduced by imperfect initial query results for pseudo-relevance-feedback documents selection . experiments with different collections of patent documents suggest that clustering_based document-selection for pseudo-relevance-feedback is an effective approach for increasing the findability of individual documents and decreasing the bias of a retrieval-system .
