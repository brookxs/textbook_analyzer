robust distributed indexing for locality-skewed workloads multidimensional-indexing is crucial for enabling a fast-search over large-scale-data . owing to the unprecedented scale of data , extending such indexing technology has recently gained attention in distributed-environments . the goal of existing efforts in distributed-indexing has been the localization of queries to data residing at a small number of nodes (i.e. , locality-preserving indexing) to minimize communication-cost . however , considering that workloads often correlate with data-locality , such indexing often generates hotspots . location-based-queries are typically skewed to disaster-areas during certain periods of time , e.g. , during hurricane irene , search traffic increased by more than 2000 % . to alleviate such hotspots , we propose workload-balancing as an optimization goal . a cost-model analytically supporting the need for load-balancing is first developed , then a distributed-index that evenly distributes the workload is presented . our empirical-study suggests that hotspots degrading search-performance can be effectively alleviated . specifically , when deployed to amazon-ec2 , our proposed scheme showed maximum speed-up of 127.7 % . even in hostile settings where workload is not at all correlated with the search criteria , the proposed scheme 's performance is comparable to existing approaches optimized for such settings .
