improving context-aware query-classification via adaptive self-training topical classification of user queries is critical for general-purpose web-search systems . it is also a challenging task , due to the sparsity of query terms and the lack of labeled queries . on the other hand , search contexts embedded in query sessions and unlabeled-queries free on the web have not been fully utilized in most query-classification systems . in this work , we leverage these information to improve query-classification accuracy . we first incorporate search contexts into our framework using a conditional-random-field (crf) model . discriminative-training of crfs is favored over the traditional maximum-likelihood-training because of its robustness to noise . we then adapt self-training with our model to exploit the information in unlabeled-queries . by investigating different confidence measurements and model-selection strategies , we effectively avoid the error-reinforcing nature of self-training . in extensive experiments on real search-logs , we have averaged around 20 \ % improvement in classification-accuracy over other state-of-the-art baselines .
