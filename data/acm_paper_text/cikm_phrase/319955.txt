binary string relations : a foundation for spatiotemporal knowledge-representation the paper is concerned with the qualitative-representation of spatiotemporal-relations . we initially propose a multiresolution framework for the representation of relations among 1d intervals , based on a binary string encoding . we subsequently extend this framework to multiple dimensions , thus allowing the description of spatiotemporal-relations at various contexts . the feasible relations at a particular resolution level are inherently permeated by a poset structure , called conceptual neighbourhood , upon which we propose efficient relation inferencing mechanisms . finally , we discuss the application of our model to spatiotemporal-reasoning , which refers to the classic problems of satisfiability and deductive-closure of a set of spatiotemporal assertions .
