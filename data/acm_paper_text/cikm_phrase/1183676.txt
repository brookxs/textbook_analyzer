processing relaxed-skylines in pdms using distributed-data-summaries peer-data-management-systems (pdms) are a natural extension of heterogeneous database systems . one of the main tasks in such systems is efficient-query-processing . insisting on complete answers , however , leads to asking almost every peer in the network . relaxing these completeness requirements by applying approximate-query-answering techniques can significantly reduce costs . since most users are not interested in the exact answers to their queries , rank-aware query-operators like top - k or skyline play an important role in query-processing . in this paper , we present the novel concept of relaxed-skylines that combines the advantages of both rank-aware query-operators and approximate-query-processing techniques . furthermore , we propose a strategy for processing relaxed-skylines in distributed-environments that allows for giving guarantees for the completeness of the result using distributed-data-summaries as routing indexes .
