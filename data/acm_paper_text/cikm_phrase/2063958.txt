sila : a spatial instance-learning approach for deep webpages deep-web pages convey very relevant-information for different application-domains like e-government , e-commerce , social-networking . for this reason there is a constant high interest in efficiently , effectively and automatically extracting data from deep-web data sources . in this paper we present sila , a novel spatial instance-learning approach , that allows for extracting data records from deep-web pages by exploiting both the spatial-arrangement and the presentation features of data items/fields produced by layout engines of web-browsers in visualizing deep-web pages on the screen . sila is independent from the internal html encodings of web-pages , and allows for recognizing data records in pages having multiple data regions in which data items are arranged by many different presentation layouts . experimental-results show that sila has very high precision-and-recall and that it works much better than mdr and vints approaches .
