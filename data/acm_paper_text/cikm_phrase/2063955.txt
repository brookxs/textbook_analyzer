two birds with one stone : learning semantic models for text-categorization and word-sense-disambiguation in this paper we present a novel approach to learning semantic models for multiple domains , which we use to categorize wikipedia pages and to perform domain word-sense-disambiguation (wsd) . in order to learn a semantic-model for each domain we first extract relevant terms from the texts in the domain and then use these terms to initialize a random-walk over the wordnet graph . given an input-text , we check the semantic models , choose the appropriate domain for that text and use the best-matching model to perform wsd . our results show considerable improvements on text-categorization and domain wsd tasks .
