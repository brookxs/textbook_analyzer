fourth workshop on exploiting semantic-annotations in information-retrieval (esair) there is an increasing amount of structure on the web as a result of modern web languages , user-tagging and annotation , and emerg - ing robust nlp-tools . these meaningful , semantic , annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information-access , by enhancing the depth of analysis of today 's systems . currently , we have only started exploring the possibilities and only begin to un - derstand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use . unleashing the potential of semantic-annotations requires us to think outside-the-box , by combining the insights of natural lan - guage processing (nlp) to go beyond bags of words , the insights of databases (db) to use structure efficiently even when aggregating over millions of records , the insights of information-retrieval (ir) in effective goal-directed-search and evaluation , and the insights of knowledge-management (km) to get grips on the greater whole . this workshop aims to bring together researchers from these dif - ferent disciplines and work together on one of the greatest chal - lenges in the years to come . the desired result of the workshop will be to gain concrete insight into the potential of semantic an - notations , and in concrete steps to take this research forward ; to synchronize related research happening in nlp , db , ir , and km , in ways that combine the strengths of each discipline ; and to have a lively , interactive workshop where every participant contributes actively and which inspires attendees to think freely and creatively , working towards a common goal .
