evaluation of set-based queries with aggregation-constraints many applications often require finding a set of items of interest with respect to some aggregation-constraints . for example , a tourist might want to find a set of places of interest to visit in a city such that the total expected duration is no more than six hours and the total cost is minimized . we refer to such queries as sac queries for `` set-based with aggregation-constraints '' queries . the usefulness of sac queries is evidenced by the many variations of sac queries that have been studied which differ in the number and types of constraints supported . in this paper , we make two contributions to sac query-evaluation . we first establish the hardness of evaluating sac queries with multiple count constraints and presented a novel , pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for evaluating a non-trivial fragment of sac queries with multiple sum constraints and at most one of either count , group-by , or content constraint . we also propose a heuristic-approach for evaluating general sac queries . the effectiveness of our proposed solutions is demonstrated by an experimental performance study .
