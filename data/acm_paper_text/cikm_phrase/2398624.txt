dual word and document seed-selection for semi-supervised sentiment-classification semi-supervised sentiment-classification aims to train a classifier with a small number of labeled-data (called seed data) and a large amount of unlabeled-data . a big advantage of this approach is its saving of annotation-effort by using the unlabeled-data which is usually freely available . in this paper , we propose an approach to further minimize the annotation-effort of semi-supervised sentiment-classification by actively selecting the seed data . specifically , a novel selection-strategy is proposed to simultaneously select good words and documents for manual-annotation by considering both of their annotation costs and informativeness . experimental-results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .
