relying on topic subsets for system-ranking-estimation ranking a number of retrieval-systems according to their retrieval-effectiveness without relying on costly relevance-judgments was first explored by soboroff et al [6] . over the years , a number of alternative approaches have been proposed . we perform a comprehensive analysis of system-ranking-estimation approaches on a wide variety of trec test-collections and topics sets . our analysis reveals that the performance of such approaches is highly dependent upon the topic or topic subset , used for estimation . we hypothesize that the performance of system-ranking-estimation approaches can be improved by selecting the `` right '' subset of topics and show that using topic subsets improves the performance by 32 \ % on average , with a maximum improvement of up to 70 \ % in some cases .
