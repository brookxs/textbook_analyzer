gelling , and melting , large-graphs by edge manipulation controlling the dissemination of an entity (e.g. , meme , virus , etc) on a large-graph is an interesting problem in many disciplines . examples include epidemiology , computer-security , marketing , etc. . so far , previous studies have mostly focused on removing or inoculating nodes to achieve the desired outcome . we shift the problem to the level of edges and ask : which edges should we add or delete in order to speed-up or contain a dissemination ? first , we propose effective and scalable-algorithms to solve these dissemination problems . second , we conduct a theoretical study of the two problems and our methods , including the hardness of the problem , the accuracy and complexity of our methods , and the equivalence between the different strategies and problems . third and lastly , we conduct experiments on real topologies of varying sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approaches .
