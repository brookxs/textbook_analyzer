opinion digger : an unsupervised opinion miner from unstructured product-reviews mining customer-reviews (opinion-mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction . most of the reviewing websites such as epinions.com provide some additional-information on top of the review text and overall rating , including a set of predefined aspects and their ratings , and a rating guideline which shows the intended interpretation of the numerical ratings . however , the existing methods have ignored this additional-information . we claim that using this information , which is freely available , along with the review text can effectively improve the accuracy of opinion-mining . we propose an unsupervised-method , called opinion digger , which extracts important aspects of a product and determines the overall consumer 's satisfaction for each , by estimating a rating in the range from 1 to 5 . we demonstrate the improved effectiveness of our methods on a real life dataset that we crawled from epinions.com .
