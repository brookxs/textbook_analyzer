removing redundancy and inconsistency in memory-based collaborative-filtering the application range of memory-based collaborative-filtering (cf) is limited due to cf 's high memory-consumption and long runtime . the approach presented in this paper removes redundant and inconsistent instances (users) from the data . this paper aims to distinguish informative instances (users) from large raw user-preference database and thus alleviate the memory and runtime cost of the widely used memory-based collaborative-filtering (cf) algorithm . our work shows that a satisfactory accuracy can be achieved by using only a small portion of the original data-set , thereby alleviating the storage and runtime cost of the cf algorithm . in our approach , we consider instance-selection as the problem of selecting informative data that increase the we begin by discussing the instance-selection problem in a general sense that is to increase a posteriori probability of the optimal model by selecting informative data . we evaluate the empirical performance of our approach pf on two real-world-data sets and attain very promisingpositive experimental-results . the ddata size and the prediction time are significantly reduced , while the prediction-accuracy is on a par with almost the same as the results achieved by using the complete database .
