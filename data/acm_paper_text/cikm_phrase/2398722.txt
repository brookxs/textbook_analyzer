pravda-live : interactive-knowledge harvesting acquiring high-quality (temporal) facts for knowledge-bases is a labor-intensive process . although there has been recent progress in the area of semi-supervised fact-extraction , these approaches still have limitations , including a restricted corpus , a fixed set of relations to be extracted or a lack of assessment capabilities . in this paper we introduce pravda-live , a framework that overcomes these limitations and supports the entire pipeline of interactive-knowledge harvesting . to this end , our demo exhibits fact-extraction from ad-hoc corpus-creation , via relation specification , labeling and assessment all the way to ready-to-use rdf exports .
