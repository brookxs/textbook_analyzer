light-weight xpath-processing of xml-stream with deterministic automata several applications based on xml stream-processing have recently emerged , such as those for air-traffic-control and the selective-dissemination-of-information (sdi) . their common need is to process a large number of xpath expressions in continuous xml-streams at high throughput.this paper proposes four techniques for xpath expression-processing based on deterministic-finite-automata (dfa) for two purposes : to improve the memory-usage efficiency of the automata and to support the processing of branching xpath expressions . the first technique , called n-dfa , clusters the given xpath expressions into n clusters to reduce the number of dfa states . the second , called shared nfa state table , lets the non-deterministic finite automata (nfa) state-set be shared among the dfa states . our experiments show that memory-usage in an 8-dfa can , with the shared nfa state table , be reduced to 1/40th that of the original 1-dfa . the optimized nfa conversion and general xpath expression-processing algorithm techniques contribute to the processing of branching xpath expressions efficiently ; overall performance is better than is possible with earlier approaches .
