stereotrust : a group based personalized trust-model trust plays important roles in diverse decentralized environments , including our society at large . computational-trust models help to , for instance , guide users ' judgements in online-auction sites about other users ; or determine quality of contributions in web-2.0 sites . most of the existing trust-models , however , require historical-information about past behavior of a specific agent being evaluated - information that is not always available . in contrast , in real life interactions among users , in order to make the first guess about the trustworthiness of a stranger , we commonly use our `` instinct '' - essentially stereotypes developed from our past interactions with `` similar '' people . we propose stereotrust , a computational-trust model inspired by real life stereotypes . a user forms stereotypes using her previous transactions with other agents . a stereotype contains certain features of agents and an expected outcome of the transaction . these features can be taken from agents ' profile-information , or agents ' observed behavior in the system . when facing a stranger , the stereotypes matching stranger 's profile are aggregated to derive his expected trust . additionally , when some information about stranger 's previous transactions is available , stereotrust uses it to refine the stereotype matching . according to our experiments , stereotrust compares favorably with existing trust-models that use different kind of information and more complete historical-information . moreover , because evaluation is done according to user 's personal stereotypes , the system is completely distributed and the result obtained is personalized . stereotrust can be used as a complimentary mechanism to provide the initial-trust value for a stranger , especially when there is no trusted , common third parties .
