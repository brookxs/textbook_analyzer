wikilabel : an encyclopedic approach to labeling documents en masse this paper presents a particular approach to collective labeling of multiple-documents , which works by associating the documents with wikipedia pages and labeling them with headings the pages carry . the approach has an obvious advantage over past approaches in that it is able to produce fluent labels , as they are hand-written by human editors . we carried out some experiments on the tdt5 dataset , which found that the approach works rather robustly for an arbitrary set of documents in the news domain . comparisons were made with some baselines , including the-state-of-the-art , with results strongly in favor of our approach .
