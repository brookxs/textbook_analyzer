real-time bid-optimization for group-buying ads group-buying ads seeking a minimum number of customers before the deal expiry are increasingly used by the daily-deal providers . unlike the traditional web ads , the advertiser 's profits for group-buying ads depends on the time to expiry and additional customers needed to satisfy the minimum group-size . since both these quantities are time-dependent , optimal bid amounts to maximize profits change with every impression . consequently , traditional static bidding-strategies are far from optimal . instead , bid values need to be optimized in real-time to maximize expected bidder profits . this online-optimization of deal profits is made possible by the advent of ad-exchanges offering real-time (spot) bidding . to this end , we propose a real-time-bidding strategy for group-buying deals based on the online optimization of the bid values . we derive the expected bidder profit of deals as a function of the bid amounts , and dynamically vary bids to maximize profits . further , to satisfy time-constraints of the online bidding , we present methods of minimizing computation timings . we evaluate the proposed bidding on a multi-million click-stream of 935 ads . the method shows significant profit improvement over the existing strategies .
