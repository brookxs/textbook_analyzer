max-margin-learning on domain-independent web-information-extraction domain-independent web-information-extraction can be addressed as a structured-prediction problem where we learn a mapping-function from an input web-page to the structured and interdependent output variables , labeling each block on the page . in this paper , built upon an html-parser of internet-explorer that parses and renders a web-page based on html tags and visual appearance , we propose a max-margin-learning approach for web-information-extraction . specifically , the output of the parser is a vision tree , which is similar to a dom-tree but with visual-information , i.e. , how each node is displayed . based on this hierarchical-structure , we develop a max-margin-learning method for labeling each of its nodes . due to the rich connections between blocks on the web-page , we further introduce edges that connect spatially adjacent nodes on the vision tree , complicating the problem into a cyclic graph-labeling task . a max-margin-learning method on cyclic graphs is developed for this problem , where loopy-belief-propagation is used for approximate-inference . experimental-results on web-data-extraction show the feasibility and promise of our approach .
