exploiting internal and external semantics for the clustering of short-texts using world-knowledge clustering of short-texts , such as snippets , presents great challenges in existing aggregated-search techniques due to the problem of data-sparseness and the complex semantics of natural-language . as short-texts do not provide sufficient term occurring information , traditional text-representation methods , such as `` bag-of-words '' model , have several limitations when directly applied to short-texts tasks . in this paper , we propose a novel framework to improve the performance of short-texts clustering by exploiting the internal semantics from original text and external concepts from world-knowledge . the proposed method employs a hierarchical three-level structure to tackle the data-sparsity problem of original short-texts and reconstruct the corresponding feature-space with the integration of multiple semantic-knowledge-bases -- wikipedia and wordnet . empirical-evaluation with reuters and real web dataset demonstrates that our approach is able to achieve significant improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art methods .
