hybrid-models for future event prediction we present a hybrid-method to turn off-the-shelf information-retrieval (ir) systems into future event predictors . given a query , a time-series model is trained on the publication dates of the retrieved documents to capture trends and periodicity of the associated events . the periodicity of historic data is used to estimate a probabilistic-model to predict future bursts . finally , a hybrid-model is obtained by intertwining the probabilistic and the time-series model . our empirical-results on the new york times corpus show that autocorrelation functions of time-series suffice to classify queries accurately and that our hybrid-models lead to more accurate future event predictions than baseline competitors .
