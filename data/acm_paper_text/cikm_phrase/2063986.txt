folksonomy-based term-extraction for word-cloud generation in this work we study the task of term-extraction for word-cloud generation . we present a folksonomy-based term-extraction method , called tag-boost , which boosts terms that are frequently used by the public to tag content . our experiments with tag-boost-based term-extraction over different domains demonstrate tremendous improvement in word-cloud quality , as reflected by the agreement between extracted terms and manually assigned tags of the testing items . additionally , we show that tag-boost can be effectively applied even in non-tagged domains , by using an external rich folksonomy borrowed from a well-tagged domain .
