on the connections between explicit-semantic-analysis and latent-semantic-analysis semantic-analysis tries to solve problems arising from polysemy and synonymy that are abundant in natural-languages . recently , gabrilovich and markovitch propose the explicit-semantic-analysis (esa) technique , which complements the well-known latent-semantic-analysis (lsa) technique . in this paper , we show that the two techniques are not as distinct as their names suggest ; instead , we find that esa is equivalent to a lsa variant , and this equivalence generalizes to all kernel-methods using kernels arising from the canonical dot-product . effectively , this result guarantees that esa would not outperform the peak efficacy of lsa for any applications using the above kernel-methods . in short , this paper for the first time establishes the connections between esa and lsa , quantifies their relative efficacy , and generalizes the result to a big category of kernel-methods .
