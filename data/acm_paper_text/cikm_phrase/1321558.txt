an automatic approach to construct domain-specific web-portals we describe the architecture of an automatic domain-specific web-portal construction system . the system has three major components : i) a focused-crawler that collects the domain-specific pages on the web , ii) an information-extraction-engine that extracts useful fields from these web-pages , and iii) a query-engine that allows both typical keyword_based queries on the pages and advanced queries on the extracted data fields . we present a prototype-system that works for the course homepages domain on the web . a user-study with the prototype-system shows that our approach produces high quality results and achieves better precision figures than the typical keyword_based search .
