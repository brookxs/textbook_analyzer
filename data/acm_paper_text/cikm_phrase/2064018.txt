interactive-reasoning in uncertain-rdf knowledge-bases recent advances in web-based information extraction have allowed for the automatic-construction of large , semantic-knowledge-bases , which are typically captured in rdf format . the very nature of the applied extraction techniques however entails that the resulting rdf knowledge-bases may face a significant amount of incorrect , incomplete , or even inconsistent (i.e. , uncertain) factual-knowledge , which makes query-answering over this kind of data a challenge . our reasoner , coined urdf , supports sparql queries along with rule-based , first-order-predicate-logic to infer new facts and to resolve data-uncertainty over millions of rdf triplets directly at query time . we demonstrate a fully interactive-reasoning engine , combining a java-based reasoning backend and a flash-based visualization frontend in a dynamic client-server-architecture . our visualization frontend provides interactive-access to the reasoning backend , including tasks like exploring the knowledge-base , rule-based and statistical-reasoning , faceted-browsing of large query-graphs , and explaining answers through lineage .
