an algorithm to determine peer-reviewers the peer-review-process is the most widely accepted certification mechanism for officially accepting the written results of researchers within the scientific community . an essential component of peer-review is the identification of competent referees to review a submitted manuscript . this article presents an algorithm to automatically determine the most appropriate reviewers for a manuscript by way of a co-authorship-network data-structure and a relative-rank particle-swarm algorithm . this approach is novel in that it is not limited to a pre-selected set of referees , is computationally efficient , requires no human-intervention , and , in some instances , can automatically identify conflict-of-interest situations . a useful application of this algorithm would be to open commentary peer-review systems because it provides a weighting for each referee with respects to their expertise in the domain of a manuscript . the algorithm is validated using referee bid data from the 2005 joint conference on digital-libraries .
