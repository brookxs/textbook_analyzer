dynamic-query intent mining from a search-log stream it has long been recognized that search queries are often broad and ambiguous . even when submitting the same query , different users may have different search-intents . moreover , the intents are dynamically evolving . some intents are constantly popular with users , others are more bursty . we propose a method for mining dynamic-query intents from search-query-logs . by regarding the query-logs as a data-stream , we identify constant intents while quickly capturing new bursty intents . to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of our method , we conducted experiments using 50 topics from the ntcir intent-9 data and additional five popular topics , all supplemented with six-month query-logs from a commercial-search-engine . our results show that our method can accurately capture new intents with short response-time .
