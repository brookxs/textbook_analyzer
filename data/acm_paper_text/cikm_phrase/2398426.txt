automated feature-weighting in naive-bayes for high-dimensional-data classification naive-bayes (nb for short) is one of the popular methods for supervised-classification in a knowledge-management-system . currently , in many real-world-applications , high-dimensional-data pose a major challenge to conventional nb classifiers , due to noisy or redundant features and local relevance of these features to classes . in this paper , an automated feature-weighting solution is proposed to result in a nb method effective in dealing with high-dimensional-data . we first propose a locally weighted probability-model , for bayesian-modeling in high-dimensional spaces , to implement a soft-feature-selection scheme . then we propose an optimization-algorithm to find the weights in linear-time complexity , based on the logitnormal priori distribution and the maximum a posteriori principle . experimental-studies show the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed model for high-dimensional-data classification .
