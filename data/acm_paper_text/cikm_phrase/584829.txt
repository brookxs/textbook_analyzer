topic-based document-segmentation with probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis this paper presents a new method for topic-based document-segmentation , i.e. , the identification of boundaries between parts of a document that bear on different topics . the method combines the use of the probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis (plsa) model with the method of selecting segmentation points based on the similarity values between pairs of adjacent blocks . the use of plsa allows for a better representation of sparse information in a text block , such as a sentence or a sequence of sentences . furthermore , segmentation performance is improved by combining different instantiations of the same model , either using different random initializations or different numbers of latent classes . results on commonly available data-sets are significantly better than those of other state-of-the-art systems .
