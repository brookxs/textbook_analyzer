queueing-analysis of relational-operators for continuous-data streams currently , stream-data processing is an active area of research , which includes everything from algorithms and architectures for stream-processing to modelling , and analysis of various components of a stream-processing-system . in this paper , we present an analysis of relational-operators used for stream-processing using queueing-theory and study behaviors of streaming-data in a query-processing system . our approach enables us to compute the fundamental performance metrics of relational-operators -- select , project , and join over data-streams . furthermore , this approach establishes a way to find the probability distribution-functions of both the number of tuples and the waiting-time of tuples in the system . finally , we designed and implemented a number of experiments to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our analysis .
