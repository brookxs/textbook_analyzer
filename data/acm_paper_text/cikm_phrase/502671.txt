irregularity in multi-dimensional space-filling-curves with applications in multimedia-databases a space-filling curve is a way of mapping the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space . it acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (or pixel) in the n - dimensional space so that every cell is visited at least once . thus , a space-filling curve imposes a linear order of the cells in the n - dimensional space . there are numerous kinds of space-filling-curves . the difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to the one-dimensional space . selecting the appropriate curve for any application requires a brief knowledge of the mapping-scheme provided by each space-filling curve . irregularity is proposed as a quantitative-measure of the quality of the mapping of the space-filling curve . closed formulas are developed to compute the irregularity for any general dimension-d with n points in each dimension for different space-filling curves.a comparative-study of different space-filling-curves with respect to irregularity is conducted and results are presented and discussed . the applicability of this research is the area of multimedia-databases is illustrated with a discussion of the problems that arise .
