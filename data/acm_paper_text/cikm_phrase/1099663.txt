on off-topic access detection in information-systems we focus on detecting insider access violations to off-topic documents . previously , we utilized information-retrieval-techniques , e.g. , clustering and relevance-feedback , to warn of potential misuse . for the relevance-feedback approach , we minimize the indicative features needed for detection using data mining techniques . we show that the derived reduced feature subset achieves equivalent performance to that of the previously derived full set-of-features .
