label constrained shortest-path estimation shortest-path querying is a fundamental graph problem which is computationally quite challenging when operating over massive scale graphs . recent results have addressed the problem of computing either exact or good approximate shortest path distances efficiently . some of these techniques also return the path corresponding to the estimated shortest-path distance fast . however , none of these techniques work very well when we have additional constraints on the labels associated with edges that constitute the path . in this paper , we develop skit index-structure , which supports a wide range of label constraints on paths , and returns an accurate estimation of the shortest-path that satisfies the constraints . we conduct experiments over graphs such as social-networks , and knowledge graphs that contain millions of nodes/edges , and show that skit index is fast , accurate in the estimated distance and has a high recall for paths that satisfy the constraints .
