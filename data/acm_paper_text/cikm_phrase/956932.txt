ontologies for semantically interoperable-systems in this paper , we discuss the use of ontologies for semantic-interoperability and integration . we argue that information-technology has evolved into a world of largely loosely-coupled-systems and as such , needs increasingly more explicit , machine-interpretable semantics . ontologies in the form of logical-domain theories and their knowledge-bases offer the richest representations of machine-interpretable semantics for systems and databases in the loosely coupled world , thus ensuring greater semantic-interoperability and integration . finally , we discuss how ontologies support semantic-interoperability in the real , commercial and governmental world .
