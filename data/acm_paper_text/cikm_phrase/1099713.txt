determining the semantic orientation of terms through gloss classification sentiment-classification is a recent subdiscipline of text-classification which is concerned not with the topic a document is about , but with the opinion it expresses . it has a rich set of applications , ranging from tracking users ' opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online-forums , to customer-relationship-management . functional to the extraction of opinions from text is the determination of the orientation of `` subjective '' terms contained in text , i.e. the determination of whether a term that carries opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation . in this paper we present a new method for determining the orientation of subjective terms . the method is based on the quantitative-analysis of the glosses of such terms , i.e. the definitions that these terms are given in on-line dictionaries , and on the use of the resulting term representations for semi-supervised term-classification . the method we present outperforms all known methods when tested on the recognized standard-benchmarks for this task .
