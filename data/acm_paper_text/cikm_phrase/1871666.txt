structural-annotation of search queries using pseudo-relevance-feedback marking up queries with annotations such as part-of-speech-tags , capitalization , and segmentation , is an important part of many approaches to query-processing and understanding . due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure , search queries pose a challenge to existing annotation-tools that are commonly trained on full-length documents . to address this challenge , we view the query as an explicit representation of a latent information-need , which allows us to use pseudo-relevance-feedback , and to leverage additional-information from the document corpus , in order to improve the quality of query annotation .
