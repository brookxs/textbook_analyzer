answering label-constraint-reachability in large-graphs in this paper , we study a variant of reachability-queries , called label-constraint-reachability (lcr) queries , specifically , given a label set s and two vertices u1 and u2 in a large directed-graph g , we verify whether there exists a path from u1 to u2 under label constraint s. like traditional reachability-queries , lcr queries are very useful , such as pathway finding in biological-networks , inferring over rdf (resource-description f ramework) graphs , relationship finding in social-networks . however , lcr queries are much more complicated than their traditional counterpart.several techniques are proposed in this paper to minimize the search-space in computing path-label transitive-closure . furthermore , we demonstrate the superiority of our method by extensive experiments .
