representation of medical guidelines using a classification-based system medical guidelines play an increasing role in selecting diagnostic and therapeutic steps under the aspects of effectiveness , invasiveness , and costs . to work directly on patient-data already available in electronic-form , they should be integrated into a medical-information-system . in order to develop a medical guideline module (mgm) managing and applying guidelines to patients , a knowledge level representation of guidelines is necessary which reflects the structure of medical-knowledge and matches medical-processes . furthermore , a direct transformation to the symbol level is needed . we use a nested , frame-like structure on the knowledge level and show that a classification-based knowledge-representation-system (cbkrs) is principally well suited for the symbol level . to facilitate the usage and to be independent of a particular cbkrs , we introduce an intermediate level called intelligent object system (ios) . it is developed by augmenting a simple data model for describing complex-objects with prototypes and implications as a means to classify objects and to draw inferences based on this classification . finally , the transformation of guidelines to prototypes and implications is described .
