what is happening right now ... that interests me ? : online topic-discovery and recommendation in twitter users engaged in the social-web increasingly rely upon continuous streams of twitter-messages (tweets) for real-time access-to-information and fresh knowledge about current affairs . however , given the deluge of tweets , it is a challenge for individuals to find relevant and appropriately ranked information . we propose to address this knowledge-management problem by going beyond the general perspective of information-finding in twitter , that asks : `` what is happening right now ? '' , towards an individual user-perspective , and ask : `` what is interesting to me right now ? '' in this paper , we consider collaborative-filtering as an online ranking problem and present rmfo , a method that creates , in real-time , user-specific rankings for a set of tweets based on individual preferences that are inferred from the user 's past system interactions . experiments on the 476 million twitter tweets dataset show that our online approach largely outperforms recommendations based on twitter 's global trend and weighted regularized matrix-factorization (wrmf) , a highly competitive state-of-the-art collaborative-filtering technique , demonstrating the efficacy of our approach .
