efficient and robust feature-extraction and pattern-matching of time-series by a lattice-structure the efficiency of searching scaling-invariant and shifting-invariant shapes in a set of massive time-series-data can be improved if searching is performed on an approximated sequence which involves less data but contains all the significant features . however , commonly used smoothing-techniques , such as moving averages and best-fitting polylines , usually miss important peaks and troughs and deform the time-series . in addition , these techniques are not robust , as they often requires users to supply a set of smoothing parameters which has direct effect on the resultant approximation pattern . to address these problems , an algorithm to construct a lattice-structure as an underlying framework for pattern-matching is proposed in this paper . as inputs , the algorithm takes a time-series and users ' requirements of level-of-detail . the algorithm then identifies all the important peaks and troughs (known as controlm points) in the time-series and classifies the points into appropriate layers of the lattice-structure . the control-points in each layer of the structure form an approximation pattern an yet preserve the overall shape of the original series with approximation error lies within certain bound . the lower the layer , the more precise the approximation pattern is . putting in another way , the algorithm takes different levels of data smoothing into account . also , the lattice-structure can be indexed to further improve the performance of pattern-matching .
