p-rank : a comprehensive structural-similarity measure over information-networks with the ubiquity of information-networks and their broad applications , the issue of similarity-computation between entities of an information-network arises and draws extensive research interests . however , to effectively and comprehensively measure '' how similar two entities are within an information-network '' is nontrivial , and the problem becomes even more challenging when the information-network to be examined is massive and diverse . in this paper , we propose a new similarity-measure , p-rank (p enetrating r ank) , toward effectively computing the structural similarities of entities in real information-networks . p-rank enriches the well-known similarity-measure , simrank , by jointly encoding both in - and out-link relationships into structural-similarity computation . p-rank is proven to be a unified structural-similarity framework , under which all state-of-the-art similarity-measures , including cocitation , coupling , amsler and simrank , are just its special cases . based on its recursive nature of p-rank , we propose a fixed-point algorithm to reinforce structural-similarity of vertex pairs beyond the localized neighborhood scope toward the entire information-network . our experimental-studies demonstrate the power of p-rank as an effective similarity-measure in different information-networks . meanwhile , under the same time/space complexity , p-rank outperforms simrank as a comprehensive and more meaningful structural-similarity measure , especially in large real information-networks .
