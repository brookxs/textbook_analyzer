unapparent information-revelation : a concept chain graph approach information generated by multiple authors working independently at different times when analyzed synergistically reveals more information than apparent . for example , a traditional search for connections between the trucking industry and iraqi banks may not produce any documents mentioning both . however , a search that follows trails of associations across documents may suggest a connection between an auto parts manufacturer who exports to iraq , and an iraqi bank providing loans to buy cars . the work described here extends link-analysis based on named-entities and labeled relationships to general concepts and unnamed associations . unapparent information-revelation involves finding chains connecting concepts across documents : it uses a new representation-formalism called concept chain graphs .
