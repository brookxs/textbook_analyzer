learning-to-rank with a novel kernel perceptron method while conventional ranking-algorithms , such as the pagerank , rely on the web-structure to decide the relevancy of a web-page , learning-to-rank seeks a function capable of ordering a set of instances using a supervised-learning-approach . learning-to-rank has gained increasing popularity in information-retrieval and machine-learning communities . in this paper , we propose a novel nonlinear perceptron method for rank learning . the proposed method is an online-algorithm and simple to implement . it introduces a kernel-function to map the original feature-space into a nonlinear-space and employs a perceptron method to minimize the ranking error by avoiding converging to a solution near the decision-boundary and alleviating the effect of outliers in the training-dataset . furthermore , unlike existing approaches such as ranksvm and rankboost , the proposed method is scalable to large-datasets for online-learning . experimental-results on benchmark-corpora show that our approach is more efficient and achieves higher or comparable accuracies in instance ranking than state-of-the-art methods such as frank , ranksvm and rankboost .
