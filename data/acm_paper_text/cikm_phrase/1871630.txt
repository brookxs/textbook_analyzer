exploiting site-level-information to improve web-search-ranking web-search-results has long evolved beyond simple bag-of-words retrieval-models . modern search-engines routinely employ machine-learning ranking that relies on exogenous relevance signals . yet the majority of current methods still evaluate each web-page out of context . in this work , we introduce a novel source of relevance information for web-search by evaluating each page in the context of its host web-site . for this purpose , we devise two strategies for compactly representing entire web-sites . we formalize our approach by building two indices , a traditional page index and a new site index , where each `` document '' represents the an entire web-site . at runtime , a query is first executed against both indices , and then the final page score for a given query is produced by combining the scores of the page and its site . experimental-results carried out on a large-scale web search test-collection from a major commercial-search-engine confirm the proposed approach leads to consistent and significant improvements in retrieval-effectiveness .
