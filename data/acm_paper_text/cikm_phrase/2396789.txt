content-based crowd retrieval on the real-time-web in this paper , we propose and evaluate a novel content-driven crowd discovery algorithm that can efficiently identify newly-formed communities of users from the real-time-web . short-lived crowds reflect the real-time interests of their constituents and provide a foundation for user-focused web-monitoring . three of the salient-features of the algorithm are its : (i) prefix-tree based locality-sensitive-hashing approach for discovering crowds from high-volume rapidly-evolving social-media ; (ii) efficient user-profile updating for incorporating new-user activities and fading older ones ; and (iii) key dimension identification , so that crowd detection can be focused on the most active portions of the real-time-web . through extensive experimental-study , we find significantly more efficient crowd discovery as compared to both a k-means clustering-based approach and a mapreduce-based implementation , while maintaining high-quality crowds as compared to an offline approach . additionally , we find that expert crowds tend to be `` stickier '' and last longer in comparison to crowds of typical users .
