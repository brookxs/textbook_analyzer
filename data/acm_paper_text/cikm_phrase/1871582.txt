clickthrough-based translation-models for web-search : from word models to phrase models web-search is challenging partly due to the fact that search queries and web-documents use different language styles and vocabularies . this paper provides a quantitative-analysis of the language discrepancy issue , and explores the use of clickthrough-data to bridge documents and queries . we assume that a query is parallel to the titles of documents clicked on for that query . two translation-models are trained and integrated into retrieval-models : a word-based-translation-model that learns the translation-probability between single words , and a phrase-based-translation-model that learns the translation-probability between multi-term phrases . experiments are carried out on a real-world data-set . the results show that the retrieval-systems that use the translation-models outperform significantly the systems that do not . the paper also demonstrates that standard statistical-machine-translation techniques such as word-alignment , bilingual-phrase extraction , and phrase-based-decoding , can be adapted for building a better web-document retrieval-system .
