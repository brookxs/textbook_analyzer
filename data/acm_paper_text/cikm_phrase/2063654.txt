towards a framework for attribute-retrieval in this paper , we propose an attribute-retrieval approach which extracts and ranks attributes from html tables . we distinguish between class attribute retrieval and instance attribute-retrieval . on one hand , given an instance (e.g. university of strathclyde) we retrieve from the-web its attributes (e.g. principal , location , number of students) . on the other hand , given a class (e.g. universities) represented by a set of instances , we retrieve common attributes of its instances . furthermore , we show we can reinforce instance attribute-retrieval if similar instances are available . our approach uses html tables which are probably the largest source for attribute-retrieval . three recall oriented-filters are applied over tables to check the following three properties : (i) is the table relational , (ii) has the table a header , and (iii) the conformity of its attributes and values . candidate attributes are extracted from tables and ranked with a combination of relevance features . our approach is shown to have a high recall and a reasonable precision . moreover , it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques .
