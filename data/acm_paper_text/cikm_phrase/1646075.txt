a unified relevance-model for opinion-retrieval representing the information-need is the greatest challenge for opinion-retrieval . typical queries for opinion-retrieval are composed of either just content-words , or content-words with a small number of cue `` opinion '' words . both are inadequate for retrieving opinionated documents . in this paper , we develop a general formal-framework -- the opinion-relevance-model -- to represent an information-need for opinion-retrieval . we explore a series of methods to automatically identify the most appropriate opinion-words for query-expansion , including using query independent sentiment resources . we also propose a relevance feedback-based approach to extract opinion-words . both query-independent and query-dependent methods can also be integrated into a more effective mixture relevance-model . finally , opinion-retrieval experiments are presented for the blog06 and coae08 text-collections . the results show that , significant improvements can always be obtained by this opinion-relevance-model whether sentiment resources are available or not .
