a structured-approach to query-recommendation with social-annotation-data query-recommendation has been recognized as an important mean to help users search and also improve the usability of search-engines . existing approaches mainly focus on helping users refine their search queries and the recommendations typically stick to users ' search-intent , named search-interests in this paper . however , users may also have some vague or delitescent interests which they are unaware of until they are faced with one , named exploratory-interests . these interests may be provoked within a search-session when users read a web-page from search-results or even follow links on the page . by considering exploratory-interests in query-recommendation , we attract more user-clicks on recommendations . this type of query-recommendation has not been explicitly addressed in previous work . in this paper , we propose to recommend queries in a structured way for better satisfying both search and exploratory-interests of users . specifically , we construct a query relation graph from query-logs and social-annotation-data which capture two types of interests respectively . based on the query relation graph , we employ hitting-time to rank possible recommendations , leverage a modularity_based approach to group top recommendations into clusters , and label each cluster with social-tags . empirical experimental-results indicate that our structured-approach to query-recommendation with social-annotation-data can better satisfy users ' interests and significantly enhance users ' click-behavior on recommendations .
