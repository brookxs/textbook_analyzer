searching consumer image collections using web-based concept-expansion as consumers accumulate more and more personal imagery , searching for specific images has become increasingly difficult . consumers typically provide little or no annotations , and automated classifiers and concept-tagging tools are limited in their scope and vocabulary . this work addresses this sparsity of semantic-information by leveraging domain-specific-information provided by online photo-sharing communities . such information enables improved-search by allowing user-provided search-terms to be expanded into a set of semantically related concepts , using relevant semantic-relationships provided by millions of users . our system first extracts metadata using a modest number of image and event-based semantic classifiers , as well as any meaningful file or folder names . when users pose text-based queries , our system retrieves images from their personal image collections by leveraging flickr 's tag dataset for concept-expansion . this approach enables users to search their collections without having to manually annotate their pictures . we compare the retrieval-performance of using a flickr-based concept expander with the performance obtained without concept-expansion and with using a wordnet-based concept expander . the results demonstrate that common-sense-knowledge gleaned from online-photo-sharing communities can enable meaningful image-search on consumer image collections , searches that would be impossible using only the available image-metadata .
