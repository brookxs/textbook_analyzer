schema-extraction understanding the schema of a complex database is a crucial step in exploratory-data-analysis . however , gaining such an understanding is challenging for new-users for many reasons . first , complex databases often have thousands of inter-linked tables , with little indication of the important tables or the main concepts in the database-schema . second , schemas can be inaccurate , e.g. , some foreign/primary key relationships are not known to designers but are inherent in the data , while others become invalid due to data inconsistencies . in this talk , we present an approach to effectively address these challenges and automatically extract an understandable schema from a complex database . the first step in our approach is a robust algorithm to discover foreign/primary key relationships between tables . we present a general rule , termed randomness , that subsumes a variety of other rules proposed in previous work , and develop efficient-approximation-algorithms for evaluating randomness , using only two passes over the data . the second step is a principled approach to summarize the schema consisting of tables linked using foreign/primary keys , so that a user can easily identify the main concepts and important tables . we present an information-theoretic approach to identify important tables , and an intuitive notion of table similarity that can be used to cluster tables into the main concepts of the schema . we validate our approach using real and synthetic datasets . this is based on joint work [1 , 2] with marios hadjieleftheriou , beng chin ooi , cecilia m. procopiuc , xiaoyan yang and meihui zhang .
