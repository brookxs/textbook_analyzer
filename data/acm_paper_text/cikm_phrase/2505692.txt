building optimal information-systems automatically : configuration-space exploration for biomedical-information systems-software frameworks which support integration and scaling of text-analysis algorithms make it possible to build complex , high-performance information-systems for information-extraction , information-retrieval , and question-answering ; ibm 's watson is a prominent example . as the complexity and scaling of information-systems become ever greater , it is much more challenging to effectively and efficiently determine which toolkits , algorithms , knowledge-bases or other resources should be integrated into an information-system in order to achieve a desired or optimal level of performance on a given task . this paper presents a formal-representation of the space of possible system configurations , given a set of information-processing components and their parameters (configuration-space) and discusses algorithmic approaches to determine the optimal configuration within a given configuration-space (configuration-space exploration or cse) . we introduce the cse framework , an extension to the uima-framework which provides a general distributed solution for building and exploring configuration-spaces for information-systems . the cse framework was used to implement biomedical-information systems in case-studies involving over a trillion different configuration combinations of components and parameter-values operating on question-answering tasks from the trec-genomics . the framework automatically and efficiently evaluated different system configurations , and identified configurations that achieved better results than prior published results .
