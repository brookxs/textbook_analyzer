joint topic-modeling for event-summarization across news and social-media streams social-media streams such as twitter are regarded as faster first-hand sources-of-information generated by massive users . the content diffused through this channel , although noisy , provides important complement and sometimes even a substitute to the traditional news-media reporting . in this paper , we propose a novel unsupervised-approach based on topic-modeling to summarize trending subjects by jointly discovering the representative and complementary information from news and tweets . our method captures the content that enriches the subject matter by reinforcing the identification of complementary sentence-tweet pairs . to valuate the complementarity of a pair , we leverage topic-modeling formalism by combining a two-dimensional topic-aspect model and a cross-collection approach in the multi-document-summarization literature . the final summaries are generated by co-ranking the news sentences and tweets in both sides simultaneously . experiments give promising results as compared to state-of-the-art baselines .
