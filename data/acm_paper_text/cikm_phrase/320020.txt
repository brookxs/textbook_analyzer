updates and view-maintenance in soft-real-time database-systems a database-system contains base data items which record and model a physical , real-world environment . for better decision-support , base data items are summarized and correlated to derive views . these base data and views are accessed by application transactions to generate the ultimate actions taken by the system . as the environment changes , updates are applied to the base data , which subsequently trigger view recomputations . there are thus three types of activities : base data-update , view recomputation , and transaction-execution . in a real-time-system , two timing constrains need to be enforced . we require transactions meet their deadlines (transaction timeliness) and read fresh data (data timeliness) . in this paper we define the concept of absolute and relative temporal-consistency from the perspective of transactions . we address the important issue of transaction-scheduling among the three types of activities such that the two timing-requirements can be met . we also discuss how a real-time-database system should be designed to enforce different levels of temporal-consistency .
