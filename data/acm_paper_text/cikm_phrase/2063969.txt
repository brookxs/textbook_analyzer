integrating and querying web-databases and documents there exist many interrelated information-sources on the internet that can be categorized into structured (database) and semistructured (documents) . a key challenge is to integrate , query and analyze such heterogeneous collections of information . in this paper , we defend the idea of building web metadata repositories using relational-databases as the main source and central data-management technology of structured-data , enriched by the semistructured-data surrounding it . our proposal rests on the assumption that heterogeneous relational-databases can be integrated (i.e. entity-resolution is assumed to work well) and thus can serve as references for external data . that is , we tackle the problem of integrating information in the deep-web , departing from databases . we discuss a prototype-system that can integrate and query metadata and related documents , based on relational-database-technology . metadata includes database er-model elements like database name , table , and column (entity , attribute) . web-document data include files , documents and web-pages . links between metadata and external documents are built with sql queries . once databases and documents are linked , they are managed and queried with sql . we discuss an interesting scientific-application of our solution with a water pollution database .
