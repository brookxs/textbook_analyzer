processing the signature-quadratic-form-distance on many-core gpu architectures the signature-quadratic-form-distance on feature-signatures represents a flexible distance-based similarity-model for effective content-based-multimedia-retrieval . although metric-indexing approaches are able to speed up query-processing by two orders of magnitude , their applicability to large-scale multimedia databases containing billions of images is still a challenging issue . in this paper , we propose the utilization of gpus for efficient-query-processing with the signature-quadratic-form-distance . we show how to process multiple distance computations in parallel and demonstrate efficient-query-processing by comparing many-core gpu with multi-core-cpu implementations .
