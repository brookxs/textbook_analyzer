survival-analysis for freshness in microblogging search freshness of information in real-time-search is central in social-networks , news , blogs and micro-blogs . nevertheless , there is not a clear experimental-evidence that shows what principled approach effectively combines time and content . we introduce a novel approach to model freshness using a survival-analysis of relevance over time . in such models , freshness is measured by the tail-probability of relevance over time . we also assume that the probability distributions for freshness are heavy-tailed . the heavy-tailed models of freshness are shown to be highly effective on the micro-blogging test-collection of trec 2011 . the improvements over the state-of-the-art time-based models are statistically significant or moderately significant .
