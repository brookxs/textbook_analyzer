learning relatedness measures for entity-linking entity-linking is the task of detecting , in text-documents , relevant mentions to entities of a given knowledge-base . to this end , entity-linking algorithms use several signals and features extracted from the input-text or from the knowledge-base . the most important of such features is entity relatedness . indeed , we argue that these algorithms benefit from maximizing the relatedness among the relevant entities selected for annotation , since this minimizes errors in disambiguating entity-linking . the definition of an effective relatedness function is thus a crucial point in any entity-linking algorithm . in this paper we address the problem of learning high quality entity relatedness functions . first , we formalize the problem of learning entity relatedness as a learning-to-rank problem . we propose a methodology to create reference datasets on the basis of manually annotated data . finally , we show that our machine-learned entity relatedness function performs better than other relatedness functions previously proposed , and , more importantly , improves the overall performance of different state-of-the-art entity-linking algorithms .
