exploration-exploitation tradeoff in interactive-relevance-feedback we study an interesting optimization-problem in interactive-feedback that aims at optimizing the tradeoff between presenting search-results with the highest immediate utility to a user (but not necessarily most useful for collecting feedback information) and presenting search-results with the best potential for collecting useful feedback information (but not necessarily the most useful documents from a user 's perspective) . optimizing such an exploration-exploitation tradeoff is key to the optimization of the overall utility of relevance-feedback to a user in the entire session of relevance-feedback . we frame this tradeoff as a problem of optimizing the diversification of search-results . we propose a machine-learning-approach to adaptively optimizing the diversification of search-results for each query so as to optimize the overall utility in an entire session . experiment results show that the proposed learning-approach can effectively optimize the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and outperforms the traditional relevance-feedback approach which only does exploitation without exploration .
