the role of documents vs. queries in extracting class-attributes from text challenging the implicit reliance on document-collections , this paper discusses the pros-and-cons of using query-logs rather than document-collections , as self-contained sources of data in textual-information extraction . the differences are quantified as part of a large-scale-study on extracting prominent attributes or quantifiable properties of classes (e.g. , top speed , price and fuel-consumption for carmodel) from unstructured-text . in a head-to-head qualitative-comparison , a lightweight extraction-method produces class-attributes that are 45 \ % more accurate on average , when acquired from query-logs rather than web-documents .
