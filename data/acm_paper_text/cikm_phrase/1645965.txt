characterizing commercial-intent understanding the intent underlying user 's queries may help personalize search-results and therefore improve user-satisfaction . we develop a methodology for using the content of search-engine result pages (serps) along with the information obtained from query strings to study characteristics of query-intent , with a particular focus on sponsored-search . this work represents an initial step towards the development and evaluation of an ontology for commercial search , considering queries that reference specific products , brands and retailers . the characteristics of query categories are studied with respect to aggregated user 's clickthrough behavior on advertising links . we present a model for clickthrough behavior that considers the influence of such factors as the location of ads and the rank of ads , along with query category . we evaluate our work using a large-corpus of clickthrough-data obtained from a major commercial-search-engine . our findings suggest that query_based features , along with the content of serps , are effective in detecting query-intent . the clickthrough behavior is found to be consistent with the classification for the general categories of query-intent , while for product , brand and retailer categories , all is true to a lesser extent .
