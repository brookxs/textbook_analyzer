anomaly-free incremental output in stream-processing continuous-queries enable alerts , predictions , and early-warning in various domains such as health-care , business-process-monitoring , financial-applications , and environment-protection . currently , the consistency of the result can not be assessed by the application , since only the query-processor has enough internal information to determine when the output has reached a consistent state . to our knowledge , this is the first paper that addresses the problem of consistency under the assumptions and-constraints of a continuous-query model . in addition to defining an appropriate consistency notion , we propose techniques for guaranteeing consistency . we implemented the proposed techniques in our existing stream engine , and we report on the characteristics of the observed performance . as we show , these methods are practical as they impose only a small overhead on the system .
