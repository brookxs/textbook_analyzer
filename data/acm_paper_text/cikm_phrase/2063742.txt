exploiting longer cycles for link-prediction in signed-networks we consider the problem of link-prediction in signed-networks . such networks arise on the web in a variety of ways when users can implicitly or explicitly tag their relationship with other users as positive or negative . the signed links thus created reflect social attitudes of the users towards each other in terms of friendship or trust . our first contribution is to show how any quantitative-measure of social imbalance in a network can be used to derive a link-prediction algorithm . our framework allows us to reinterpret some existing algorithms as well as derive new ones . second , we extend the approach of leskovec et al. (2010) by presenting a supervised-machine-learning_based link-prediction method that uses features derived from longer cycles in the network . the supervised-method outperforms all previous approaches on 3 networks drawn from sources such as epinions , slashdot and wikipedia . the supervised approach easily scales to these networks , the largest of which has 132k nodes and 841k edges . most real-world networks have an overwhelmingly large proportion of positive-edges and it is therefore easy to get a high overall accuracy at the cost of a high false-positive-rate . we see that our supervised-method not only achieves good accuracy for sign prediction but is also especially effective in lowering the false-positive-rate .
