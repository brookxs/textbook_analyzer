on reducing redundancy and improving efficiency of xml labeling-schemes the basic relationships to be determined in xml-query-processing are ancestor-descendant (a-d) , parent-child (p-c) , sibling and ordering relationships . the containment-labeling-scheme can determine the a-d , p-c and ordering relationships fast , but it is very expensive in determining the sibling relationship . the prefix labeling-scheme can determine all the four basic relationships fast if the xml-tree is shallow . however , if the xml-tree is deep , the prefix scheme is inefficient since the prefix is long . furthermore , the prefix label is repeated by all the siblings (only the self labels of these siblings are different) . thus in this paper , we propose the p-containment and p-prefix schemes which can determine all the four basic relationships faster no matter what the xml structure is ; meanwhile p-prefix can reduce the redundancies in the prefix labeling-scheme .
