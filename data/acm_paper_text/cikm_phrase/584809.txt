semantic-based delivery of olap summary tables in wireless-environments with the rapid growth in mobile and wireless technologies and the availability , pervasiveness and cost-effectiveness of wireless-networks , mobile-computers are quickly becoming the normal front-end devices for accessing enterprise-data . in this paper , we are addressing the issue of efficient delivery of business decision support data in the form of summary tables to mobile-clients equipped with olap front-end tools . towards this , we propose a new on-demand scheduling-algorithm , called sbs , that exploits both the derivation semantics among olap summary tables and the mobile-clients ' capabilities of executing simple sql queries . it maximizes the aggregated data-sharing between clients and reduces the broadcast length compared to the already existing techniques . the degree of aggregation can be tuned to control the tradeoff between access-time and energy-consumption . further , the proposed scheme adapts well to different request rates , access-patterns and data distributions . the algorithm effectiveness with respect to access-time and power consumption is evaluated using simulation .
