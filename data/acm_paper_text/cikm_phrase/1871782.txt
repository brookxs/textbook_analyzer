sequel : query-completion via pattern-mining on multi-column structural-data in this demonstration , we propose an interactive-query completion system on structural-data like dblp , called sequel . it is novel in several aspects : with patterns mined on the structural-data using newly devised algorithm , sequel offers high-utility completions composed with not only words but also phrases , and requires no explicit indications of corresponding columns . instead of using query-logs exploited previously for unstructured-data , more effective completions are provided based on patterns mined directly from the records . moreover , an effective index-structure helps sequel respond fast at millisecond level for each keystroke .
