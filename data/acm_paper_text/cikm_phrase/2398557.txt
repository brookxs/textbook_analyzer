automatic-query-expansion based on tag-recommendation we here propose a new method for expanding entity related queries that automatically filters , weights and ranks candidate expasion terms extracted from wikipedia articles related to the original query . our method is based on state-of-the-art tag-recommendation methods that exploit heuristic metrics to estimate the descriptive capacity of a given term . originally proposed for the context of tags , we here apply these recommendation-methods to weight and rank terms extracted from multiple fields of wikipedia articles according to their relevance for the article . we evaluate our method comparing it against three state-of-the-art baselines in three collections . our results indicate that our method outperforms all baselines in all collections , with relative gains in map of up to 14 % against the best ones .
