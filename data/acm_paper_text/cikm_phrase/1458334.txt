decomposition of terminology graphs for domain-knowledge-acquisition we propose a graph-decomposition algorithm for analyzing the structure of complex graph networks . after multi-word-term-extraction , we apply techniques from text-mining and visual-analytics in a novel way by integrating symbolic and numeric information to build clusters of domain topics . terms are clustered based on surface linguistic variations and clusters are inserted in an association-network based on their intersection with documents . the graph is then decomposed based on atom graph-structure into central (non-decomposable) atom and peripheral atoms . the whole process is applied to publications from the sloan-digital-sky-survey (sdss) project in the astronomy field . the mapping obtained was evaluated by a domain expert and appeared to have captured interesting conceptual relations between different domain topics .
