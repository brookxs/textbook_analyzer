augmenting web-search surrogates with images while images are commonly used in search-result-presentation for vertical domains such as shopping and news , web-search-results surrogates remain primarily text-based . in this paper , we present results of two large-scale user studies to examine the effects of augmenting text-based surrogates with images extracted from the underlying webpage . we evaluate effectiveness and efficiency at both the individual surrogate level and at the results page level . additionally , we investigate the influence of two factors : the goodness of the image in terms of representing the underlying page content , and the diversity of the results on a results page . our results show that at the individual surrogate level , good images provide only a small benefit in judgment accuracy versus text-only surrogates , with a slight increase in judgment time . at the results page level , surrogates with good images had similar effectiveness and efficiency compared to the text-only condition . however , in situations where the results page items had diverse senses , surrogates with images had higher click precision versus text-only ones . results of these studies show tradeoffs in the use-of-images in web-search surrogates , and highlight particular situations where they can provide benefits .
