a formal characterization of pivot/unpivot pivot is an important relational operation that allows data in rows to be exchanged for columns . although most current relational-database-management-systems support pivot-type operations , to date a purely formal , algebraic-characterization of pivot has been lacking . in this paper , we present a characterization in terms of extended relational algebra operators ? (transpose) , ? (drop projection) , and ? (unique optimal tuple merge) . this enables us to (1) draw parallels with pivot and existing operators employed in dynamic-data mapping systems (ddms) , (2) formally characterize invertible pivot instances , and (3) provide complexity-results for pivot-type operations . these contributions are an important part of ongoing work on formal-models for relational olap .
