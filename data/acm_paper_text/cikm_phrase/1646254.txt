learning-to-rank using evolutionary-computation : immune-programming or genetic-programming ? nowadays ranking-function discovery approaches using evolutionary-computation (ec) , especially genetic-programming (gp) , have become an important branch in the learning-to-rank-for-information-retrieval (lr4ir) field . inspired by the gp_based learning-to-rank approaches , we provide a series of generalized definitions and a common framework for the application of ec in learning-to-rank research . besides , according to the introduced framework , we propose rankip , a ranking-function discovery approach using immune-programming (ip) . experimental-results demonstrate that rankip evidently outperforms the baselines . in addition , we study the differences between ip and gp in theory and experiments . results show that ip is more suitable for lr4ir due to its high diversity .
