model-guided information-discovery for intelligence-analysis intelligence-analysis can be aided and guided by models of the analysts ' interests and priorities . this paper describes our approach to analyst modeling as part of the ant caf project , in which analyst models are used to guide the searching-behavior of a swarm of intelligent-agents . structural elements of our analyst model include concepts and relations , both of which help to capture the analyst 's current interest and concerns . in addition , the concepts and relationships have associated scalar parameters to provide a quantitative-measure of the user 's level-of-interest . we have developed algorithms for dynamically adapting the weights and evolving the elements of the model itself . to evaluate these algorithms we have built an analyst modeling environment workbench . we have tested our approach on this workbench using traces generated by human analysts , and have demonstrated improvements over current-state of the art search-engines .
