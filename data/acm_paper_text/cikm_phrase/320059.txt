graph-based object-oriented-approach for structural and behavioral representation of multimedia-data the management of multimedia-information poses special requirements for multimedia-information-systems . both representation and retrieval of the complex and multifaceted multimedia-data are not easily handled with the flat relational-model and require new data-models . in the last several years , object-oriented and graph-based data models are actively pursued approaches for handling the multimedia-information . in this paper the characteristics of the novel graph-based object-oriented-data-model are presented . this model represents the structural and behavioral aspects of data that form multimedia-information-systems . it also provides for handling the continuously changing user-requirements and the complexity of the schema and data-representation in multimedia-information-systems using the schema-versioning approach and perspective version abstraction .
