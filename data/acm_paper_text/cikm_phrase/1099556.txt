emerging data-management-systems : close-up and personal conventional data-management occurs primarily in centralized servers or in well-interconnected distributed-systems . these are removed from their end-users , who interact with the systems mostly through static devices to obtain generic-services around main-stream applications : banking , retail , business management , etc. . several recent advances in technologies , however , give rise to a new breed of applications , which change altogether the user-experience and sense of data-management . very soon several such systems will be in our pockets , many more in our homes , the kitchen appliances , our clothes , etc. . how would these systems operate ? many system and user aspects must be approached in novel ways , while several new issues come up and need to be addressed for the first time . highlights include personalization , privacy , information trading , annotation , new interaction devices and corresponding interfaces , visualization , etc. . in this talk , we take a close look at and give a very personal guided-tour to this emerging world of data-management , offering some thoughts on how the new technical challenges might be approached .
