computational community-interest for ranking ranking documents with respect to users ' information-needs is a challenging task , due , in part , to the dynamic nature of users ' interest with respect to a query , which can change over time . in this paper , we propose an innovative method for characterizing the interests of a-community of users at a specific point in time and for using this characterization to alter the ranking of documents retrieved for a query . by generating a-community interest vector (civ) for a given query , we measure the community-interest by computing a score in a specific document or web-page retrieved by the query . this score is based on a continuously updated set of recent (daily or past few hours) user-oriented text-data . when applying our method in ranking yahoo! buzz results , the civ score improves relevant results by 16 \ % as determined by real-world user-evaluation .
