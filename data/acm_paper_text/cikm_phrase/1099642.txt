static score bucketing in inverted-indexes maintaining strict static score order of inverted-lists is a heuristic used by search-engines to improve the quality of query results when the entire inverted-lists can not be processed . this heuristic , however , increases the cost of index generation and requires complex index build algorithms . in this paper , we study a new index organization based on static score bucketing . we show that this new technique significantly improves in index build performance while having minimal impact on the quality of search-results .
