wisenet : building a wikipedia-based semantic-network with ontologized relations in this paper we present an approach for building a wikipedia-based semantic-network by integrating open-information-extraction with knowledge-acquisition techniques . our algorithm extracts relation instances from wikipedia page bodies and ontologizes them by , first , creating sets of synonymous relational phrases , called relation synsets , second , assigning semantic-classes to the arguments of these relation synsets and , third , disambiguating the initial relation instances with relation synsets . as a result we obtain wisenet , a wikipedia-based semantic-network with wikipedia pages as concepts and labeled , ontologized relations between them .
