active-learning in partially-supervised-classification positive-example-based-learners reduce human-annotation effort significantly by removing the burden of labeling the negative-examples . various methods have been proposed in literature for building classifiers using positive and unlabeled examples . however , we empirically observe that classification-accuracy of the-state-of-the-art methods degrades significantly as the number of labeled positive examples decreases . in this paper , we propose an active-learning_based method to address this issue . the proposed method learns starting from a handful of positively labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled-examples . experimental-results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method performs better than the-state-of-the-art methods when the percentage of labeled positive examples is small .
