privacy-preservation by independent-component-analysis and variance control the primary objective of privacy-preservation is to protect an individual 's confidential information in released data-sets . in recent years , several simulation-based approaches for privacy-preservation have been proposed . the idea is to generate a synthetic-data set with the constraint that the probability distribution is as close as possible to that of the original set . in this paper , we propose two frameworks for simulation-based privacy-preservation of multivariate numerical-data . the first framework , called primp (privacy-preserving by independent components) , is based on independent-component-analysis (ica) . it is shown empirically that primp outperforms other simulation-based approaches in terms of spearman 's rank-correlation and kendall 's tau correlation . the second approach proposed is a hybrid-method that combines primp and cholesky 's decomposition technique . it is shown empirically that the hybrid method preserves the covariance-matrix of the original data exactly . the method also resolves the problem of generating good seeds for the cholesky-based approach . although the empirical-results show that the hybrid approach is not always better than the primp in terms of spearman 's rank-correlation and kendall 's tau correlation , in theory , the risk of information-leakage under the hybrid approach is much less than that under primp .
