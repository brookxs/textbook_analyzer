dynamic covering for recommendation-systems in this paper , we identify a fundamental algorithmic problem that we term succinct dynamic covering (sdc) , arising in many modern-day web-applications , including ad-serving and online recommendation-systems such as in ebay , netflix , and amazon . roughly speaking , sdc applies two restrictions to the well-studied max-coverage problem [14] : given an integer k , x = {1,2 , ... , n} and i = {s_1 , ... , s_m} , s_i subseteq x , find | j | subseteq i , such that | j | we present algorithms and complexity-results for coverage oracles . we present deterministic and probabilistic near-tight upper-and-lower-bounds on the approximation ratio of sdc as a function of the amount of space available to the oracle . our lower-bound results show that to obtain constant-factor approximations we need omega (mn) space . fortunately , our upper-bounds present an explicit tradeoff between space and approximation ratio , allowing us to determine the amount of space needed to guarantee certain accuracy .
