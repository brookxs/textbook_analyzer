large-scale question-classification in cqa by leveraging wikipedia semantic-knowledge with the flourishing of community-based-question-answering (cqa) services like yahoo!-answers , more and more web users seek their information-need from these sites . understanding user 's information-need expressed through their search questions is crucial to information providers . question-classification in cqa is studied for this purpose . however , there are two main difficulties in applying traditional methods (question-classification in trec qa and text-classification) to cqa : (1) traditional methods confine themselves to classify a text or question into two or a few predefined categories . while in cqa , the number of categories is much larger , such as yahoo!-answers , there contains 1,263 categories . our empirical-results show that with the increasing of the number of categories to moderate size , the performance of the classification-accuracy dramatically decreases . (2) unlike the normal texts , questions in cqa are very short , which can not provide sufficient word-co-occurrence or shared information for a good similarity-measure due to the data-sparseness . in this paper , we propose a two-stage approach for question-classification in cqa that can tackle the difficulties of the traditional methods . in the first stage , we preform a search-process to prune the large-scale categories to focus our classification effort on a small subset . in the second stage , we enrich questions by leveraging wikipedia semantic-knowledge to tackle the data-sparseness . as a result , the classification-model is trained on the enriched small subset . we demonstrate the performance of our proposed method on yahoo!-answers with 1,263 categories . the experimental-results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline method (with error reductions of 23.21 \ %) .
