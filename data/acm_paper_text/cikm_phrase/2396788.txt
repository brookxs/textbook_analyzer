social book-search : comparing topical-relevance judgements and book suggestions for evaluation the-web and social-media give us access to a wealth of information , not only different in quantity but also in character -- traditional descriptions from professionals are now supplemented with user-generated-content . this challenges modern search systems based on the classical model of topical-relevance and ad-hoc search : how does their effectiveness transfer to the changing nature of information and to the changing types-of-information-needs and search-tasks ? we use the inex 2011 books and social-search track 's collection of book descriptions from amazon and social cataloguing site librarything . we compare classical ir with social book-search in the context of the librarything discussion-forums where members ask for book suggestions . specifically , we compare book suggestions on the forum with mechanical-turk judgements on topical-relevance and recommendation , both the judgements directly and their resulting evaluation of retrieval-systems . first , the book suggestions on the forum are a complete enough set of relevance-judgements for system-evaluation . second , topical-relevance judgements result in a different system ranking from evaluation based on the forum suggestions . although it is an important aspect for social book-search , topical-relevance is not sufficient for evaluation . third , professional metadata alone is often not enough to determine the topical-relevance of a book . user reviews provide a better signal for topical-relevance . fourth , user-generated-content is more effective for social book-search than professional metadata . based on our findings , we propose an experimental-evaluation that better reflects the complexities of social book-search .
