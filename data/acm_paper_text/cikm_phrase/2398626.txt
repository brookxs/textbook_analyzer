an interaction-framework of service-oriented ontology-learning ontology plays a very important role in supporting knowledge-based applications . in cloud-computing , ontology-learning technology is facing new challenges in dealing with heterogeneous-data-sources from different domains and researchers , which may contain various particular concepts and relations . traditional ontology-learning frameworks usually focus only on the extraction of concepts and taxonomic relations from the multi-structured corpus . however , former researches rarely studied the interactions during ontology-learning process among different researchers . lack of interactions among people who build ontology in different domains may cause inconsistent ontology . besides , lack of incentive during the ontology-building process will also result in low efficiency . to address these challenges , this paper specifies a novel solution to perform ontology-learning . the solution includes a service-oriented ontology interaction-framework , a service-oriented ontology-learning strategy . it shows that it advances ontology-learning to a higher level of performance and portability with a number of experiments in demo system .
