structure-based inference of xml-similarity for fuzzy duplicate-detection fuzzy duplicate-detection aims at identifying multiple-representations of real-world-objects stored in a data source , and is a task of critical practical relevance in data-cleaning , data-mining , or data-integration . it has a long history for relational-data stored in a single table (or in multiple tables with equal schema) . algorithms for fuzzy duplicate-detection in more complex structures , e.g. , hierarchies of a data-warehouse , xml-data , or graph-data have only recently emerged . these algorithms use similarity-measures that consider the duplicate status of their direct neighbors , e.g. , children in hierarchical-data , to improve duplicate-detection effectiveness . in this paper , we propose a novel method for fuzzy duplicate-detection in hierarchical and semi-structured xml-data . unlike previous approaches , it not only considers the duplicate status of children , but rather the probability of descendants being duplicates . probabilities are computed efficiently using a bayesian-network . experiments show the proposed algorithm is able to maintain high precision and recall values , even when dealing with data containing a high amount of errors and missing-information . our proposal is also able to outperform a state-of-the-art duplicate-detection system on three different xml-databases .
