twisent : a multistage system for analyzing sentiment in twitter in this paper , we present twisent , a sentiment-analysis system for twitter . based on the topic searched , twisent collects tweets pertaining to it and categorizes them into the different polarity classes positive , negative and objective . however , analyzing micro-blog posts have many inherent challenges compared to the other text genres . through twisent , we address the problems of 1) spams pertaining to sentiment-analysis in twitter , 2) structural anomalies in the text in the form of incorrect spellings , nonstandard abbreviations , slangs etc. , 3) entity specificity in the context of the topic searched and 4) pragmatics embedded in text . the system-performance is evaluated on manually annotated gold-standard data and on an automatically annotated tweet set based on hashtags . it is a common practise to show the efficacy of a supervised-system on an automatically annotated-dataset . however , we show that such a system achieves lesser classification accurcy when tested on generic twitter dataset . we also show that our system performs much better than an existing system .
