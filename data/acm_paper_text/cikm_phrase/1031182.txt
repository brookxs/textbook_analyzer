scoring missing terms in information-retrieval-tasks an usual approach to address mismatching vocabulary problem is to augment the original query using dictionaries and other lexical-resources and/or by looking at pseudo-relevant documents . either way , terms are added to form a new query that will be used to score all documents in a subsequent retrieval pass , and as consequence the original query 's focus may drift because of the newly added terms . we propose a new method to address the mismatching vocabulary problem , expanding original query terms only when necessary and complementing the user-query for missing terms while scoring documents . it allows related semantic aspects to be included in a conservative and selective way , thus reducing the possibility of query-drift . our results using replacements for the <i> missing query terms </i> in modified document and passages retrieval-methods show significant improvement over the original ones .
