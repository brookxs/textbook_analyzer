attention prediction on social-media brand-pages in this paper , we deal with the problem of predicting how much attention a newly submitted post would receive from fellow community members of closed communities in social-networking-sites . though the concept of attention is subjective , the number of comments received by a post serves as a very good indicator of the same . unlike previous work which primarily made use of either content-features or the network features (friendship links on the network) , we exploit both the content-features and community-level features (for instance , what time of the day is the community more active) for tackling this problem . further , we focus on dedicated pages of corporate brands on social-media websites and accordingly extract important features from the content and community activity of such brand-pages . the attention prediction-task finds direct application in the listening , monitoring and engaging activities of the businesses that have such brand-pages . in this paper , we formulate the problem of attention prediction on social-media brand-pages . we further propose attention prediction (ap) framework which integrates the various features that influence the attention received by a post using classification and regression_based approaches . experimental-results on real-world data extracted from some highly active brand-pages on facebook demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework .
