two-part segmentation of text-documents we consider the problem of segmenting text-documents that have a two-part structure such as a problem part and a solution part . documents of this genre include incident reports that typically involve description of events relating to a problem followed by those pertaining to the solution that was tried . segmenting such documents into the component two parts would render them usable in knowledge-reuse frameworks such as case-based-reasoning . this segmentation-problem presents a hard case for traditional text-segmentation due to the lexical inter-relatedness of the segments . we develop a two-part segmentation technique that can harness a corpus of similar documents to model the behavior of the two segments and their inter-relatedness using language-models and translation-models respectively . in particular , we use separate language-models for the problem and solution segment types , whereas the inter-relatedness between segment types is modeled using an ibm-model 1 translation-model . we model documents as being generated starting from the problem part that comprises of words sampled from the problem language-model , followed by the solution part whose words are sampled either from the solution language-model or from a translation-model conditioned on the words already chosen in the problem part . we show , through an extensive set of experiments on real-world-data , that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art text-segmentation algorithms in the accuracy of segmentation , and that such improved accuracy translates well to improved usability in case-based-reasoning systems . we also analyze the robustness of our technique to varying amounts and types of noise and empirically illustrate that our technique is quite noise-tolerant , and degrades gracefully with increasing amounts of noise .
