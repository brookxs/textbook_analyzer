blog-site search using resource-selection a blog-site consists of many individual blog postings . current blog-search services focus on retrieving postings but there is also a need to identify relevant blog sites . blog-site search is similar to resource-selection in distributed-information-retrieval , in that the target is to find relevant collections of documents . we introduce resource-selection techniques for blog-site search and evaluate their performance . further , we propose a `` diversity factor '' that measures the topic diversity of each blog-site . our results show that the appropriate combination of the resource-selection techniques and the diversity factor can achieve significant improvements in retrieval-performance compared to baselines . we also report results using these techniques on the trec blog-distillation task .
