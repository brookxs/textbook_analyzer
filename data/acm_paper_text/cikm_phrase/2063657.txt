effective retrieval of resources in folksonomies using a new tag-similarity measure social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe content within web-2.0 websites . however , as tags are informally defined , continually changing , and ungoverned , it has often been criticised for lowering , rather than increasing , the efficiency of searching . to address this issue , a variety of approaches have been proposed that recommend users what tags to use , both when labeling and when looking for resources . these techniques work well in dense folksonomies , but they fail to do so when tag usage exhibits a power-law-distribution , as it often happens in real-life folksonomies . to tackle this issue , we propose an approach that induces the creation of a dense folksonomy , in a fully automatic and transparent way : when users label resources , an innovative tag-similarity metric is deployed , so to enrich the chosen tag-set with related tags already present in the folksonomy . the proposed metric , which represents the core of our approach , is based on the mutual-reinforcement-principle . our experimental-evaluation proves that the accuracy and coverage of searches guaranteed by our metric are higher than those achieved by applying classical metrics .
