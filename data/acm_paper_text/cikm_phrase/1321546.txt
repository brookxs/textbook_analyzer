index-compression is good , especially for random-access index-compression techniques are known to substantially decrease the storage requirements of a text-retrieval-system . as a side-effect , they may increase its retrieval-performance by reducing disk-i/o overhead . despite this advantage , developers sometimes choose to store index data in uncompressed form , in order to not obstruct random-access into each index term 's postings list . in this paper , we show that index-compression does not harm random-access performance . in fact , we demonstrate that , in some cases , random-access into a term 's postings list may be realized more efficiently if the list is stored in compressed form instead of uncompressed . this is regardless of whether the index is stored on disk or in main-memory , since both types of storage - hard drives and ram - do not support efficient random-access in the first place .
