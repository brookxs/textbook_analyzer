energy-management schemes for memory-resident database-systems with the tremendous growth of system memories , memory-resident databases are increasingly becoming important in various domains . newer memories provide a structured way of storing data in multiple chips , with each chip having a bank of memory-modules . current memory-resident databases are yet to take full advantage of the banked storage-system , which offers a lot of room for performance and energy optimizations . in this paper , we identify the implications of a banked memory environment in supporting memory-resident databases , and propose hardware (memory-directed) and software (query-directed) schemes to reduce the energy-consumption of queries executed on these databases . our results show that high-level query-directed schemes (hosted in the query-optimizer) better utilize the low-power modes in reducing the energy-consumption than the respective hardware-schemes (hosted in the memory-controller) , due to their complete knowledge of query access-patterns . we extend this further and propose a query restructuring scheme and a multi-query-optimization . queries are restructured and regrouped based on their table access-patterns to maximize the likelihood that data accesses are clustered . this helps increase the inter-access idle times of memory-modules , which in turn enables a more effective control of their energy behavior . this heuristic is eventually integrated with our hardware optimizations to achieve maximum savings . our experimental-results show that the memory energy reduces by 90 \ % if query restructuring method is applied along with basic energy optimizations over the unoptimized version . the system-wide performance-impact of each scheme is also studied simultaneously .
