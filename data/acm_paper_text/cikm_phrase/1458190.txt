finding informative commonalities in concept collections the problem of finding commonalities characterizes several knowledge-management scenarios involving collection of resources . the automatic-extraction of shared features in a collection of resource descriptions formalized in accordance with a logic-language has been in fact widely investigated in the past . in particular , with reference to description-logics concept descriptions , least common subsumers have been specifically introduced . nevertheless , such studies focused on identifying features shared by the whole collection . the paper proposes instead novel reasoning services in description-logics , aimed at identifying commonalities in a significant portion of the collection , rather than in the collection as a whole . in particular , common subsumers adding informative content to the one provided by the least common subsumer are here investigated . the new-services are useful in all scenarios where features are not required to be fully shared , like the one motivating our research : core competence extraction in knowledge intensive companies .
