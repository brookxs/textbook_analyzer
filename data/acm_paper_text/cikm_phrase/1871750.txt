skif : a data-imputation framework for concept-drifting data-streams missing-data commonly occurs in many applications . while many data-imputation methods exist to handle the missing-data problem for large-scale databases , when applied to concept-drifting data-streams , these methods face some common difficulties . first , due to large and continuous-data volumes , we are unable to maintain all stream records to form a candidate pool and estimate missing-values , as most existing methods commonly do . second , even if we could maintain all complete stream records using a summary structure , the concept-drifting problem would make some information obsolete , and thus deteriorate the imputation accuracy . third , in data-streams , it is necessary to develop a fast yet accurate algorithm to find the most similar data for imputation . fourth , due to the dynamic and sophisticated data-collection environments , the missing rate of most stream-data may be much higher than that in generic static databases , so the imputation-method should be able to accommodate high missing rate in the data . to tackle these challenges , we propose , in this paper , a streaming k-nearest-neighbors imputation framework (skif) for concept-drifting data-streams . to handle concept-drifting and large volume problems in data-streams , skif first summarizes historical complete records in some micro-resources (which are high-level statistical-data structures) , and maintains these micro-resources in a candidate pool as benchmark data . after that , skif employs a novel hybrid-knn imputation procedure , which uses a hybrid similarity-search mechanism , to find the most similar micro-resources from the large-scale candidate pool efficiently . experimental-results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed skif framework for data-stream imputation tasks .
