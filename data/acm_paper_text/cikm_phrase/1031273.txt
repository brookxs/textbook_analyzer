qfilter : fine-grained run-time xml-access-control via nfa-based query-rewriting at present , most of the state-of-the-art solutions for xml access controls are either (1) document-level access-control techniques that are too limited to support fine-grained security-enforcement ; (2) view-based approaches that are often expensive to create and maintain ; or (3) impractical proposals that require substantial security-related support from underlying xml-databases . in this paper , we take a different approach that assumes no security support from underlying xml-databases and examine three alternative fine-grained xml-access-control solutions , namely <i> primitive , pre-processing </i> and <i> post-processing </i> approaches . in particular , we advocate a pre-processing method called <i> qfilter </i> that uses non-deterministic finite automata (nfa) to rewrite user 's query such that any parts violating access-control rules are pruned . we show the construction and execution of a qfilter and demonstrate its superiority to other competing methods .
