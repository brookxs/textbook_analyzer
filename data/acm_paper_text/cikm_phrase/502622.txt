how foreign function integration conquers heterogeneous-query-processing with the emergence of application systems which encapsulate databases and related application components , pure-data integration using , for example , a federated-database-system is not possible anymore . instead , access via predefined functions is the only way to get data from an application system . as a result , retrieval of such heterogeneous and encapsulated data sources needs the combination of generic query as well as predefined function access . in this paper , we present a middleware approach supporting such a novel and extended kind of integration . starting with the overall architecture , we explain the functionality and cooperation of its core components : a federated-database-system and a workflow-management-system connected via a wrapper . afterwards , we concentrate on essential aspects of query-processing across these heterogeneous components focusing on the impact of the functions included . we discuss the operations the wrapper should provide in order to extend the workflow-system 's native functionality . in addition to selection and projection , these operations could include aggregation and the support of subqueries . moreover , we point out modifications to the traditional cost-model needed to consider the cost-estimates for the function-calls as well .
