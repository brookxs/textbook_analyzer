coupling feature-selection and machine-learning-methods for navigational-query identification it is important yet hard to identify navigational-queries in web-search due to a lack of sufficient information in web-queries , which are typically very short . in this paper we study several machine-learning-methods , including naive-bayes-model , maximum-entropy-model , support-vector-machine (svm) , and stochastic-gradient boosting-tree (sgbt) , for navigational-query identification in web-search . to boost the performance of these machine techniques , we exploit several feature-selection methods and propose coupling feature-selection with classification approaches to achieve the best performance . different from most prior work that uses a small number of features , in this paper , we study the problem of identifying navigational-queries with thousands of available features , extracted from major commercial-search-engine results , web-search user click-data , query-log , and the whole web 's relational content . a multi-level feature-extraction system is constructed.our results on real search data show that 1) among all the features we tested , user click distribution features are the most important set-of-features for identifying navigational-queries . 2) in order to achieve good performance , machine-learning-approaches have to be coupled with good feature-selection methods . we find that gradient-boosting tree , coupled with linear-svm feature-selection is most effective . 3) with carefully coupled feature-selection and classification approaches , navigational-queries can be accurately identified with 88.1 \ % f1 score , which is 33 \ % error-rate-reduction compared to the best uncoupled system , and 40 \ % error-rate-reduction compared to a well tuned system without feature-selection .
