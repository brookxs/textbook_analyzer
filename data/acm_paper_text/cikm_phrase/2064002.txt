a machine-learned proactive moderation system for auction fraud-detection online-auction and shopping are gaining popularity with the growth of web-based ecommerce . criminals are also taking advantage of these opportunities to conduct fraudulent activities against honest parties with the purpose of deception and illegal profit . in practice , proactive moderation systems are deployed to detect suspicious events for further inspection by human experts . motivated by real-world-applications in commercial auction sites in asia , we develop various advanced machine-learning-techniques in the proactive moderation system . our proposed system is formulated as optimizing bounded generalized-linear-models in multi-instance-learning problems , with intrinsic bias in selective labeling and massive unlabeled-samples . in both offline evaluations and online bucket tests , the proposed system significantly outperforms the rule-based-system on various metrics , including area-under-roc (auc) , loss-rate of labeled frauds and customer complaints . we also show that the metrics of loss rates are more effective than auc in our cases .
