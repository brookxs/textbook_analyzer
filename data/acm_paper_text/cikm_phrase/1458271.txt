an extension of plsa for document-clustering in this paper we propose an extension of the plsa model in which an extra latent-variable allows the model to co-cluster documents and terms simultaneously . we show on three datasets that our extended model produces statistically significant improvements with respect to two clustering measures over the original plsa and the multinomial mixture mm models .
