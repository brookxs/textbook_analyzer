scalable complex-pattern-search in sequential-data searching data-streams has been traditionally very limited , either in the complexity of the search or in the size of the searched dataset . in this paper , we investigate the design and optimization of constructs that enable sql to express complex patterns . in particular we propose the rsps (recursive sequential-pattern search) algorithm which exploits the inter-dependencies between the elements of a sequential-pattern to minimize repeated passes over the same data . performance gains derived experimental-results show impressive speedup up to 100 times .
