evaluating , combining and generalizing recommendations with prerequisites we consider the problem of recommending the best set of k items when there is an inherent ordering between items , expressed as a set of prerequisites (e.g. , the movie ` godfather i ' is a prerequisite of ` godfather ii ') . since this general problem is computationally intractable , we develop 3 approximation-algorithms to solve this problem for various prerequisite structures (e.g. , chain graphs , and graphs , and-or-graphs) . we derive worst-case bounds for these algorithms for these structures , and experimentally evaluate these algorithms on synthetic-data . we also develop an algorithm to combine solutions in order to generate even better solutions , and compare the performance of this algorithm with the other three .
