predicting trends in social-networks via dynamic activeness model with the effect of word-of-the-mouth , trends in social-networks are now playing a significant role in shaping people 's lives . predicting dynamic trends is an important problem with many useful applications . there are three dynamic-characteristics of a trend that should be captured by a trend model : intensity , coverage and duration . however , existing approaches on the information-diffusion are not capable of capturing these three characteristics . in this paper , we study the problem of predicting dynamic trends in social-networks . we first define related concepts to quantify the dynamic-characteristics of trends in social-networks , and formalize the problem of trend prediction . we then propose a dynamic activeness (da) model based on the novel concept of activeness , and design a trend prediction-algorithm using the da model . we examine the prediction-algorithm on the dblp network , and show that it is more accurate than state-of-the-art approaches .
