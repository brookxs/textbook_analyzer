large-scale behavioral-targeting with a social twist behavioral-targeting (bt) is a widely used technique for online-advertising . it leverages information collected on an individual 's web-browsing behavior , such as page views , search queries and ad clicks , to select the ads most relevant to user to display . with the proliferation of social-networks , it is possible to relate the behavior of individuals and their social connections . although the similarity among connected individuals are well established (i.e. , homophily) , it is still not clear whether and how we can leverage the activities of one 's friends for behavioral-targeting ; whether forecasts derived from such social-information are more accurate than standard behavioral-targeting models . in this paper , we strive to answer these questions by evaluating the predictive-power of social-data across 60 consumer domains on a large online network of over 180 million users in a period of two and a half months . to our best knowledge , this is the most comprehensive study of social-data in the context of behavioral-targeting on such an unprecedented scale . our analysis offers interesting insights into the value of social-data for developing the next generation of targeting services .
