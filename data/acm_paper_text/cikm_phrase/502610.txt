mining the-web for answers to natural-language questions the-web is now becoming one of the largest information and knowledge repositories . many large-scale search-engines (google , fast , northern light , etc.) have emerged to help users find information . in this paper , we study how we can effectively use these existing search-engines to mine the-web and discover the `` correct '' answers to factual natural-language questions.we propose a probabilistic-algorithm called qasm (question-answering using statistical-models) that learns the best query paraphrase of a natural-language-question . we validate our approach for both local and web-search-engines using questions from the trec-evaluation . we also show how this algorithm can be combined with another algorithm (ansel) to produce precise answers to natural-language questions .
