designing an ensemble-classifier over subspace-classifiers using iterative convergence routine there can be multiple-classifiers for a given data-set . one way to generate multiple-classifiers is to use subspaces of the attribute sets . in this paper , we generate subspace-classifiers by an iterative convergence routine to build an ensemble-classifier . experimental-evaluation covers the cases of both labelled and unlabelled (blind) data separately . we evaluate our approach on many benchmark uc irvine datasets to assess the robustness of our approach with varying induced noise levels . we explicitly compare and present the utility of the clusterings generated for classification using several diverse clustering dissimilarity metrics . results show that our ensemble-classifier is a more robust classifier in comparison to different multi-class-classification approaches .
