a constraint-based probabilistic-framework for name-disambiguation this paper is concerned with the problem of name-disambiguation . by name-disambiguation , we mean distinguishing persons with the same name . it is a critical problem in many knowledge-management applications . despite much research work has been conducted , the problem is still not resolved and becomes even more serious , in particular with the popularity of web-2.0 . previously , name-disambiguation was often undertaken in either a supervised or unsupervised fashion . this paper first gives a constraint-based probabilistic-model for semi-supervised name-disambiguation . specifically , we focus on investigating the problem in an academic researcher social-network (http://arnetminer.org) . the framework combines constraints and euclidean-distance learning , and allows the user to refine the disambiguation results . experimental-results on the researcher social-network show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the baseline method using unsupervised hierarchical-clustering algorithm .
