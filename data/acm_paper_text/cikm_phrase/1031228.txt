a design-space approach to analysis of information-retrieval adaptive-filtering systems in this paper we suggest a new approach to analysis-and-design of ir systems . we argue for design-space-exploration in constructing ir systems and in analyzing the effects of individual modules and parameters . we present results of experiments with parametric interpolation , or `` homotopy '' , between two systems , and show , incidentally , that the best results are not achieved at the endpoints , and may lie outside the bounding hypercube defined by our choice of parameterization . three distinct classes of interpolation are introduced to deal with the complexities of the specific example .
