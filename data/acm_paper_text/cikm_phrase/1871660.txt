focused-crawling using navigational-rank the goal of focused-crawling is to use limited-resources to effectively discover web-pages related to a specific topic rather than downloading all accessible web documents . the major challenge in focused-crawling is how to effectively determine each hyperlink 's capability of leading to target pages . to compute this capability , we present a novel approach , called navigational-rank (nr) . in general , nr is a kind of two-step and two-direction credit propagation approach . compared to existing methods , nr mainly has three advantages . first , nr is dynamically updated during the crawling progress , which can adapt to different website structures very well . second , when the crawling seed is far away from the target pages , and the target pages only constitute a small portion of the whole website , nr shows a significant performance advantage . third , nr computes each link 's capability of leading to target pages by considering both the target and non-target pages it leads to . this global-knowledge causes a better performance than only using target pages . we have performed extensive experiments for performance-evaluation of the proposed approach using two groups of large-scale , real-world datasets from two different domains . the experimental-results show that our approach is domain-independent and significantly outperforms the state-of-arts .
