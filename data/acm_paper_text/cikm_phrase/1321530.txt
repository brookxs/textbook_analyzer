hypothesis-testing with incomplete relevance-judgments information-retrieval experimentation generally proceeds in a cycle of development , evaluation , and hypothesis-testing . ideally , the evaluation and testing phases should be short and easy , so as to maximize the amount of time spent in development . there has been recent work on reducing the amount of assessor effort needed to evaluate retrieval-systems , but it has not , for the most part , investigated the effects of these methods on tests of significance . in this work , we explore in detail the effects of reduced sets of judgments on the sign test . we demonstrate both analytically and empirically the relationship between the power of the test , the number of topics evaluated , and the number of judgments available . using these relationships , we can determine the number of topics and judgments needed for the least-cost but highest-confidence significance evaluation . specifically , testing pairwise significance over 192 topics with fewer than 5 judgments for each is as good as testing significance over 25 topics with an average of 166 judgments for each - 85 \ % less effort producing no additional errors .
