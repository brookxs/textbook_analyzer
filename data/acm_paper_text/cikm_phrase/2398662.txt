a constraint to automatically regulate document-length normalisation retrieval functions in information-retrieval (ir) are fundamental to the effectiveness of search systems . however , considerable parameter-tuning is often needed to increase the effectiveness of the retrieval . document-length normalisation is one such aspect that requires tuning on a per-query and per-collection basis for many retrieval functions . in this paper , we develop an approach that regularises the level of normalisation to apply on a per-query basis . we formally describe the interaction between query-terms and document-length normalisation using a constraint . we then develop a general pre-retrieval approach to adapt a number of state-of-the-art ranking-functions so that they adhere to the constraint . finally , we empirically demonstrate that the adapted retrieval functions outperform default versions of the original retrieval functions , and perform at least comparably to tuned versions of the original functions , on a number of datasets . essentially this regulates the normalisation parameter in a number of retrieval functions on a per-query basis in a principled manner .
