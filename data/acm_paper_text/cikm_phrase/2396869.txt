learning-to-rank duplicate-bug-reports for a large and complex-software system , the project-team could receive a large number of bug-reports . some bug-reports could be duplicates as they essentially report the same problem . it is often tedious and costly to manually check if a newly reported bug is a duplicate of an already reported bug . in this paper , we propose bugsim , a method that can automatically retrieve duplicate-bug-reports given a new bug-report . bugsim is based on learning-to-rank concepts . we identify textual and statistical-features of bug-reports and propose a similarity-function for bug-reports based on the features . we then construct a training-set by assembling pairs of duplicate and non-duplicate bug-reports . we train the weights of features by applying the stochastic-gradient-descent algorithm over the training-set . for a new bug-report , we retrieve candidate duplicate reports using the trained-model . we evaluate bugsim using more than 45,100 real bug-reports of twelve eclipse projects . the evaluation results show that the proposed method is effective . on average , the recall rate for the top 10 retrieved reports is 76.11 % . furthermore , bugsim outperforms the previous state-of-art methods that are implemented using svm and bm25fext .
