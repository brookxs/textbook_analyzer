automatic schema merging using mapping constraints among incomplete sources schema-merging is the process of consolidating multiple schemas into a unified view . the task becomes particularly challenging when the schemas are highly heterogeneous and autonomous . classical data-integration-systems rely on a mediated-schema created by human experts through an intensive design-process . in this paper , we present a novel approach for merging multiple relational-data sources related by a collection of mapping constraints in the form of p2p style tuple-generating-dependencies (tgds) . in the scenario of data-integration , we opt for minimal mediated schemas that are complete regarding certain-answers of conjunctive-queries . under open-world-assumption (owa) , we characterize the semantics of schema-merging by properties of the output mapping-system between the source schemas and the mediated-schema . we propose a merging algorithm following a redundancy-reduction paradigm and prove that the output satisfies the desired logical-properties . recognizing the fact that multiple plausible mediated schemas may co-exist , a variant of the a priori algorithm is employed to enumerate alternative mediated schemas . output mappings in the form of data-dependencies are generated to support the mediated schemas , which enables query-processing . we have evaluated our merging approach over a collection of real-world data-sets , which demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach in practice .
