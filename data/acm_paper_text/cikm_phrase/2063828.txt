rfid data analysis using tensor calculus for supply-chain-management in current trends of consumer-products market , there is a growing significance of the role of retailers in the governance of supply-chains . rfid is a promising infrastructure-less technology , allowing to connect an object with its virtual counterpart , i.e. , its representation within information-systems . however , the amount of rfid data in supply-chain-management is vast , posing significant challenges for attaining acceptable performance on their analysis . current approaches provide hard-coded solutions , with high consumption of resources ; moreover , these exhibit very limited flexibility dealing with multidimensional-queries , at various levels of granularity and complexity . in this paper we propose a general-model for supply-chain-management based on the first principles of linear-algebra , in particular on tensorial calculus . leveraging our abstract algebraic framework , our technique allows both quick decentralized on-line-processing , and centralized off-line massive business-logic analysis , according to needs and requirements of supply-chain actors . experimental-results show that our approach , utilizing recent linear-algebra techniques can process-analysis efficiently , when compared to recent approaches . in particular , we are able to carry out the required computations even in high memory constrained environments , such as on mobile-devices . moreover , when dealing with massive amounts of data , we are capable of exploiting recent parallel and distributed technologies , subdividing our tensor objects into sub-blocks , and processing them independently .
