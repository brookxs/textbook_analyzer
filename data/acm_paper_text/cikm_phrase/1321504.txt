a knowledge-based search-engine powered by wikipedia this paper describes koru , a new search interface that offers effective domain-independent knowledge-based-information-retrieval . koru exhibits an understanding of the topics of both queries and documents . this allows it to (a) expand queries automatically and (b) help guide the user as they evolve their queries interactively . its understanding is mined from the vast investment of manual effort and judgment that is wikipedia . we show how this open , constantly evolving encyclopedia can yield inexpensive knowledge-structures that are specifically tailored to expose the topics , terminology and semantics of individual document-collections . we conducted a detailed user-study with 12 participants and 10 topics from the 2005 trec-hard track , and found that koru and its underlying knowledge-base offers significant advantages over traditional keyword-search . it was capable of lending assistance to almost every query issued to it ; making their entry more efficient , improving the relevance of the documents they return , and narrowing the gap between expert and novice seekers .
