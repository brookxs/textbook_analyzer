dsac : integrity for outsourced-databases with signature-aggregation and chaining database-outsourcing is an important trend which involves data owners farming out their data-management needs to an external service-provider . one important requirement is to maintain the integrity-and-authenticity of outsourced-data . whenever an outsourced database is queried , the corresponding query reply must be demonstrably authentic . furthermore , a reply must include a proof of completeness to convince the querier that no data-matching the query predicate (s) has been omitted . in this paper , we suggest new techniques in support of efficient authenticity and completeness guarantees of such query replies .
