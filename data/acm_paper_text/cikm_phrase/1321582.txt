satisfaction balanced mediation we consider a distributed-information-system that allows autonomous consumers to query autonomous providers . we focus on the problem of query-allocation from a new point-of-view , by considering consumers and providers ' satisfaction in addition to query load . we define satisfaction as a long-run notion based on the consumers and providers ' preferences . we propose and validate a mediation process , called sbmediation , which is compared to capacity_based query-allocation . the experimental-results show that sbmediation significantly outperforms capacity based when confronted to autonomous-participants .
