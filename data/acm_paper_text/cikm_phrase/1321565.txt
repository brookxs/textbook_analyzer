improving the classification of newsgroup messages through social-network-analysis improving the classification of newsgroup messages through social-network-analysis . in this paper , we focus on automatic-classification of message replies into several types . for representing messages we consider rich feature-sets that combine the standard author reply-to network properties with features derived from four additional structures identified in the data : 1) a network of authors who participate in the same threads , 2) network of authors who post similar-content , 3) network of threads sharing common authors , and 4) network of content-related threads . for selected newsgroups we train linear-svm classifiers to identify agreement and disagreement with the original message , and question-and-answer patterns in the threads . we show that the use of newly defined features substantially improves classification of messages in comparison with the svm-model based only on the standard reply-to network .
