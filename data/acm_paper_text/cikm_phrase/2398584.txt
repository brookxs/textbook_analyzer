efficient buffer-management for piecewise-linear representation of multiple-data-streams piecewise-linear representation (plr) has been a widely used method for approximating data-streams in the form of compact line-segments . the buffer-based approach to plr enables a semi-global approximation which relies on the aggregated processing of batches of streamed data so that to adjust and improve the approximation results . however , one challenge towards applying the buffer-based approach is allocating the necessary memory resources for stream buffering . this challenge is further complicated in a multi-stream environment where multiple-data-streams are competing for the available memory resources , especially in resource-constrained-systems such as sensors and mobile-devices . in this paper , we address precisely those challenges mentioned above and propose efficient buffer-management techniques for the plr of multiple-data-streams . in particular , we propose a new dynamic approach called dynamic buffer-management with error monitoring (dbmem) , which leverages the relationship between the buffer demands of each data-stream and its exhibited pattern of data-values towards estimating its sufficient buffer-size . this enables dbmem to provide a global buffer-allocation strategy that maximizes the overall plr approximation quality for multiple-data-streams as shown by our experimental-results .
