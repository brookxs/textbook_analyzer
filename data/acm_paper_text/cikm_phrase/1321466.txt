computing block-importance for searching on web-sites in this paper we consider the problem of using the block-structure of a web-page to improve ranking results when searching for information on web-sites . given the block-structure of the-web pages as input , we propose a method for computing the importance of each block (in the form of block weights) in a web collection . as we show-through experiments , the deployment of our method may allow a significant improvement in the quality of search-results . we ran experiments to compare the quality of search-results when using our method to the quality obtained when using no structure-information . when compared to a ranking-method that considered pages as monolithic units , our block-based ranking-method led to improvements in the quality of search-results in experiments with two sites with heterogeneous structures . further , our method does not increase the cost of processing queries when compared to the systems using no structural-information .
