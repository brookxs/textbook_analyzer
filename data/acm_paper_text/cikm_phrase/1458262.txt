sql-extension for exploring multiple tables the standard sql assumes that the users are aware of all tables and their schemas to write queries . this assumption may be valid when the users deal with a relatively small number of tables , but writing a sql-query on a large number of tables is often challenging ; (1) the users do not know what tables are relevant to their query , (2) it is too cumbersome to explicitly list tens of (or even hundreds of) relevant tables in the from clause and (3) the schemas of those tables are not identical . we now propose an intuitive yet powerful extension to sql that helps users explore and aggregate information-spread over a large number of tables .
