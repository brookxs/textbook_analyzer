structure-based querying of proteins using wavelets the ability to retrieve molecules based on structural-similarity has use in many applications , from disease-diagnosis and treatment to drug-discovery and design . in this paper , we present a method to represent protein-molecules that allows for the fast , flexible and efficient retrieval of similar structures , based on either global or local attributes . we begin by computing the pair-wise distance between amino-acids , transforming each 3d-structure into a 2d distance-matrix . we normalize this matrix to a specific size and apply a 2d wavelet-decomposition to generate a set of approximation coefficients , which serves as our global-feature vector . this transformation reduces the overall dimensionality of the data while still preserving spatial features and correlations . we test our method by running queries on three different protein data sets that have been used previously in the literature , basing our comparisons on labels taken from the scop database . we find that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches , in terms of retrieval-accuracy , memory-utilization and execution-time . specifically , using a k-d-tree and running a 10-nearest-neighbor search on a dataset of 33,000 proteins against itself , we see an average accuracy of 89 \ % at the scop superfamily level and a total query time that is up to 350 times faster than previously published techniques . in addition to processing queries based on global similarity , we also propose innovative extensions to effectively match proteins based solely on shared local substructures , allowing for a more flexible-query interface .
