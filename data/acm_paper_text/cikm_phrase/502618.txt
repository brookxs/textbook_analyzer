approaches to collection-selection and results-merging for distributed-information-retrieval we have investigated two major issues in distributed-information-retrieval (dir) , namely : collection-selection and search-results merging . while most published works on these two issues are based on pre-stored metadata , the approaches described in this paper involve extracting the required information at the time the query is processed . in order to predict the relevance of collections to a given query , we analyse a limited number of full documents (e.g. , the top five documents) retrieved from each collection and then consider term-proximity within them . on the other hand , our merging technique is rather simple since input only requires document scores and lengths of results lists . our experiments evaluate the retrieval-effectiveness of these approaches and compare them with centralised indexing and various other dir techniques (e.g. , cori) . we conducted our experiments using two testbeds : one containing news-articles extracted from four different sources (2 gb) and another containing 10 gb of web-pages . our evaluations demonstrate that the retrieval-effectiveness of our simple approaches is worth considering .
