to swing or not to swing : learning when (not) to advertise web textual advertising can be interpreted as a search-problem over the corpus of ads available for display in a particular context . in contrast to conventional information-retrieval-systems , which always return results if the corpus contains any documents lexically related to the query , in web-advertising it is acceptable , and occasionally even desirable , not to show any results . when no ads are relevant to the user 's interests , then showing irrelevant ads should be avoided since they annoy the user and produce no economic benefit . in this paper we pose a decision-problem `` whether to swing '' , that is , whether or not to show any of the ads for the incoming request . we propose two methods for addressing this problem , a simple thresholding approach and a machine-learning-approach , which collectively analyzes the set of candidate ads augmented with external-knowledge . our experimental-evaluation , based on over 28,000 editorial-judgments , shows that we are able to predict , with high accuracy , when to `` swing '' for both content-match and sponsored-search advertising .
