path-hop : efficiently indexing large-graphs for reachability-queries graph-reachability is a fundamental research problem that finds its use in many applications such as geographic navigation , bioinformatics , web-ontologies and xml-databases , etc. . given two vertices , u and v , in a directed-graph , a reachability-query asks if there is a directed path from u to v . over the last two decades , many indexing schemes have been proposed to support reachability-queries on large-graphs . typically , those schemes based on chain or tree covers work well when the graph is sparse . for dense graphs , they still have fast-query time but require large storage for their indices . in contrast , the 2-hop cover and its variations/extensions produce compact indices even for dense graphs but have slower query time than those chain/tree covers . in this paper , we propose a new indexing-scheme , called path-hop , which is even more space-efficient than those schemes based on 2-hop cover and yet has query-processing speed comparable to those chain/tree covers . we conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach relative to other state-of-the-art methods .
