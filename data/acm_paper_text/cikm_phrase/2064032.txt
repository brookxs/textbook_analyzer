large-scale-information-retrieval experimentation with terrier this tutorial aims to provide a practical introduction to conducting large-scale-information-retrieval (ir) experiments , using terrier (http://terrier.org) as an experimentation platform . written in java , terrier provides an open-source , feature-rich , flexible , and robust environment for large-scale ir experimentation . this tutorial will cover the experimentation process end-to-end , from configuring terrier to a particular experimental-setting , to efficiently indexing a document-corpus and retrieving from it , and to evaluating the outcome . moreover , it will describe how to use and extend the platform to one 's own needs , and will be illustrated by practical research-driven examples . as a half-day tutorial , it will be split into two major sessions , with each session comprising both background-information and practical demonstrations . in the first session , we will provide an overview of several aspects of large-scale ir experimentation , spanning areas such as indexing , data-structures , query-languages , and advanced retrieval-models , and how these are implemented within terrier . in the second session , we will discuss how to extend terrier to conduct one 's own experiments in a large-scale setting , including how to facilitate the evaluation of non-standard ir tasks through crowdsourcing . the practical demonstrations will cover recent use-cases identified from terrier 's online-discussion-forum , so as to provide attendees with concrete examples of what can be done within terrier .
