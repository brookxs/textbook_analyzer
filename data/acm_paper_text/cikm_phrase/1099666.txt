inferring document-similarity from hyperlinks assessing semantic-similarity between text-documents is a crucial aspect in information-retrieval-systems . in this work , we propose to use hyperlink information to derive a similarity-measure that can then be applied to compare any text-documents , with or without hyperlinks . as linked documents are generally semantically closer than unlinked documents , we use a training-corpus with hyperlinks to infer a function a , b ? sim (a , b) that assigns a higher value to linked documents than to unlinked ones . two sets of experiments on different corpora show that this function compares favorably with okapi matching on document-retrieval tasks .
