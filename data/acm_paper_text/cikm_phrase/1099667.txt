a hybrid-approach to ner by memm and manual rules this paper describes a framework for defining domain-specific feature functions in a user friendly form to be used in a maximum-entropy-markov-model (memm) for the named-entity-recognition (ner) task . our system called merge allows defining general feature function-templates , as well as linguistic rules incorporated into the classifier . the simple way of translating these rules into specific feature functions are shown . we show that merge can perform better from both purely machine-learning_based systems and purely-knowledge_based approaches by some small expert interaction of rule-tuning .
