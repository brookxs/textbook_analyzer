a data-mining system based on sql queries and udfs for relational-databases most research on data-mining has proposed algorithms and optimizations that work on flat files , outside a dbms , mainly due to the following reasons . it is easier to develop efficient-algorithms in a traditional programming-language . the integration of data-mining-algorithms into a dbms is difficult given its relational-model foundation and system-architecture . moreover , sql may be slow and cumbersome for numerical-analysis computations . therefore , data-mining users commonly export data-sets outside the dbms for data-mining processing , which creates a performance-bottleneck and eliminates important data-management capabilities such as query-processing and security , among others (e.g. concurrency-control and fault-tolerance) . with that motivation in mind , we developed a novel system based on sql queries and user-defined-functions (udfs) that can directly analyze relational-tables to compute statistical-models , storing such models as relational-tables as well . most algorithms have been optimized to reduce the number of passes on the data-set . our system can analyze large and high-dimensional-data sets faster than external data-mining tools .
