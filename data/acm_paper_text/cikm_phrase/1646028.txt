frequent-subgraph pattern-mining on uncertain-graph data graph-data are subject to uncertainties in many applications due to incompleteness and imprecision of data . mining uncertain-graph data is semantically different from and computationally more challenging than mining exact graph-data . this paper investigates the problem of mining frequent subgraph patterns from uncertain-graph data . the frequent-subgraph pattern-mining problem is formalized by designing a new measure called expected-support . an approximate mining algorithm is proposed to find an approximate set of frequent-subgraph patterns by allowing an error-tolerance on the expected supports of the discovered subgraph patterns . the algorithm uses an efficient approximation algorithm to determine whether a subgraph-pattern can be output or not . the analytical and experimental-results show that the algorithm is very efficient , accurate and scalable for large uncertain-graph databases .
