on the feasibility of multi-site-web-search-engines web-search-engines are often implemented as centralized systems . designing and implementing a web-search-engine in a distributed-environment is a challenging engineering task that encompasses many interesting research-questions . however , distributing a search-engine across multiple sites has several advantages , such as utilizing less compute resources and exploiting data-locality . in this paper we investigate the cost-effectiveness of building a distributed-web-search engine . we propose a model for assessing the total cost of a distributed-web-search engine that includes the computational costs and the communication-cost among all distributed sites . we then present a query-processing algorithm that maximizes the amount of queries answered locally , without sacrificing the quality of the results compared to a centralized search-engine . we simulate the algorithm on real document-collections and query workloads to measure the actual parameters needed for our cost-model , and we show that a distributed-search engine can be competitive compared to a centralized-architecture with respect to real cost .
