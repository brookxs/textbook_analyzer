causality and responsibility : probabilistic queries revisited in uncertain-databases recently , due to ubiquitous data-uncertainty in many real-life applications , it has become increasingly important to study efficient and effective processing of various probabilistic queries over uncertain-data , which usually retrieve uncertain objects that satisfy query predicates with high probabilities . however , one annoying , yet challenging , problem is that , some probabilistic queries are very sensitive to low-quality objects in uncertain-databases , and the returned query answers might miss some important results (due to low data-quality) . to identify both accurate query answers and those potentially low-quality objects , in this paper , we investigate the causes of query answers/non-answers from a novel angle of causality and responsibility (cr) , and propose a new interpretation of probabilistic queries . particularly , we focus on the problem of cr-based probabilistic nearest-neighbor (cr-pnn) query , and design a general-framework for answering cr-based queries (including cr-pnn) , which can return both query answers with high confidences and low-quality objects that may potentially affect query results (for data-cleaning purposes) . to efficiently process cr-pnn queries , we propose effective pruning strategies to quickly filter out false-alarms , and design efficient-algorithms to obtain cr-pnn answers . extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our proposed approaches .
