labels or attributes ? : rethinking the neighbors for collective-classification in sparsely-labeled networks many classification-tasks involve linked nodes , such as people connected by friendship links . for such networks , accuracy might be increased by including , for each node , the (a) labels or (b) attributes of neighboring-nodes as model features . recent work has focused on option (a) , because early work showed it was more accurate and because option (b) fit poorly with discriminative classifiers . we show , however , that when the network is sparsely labeled , `` relational classification '' based on neighbor attributes often has higher accuracy than `` collective-classification '' based on neighbor labels . moreover , we introduce an efficient method that enables discriminative classifiers to be used with neighbor attributes , yielding further accuracy gains . we show that these effects are consistent across a range of datasets , learning choices , and inference-algorithms , and that using both neighbor attributes and labels often produces the best accuracy .
