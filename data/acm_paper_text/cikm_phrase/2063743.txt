structural link-analysis and prediction in microblogs with hundreds of millions of participants , social-media services have become commonplace . unlike a traditional social-network-service , a microblogging network like twitter is a hybrid-network , combining aspects of both social-networks and information networks . understanding the structure of such hybrid-networks and predicting new links are important for many tasks such as friend-recommendation , community-detection , and modeling network growth . we note that the link-prediction problem in a hybrid-network is different from previously studied networks . unlike the information-networks and traditional online-social-networks , the structures in a hybrid-network are more complicated and informative . we compare most popular and recent methods and principles for link-prediction and recommendation . finally we propose a novel structure-based personalized link-prediction model and compare its predictive performance against many fundamental and popular link-prediction methods on real-world-data from the twitter microblogging network . our experiments on both static and dynamic data-sets show that our methods noticeably outperform the state-of-the-art .
