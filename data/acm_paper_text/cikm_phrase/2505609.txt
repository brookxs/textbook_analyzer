dyadic event attribution in social-networks with mixtures of hawkes processes in many applications in social-network-analysis , it is important to model the interactions and infer the influence between pairs of actors , leading to the problem of dyadic event-modeling which has attracted increasing interests recently . in this paper we focus on the problem of dyadic event attribution , an important missing-data problem in dyadic event-modeling where one needs to infer the missing actor-pairs of a subset of dyadic events based on their observed timestamps . existing works either use fixed model-parameters and heuristic-rules for event attribution , or assume the dyadic events across actor-pairs are independent . to address those shortcomings we propose a probabilistic-model based on mixtures of hawkes processes that simultaneously tackles event attribution and network parameter inference , taking into consideration the dependency among dyadic events that share at least one actor . we also investigate using additive-models to incorporate regularization to avoid overfitting . our experiments on both synthetic and real-world-data sets on international armed conflicts suggest that the proposed new method is capable of significantly improve accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art for dyadic event attribution .
