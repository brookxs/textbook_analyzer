local replication for proxy web-caches with hash routing this paper studies controlled local replication for hash routing , such as carp , among a collection of loosely-coupled proxy web cache servers . hash routing partitions the entire url space among the shared web caches , creating a single logical cache . each partition is assigned to a cache server . duplication of cache contents is eliminated and total incoming traffic to the shared web caches is minimized . client requests for non-assigned-partition objects are forwarded to sibling caches . however , request forwarding increases not only inter-cache traffic but also cpu-utilization , thus slows the client response-time . we propose a controlled local replication of non-assigned-partition objects in each cache server to effectively reduce the inter-cache traffic . we use a multiple-exit lru to implement controlled local replication . trace-driven-simulations are conducted to study the performance-impact of local replication . the results show that (1) regardless of cache sizes , with a controlled local replication , the average-response-time , inter-cache traffic and cpu-overhead can be effectively reduced without noticeable increases in incoming traffic ; (2) for very-large cache sizes , a larger amount of local replication can be allowed to reduce inter-cache traffic without increasing incoming traffic ; and (3) local replication is effective even if clients are dynamically assigned to different cache servers .
