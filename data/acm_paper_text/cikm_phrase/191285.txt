logicbase : a deductive-database system-prototype a deductive-database system-prototype , logicbase , has been developed , with an emphasis on efficient compilation and query-evaluation of application-oriented recursions in deductive-databases . the system identifies different classes of recursions and compiles recursions into chain or psuedo-chain forms when appropriate . queries posed to the compiled recursions are analyzed systematically with efficient evaluation plans generated and executed , mainly based on a chained-based query-evaluation method . the system has been tested using sophisticated recursions and queries with satisfactory performance . this paper introduces the general design principles and implementation-techniques of the system and discusses its strength and limitations .
