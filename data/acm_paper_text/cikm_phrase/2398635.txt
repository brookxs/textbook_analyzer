an efficient and simple under-sampling technique for imbalanced time-series-classification imbalanced time-series-classification (tsc) involving many real-world-applications has increasingly captured attention of researchers . previous work has proposed an intelligent-structure preserving over-sampling method (spo) , which the authors claimed achieved better performance than other existing over-sampling and state-of-the-art methods in tsc . the main disadvantage of over-sampling methods is that they significantly increase the computational cost of training a classification-model due to the addition of new minority class instances to balance data-sets with high-dimensional features . these challenging issues have motivated us to find a simple and efficient-solution for imbalanced tsc . statistical-tests are applied to validate our conclusions . the experimental-results demonstrate that this proposed simple random under-sampling technique with svm is efficient and can achieve results that compare favorably with the existing complicated spo method for imbalanced tsc .
