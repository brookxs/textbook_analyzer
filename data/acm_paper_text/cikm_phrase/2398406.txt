an effective rule miner for instance-matching in a web-of-data publishing structured-data and linking them to linking-open-data (lod) is an ongoing effort to create a web-of-data . each newly involved data source may contain duplicated instances (entities) whose descriptions or schemata differ from those of the existing sources in lod . to tackle this heterogeneity issue , several matching methods have been developed to link equivalent entities together . many general-purpose matching methods which focus on similarity-metrics suffer from very diverse matching results for different data source pairs . on the other hand , the dataset-specific ones leverage heuristic-rules or even manual efforts to ensure the quality , which makes it impossible to apply them to other sources or domains . in this paper , we offer a third choice , a general method of automatically discovering dataset-specific matching rules . in particular , we propose a semi-supervised-learning algorithm to iteratively refine matching rules and find new matches of high confidence based on these rules . this dramatically relieves the burden on users of defining rules but still gives high-quality matching results . we carry out experiments on real-world large-scale-data sources in lod ; the results show the effectiveness of our approach in terms of the precision of discovered matches and the number of missing matches found . furthermore , we discuss several extensions (like similarity embedded rules , class restriction and sparql rewriting) to fit various applications with different requirements .
