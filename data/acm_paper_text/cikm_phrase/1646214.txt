kernel latent-semantic-analysis using an information-retrieval_based kernel hidden term-relationships can be found within a document-collection using latent-semantic-analysis (lsa) and can be used to assist in information-retrieval . lsa uses the inner-product as its similarity-function , which unfortunately introduces bias due to document-length and term rarity into the term-relationships . in this article , we present the novel kernel_based lsa method , which uses separate document and query kernel-functions to compute document and query similarities , rather than the inner-product . we show that by providing an appropriate kernel-function , we are able to provide a better fit of our data and hence produce more effective term-relationships .
