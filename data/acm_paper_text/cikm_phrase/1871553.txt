orientation distance-based discriminative-feature extraction for multi-class-classification feature-extraction is an effective step in data-mining and machine-learning . while many feature-extraction methods have been proposed for clustering , classification and regression , very limited work has been done on multi-class-classification problems . in fact , the accuracy of multi-class-classification problems relies on well-extracted features , the modeling part aside . this paper proposes a new feature-extraction method , namely extracting orientation distance-based discriminative (odd) features , which is particularly designed for multi-class-classification problems . the proposed method works in two steps . in the first step , we extend the fisher discriminant idea to determine more appropriate kernel-function and map the input data with all classes into a feature-space . in the second step , the odd features are extracted based on the one-vs-all scheme to generate discriminative-features between a pattern and each hyperplane . these newly extracted features are treated as the representative features and are further used in the subsequent classification procedure . substantial experiments on both uci and real-world datasets have been conducted to investigate the performance of odd features_based multi-class-classification . the statistical results show that the classification-accuracy based on odd features outperforms that of the state-of-the-art feature-extraction methods .
