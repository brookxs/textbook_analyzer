automated index management for distributed-web-search distributed heterogeneous search systems are an emerging phenomenon in web-search , in which independent topic-specific search-engines provide search-services , and metasearchers distribute user 's queries to only the most suitable search-engines . previous research has investigated methods for engine selection and merging of search-results (i.e. performance-improvements from the user 's perspective) . we focus instead on performance from the service-provider 's point-of-view (e.g , income from queries processed vs. resources used to answer them) . we consider a scenario in which individual search-engines compete for user queries by choosing which documents (topics) to index . the difficulty here stems from the fact that the utilities of local engine actions should depend on the uncertain actions of competitors . thus , naive strategies (e.g , blindly indexing lots of popular documents) are ineffective . we model the competition between search-engines as a stochastic-game , and propose a reinforcement-learning approach to managing search-index contents . we evaluate our approach using a large log of user queries to 47 real search-engines .
