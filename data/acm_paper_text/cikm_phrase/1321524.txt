reasoning about vague topological information topological information plays a fundamental role in the human-perception of spatial configurations and is thereby one of the most prominent geographical features in natural-language . as vagueness abounds in geography , flexible formalisms with the ability to capture vague topological information are often needed in practice . while such formalisms have already been introduced by various authors , complete reasoning procedures are usually not discussed . in this paper , we show how many interesting reasoning tasks , such as consistency-checking and entailment checking , can be supported in a generalization of the well-known rcc-8 calculus . in particular , we present decision-procedures based on linear-programming , solving all reasoning tasks of interest . we furthermore show how deciding the consistency of vague topological information can be reduced to the consistency problem of the original rcc-8 .
