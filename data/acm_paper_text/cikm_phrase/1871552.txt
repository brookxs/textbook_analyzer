a probabilistic topic-connection model for automatic-image-annotation the explosive increase of image-data on internet has made it an important , yet very challenging task to index and automatically annotate image-data . to achieve that end , sophisticated algorithms and models have been proposed to study the correlation between image-content and corresponding text description . despite the success of previous works , however , researchers are still facing two major difficulties that may undermine their effort of providing reliable and accurate annotations for images . the first difficulty is lacking of comprehensive benchmark image dataset with high-quality-text descriptions . the second difficulty is lacking of effective way to represent the image-content and make it associate with the text descriptions . in our paper , we aim to deal with both problems . to deal with the first problem , we utilize wikipedia as external-knowledge-source and enrich the ontology structure of imagenet database with comprehensive and highly-reliable text descriptions from wikipedia articles . to address the second problem , we develop a probabilistic topic-connection (ptc) model to represent the connection between latent-semantic topic in text description and latent patterns from image-feature space . we compare the performance of our model with the currently popular correspondence lda (corr-lda) model under the same automatic-image-annotation scenario using cross-validation . experimental-results demonstrate that our model is able to well represent the connection between latent-semantic topics and latent patterns in image-feature space , thus facilitates knowledge-organization and understanding of both image-and-text descriptions .
