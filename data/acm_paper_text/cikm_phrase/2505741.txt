parallel triangle-counting in massive streaming graphs the number of triangles in a graph is a fundamental metric widely used in social-network-analysis , link-classification and recommendation , and more . in these applications , modern graphs of interest tend to both large and dynamic . this paper presents the design and implementation of a fast parallel-algorithm for estimating the number of triangles in a massive undirected-graph whose edges arrive as a stream . our algorithm is designed for shared-memory multicore machines and can make efficient use of parallelism and the memory-hierarchy . we provide theoretical guarantees on performance and accuracy , and our experiments on real-world datasets show accurate results and substantial speedups compared to an optimized sequential implementation .
