multi-faceted ranking of news-articles using post-read actions personalized article recommendation is important for news portals to improve user-engagement . existing work quantifies engagement primarily through click rates . we suggest that quality of recommendations may be improved by exploiting different types of `` post-read '' engagement signals like sharing , commenting , printing and e-mailing article links . specifically , we propose a multi-faceted ranking problem for recommending articles , where each facet corresponds to a ranking task that seeks to maximize actions of a particular post-read type (e.g. , ranking articles to maximize sharing actions) . our approach is to predict the probability that a user would take a post-read action on an article , so that articles can be ranked according to such probabilities . however , post-read actions are rare-events -- enormous data-sparsity makes the problem challenging . we meet the challenge by exploiting correlations across different post-read action types through a novel locally augmented tensor (lat) model , so that the ranking-performance of a particular action-type can be improved by leveraging data from all other action types . through extensive experiments , we show that our lat model significantly outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art factor-models , logistic-regression and ir-models .
