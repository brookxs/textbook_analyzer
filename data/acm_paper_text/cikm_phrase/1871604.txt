skyline-query processing for uncertain-data recently , several research efforts have addressed answering skyline-queries efficiently over large-datasets . however , this research lacks methods to compute these queries over uncertain-data , where uncertain values are represented as a range . in this paper , we define skyline-queries over continuous uncertain-data , and propose a novel , efficient framework to answer these queries . query answers are probabilistic , where each object is associated with a probability-value of being a query answer . typically , users specify a probability threshold , that each returned object must exceed , and a tolerance value that defines the allowed error-margin in probability calculation to reduce the computational-overhead . our framework employs an efficient two-phase query-processing algorithm .
