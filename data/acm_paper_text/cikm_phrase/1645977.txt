a translation-model for matching reviews to objects we develop a generic method for the review-matching problem , which is to match unstructured-text reviews to a list of objects , where each object has a set of attributes . to this end , we propose a translation-model for generating reviews from a structured-description of objects . we develop an em-based method to estimate the model-parameters and use this model to find , given a review , the object most likely to be the topic of the review . we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale-datasets : a collection of restaurant reviews from yelp and a collection of movie-reviews from imdb . the experiments show that our translation model-based-method is superior to traditional tf-idf based methods as well as a recent mixture model-based-method for the review-matching problem .
