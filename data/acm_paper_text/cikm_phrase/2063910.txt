beyond precision@10: clustering the-long-tail of web-search-results the paper addresses the missing user-acceptance of web-search result-clustering . we report on selected analyses and propose new concepts to improve existing result-clustering approaches . our findings in a nutshell are : 1 . do n't compete with a search-engine 's top hits . in response to a query we presume search-engines to return an optimal result list in the sense of the probabilistic-ranking principle : documents that are expected by the majority of users are placed on top and form the result list head . we argue that , with respect to the top results , it is not beneficial to replace this established form of result-presentation . 2 . improve document access in the result list tail . documents that address the information-need of `` minorities '' appear at some position in the result list tail . especially for ambiguous and multi-faceted queries we expect this tail to be long , with many users appreciating different documents . in this situation web-search result-clustering can improve user-satisfaction by reorganizing the-long-tail into topic-specific clusters . 3 . avoid shadowing when constructing cluster-labels . we show that most of the cluster-labels that are generated by current clustering-technology occur within the snippets of the result list head -- an effect which we call shadowing . the value of such labels for topic organization and navigating within a clustering of the entire result list is limited . we propose and analyze a filtering approach to significantly alleviate the label shadowing effect .
