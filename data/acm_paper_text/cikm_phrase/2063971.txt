top-k most influential locations selection we propose and study a new type of facility-location selection-query , the top-k most influential-location selection-query . given a set m of customers and a set f of existing facilities , this query finds k locations from a set c of candidate locations with the largest influence values , where the influence of a candidate location c (c in c) is defined as the number of customers in m who are the reverse-nearest-neighbors of c . we first present a naive algorithm to process the query . however , the algorithm is computationally expensive and not scalable to large-datasets . this motivates us to explore more efficient solutions . we propose two branch-and-bound-algorithms , the estimation expanding pruning (eep) algorithm and the bounding influence pruning (bip) algorithm . these algorithms exploit various geometric properties to prune the search-space , and thus achieve much better performance than that of the naive algorithm . specifically , the eep algorithm estimates the distances to the nearest existing facilities for the customers and the numbers of influenced customers for the candidate locations , and then gradually refines the estimation until the answer set is found , during which distance-metric_based pruning techniques are used to improve the refinement efficiency . bip only estimates the numbers of influenced customers for the candidate locations . but it uses the existing facilities to limit the space for searching the influenced customers and achieve a better estimation , which results in an even more efficient-algorithm . extensive experiments conducted on both real and synthetic datasets validate the efficiency of the algorithms .
