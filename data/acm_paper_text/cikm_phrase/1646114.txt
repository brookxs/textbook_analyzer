a term dependency-based approach for query-terms-ranking formulating appropriate and effective queries has been regarded as a challenging issue , since a large number of candidate words or phrases could be chosen as query terms to convey users ' information-needs . in this paper , we propose an approach to rank a set of given query terms according their effectiveness , wherein top ranked terms will be selected as an effective query . our ranking approach exploits and benefits from the underlying relationship between the query terms , and thereby the effective terms can be properly combined into the query . two regression-models which capture a rich set of linguistic and statistical-properties are used in our approach . experiments on ntcir-4 ad-hoc-retrieval tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve retrieval-performance , and can be well applied to other problems such as query-expansion and querying by text-segments .
