coreference aware web-object retrieval as user demands become increasingly sophisticated , search-engines today are competing in more than just returning document results from the-web . one area of competition is providing web-object results from structured-data extracted from a multitude of information-sources . we address the problem of performing keyword-retrieval over a collection of objects containing a large degree of duplication as different web-based-information-sources provide descriptions of the same object . we develop a method for coreference aware retrieval that performs topic-specific coreference-resolution on retrieved objects in order to improve object-search results . our results demonstrate that coreference has a significant impact on the effectiveness of retrieval in the domain of local-search . our results show that a coreference aware system outperforms naive object-retrieval by more than 20 \ % in p5 and p10 .
