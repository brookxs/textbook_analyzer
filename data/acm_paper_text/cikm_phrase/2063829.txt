spreadsheet-based complex-data transformation spreadsheets are used by millions of users as a routine all-purpose data-management tool . it is now increasingly necessary for external applications and services to consume spreadsheet data . in this paper , we investigate the problem of transforming spreadsheet data to structured formats required by these applications and services . unlike prior methods , we propose a novel approach in which transformation logic is embedded into a familiar and expressive spreadsheet-like formula mapping language . popular transformation patterns provided by transformation-languages and mapping-tools , that are relevant to spreadsheet-based data-transformation , are supported in the language via formulas . consequently , the language avoids cluttering the source spreadsheets with transformations and turns out to be helpful when multiple schemas are targeted . we implemented a prototype and evaluated the benefits of our approach via experiments in a real application . the experimental-results confirmed the benefits of our approach .
