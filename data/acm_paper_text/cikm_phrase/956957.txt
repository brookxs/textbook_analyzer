industrial evaluation of a highly-accurate academic ir-system in this paper we report the results of an independent experimental-evaluation of an information-retrieval (ir) system developed at the illinois institute of technology (iit) . the system , which is called the advanced information retrieval-engine (aire) , consists of a set of tools and utilities providing indexing , extraction , searching and visualization . we evaluated aire on three data-sets from the text-retrieval-conference (trec) - trec 8 , 9 and 10 . overall , our results indicate that aire is a highly accurate ir-system . compared with results published by iit , in our experiments aire consistently scored higher in recall . aire also scored higher in precision , but only for automatic tasks . in manual tasks , aire scored lower in precision in our experiments , but we attributed that to factors external to aire . our final conclusion is that aire is a highly accurate ir-system .
