using opinion-based features to boost sentence-retrieval opinion-mining has become recently a major research-topic . a wide range of techniques have been proposed to enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems . however , little is known about the ability of opinion-related information to improve regular retrieval tasks . our hypothesis is that standard retrieval-methods might benefit from the inclusion of opinion-based features . a sentence-retrieval scenario is a natural choice to evaluate this claim . we propose here a formal-method to incorporate some opinion-based features of the sentences as query-independent evidence . we show that this incorporation leads to retrieval-methods whose performance is significantly better than the the performance of state-of-the-art sentence-retrieval models .
