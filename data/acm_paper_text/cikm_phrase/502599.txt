approximately common patterns in shared-forests we present a proposal intended to demonstrate the applicability of tabulation techniques for detecting approximately common patterns when dealing with structures sharing some common parts . this sharing saves on the space needed to represent the structures and also on their later processing , by factorizing the filtering of substructure matching . as a consequence , preliminary experimental tests indicate a reduction of the running-time .
