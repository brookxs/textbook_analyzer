a latent pairwise-preference learning-approach for recommendation from implicit-feedback most of the current recommender-systems heavily rely on explicit-user-feedback such as ratings on items to model users ' interests . however , in many applications , it is very hard to collect the explicit-feedback , while implicit-feedback such as user-clicks may be more available . furthermore , it is often more suitable for many recommender-systems to address a ranking problem than a rating predicting problem . this paper proposes a latent pairwise-preference learning (lppl) approach for recommendation with implicit-feedback . lppl directly models user-preferences with respect to a set of items rather than the rating scores on individual items , which are modeled with a set-of-features by analyzing clickthrough-data available in many real-world recommender-systems . the lppl approach models both the latent-variables of group-structure of users and the pairwise preferences simultaneously . we conduct experiments on the testbed from a real-world recommender-system and demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively improve the recommendation-performance against several baseline algorithms .
