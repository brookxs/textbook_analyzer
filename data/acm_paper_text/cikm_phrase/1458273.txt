nested region-algebra extended with variables for tag-annotated-text search this paper presents a framework for searching text regions with specifying annotated information in tag-annotated-text by using region-algebra . we extend the efficient-algorithm for region-algebra to handle both nested and crossed regions and introduce variables for attribute values to treat tag-annotations in which attributes indicate another tag regions . our framework have been implemented in a text-search-engine for medline , which is a large textbase of abstracts in medical-science . experiments in tag-annotated medline abstracts demonstrate the effectiveness of specifying annotations and the efficiency of our framework .
