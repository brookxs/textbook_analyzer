voting for candidates : adapting data-fusion techniques for an expert-search task in an expert-search task , the users ' need is to identify people who have relevant expertise to a topic of interest . an expert-search system predicts and ranks the expertise of a set of candidate persons with respect to the users ' query . in this paper , we propose a novel approach for predicting and ranking-candidate expertise with respect to a query . we see the problem of ranking experts as a voting problem , which we model by adapting eleven data-fusion techniques.we investigate the effectiveness of the voting approach and the associated data-fusion techniques across a range of document-weighting models , in the context of the trec 2005 enterprise track . the evaluation results show that the voting paradigm is very effective , without using any collection specific heuristics . moreover , we show that improving the quality of the underlying document-representation can significantly improve the retrieval-performance of the data-fusion techniques on an expert-search task . in particular , we demonstrate that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates . finally , we demonstrate that the relative-performance of the adapted data-fusion techniques for the proposed approach is stable regardless of the used weighting models .
