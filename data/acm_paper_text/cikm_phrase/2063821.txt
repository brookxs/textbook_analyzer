adding structure to top-k : from items to expansions keyword_based search-interfaces are extremely popular as a means for efficiently discovering items of interest from a huge collection , as evidenced by the success of search-engines like google and bing . however , most of the current search-services still return results as a flat ranked list of items . considering the huge number of items which can match a query , this list_based interface can be very difficult for the user to explore and find important items relevant to their search needs . in this work , we consider a search scenario in which each item is annotated with a set of keywords . e.g. , in web-2.0 enabled systems such as flickr and del.icio.us , it is common for users to tag items with keywords . based on this annotation information , we can automatically group query result items into different expansions of the query corresponding to subsets of keywords . we formulate and motivate this problem within a top-k-query-processing framework , but as that of finding the top-k most important expansions . then we study additional desirable properties for the set of expansions returned , and formulate the problem as an optimization-problem of finding the best k expansions satisfying all the desirable properties . we propose several efficient-algorithms for this problem . our problem is similar in spirit to recent works on automatic facets generation , but has the important difference and advantage that we do n't need to assume the existence of pre-defined categorical hierarchy which is critical for these works . through extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets , we show our proposed algorithms are both effective and efficient .
