spectral-analysis of a blogosphere a blogosphere is a representative example of online-social-networks . in this paper , we address spectral-analysis of a blogosphere . we model a real-world blogosphere as a matrix and a tensor , and then analyze it by using the svd and parafac-decomposition . according to the results , the svd successfully identified communities , each of which focuses on a specific topic , and also found hub blogs and authoritative posts within each community . the parafac-decomposition also succeeded in extracting more communities of finer granules than the svd . also , the parafac-decomposition could identify the dominant keywords in addition to the hub blogs and authoritative posts honored in each community .
