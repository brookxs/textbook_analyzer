location-selection for utility-maximization with capacity constraints given a set of client locations , a set of facility locations where each facility has a service-capacity , and the assumptions that : (i) a client seeks service from its nearest facility ; (ii) a facility provides service to clients in the order of their proximity , we study the problem of selecting all possible locations such that setting-up a new facility with a given capacity at these locations will maximize the number of served clients . this problem has wide applications in practice , such as setting-up new distribution centers for online sales business and building additional base-stations for mobile subscribers . we formulate the problem as location-selection query for utility-maximization . after applying three pruning rules to a baseline solution , we obtain an efficient-algorithm to answer the query . extensive experiments confirm the efficiency of our proposed algorithm .
