query-optimization using restructured-views we study optimization of relational queries using materialized-views , where views may be regular or restructured . in a restructured view , some data from the base table (s) are represented as metadata - that is , schema information , such as table and attribute names - or vice versa.using restructured-views in query-optimization opens up a new spectrum of views that were not previously available , and can result in significant additional savings in query-evaluation costs . these savings can be obtained due to a significantly larger set of views to choose from , and may involve reduced table sizes , elimination of self-joins , clustering produced by restructuring , and horizontal partitioning.in this paper we propose a general query-optimization framework that treats regular and restructured-views in a uniform manner and is applicable to sql select-project-join queries and views with or without aggregation . within the framework we provide (1) algorithms to determine when a view (regular or restructured) is usable in answering a query , and (2) algorithms to rewrite a query using usable views.semantic information , such as knowledge of the key of a view , can be used to further optimize a rewritten query . within our general query-optimization framework , we develop techniques for determining the key of a (regular or restructured) view , and show how this information can be used to further optimize a rewritten query . it is straightforward to integrate all our algorithms and techniques into standard query-optimization algorithms .
