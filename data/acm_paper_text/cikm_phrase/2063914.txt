collaborative blacklist generation via searches-and-clicks this paper presents an intent conformity model to collaboratively generate blacklists for cyberporn filtering . a novel porn detection-framework via searches-and-clicks is proposed to explore collective-intelligence embedded in query-logs . firstly , the clicked pages are represented in terms of the weighted queries to reflect the degrees related to pornography . consequently , these weighted queries are regarded as discriminative-features to calculate the pornography indicator by an inverse chi-square method for candidate determination . finally , a candidate whose url contains at least one pornographic keyword is included in our collaborative blacklists . the experiments on a msn porn data-set indicate that the generated blacklist achieves a high precision , while maintaining a favorably low false positive rate . in addition , real-life filtering simulations reveal that our blacklist is more effective than some publicly released blacklists .
