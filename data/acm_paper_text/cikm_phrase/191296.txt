a pattern-matching language for spatio-temporal-databases we propose a pattern-matching language for spatio-temporal-databases . the matching-process in time-dimension is based upon the evolutionary nature of time , but in spatial dimension it is based on placement , shape and sizes of regions . the concept of pattern-matching introduced in this paper is independent of the choice of the underlying model for spatio-temporal-databases . in particular , the pattern-matching language seamlessly extends our sql-like query-language parasql for spatio-temporal-databases . the pattern-matching language would also have application in active-databases , because patterns can be used as triggers .
