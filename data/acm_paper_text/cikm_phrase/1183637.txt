classification spanning correlated-data streams in many applications , classifiers need to be built based on multiple related data-streams . for example , stock streams and news-streams are related , where the classification patterns may involve features from both streams . thus instead of mining on a single isolated stream , we need to examine multiple related data-streams in order to find such patterns and build an accurate classifier . other examples of related streams include traffic reports and car accidents , sensor readings of different types or at different locations , etc. . in this paper , we consider the classification-problem defined over sliding-window join of several input data streams . as the data-streams arrive in fast pace and the many-to-many join relationship blows up the data arrival rate even more , it is impractical to compute the join and then build the classifier each time the window slides forward . we present an efficient-algorithm to build a na ve-bayesian-classifier in such context . our method does not need to perform the join operations but is still able to build exactly the same classifier as if built on the joined result . it only examines each input tuple twice , independent of the number of tuples it joins in other streams , therefore , is able to keep pace with the fast arriving data-streams in the presence of many-to-many join relationships . the experiments confirmed that our classification-algorithm is more efficient than conventional methods while maintaining good classification-accuracy .
