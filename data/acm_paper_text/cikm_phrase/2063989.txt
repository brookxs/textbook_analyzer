insert-friendly xml containment-labeling-scheme the labeling-scheme is designed to label the xml nodes so that both ordered and un-ordered queries can be processed without accessing the original xml file . when xml-data become dynamic , it is important to design a labeling-scheme that can facilitate updates and support query-processing efficiently . in this paper , we propose a novel containment-labeling-scheme called dxcl (dynamic-xml containment labeling) to effectively process updating in dynamic-xml-data . compared with the existing dynamic-labeling schemes , a distinguishing feature of dxcl is that dxcl is compact and efficient regardless of whether the documents are updated or not . dxcl uses fixed length integer numbers to label initial xml-documents and hence yields compact label size and high query-performance . when updates take place , dxcl also has high-performance on both label updates and query-processing especially in the case of skewed insertions . experimental-results conform the benefits of our approach over the previous dynamic schemes .
