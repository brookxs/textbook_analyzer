linda : distributed web-of-data-scale entity-matching linked-data has emerged as a powerful way of interconnecting structured-data on the web . however , the cross-linkage between linked-data sources is not as extensive as one would hope for . in this paper , we formalize the task of automatically creating `` sameas '' links across data sources in a globally consistent manner . our algorithm , presented in a multi-core as well as a distributed version , achieves this link-generation by accounting for joint evidence of a match . experiments confirm that our system scales beyond 100 million entities and delivers highly accurate results despite the vast heterogeneity and daunting scale .
