ming : mining informative entity-relationship subgraphs many modern applications are faced with the task of knowledge-discovery in entity-relationship graphs , such as domain-specific-knowledge bases or social-networks . mining an `` informative '' subgraph that can explain the relations between k (> = 2) given entities of interest is a frequent knowledge-discovery scenario on such graphs . we present ming , a principled method for extracting an informative subgraph for given query nodes . ming builds on a new notion of informativeness of nodes . this is used in a random-walk-with-restarts process to compute the informativeness of entire subgraphs .
