efficient runtime generation of association-rules-mining frequent-patterns in transaction databases has been a popular subject in data-mining research . common activities include finding patterns in database transactions , times-series , and exceptions . the apriori-algorithm is a widely accepted method of generating frequent-patterns . the algorithm can require many scans of the database and can seriously tax resources . new methods of finding association-rules , such as the frequent-pattern tree (fp-tree) have improved performance , but still have problems when new data becomes available and require two scans of the database.this paper proposes a new method , which requires only one scan of the database and supports update of patterns when new data becomes available . we design a new structure called pattern repository (pr) , which stores all of the relevant-information in a highly compact form and allows direct derivation of the fp-tree and association-rules quickly with a minimum of resources . in addition , it supports run-time generation of association-rules by considering only those patterns that meet on-line data requirements .
