extremely fast text feature extraction for classification and indexing most research in speeding up text-mining involves algorithmic improvements to induction algorithms , and yet for many large-scale-applications , such as classifying or indexing large document repositories , the time spent extracting word-features from texts can itself greatly exceed the initial training-time . this paper describes a fast method for text feature extraction that folds together unicode conversion , forced lowercasing , word-boundary-detection , and string hash computation . we show empirically that our integer hash features result in classifiers with equivalent statistical-performance to those built using string word-features , but require far less computation and less memory .
