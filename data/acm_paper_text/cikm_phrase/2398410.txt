segmenting web-domains and hashtags using length specific models segmentation of a string of english-language characters into a sequence of words has many applications . here , we study two applications in the internet domain . first application is the-web domain segmentation which is crucial for monetization of broken-urls . secondly , we propose and study a novel application of twitter hashtag segmentation for increasing recall on twitter searches . existing methods for word-segmentation use unsupervised language models . we find that when using multiple corpora , the joint-probability-model from multiple corpora performs significantly better than the individual corpora . motivated by this , we propose weighted joint-probability-model , with weights specific to each corpus . we propose to train the weights in a supervised manner using max-margin methods . the supervised probability-models improve segmentation-accuracy over joint-probability models . finally , we observe that length of segments is an important parameter for word-segmentation , and incorporate length-specific weights into our model . the length specific models further improve segmentation-accuracy over supervised probability-models . for all models proposed here , inference-problem can be solved using the dynamic-programming-algorithm . we test our methods on five different datasets , two from web domains data , and three from news-headlines data from an ldc dataset . the supervised length specific models show significant improvements over unsupervised single corpus and joint-probability models . cross-testing between the datasets confirm that supervised probability-models trained on all datasets , and length specific models trained on news-headlines data , generalize well . segmentation of hashtags result in significant improvement in recall on searches for twitter trends .
