frem : fast and robust em-clustering for large-data-sets clustering is a fundamental data-mining technique . this article presents an improved em-algorithm to cluster large-data-sets having high-dimensionality , noise and zero variance problems . the algorithm incorporates improvements to increase the quality of solutions and speed . in general the algorithm can find a good clustering solution in 3 scans over the data-set . alternatively , it can be run until it converges . the algorithm has a few parameters that are easy to set and have defaults for most cases . the proposed algorithm is compared against the standard em-algorithm and the on-line em-algorithm .
