a fast unified optimal route query-evaluation algorithm we investigate the problem of how to evaluate , fast and efficiently , classes of optimal-route-queries on a massive graph in a unified-framework . to evaluate a route query effectively , a large-network is partitioned into a collection of fragments , and distances of some optimal routes in the network are pre-computed . under such a setting , we find a unified algorithm that can evaluate classes of optimal-route-queries . the classes that can be processed efficiently are called constraint preserving (cp) which include , among others , shortest-path , forbidden edges , forbidden nodes and ? - autonomy optimal route query classes . we prove the correctness of the unified algorithm . we then turn our attention to the optimization of the proposed algorithm . several pruning and optimization-techniques are derived that minimize the search-time and i/o accesses . we show empirically that these techniques are effective . the proposed optimal route query-evaluation algorithm , with all these techniques incorporated , is compared with a main-memory and a disk-based brute-force cp algorithms . we show experimentally that the proposed unified algorithm outperforms the brute-force algorithms , both in term of cpu-time and i/o cost , by a wide margin .
