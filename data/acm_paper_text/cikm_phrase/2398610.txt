learning-to-rank for hybrid-recommendation most existing recommender-systems can be classified into two categories : collaborative-filtering and content-based-filtering . hybrid-recommender-systems combine the advantages of the two for improved recommendation-performance . traditional recommender-systems are rating-based . however , predicting ratings is an intermediate step towards their ultimate goal of generating rankings or recommendation lists . learning-to-rank is an established means of predicting rankings and has recently demonstrated high promise in improving quality of recommendations . in this paper , we propose lrhr , the first attempt that adapts learning-to-rank to hybrid-recommender-systems . lrhr first defines novel representations for both users and items so that they can be content-comparable . then , lrhr identifies a set of novel meta-level features for learning purposes . finally , lrhr adopts ranksvm , a pairwise learning-to-rank algorithm , to generate recommendation lists of items for users . extensive experiments on benchmarks in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the performance-gain of our approach .
