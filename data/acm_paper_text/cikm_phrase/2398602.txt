optimizing data-migration for cloud-based key-value-stores as one database offloading strategy , elastic key-value-stores are often introduced to speed up the application-performance with dynamic-scalability . since the workload is varied , efficient data-migration with minimal impact in service is critical for the issue of elasticity and scalability . however , due to the new virtualization-technology , real-time and low-latency requirements , data-migration within cloud-based key-value-stores has to face new challenges : effects of vm interference , and the need to trade-off between the two ingredients of migration cost , namely migration time and performance-impact . to fulfill these challenges , in this paper we explore a new approach to optimize the data-migration . explicitly , we build two interference-aware models to predict the migration time and performance-impact for each migration action using statistical-machine-learning , and then create a cost-model to strike a balance between the two ingredients . using the load rebalancing scenario as a case-study , we have designed one cost-aware migration algorithm that utilizes the cost-model to guide the choice of possible migration actions . finally , we demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using yahoo! cloud serving benchmark (ycsb) .
