trust-prediction via aggregating heterogeneous-social-networks along with the increasing popularity of social-web sites , users rely more on the trustworthiness information for many online activities among users . however , such social-network data often suffers from severe data-sparsity and are not able to provide users with enough information . therefore , trust-prediction has emerged as an important topic in social-network research . traditional approaches explore the topology of trust graph . previous research in sociology and our life experience suggest that people who are in the same social circle often exhibit similar behavior and tastes . such ancillary information , is often accessible and therefore could potentially help the trust-prediction . in this paper , we address the link-prediction problem by aggregating heterogeneous-social-networks and propose a novel joint manifold factorization (jmf) method . our new joint learning-model explores the user-group level similarity between correlated graphs and simultaneously learns the individual graph-structure , therefore the shared-structures and patterns from multiple social-networks can be utilized to enhance the prediction tasks . as a result , we not only improve the trust-prediction in the target graph , but also facilitate other information-retrieval-tasks in the auxiliary graphs . to optimize the objective-function , we break down the proposed objective-function into several manageable sub-problems , then further establish the theoretical convergence with the aid of auxiliary function . extensive experiments were conducted on real-world data-sets and all empirical-results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method .
