use of semantics in real life applications semantics has many different definitions in science . in natural-language-processing , there has been much research over the past three decades involving extracting the semantics , the meaning , of natural texts . this has led to entity-recognition (people , places , companies , prices , dates , and events) , and more recently into sentiment-analysis , exploring another level-of-meaning in a text . these techniques are now well understood and robust . results of this research are beginning to appear in products and online sites , finding their way into practical applications . the stage is set for an explosion of semantically savvy applications , from 3d-design , to enhanced web browsing , to social-network aware yellowpages . this talk will explore these paths from research to industry , illustrated by current products on the market .
