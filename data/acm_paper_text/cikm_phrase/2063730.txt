polarity-analysis of texts using discourse-structure sentiment-analysis has applications in many areas and the exploration of its potential has only just begun . we propose pathos , a framework which performs document-sentiment analysis (partly) based on a document 's discourse-structure . we hypothesize that by splitting a text into important and less important text spans , and by subsequently making use of this information by weighting the sentiment conveyed by distinct text spans in accordance with their importance , we can improve the performance of a sentiment classifier . a document 's discourse-structure is obtained by applying rhetorical-structure-theory on sentence-level . when controlling for each considered method 's structural-bias towards positive classifications , weights optimized by a genetic-algorithm yield an improvement in sentiment-classification accuracy and macro-level f1 score on documents of 4.5 \ % and 4.7 \ % , respectively , in comparison to a baseline not taking into account discourse-structure .
