balanced coverage of aspects for text-summarization we propose a new model for the guided text-summarization task . in this task , it is required that a generated summary covers all the aspects , which are predefined for the topic of the given document-cluster ; for example , aspects for the topic `` accidents and natural-disasters '' include what , when , where , why , who affected , damages and countermeasures . we use as a scorer for an aspect , the maximum-entropy-classifier that predicts whether each sentence reflects the aspect or not . we formalize the coverage of the aspects as a max-min problem , which enables a summary to cover aspects in a well-balanced manner . in the max-min problem , the minimum of the aspect scores is going to be maximized so that the summary contains all the aspects as much as possible . furthermore , we integrate the model based on the max-min problem with the maximum-coverage summarization-model , which generates a summary containing as many conceptual units as possible . through the experiments on benchmark datasets for the guided summarization , we show that our model outperforms other approaches in terms of rouge-2 .
