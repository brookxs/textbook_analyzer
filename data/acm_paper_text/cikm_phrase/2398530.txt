ranking news events by influence decay and information fusion for media and users in many cases , people would like to read the news with great importance on the internet . however , what users can grasp covers a very small part compared with the huge amount of news which never stops increasing . in this paper , we try to find what users are most likely to be interested in . we notice that media-focus plays an essential role in distinguishing news topics and user-attention is also an important-factor . therefore , we first propose five strategies which only exploit media-focus to decide news influence impact . then we provide three strategies to combine user-attention with media-focus . meanwhile , we also take four types of interaction between user-attention and media-focus into consideration . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to establish different models for computing influence decay of news topics . experiments show that better influence scores will be achieved by a decay algorithm based on ebbinghaus forgetting curve and information-fusion by considering interactions between user-attention and media-focus .
