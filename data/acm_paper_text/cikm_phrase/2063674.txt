semi-supervised svms for classification with unknown class proportions and a small labeled dataset in the design of practical web-page-classification systems one often encounters a situation in which the labeled training set is created by choosing some examples from each class ; but , the class proportions in this set are not the same as those in the test distribution to which the classifier will be actually applied . the problem is made worse when the amount of training-data is also small . in this paper we explore and adapt binary svm methods that make use of unlabeled-data from the test distribution , viz. , transductive svms (tsvms) and expectation regularization/constraint (er/ec) methods to deal with this situation . we empirically show that when the labeled-training-data is small , tsvm designed using the class ratio tuned by minimizing the loss on the labeled set yields the best performance ; its performance is good even when the deviation between the class ratios of the labeled training set and the test-set is quite large . when the labeled-training-data is sufficiently large , an unsupervised gaussian-mixture-model can be used to get a very good estimate of the class ratio in the test-set ; also , when this estimate is used , both tsvm and ec/er give their best possible performance , with tsvm coming out superior . the ideas in the paper can be easily extended to multi-class svms and maxent models .
