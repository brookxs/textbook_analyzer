topic-sensitive probabilistic-model for expert-finding in question answer communities in this paper , we address the problem of expert-finding in community-question-answering (cqa) . most of the existing approaches attempt to find experts in cqa by means of link-analysis techniques . however , these traditional techniques only consider the link-structure while ignore the topical-similarity among users (askers and answerers) and user-expertise and user-reputation . in this study , we propose a topic-sensitive probabilistic-model , which is an extension of pagerank-algorithm to find experts in cqa . compared to the traditional link-analysis techniques , our proposed method is more effective because it finds the experts by taking into account both the link-structure and the topical-similarity among users . we conduct experiments on real-world data-set from yahoo!-answers . experimental-results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional link-analysis techniques and achieves the state-of-the-art performance for expert-finding in cqa .
