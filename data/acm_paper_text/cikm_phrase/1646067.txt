information-extraction meets relation databases information-extraction from unstructured-text has much in common with querying in databases systems . despite some differences on how data is modeled or represented , the general goal remains the same , i.e. to retrieve data or tag elements that satisfy some user-specified constraints . in recent years , the two paradigms have become much closer thanks to the large volume of data on the world-wide-web and the need for more automated-search tools for information-extraction and often the need for relating the extracted pieces . several developments have contributed to the growth of the area including the work on named-entity-recognition (marked by muc-6 and subsequent conferences) and natural-language-processing , web-information-retrieval and mining , and web-query-languages inspired by the query-languages in the relational world . this panel explores the areas where the two paradigms overlap , the impacts and contributions they have had on each other and the areas that may be open for further research . the panel will bring together researchers who have worked in some established areas that closely relate to extracting structured-information from unstructured-text . in the first (role-playing) round , each panelist will strongly take a side on where the intersection is heading , arguing that one area will subsume the other area in near future . in the second round , the panelists will counter one or two others , pointing out the challenges that one area would be facing in subsuming the other and implications for future-research directions .
