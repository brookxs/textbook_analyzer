boosting social-annotations using propagation this paper is concerned with the problem of boosting social-annotations using propagation , which is also called social propagation . in particular , we focus on propagating social-annotations of web-pages (e.g. , annotations in del.icio.us) . although social-annotations are developing fast , they cover only a small proportion of web-pages on the world-wide-web . to alleviate the low coverage-problem , a general propagation-model based on random surfer is proposed . specifically , four steps are included : basic propagation , multiple-annotation propagation , multiple-link-type propagation , and constraint-guided propagation . experimental-results show that the proposed model is very effective in increasing coverage of annotations as well as preserving property of social-annotations .
