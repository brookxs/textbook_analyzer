structured-learning of two-level dynamic rankings for ambiguous-queries , conventional retrieval-systems are bound by two conflicting goals . on the one hand , they should diversify and strive to present results for as many query-intents as possible . on the other hand , they should provide depth for each intent by displaying more than a single result . since both diversity and depth can not be achieved simultaneously in the conventional static retrieval-model , we propose a new dynamic ranking approach . in particular , our proposed two-level dynamic ranking-model allows users to adapt the ranking through interaction , thus overcoming the constraints of presenting a one-size-fits-all static-ranking . in this model , a user 's interactions with the first-level ranking are used to infer this user 's intent , so that second-level rankings can be inserted to provide more results relevant to this intent . unlike previous dynamic ranking-models , we provide an algorithm to efficiently compute dynamic rankings with provable approximation guarantees . we also propose the first principled algorithm for learning dynamic ranking-functions from training-data . in addition to the theoretical results , we provide empirical evidence demonstrating the gains in retrieval quality over conventional approaches .
