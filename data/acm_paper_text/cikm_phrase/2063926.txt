latent feature-encoding using dyadic and relational-data learning from dyadic and relational-data is a fundamental problem for ir and kdd applications in web and social media domain . basic behaviors and characteristics of users and documents are typically described by a collection of dyads , i.e. , pairs of entities . discriminative-features extracted from such data are essential in exploratory and discriminatory analyses . relational properties of the entities reflect pair-wise similarities and their collective community-structure which are also valuable for discriminative-learning . a challenging aspect of learning from the relational-data in many domains , is that the generative process of relational links appears noisy and is not well described by a stochastic-model . in this paper , we present a principled approach for learning discriminative-features from heterogeneous-sources of dyadic and relational-data . we propose an information-theoretic framework called latent feature-encoding (lfe) which projects the entities and the links to a latent feature-space in the analogy of - encoding . projection is formalized as a maximization of the mutual-information preserved in the latent features , regularized by the compression-rate of encoding . the regularization is emphasized over more probable links to account for the noisiness of the observation . an empirical-evaluation of the proposed method using text and social-media datasets is presented . performances in supervised-and-unsupervised-learning tasks are compared with those of conventional latent feature-extraction methods .
