asking what no one has asked before : using phrase similarities to generate synthetic web-search-queries this paper introduces a method for automatically inferring meaningful , not-yet-submitted queries . the inferred queries fill some of the knowledge gaps between documents , on one hand , and known (i.e. , already-submitted) queries , on the other hand . thus , the inferred queries expand query-logs and increase their coverage . new candidate queries are over-generated from known queries via phrase similarity data , then filtered against the set of known queries . the accuracy of the generated queries is computed using open-domain questions from standard question-answering-evaluation sets . over the ranked-lists of questions inferred for each of the evaluation questions , the precision reaches 0.9 at rank 50 . the set of inferred queries is more than twice as large as the set of input queries .
