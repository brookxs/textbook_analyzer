on the storage-and-retrieval of continuous-media-data continuous-media applications , which require a guaranteed transfer rate of the data , are becoming an integral part of daily computational life . however , conventional file-systems do not provide rate-guarantees , and are therefore not suitable for the storage-and-retrieval of continuous-media-data (e.g. , audio , video) . to meet the demands of these new-applications , continuous-media file-systems , which provide rate-guarantees by managing critical storage resources such as memory and disks , must be designed . in this paper , we highlight the issues in the storage-and-retrieval of continuous-media-data . we first present a simple scheme for concurrently retrieving multiple continuous-media streams from disks . we then introduce a a clever allocation technique for storing continuous-media-data that eliminates disk latency and thus , drastically reduces ram requirements . we present , for video-data , schemes for implementing the operations fast-forward , rewind and pause . finally , we conclude by outlining directions for future-research in the storage-and-retrieval of continuous-media-data .
