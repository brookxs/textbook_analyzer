fd-buffer : a buffer-manager for databases on flash-disks we design and implement fd-buffer , a buffer-manager for database-systems running on flash-based disks . unlike magnetic-disks , flash media has an inherent read-write-asymmetry : writes involve expensive erase operations and as a result are usually much slower than reads . therefore , we address this asymmetry in fd-buffer . specifically , we use the average i/o cost per page access as opposed to the traditional miss-rate as the performance-metric for a buffer . we develop a new replacement-policy in which we separate clean and dirty-pages into two pools . the size ratio of the two pools is automatically adapted to the read-write-asymmetry and the runtime workload . we evaluate fd-buffer with trace-driven experiments on real flash-disks . our evaluation results show that our algorithm achieves up to 33 \ % improvement on the overall performance on commodity flash-disks , in comparison with the state-of-the-art flash-aware replacement-policy .
