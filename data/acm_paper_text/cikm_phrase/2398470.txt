exploiting latent relevance for relational-learning of ubiquitous things with recent advances in radio-frequency-identification (rfid) , wireless-sensor-networks , and web-services , physical things are becoming an integral part of the emerging ubiquitous-web . while this integration offers many exciting opportunities such as efficient supply-chains and improved environmental-monitoring , it also presents many significant challenges . one such challenge lies in how to classify , discover , and manage ubiquitous things , which is critical for efficient and effective object-search , recommendation , and composition . in this paper , we focus on automatically classifying ubiquitous things into manageable semantic-category labels by exploiting the information hidden in interactions between users and ubiquitous things . we develop a novel approach to extract latent relevance by building a relational network of ubiquitous things (rnubit) where similar things are linked via virtual edges according to their latent relevance . a discriminative-learning algorithm is also developed to automatically determine category labels for ubiquitous things . we conducted experiments using real-world-data and the experimental-results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our proposed approach .
