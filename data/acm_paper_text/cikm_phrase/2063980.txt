k-nearest-neighbor-query processing method based on distance relation pattern the k-nearest-neighbor (k-nn) query is one of the most important query-types for location-based-services (lbs) . various methods have been proposed to efficiently process the k-nn query . however , most of the existing methods suffer from high computation time and larger memory requirement because they unnecessarily access cells to find the nearest cells on a grid index . in this paper , we propose a new efficient method , called pattern_based k-nn (pb-knn) to process the k-nn query . the proposed method uses the patterns of the distance relationships among the cells in a grid index . the basic idea is to normalize the distance relationships as certain patterns . using this approach , pb-knn significantly improves the overall performance of the query-processing . it is shown through various experiments that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of query-processing time and storage overhead .
