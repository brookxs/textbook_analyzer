topsig : topology preserving document-signatures comparisons between file signatures and inverted-files for text-retrieval have shown the shortcomings of traditional file signatures . it has been widely accepted that traditional file signatures are inferior alternatives to inverted-files . this paper describes topsig , a new approach to the construction of file signatures that extends recent advances in semantic-hashing and dimensionality-reduction . these were not so far linked to general purpose , signature-file based , search-engines . we demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of signature-file_based indexing-and-retrieval . performance is comparable to the-state-of-the-art inverted-file_based systems , including language-models and bm25 . these findings suggest that file signatures offer a viable alternative to inverted-files in suitable settings and positions the file signatures model in the class of vector-space-retrieval models .
