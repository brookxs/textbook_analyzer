spatial-data traversal in road-map databases : a graph-indexing approach spatial-data are found in geographic-information-systems such as digital road-map databases where city and road attributes are associated with nodes and links in a directed-graph . queries on spatial-data are expensive because of the recursive property of graph-traversal . we propose a graph-indexing technique to expedite spatial-queries where the graph-topology remains relatively stationary . using a probabilistic-analysis , this paper shows that the graph-indexing technique significantly improves the efficiency of constrained spatial-queries .
