the water filling model and the cube test : multi-dimensional evaluation for professional search professional search activities such as patent and legal search are often time sensitive and consist of rich information-needs with multiple aspects or subtopics . this paper proposes a 3d water filling model to describe this search-process , and derives a new evaluation-metric , the cube test , to encompass the complex nature of professional search . the new metric is compared against state-of-the-art patent-search evaluation-metrics as well as web-search-evaluation metrics over two distinct patent datasets . the experimental-results show that the cube test metric effectively captures the characteristics and requirements of professional search .
