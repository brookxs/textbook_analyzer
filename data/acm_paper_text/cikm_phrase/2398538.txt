structured-query reformulations in commerce-search recent work in commerce-search has shown that understanding the semantics in user queries enables more effective query-analysis and retrieval of relevant products . however , due to lack of sufficient domain-knowledge , user queries often include terms that can not be mapped directly to any product attribute . for example , a user looking for designer handbags might start with such a query because she is not familiar with the manufacturers , the price ranges , and/or the material that gives a handbag designer appeal . current commerce-search engines treat terms such as designer as keywords and attempt to match them to contents such as product-reviews and product descriptions , often resulting in poor user-experience . in this study , we propose to address this problem by reformulating queries involving terms such as designer , which we call modifiers , to queries that specify precise product-attributes . we learn to rewrite the modifiers to attribute values by analyzing user-behavior and leveraging structured-data sources such as the product catalog that serves the queries . we first produce a probabilistic mapping between the modifiers and attribute values based on user behavioral data . these initial associations are then used to retrieve products from the catalog , over which we infer sets of attribute values that best describe the semantics of the modifiers . we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach based on a comprehensive mechanical-turk study . we find that users agree with the attribute values selected by our approach in about 95 % of the cases and they prefer the results surfaced for our reformulated queries to ones for the original queries in 87 % of the time .
