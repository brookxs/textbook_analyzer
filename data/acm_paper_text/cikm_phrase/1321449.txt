autonomously semantifying wikipedia berners-lee 's compelling vision of a semantic-web is hindered by a chicken-and-egg-problem , which can be best solved by a bootstrapping-method - creating enough structured-data to motivate the development of applications . this paper argues that autonomously `` semantifying wikipedia '' is the best way to solve the problem . we choose wikipedia as an initial data source , because it is comprehensive , not too large , high-quality , and contains enough manually-derived structure to bootstrap an autonomous , self-supervised process . we identify several types of structures which can be automatically enhanced in wikipedia (e.g. , link-structure , taxonomic data , infoboxes , etc.) , and we describea prototype-implementation of a self-supervised , machine-learning system which realizes our vision . preliminary experiments demonstrate the high precision of our system 's extracted data - in one case equaling that of humans .
