efficient data-dissemination using locale-covers location-dependent-data are central to many emerging applications , ranging from traffic-information services to sensor-networks . the standard pull - and push-based data-dissemination models become unworkable since the data volumes and number of clients are high.we address this problem using locale-covers , a subset of the original set of locations of interest , chosen to include at least one location in a suitably defined neighborhood of any client . since location-dependent values are highly correlated with location , a query can be answered using a location close to the query point.we show that location-dependent queries may be answered satisfactorily using locale-covers , with small loss of accuracy . our approach is independent of locations and speeds of clients , and is applicable to mobile-clients .
