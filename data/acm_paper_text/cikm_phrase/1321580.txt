a dual-view approach to interactive-network-visualization visualizing network-data , from tree-structures to arbitrarily connected graphs , is a difficult problem in information-visualization . a large part of the problem is that in network-data , users not only have to visualize the attributes specific to each data item , but also the links specifying how those items are connected to each other . past approaches to resolving these difficulties focus on zooming , clustering , filtering and applying various methods of laying out nodes and edges . such approaches , however , focus only on optimizing a network-visualization in a single view , limiting the amount of information that can be shown and explored in parallel . moreover , past approaches do not allow users to cross reference different subsets or aspects of large , complex-networks . in this paper , we propose an approach to these limitations using multiple-coordinated-views of a given network . to illustrate our approach , we implement a tool called dualnet and evaluate the tool with a case-study using an email-communication network . we show how using multiple-coordinated-views improves navigation and provides insight into large-networks with multiple node and link properties and types .
