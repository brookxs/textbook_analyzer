improving document-clustering using automated machine-translation with the development of statistical-machine-translation , we have ready-to-use tools that can translate documents from one language to many other languages . these translations provide different yet correlated views of the same set of documents . this gives rise to an intriguing question : can we use the extra information to achieve a better clustering of the documents ? some recent work on multiview clustering provided positive answers to this question . in this work , we propose an alternative approach to address this problem using the constrained-clustering framework . unlike traditional must-link and cannot-link constraints , the constraints generated from machine-translation are dense yet noisy . we show how to incorporate this type of constraints by presenting two algorithms , one parametric and one non-parametric . our algorithms are easy to implement , efficient , and can consistently improve the clustering of real-data , namely the reuters rcv1/rcv2 multilingual dataset . in contrast to existing multiview clustering-algorithms , our technique does not need the compatibility or the conditional-independence assumption , nor does it involve subtle parameter-tuning .
