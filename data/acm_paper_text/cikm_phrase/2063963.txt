probabilistic-model for discovering topic_based communities in social-networks social graphs have received renewed interest as a research-topic with the advent of social-networking-websites . these online networks provide a rich source of data to study user-relationships and interaction patterns on a large-scale . in this paper , we propose a generative bayesian-model for extracting latent-communities from a social-graph . we assume that community memberships depend on topics of interest between users and the link-relationships between them in the social-graph topology . in addition , we make use of the nature of interaction to gauge user-interests . our model allows communities to be related to multiple topics and each user in the graph can be a member of multiple communities . this gives an insight into user-interests and topical distribution in communities . we show the effectiveness of our model using a real-world data-set and also compare our model with existing community-discovery methods .
