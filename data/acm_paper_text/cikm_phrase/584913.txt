interactive methods for taxonomy editing and validation taxonomies are meaningful hierarchical categorizations of documents into topics reflecting the natural relationships between the documents and their business-objectives . improving the quality of these taxonomies and reducing the overall cost required to create them is an important area of research . supervised and unsupervised text-clustering are important technologies that comprise only a part of a complete solution . however , there exists a great need for the ability for a human to efficiently interact with a taxonomy during the editing and validation phase . we have developed a comprehensive-approach to solving this problem , and implemented this approach in a software-tool called eclassifier . eclassifier provides features to help the taxonomy editor understand and evaluate each category of a taxonomy and visualize the relationships between the categories . multiple techniques allow the user to make changes at both the category and document level . metrics then establish how well the resultant taxonomy can be modeled for future document-classification . in this paper , we present a comprehensive set of viewing , editing and validation techniques we have implemented in the lotus discovery server resulting in a significant reduction in the time required to create a quality taxonomy .
