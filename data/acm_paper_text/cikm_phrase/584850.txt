boosting to correct inductive-bias in text-classification this paper studies the effects of boosting in the context of different classification-methods for text-categorization , including decision-trees , naive-bayes , support-vector-machines (svms) and a rocchio-style classifier . we identify the inductive biases of each classifier and explore how boosting , as an error-driven resampling mechanism , reacts to those biases . our experiments on the reuters-21578 benchmark show that boosting is not effective in improving the performance of the base classifiers on common categories . however , the effect of boosting for rare categories varies across classifiers : for svms and decision-trees , we achieved a 13-17 \ % performance-improvement in macro-averaged f1 measure , but did not obtain substantial improvement for the other two classifiers . this interesting finding of boosting on rare categories has not been reported before .
