an empirical-study of required dimensionality for large-scale latent-semantic-indexing applications the technique of latent-semantic-indexing is used in a wide variety of commercial-applications . in these applications , the processing-time and ram required for svd computation , and the processing-time and ram required during lsi retrieval operations are all roughly linear in the number of dimensions , k , chosen for the lsi representation-space . in large-scale commercial lsi applications , reducing k values could be of significant value in reducing server costs . this paper explores the effects of varying dimensionality . the approach taken here focuses on term comparisons . pairs of terms are considered which have strong real-world associations . the proximities of members of these pairs in the lsi space are compared at multiple values of k . the testing is carried out for collections of from one to five million documents . for the five million document-collection , a value of k ? 400 provides the best performance . the results suggest that there is something of an ` island of stability ' in the k = 300 to 500 range . the results also indicate that there is relatively little room to employ k values outside of this range without incurring significant distortions in at least some term-term correlations .
