effective xml content-and-structure retrieval with relevance-ranking xml-documents can be retrieved by means of not only content-only (co) queries , but also content-and-structure (cas) queries . though promising better retrieval-precision , cas queries introduce several new challenges . to address these challenges , we propose a novel approach for xml cas retrieval . the distinctive feature of the approach is that it adopts a content-oriented point-of-view . specifically , the approach first decomposes a cas query into several fragments , then retrieves results for each query fragment in a content-centric way , and finally scores each answer node . the approach is adaptive to versatile homogeneous and heterogeneous data-environments . to assess the relevance of retrieval results to a query fragment , we present a scoring strategy that measures relevance from both content-and-structure perspectives . in addition , an effective approach is proposed to infer answer nodes based on the cas query and document structure . an efficient-algorithm is also presented for cas retrieval . finally , we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through comprehensive experimental-studies .
