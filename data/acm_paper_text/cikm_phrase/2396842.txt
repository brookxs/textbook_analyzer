maximum-margin-clustering on evolutionary data evolutionary data , such as topic changing blogs and evolving trading behaviors in capital market , is widely seen in business and social-applications . the time-factor and intrinsic change embedded in evolutionary data greatly challenge evolutionary-clustering . to incorporate the time-factor , existing methods mainly regard the evolutionary-clustering problem as a linear combination of snapshot cost and temporal cost , and reflect the time-factor through the temporal cost . it still faces accuracy and scalability challenge though promising results gotten . this paper proposes a novel evolutionary-clustering approach , evolutionary maximum-margin-clustering (e-mmc) , to cluster large-scale evolutionary data from the maximum-margin perspective . e-mmc incorporates two frameworks : data-integration from the data changing perspective and model-integration corresponding to model adjustment to tackle the time-factor and change , with an adaptive label allocation mechanism . three e-mmc clustering-algorithms are proposed based on the two frameworks . extensive experiments are performed on synthetic-data , uci data and real-world blog-data , which confirm that e-mmc outperforms the state-of-the-art clustering-algorithms in terms of accuracy , computational cost and scalability . it shows that e-mmc is particularly suitable for clustering large-scale evolving data .
