hypersum : hypergraph based semi-supervised sentence-ranking for query-oriented-summarization graph-based sentence-ranking algorithms such as pagerank and hits have been successfully used in query-oriented-summarization . with these algorithms , the documents to be summarized are often modeled as a text graph where nodes represent sentences and edges represent pairwise similarity relationships between two sentences . a deficiency of conventional graph-modeling is its incapability of naturally and effectively representing complex group relationships shared among multiple objects . simply squeezing complex relationships into pairwise ones will inevitably lead to loss of information which can be useful for ranking and learning . in this paper , we propose to take advantage of hypergraph , i.e. a generalization of graph , to remedy this defect . in a text-hypergraph , nodes still represent sentences , yet hyperedges are allowed to connect more than two sentences . with a text-hypergraph , we are thus able to integrate both group relationships formulated among multiple sentences and pairwise relationships formulated between two sentences in a unified-framework . as essential work , it is first addressed in the paper that how a text-hypergraph can be built for summarization by applying clustering-techniques . then , a hypergraph based semi-supervised sentence-ranking algorithm is developed for query-oriented extractive-summarization , where the influence of query is propagated to sentences through the structure of the constructed text-hypergraph . when evaluated on duc data-sets , performance of the proposed approach is remarkable .
