entity centric query-expansion for enterprise-search enterprise-search is important , and the search-quality has a direct impact on the productivity of an enterprise . many information-needs of enterprise-search center around entities . intuitively , information related to the entities mentioned in the query , such as related entities , would be useful to reformulate the query and improve the retrieval-performance . however , most existing studies on query-expansion are term-centric . in this paper , we propose a novel entity-centric query-expansion framework for enterprise-search . specifically , given a query containing entities , we first utilize both unstructured and structured-information to find entities that are related to the ones in the query . we then discuss how to adapt existing feedback methods to use the related entities to improve search-quality . experiment results show that the proposed entity-centric query-expansion strategy is more effective to improve the search-performance than the state-of-the-art pseudo-feedback methods on longer , natural language-like queries with entities .
