validating associations in biological-databases erroneous-data can often be found in databases , and detecting it is normally a non-trivial task . for example , to cope with the large amount of biological-sequences being produced , a significant number of genes and proteins have been annotated by automated-tools . a protein-annotation is an association between a protein and a term describing its role . these tools have produced a significant number of misannotations that are now present in biological-databases . this paper proposes a new method for automatically scoring associations by comparing them to preexisting curated associations . an association is a pair that links two entities . the score can be used to filter incorrect or uncommon associations.we evaluated the method using the automated protein annotations submitted to biocreative , an international evaluation of state-of-the-art text-mining systems in biology . the method scored each of these annotations and those scored below a certain threshold were discarded . the results have shown a small trade-off in recall for a large improvement in precision . for example , we were able to discard 44.6 \ % , 66.8 \ % and 81 \ % of the misannotations , maintaining 96.9 \ % , 84.2 \ % , and 47.8 \ % of the correct annotations , respectively . moreover , we were able to outperform each individual submission to biocreative by proper adjustment of the threshold .
