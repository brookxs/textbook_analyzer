exploring online-social-activities for adaptive-search personalization the-web has largely become a very social-environment and will continue to become even more so . people are not only enjoying their social-visibility on the web but also increasingly participating in various social-activities delivered through the-web . in this paper , we propose to explore a user 's public social activities , such as blogging and social-bookmarking , to personalize internet-services . we believe that public social data provides a more acceptable way to derive user-interests than more private-data such as search histories and desktop data . we propose a framework that learns about users ' preferences from their activities on a variety of online social systems . as an example , we illustrate how to apply the user-interests derived by our system to personalize search-results . furthermore , our system is adaptive ; it observes users ' choices on search-results and automatically adjusts the weights of different social-systems during the information-integration process , so as to refine its interest profile for each user . we have implemented our approach and performed experiments on real-world-data collected from three large-scale online social systems . over two hundred users from worldwide who are active on the three social-systems have been tested . our experimental-results demonstrate the effectiveness of our personalized-search approach . our results also show that integrating information from multiple social-systems usually leads to better personalized results than relying on the information from a single social-system , and our adaptive-approach further improves the performance of the personalization solution .
