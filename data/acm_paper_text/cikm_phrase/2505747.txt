spatial-search for k diverse-near neighbors to many location-based-service applications that prefer diverse results , finding locations that are spatially diverse and close in proximity to a query point (e.g. , the current location of a user) can be more useful than finding the k nearest neighbors/locations . in this paper , we investigate the problem of searching for the k diverse-near neighbors (kdnns)} in spatial space that is based upon the spatial-diversity and proximity of candidate locations to the query point . while employing a conventional distance-measure for proximity , we develop a new and intuitive diversity metric based upon the variance of the angles among the candidate locations with respect to the query point . accordingly , we create a dynamic-programming-algorithm that finds the optimal kdnns . unfortunately , the dynamic-programming-algorithm , with a time-complexity of o (kn3) , incurs excessive computational cost . therefore , we further propose two heuristic-algorithms , namely , distance-based browsing (distbrow) and diversity-based browsing (divbrow) that provide high effectiveness while being efficient by exploring the search-space prioritized upon the proximity to the query point and spatial-diversity , respectively . using real and synthetic datasets , we conduct a comprehensive performance-evaluation . the results show that distbrow and divbrow have superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining high efficiency .
