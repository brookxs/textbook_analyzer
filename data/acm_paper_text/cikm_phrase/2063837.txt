learning to target : what works for behavioral-targeting understanding what interests and delights users is critical to effective behavioral-targeting , especially in information-poor contexts . as users interact with content and advertising , their passive behavior can reveal their interests towards advertising . two issues are critical for building effective targeting methods : what metric to optimize for and how to optimize . more specifically , we first attempt to understand what the learning-objective should be for behavioral-targeting so as to maximize advertiser 's performance . while most popular advertising methods optimize for user-clicks , as we will show , maximizing clicks does not necessarily imply maximizing purchase activities or transactions , called conversions , which directly translate to advertiser 's revenue . in this work we focus on conversions which makes a more relevant metric but also the more challenging one . second is the issue of how to represent and combine the plethora of user-activities such as search queries , page views , ad clicks to perform the targeting . we investigate several sources of user-activities as well as methods for inferring conversion likelihood given the activities . we also explore the role played by the temporal aspect of user-activities for targeting , e.g. , how recent activities compare to the old ones . based on a rigorous offline empirical-evaluation over 200 individual advertising campaigns , we arrive at what we believe are best-practices for behavioral-targeting . we deploy our approach over live user traffic to demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art targeting methods .
