learning to recommend with social relation ensemble recommender-systems with social-networks (rssn) have been well studied in recent works . however , these methods ignore the relationships among items , which may affect the quality of recommendations . motivated by the observation that related items often have similar ratings , we propose a framework integrating items ' relations , users ' social-graph and user-item rating matrix for recommendation . experimental-results show that our approach performs better than the state-of-art algorithm and the method with only users ' social-graph ensemble in terms of map and rmse .
