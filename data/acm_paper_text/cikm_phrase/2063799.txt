information-re-finding by context : a brain memory inspired approach re-finding what we have accessed before is a common behavior in real life . psychological studies show that context under which information was accessed can serve as a powerful cue for information recall . `` finding the sweet recipe that i read at the hotel on the trip to africa last year '' is a context-based re-finding request example . inspired by users ' recall characteristics and human-memory , we present a context memory-model , where each context unit links to the data created/accessed before . context units are organized in a clustering and associative manner , and evolve dynamically in life cycles . based on the context memory , we build a recall-by-context query-model . two methods are devised to evaluate context-based recall queries . our experiments with synthetic and real-data show that evaluation exploring the use of context associations can get the best-response time .
