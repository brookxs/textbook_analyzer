knowledge-based extraction of named-entities the usual approach to named-entity-detection is to learn extraction rules that rely on linguistic , syntactic , or document-format patterns that are consistent across a set of documents . however , when there is no consistency among documents , it may be more effective to learn document-specific extraction rules.this paper presents a knowledge-based-approach to learning-rules for named-entity-extraction . document-specific extraction rules are created using a generate-and-test paradigm and a database of known named-entities . experimental-results show that this approach is effective on web-documents that are difficult for the usual methods .
