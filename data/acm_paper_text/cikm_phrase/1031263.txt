infoanalyzer : a computer-aided tool for building enterprise taxonomies in this paper we study the problem of collecting training-samples for building enterprise taxonomies . we develop a computer-aided tool named infoanalyzer , which can effectively assist the enterprise to prepare large set of samples used for machine-learning in text-categorization . in our system , the enterprise category-tree is initially defined by some keywords , then the google-search-engine is used to construct a small set of labeled documents , and topic-tracking algorithm based on document-length-normalization is applied to enlarge the training-corpus on the bases of the seed stories . furthermore , we design a method to check the consistency of the training-corpus . experiments show that the training-corpus is good enough for statistical-classification methods and meets human 's requirements as well .
