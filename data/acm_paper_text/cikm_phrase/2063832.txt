delta : indexing and querying multi-labeled graphs with the emergence of social-networks and computational-biology , more data are in the forms of multi-labeled graphs , where a vertex has multiple labels . since most algorithms focus only on single labeled graphs , these algorithms perform inefficiently when applied to multi-labeled graphs . in this paper , we investigate the problem of subgraph indexing and matching in the multi-labeled graphs . the label set on a vertex is transformed into a high-dimensional box . the r-tree is employed to store and index these boxes . the vertex-matching problem can be transformed into spatial range-queries on the high-dimensional-space . in addition , we study two types of queries : location and existence queries . in this paper , detailed algorithms are provided to process these two types of queries . real and synthetic-data sets are employed to demonstrate the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our subgraph indexing and query-processing-methods .
