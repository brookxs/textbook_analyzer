finding images of difficult entities in the long-tail while images of famous people and places are abundant on the internet , they are much harder to retrieve for less popular entities such as notable computer scientists or regionally interesting churches . querying the entity names in image-search engines yields large candidate lists , but they often have low precision and unsatisfactory recall . in this paper , we propose a principled model for finding images of rare or ambiguous named-entities . we propose a set of efficient , light-weight algorithms for identifying entity-specific keyphrases from a given textual description of the entity , which we then use to score candidate images based on the matches of keyphrases in the underlying web-pages . our experiments show the high precision-recall quality of our approach .
