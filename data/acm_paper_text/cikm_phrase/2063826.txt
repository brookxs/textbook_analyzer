cost-efficient repair in inconsistent probabilistic databases due to the ubiquitous data-uncertainty in many emerging real applications , efficient management of probabilistic-databases has become an increasingly important yet challenging problem . in particular , one fundamental task of data-management is to identify those unreliable data in the probabilistic-database that violate integrity-constraints (e.g. , functional-dependencies) , and then quickly resolve data inconsistencies . in this paper , we formulate and tackle an important problem of repairing inconsistent probabilistic databases efficiently by value modification . specifically , we propose a repair semantic , namely possible-world-oriented-repair (pw-repair) , which partitions possible worlds into several disjoint groups , and repairs these groups individually with minimum repair costs . due to the intractable result that finding such a pw-repair strategy is np-complete , we carefully design a heuristic-based greedy-approach for pw-repair , which can efficiently obtain an effective repair of the inconsistent-probabilistic-database . through extensive experiments , we show that our approach can achieve the efficiency-and-effectiveness of the repair on inconsistent probabilistic data .
