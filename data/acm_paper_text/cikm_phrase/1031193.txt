a practical web-based approach to generating topic-hierarchy for text-segments it is crucial in many information-systems to organize short-text segments , such as keywords in documents and queries from users , into a well-formed topic-hierarchy . in this paper , we address the problem of generating topic-hierarchies for diverse text-segments with a general and practical approach that uses the-web as an additional knowledge source . unlike long documents , short-text segments typically do not contain enough information to extract reliable features . this work investigates the possibilities of using highly ranked search-result snippets to enrich the representation of text-segments . a hierarchical-clustering algorithm is then applied to create the hierarchical topic structure of text-segments . different from traditional clustering-algorithms , which tend to produce cluster hierarchies with a very unnatural shape , the approach tries to produce a more natural and comprehensive hierarchy . extensive experiments were conducted on different domains of text-segments . the obtained results have shown the potential of the proposed approach , which is believed able to benefit many information-systems .
