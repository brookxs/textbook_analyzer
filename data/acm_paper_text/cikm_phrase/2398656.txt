fast candidate-generation for two-phase document-ranking : postings list-intersection with bloom-filters most modern web-search-engines employ a two-phase ranking strategy : a candidate list of documents is generated using a `` cheap '' but low-quality scoring-function , which is then reranked by an `` expensive '' but high-quality method (usually machine-learned) . this paper focuses on the problem of candidate-generation for conjunctive-query processing in this context . we describe and evaluate a fast , approximate postings list-intersection algorithms based on bloom-filters . due to the power of modern learning-to-rank techniques and emphasis on early-precision , significant speedups can be achieved without loss of end-to-end retrieval-effectiveness . explorations reveal a rich design-space where effectiveness and efficiency can be balanced in response to specific hardware-configurations and application scenarios .
