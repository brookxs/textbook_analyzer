minimum-effort driven dynamic faceted-search in structured databases in this paper , we propose minimum-effort driven navigational techniques for enterprise database-systems based on the faceted-search paradigm . our proposed techniques dynamically suggest facets for drilling down into the database such that the cost of navigation is minimized . at every step , the system asks the user a question or a set of questions on different facets and depending on the user response , dynamically fetches the next most promising set of facets , and the process repeats . facets are selected based on their ability to rapidly drill down to the most promising tuples , as well as on the ability of the user to provide desired values for them . our facet selection-algorithms also work in conjunction with any ranked-retrieval model where a ranking-function imposes a bias over the user-preferences for the selected tuples . our methods are principled as well as efficient , and our experimental-study validates their effectiveness on several application-scenarios .
