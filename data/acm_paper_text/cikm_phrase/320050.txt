spatial-match-representation scheme supporting ranking in iconic images databases because content-based-image-retrieval is essential to retrieve relevant multimedia-documents , we represent images as a set of recognizable symbols , i.e. , icon objects , and do indexing by regarding the icon object as a representative of a given document . when users request content-based-image-retrieval , we convert a query image into icon objects and retrieve relevant images in the database . in this paper , we propose a new spatial-match representation-scheme , called srr (spatial-match representation supporting ranking) scheme , which combine directional operators with positional-operators . therefore , our srr scheme can represent spatial-relationships between icon objects precisely and can provide ranking for the retrieved images . in addition , we compare our scheme with the conventional 9dlt and smr schemes in terms of retrieval-effectiveness . finally , we show from our experiment that our srr scheme holds about 25 \ % higher recall and about 10 \ % higher precision , compared with the 9dlt and the smr .
