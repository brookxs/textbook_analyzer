generalizing from relevance-feedback using named-entity wildcards traditional adaptive-filtering systems learn the user 's interests in a rather simple way - words from relevant documents are favored in the query-model , while words from irrelevant documents are down-weighted . this biases the query-model towards specific words seen in the past , causing the system to favor documents containing relevant but redundant-information over documents that use previously unseen words to denote new facts about the same news event . this paper proposes news ways of generalizing from relevance-feedback by augmenting the traditional bag-of-words query-model with named-entity wildcards that are anchored in context . the use of wildcards allows generalization beyond specific words , while contextual restrictions limit the wildcard-matching to entities related to the user 's query . we test our new approach in a nugget-level adaptive-filtering system and evaluate it in terms of both relevance and novelty of the presented information . our results indicate that higher recall is obtained when lexical terms are generalized using wildcards . however , such wildcards must be anchored to their context to maintain good precision . how the context of a wildcard is represented and matched against a given document also plays a crucial role in the performance of the retrieval-system .
