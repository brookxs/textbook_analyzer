bns feature-scaling : an improved representation over tf-idf for svm text-classification in the realm of machine-learning for text-classification , tf-idf is the most widely used representation for real-valued feature-vectors . however , idf is oblivious to the training class labels and naturally scales some features inappropriately . we replace idf with bi-normal separation (bns) , which has been previously found to be excellent at ranking words for feature-selection filtering . empirical-evaluation on a benchmark of 237 binary text classification-tasks shows substantially better accuracy and f-measure for a support-vector-machine (svm) by using bns scaling . a wide variety of other feature representations were later tested and found inferior , as well as binary-features with no scaling . moreover , bns scaling yielded better performance without feature-selection , obviating the need for feature-selection .
