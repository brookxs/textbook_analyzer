structured-document handling a case for integrating-databases and information retrieval in this paper we discuss the structured-multimedia-documents that will be , or already are , to some degree the communication backbone of the so-called superhighways . it will be shown that storage-and-retrieval of such documents will best be handled by an integration of database and information retrieval technologies . we assume documents to be structured with the help of standards like sgml/hytime and represented by the multitude of formats currently used for multimedia-data . starting with an approach based on object-oriented-database technology we extend both their functionality on the cost-models for query-evaluation on one side with multimedia features and on the other with logic-based models of information-retrieval to truly combine structure-and-content information about the documents in question .
