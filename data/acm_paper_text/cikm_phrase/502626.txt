selecting relevant instances for efficient and accurate collaborative-filtering collaborative-filtering uses a database about consumers ' preferences to make personal product-recommendations and is achieving widespread success in both e-commerce and information filtering applications nowadays . however , the traditional collaborative-filtering algorithms do not scale well to the ever-growing number of consumers . the quality of the recommendation also needs to be improved in order to gain more trust from the consumers . in this paper , we present a novel method to improve the scalability and the accuracy of the collaborative-filtering algorithm . we introduce an information-theoretic approach to measure the relevance of a consumer (instance) for predicting the preference for the given product (target concept) . the proposed method reduces the training-data-set by selecting only highly relevant instances . our experimental-evaluation on the well-known eachmovie data-set shows that our method does n't only significantly speed up the prediction , but also results in a better accuracy .
