cross-argument inference for implicit discourse-relation recognition motivated by the critical importance of connectives in recognizing discourse-relations , we present an unsupervised cross-argument inference-mechanism to implicit discourse-relation recognition . the basic idea is to infer the implicit discourse-relation of an argument pair from a large number of comparable argument pairs , which are automatically retrieved from the-web in an unsupervised way . in this way , the inference proceeds from explicit relations to implicit ones via connective as bridge . this kind of pair-to-pair inference is based on the assumption that two argument pairs with high content similarity (i.e. comparable argument pairs) should have similar discourse relationship . evaluation on pdtb proves the effectiveness of our inference-mechanism in implicit-relation recognition to the four level-1 relations . it also shows that our mechanism significantly outperforms other alternatives .
