a query-based multi-document sentiment summarizer review websites , such as epinions.com , which offer users a platform to share their opinions on diverse products and services , provide a valuable source of opinion-rich information . browsing through archived reviews to locate different opinions on a product or service , however , is a time-consuming and tedious task , and in most cases , the large amount of available information is difficult for users to absorb . to facilitate the process of synthesizing opinions expressed in reviews on a product or service p specified in a user query/question q , we introduce qmss , a query-based multi-document sentiment summarizer . qmss creates a summary for q , which either reflects the general opinions on p or is tailored to specific facets (i.e. , features) and/or sentiment of p as specified in q. qmss (i) identifies the facets addressed in reviews retrieved for q , (ii) employs a sentence-based , sentiment classifier to determine the polarity of each sentence in each review , and (iii) clusters sentences in reviews according to the facets captured in the sentences , which are identified using a keyword-label extraction-algorithm . this process dictates which sentences in the reviews should be included in the summary for q. empirical-studies have verified that qmss is highly effective in generating summaries that satisfy users ' information-needs and ranks on top among the state-of-the-art query-based multi-document sentiment summarizers
