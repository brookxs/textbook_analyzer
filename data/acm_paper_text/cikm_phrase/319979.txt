zbroker : a query-routing broker for z39 .50 databases a query-routing broker is a software-agent that determines from a large set of accessing information-sources the ones most relevant to a user 's information-need . as the number of information-sources on the internet increases dramatically , future users will have to rely on query-routing brokers to decide a small number of information-sources to query without incurring too much query-processing overheads . in this paper , we describe a query-routing broker known as zbroker developed for bibliographic database servers that support the z39 .50 protocol . zbroker samples the content of each bibliographic database by using training queries and their results , and summarizes the bibliographic database content into a knowledge-base . we present the design and implementation of zbroker and describe its web-based-user-interface .
