constrained multi-aspect expertise matching for committee review-assignment automatic review-assignment can significantly improve the productivity of many people such as conference organizers , journal editors and grant administrators . most previous works have set the problem up as using a paper as a query to independently `` retrieve '' a set of reviewers that should review the paper . a more appropriate formulation of the problem would be to simultaneously optimize the assignments of all the papers to an entire committee of reviewers under constraints such as the review quota . in this paper , we solve the problem of committee review-assignment with multi-aspect expertise matching by casting it as an integer-linear-programming-problem . the proposed algorithm can naturally accommodate any probabilistic or deterministic method for modeling multiple aspects to automate committee review assignments . evaluation using an existing data-set shows that the proposed algorithm is effective for committee review assignments based on multi-aspect expertise matching .
