probabilistic-models of ranking novel documents for faceted topic retrieval traditional models of information-retrieval assume documents are independently relevant . but when the goal is retrieving diverse or novel information about a topic , retrieval-models need to capture dependencies between documents . such tasks require alternative evaluation and optimization-methods that operate on different types of relevance-judgments . we define faceted topic retrieval as a particular novelty-driven task with the goal of finding a set of documents that cover the different facets of an information-need . a faceted topic retrieval-system must be able to cover as many facets as possible with the smallest number of documents . we introduce two novel models for faceted topic retrieval , one based on pruning a set of retrieved documents and one based on retrieving sets of documents through direct-optimization of evaluation-measures . we compare the performance of our models to mmr and the probabilistic-model due to zhai et al. on a set of 60 topics annotated with facets , showing that our models are competitive .
