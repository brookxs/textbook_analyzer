robust-video fingerprinting based on hierarchical symmetric difference feature the piracy of copyrighted digital-content over the-internet infringes copyrights and damages the digital content industry . accordingly , identifying and monitoring technology on the online-content service like fingerprinting is getting valuable through the explosion of digital-content sharing . this paper proposes a robust-video fingerprinting feature to identify a modified video-clip from a large-scale database . hierarchical symmetric difference feature is proposed in order to offer efficient video-fingerprinting . the feature is robust and pairwise independent against various video modifications such as compression , resizing , or cropping . moreover , videos undergoing a transformation such as flipping or mirroring can be identified by simply disordering the bit pattern of fingerprints . the performance of the proposed feature is extensively experimented on 6,482 hours of database and the experimental-results show that the proposed fingerprinting is efficient and robust against various modifications .
