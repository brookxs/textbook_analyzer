predicting web-search-success with fine-grained interaction data detecting and predicting searcher success is essential for automatically evaluating and improving web-search-engine performance . in the past , web searcher-behavior data , such as result clickthrough , dwell-time , and query-reformulation sequences , have been successfully used for a variety of tasks , including prediction of success in a search-session . however , the effectiveness of the previous approaches has been limited , as they tend to ignore how searchers actually view and interact with the visited pages . we show that fine-grained interactions , such as mouse-cursor movements and scrolling , provide additional clues for better predicting-success of a search-session as a whole . to this end , we identify patterns of examination and interaction behavior that correspond to search-success , and design a new fine-grained session behavior (fsb) model to capture these patterns . our experimental-results show that fsb is significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches that do not use these additional interaction data .
