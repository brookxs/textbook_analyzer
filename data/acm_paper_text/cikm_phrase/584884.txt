personalized-web-search by mapping user queries to categories current web search-engines are built to serve all users , independent of the needs of any individual user . personalization of web-search is to carry out retrieval for each user incorporating his/her interests . we propose a novel technique to map a user-query to a set of categories , which represent the user 's search-intention . this set of categories can serve as a context to disambiguate the words in the user 's query . a user-profile and a general profile are learned from the user 's search-history and a category-hierarchy respectively . these two profiles are combined to map a user-query into a set of categories . several learning and combining algorithms are evaluated and found to be effective . among the algorithms to learn a user-profile , we choose the rocchio-based method for its simplicity , efficiency and its ability to be adaptive . experimental-results indicate that our technique to personalize web-search is both effective and efficient .
