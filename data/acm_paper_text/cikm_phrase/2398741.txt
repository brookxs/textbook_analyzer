magik : managing completeness of data magik demonstrates how to use meta-information about the completeness of a database to assess the quality of the answers returned by a query . the system holds so-called table-completeness (tc) statements , by which one can express that a table is partially complete , that is , it contains all facts about some aspect of the domain . given a query , magik determines from such meta-information whether the database contains sufficient data for the query answer to be complete . if , according to the tc statements , the database content is not sufficient for a complete answer , magik explains which further tc statements are needed to guarantee completeness . magik extends and complements theoretical work on modeling and reasoning about data completeness by providing the first implementation of a reasoner . the reasoner operates by translating completeness reasoning tasks into logic-programs , which are executed by an answer set engine .
