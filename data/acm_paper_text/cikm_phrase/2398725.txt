carbondb : a semantic life-cycle-inventory database we demonstrate carbondb , a web-application for life-cycle-inventory data-management . life-cycle-assessment provides a well-accepted methodology for modelling environmental-impacts of human activities . this methodology relies on the decomposition of a studied system into interdependent processes in a phase called life-cycle-inventory . several organisations provide processes databases containing thousands of processes with their interdependency links . the usual workflow to manage those databases is based on the manipulation of individual processes , which turns out to be a very harnessing work even if there are strong semantic similarities between the involved processes . in previous publications , we proposed a new workflow for lca inventory databases maintenance based on the addition of semantic-information to the processes they contained . this method considerably eases the modeling-process and offers a synthetic view of the dependencies links . we created a web-application based on this approach composed of a back-end for data-management and a front-end for searching processes and visualize the dependencies links in a graph .
