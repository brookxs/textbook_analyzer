unsupervised discovery of opposing opinion networks from forum discussions with more and more people freely express opinions as well as actively interact with each other in discussion threads , online-forums are becoming a gold mine with rich information about people 's opinions and social-behaviors . in this paper , we study an interesting new problem of automatically discovering opposing opinion networks of users from forum discussions , which are subset of users who are strongly against each other on some topic . toward this goal , we propose to use signals from both textual content (e.g. , who says what) and social-interactions (e.g. , who talks to whom) which are both abundant in online-forums . we also design an optimization formulation to combine all the signals in an unsupervised way . we created a data-set by manually annotating forum data on five controversial topics and our experimental-results show that the proposed optimization-method outperforms several baselines and existing approaches , demonstrating the power of combining both text-analysis and social-network-analysis in analyzing and generating the opposing opinion networks .
