rank learning for factoid-question-answering with linguistic and semantic-constraints this work presents a general rank-learning framework for passage-ranking within question-answering (qa) systems using linguistic and semantic-features . the framework enables query-time checking of complex linguistic and semantic-constraints over keywords . constraints are composed of a mixture of keyword and named-entity features , as well as features derived from semantic-role-labeling . the framework supports the checking of constraints of arbitrary length relating any number of keywords . we show that a trained ranking-model using this rich feature-set achieves greater than a 20 \ % improvement in mean-average-precision over baseline keyword-retrieval models . we also show that constraints based on semantic-role-labeling features are particularly effective for passage-retrieval ; when they can be leveraged , an 40 \ % improvement in map over the baseline can be realized .
