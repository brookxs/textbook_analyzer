tapping on the potential of q & a-community by recommending answer providers the rapidly increasing popularity of community-based-question-answering (cqa) services , e.g. yahoo!-answers , baidu zhidao , etc. have attracted great attention from both academia and industry . besides the basic problems , like question searching and answer-finding , it should be noted that the low participation rate of users in cqa service is the crucial problem which limits its development potential . in this paper , we focus on addressing this problem by recommending answer providers , in which a question is given as a query and a ranked list of users is returned according to the likelihood of answering the question . based on the intuitive idea for recommendation , we try to introduce topic-level model to improve heuristic term-level methods , which are treated as the baselines . the proposed approach consists of two steps : (1) discovering latent topics in the content of questions-and-answers as well as latent interests of users to build user-profiles ; (2) recommending question answerers for new arrival questions based on latent topics and term-level model . specifically , we develop a general generative-model for questions-and-answers in cqa , which is then altered to obtain a novel computationally tractable bayesian-network model . experiments are carried out on a real-world-data crawled from yahoo!-answers during jun 12 2007 to aug 04 2007 , which consists of 118510 questions , 772962 answers and 150324 users . the experimental-results reveal significant improvements over the baseline methods and validate the positive influence of topic-level information .
