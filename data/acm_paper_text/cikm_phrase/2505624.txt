local-clustering in provenance graphs systems that capture and store data-provenance , the record of how an object has arrived at its current-state , accumulate historical metadata over time , forming a large-graph . local-clustering in these graphs , in which we start with a seed vertex and grow a cluster around it , is of paramount importance because it supports critical provenance applications such as identifying semantically meaningful tasks in an object 's history . however , generic graph-clustering algorithms are not effective at these tasks . we identify three key properties of provenance graphs and exploit them to justify two new centrality metrics we developed for use in performing local-clustering on provenance graphs .
