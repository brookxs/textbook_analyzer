learning a user-thread alignment manifold for thread recommendation in online-forum people are more and more willing to participate in online-forums to share their knowledge and experience . however , it may not be easy for them to find their desired threads in online-forums due to the information-overload problem . traditional recommendation approaches can not be directly applied to online-forums due to two reasons . first , unlike traditional movie or music-recommendation problem , there is no rating information in online-forums . second , the sparsity-problem is more severe since the users may only read threads but take no actions . to address these limitations , in this paper we propose to make use of the reply relationships among users , as well as thread contents . a learning-algorithm is introduced to infer a user-thread alignment manifold in which both users and thread contents can be well represented . thus , the relatedness between users and threads can be measured on this alignment manifold , and the closest threads which can best meet the corresponding user 's information-needs are recommended . experiments on a dataset crawled from digg.com have demonstrated the superiority of our algorithm over traditional recommendation-algorithms .
