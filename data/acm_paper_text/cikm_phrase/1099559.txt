structured-queries in xml-retrieval document-centric-xml is a mixture of text-and-structure . with the increased availability of document-centric-xml content comes a need for query facilities in which both structural constraints and-constraints on the content of the documents can be expressed . how does the expressiveness of languages for querying-xml-documents help users to express their information-needs ? we address this question from both an experimental and a theoretical point-of-view . our experimental-analysis compares a structure-ignorant with a structure-aware retrieval approach using the test-suite of the 2004 edition of the inex xml-retrieval-evaluation initiative . theoretically , we create mathematical-models of users ' knowledge of a set of documents and define query-languages which exactly fit these models . one of these languages corresponds to an xml version of fielded search , the other to the inex query-language . our main findings are : first , while structure is used in varying degrees of complexity , over half of the queries can be expressed in a fielded-search like format which does not use the hierarchical-structure of the documents . second , structure is used as a search hint , and not a strict requirement , when judged against the underlying information-need . third , the use of structure in queries functions as a precision enhancing device .
