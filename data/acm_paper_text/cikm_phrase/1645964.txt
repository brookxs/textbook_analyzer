what happens after an ad click ? : quantifying the impact of landing-pages in web-advertising unbeknownst to most users , when a query is submitted to a search-engine two distinct searches are performed : the organic or algorithmic search that returns relevant-web pages and related data (maps , images , etc.) , and the sponsored-search that returns paid advertisements . while an enormous amount of work has been invested in understanding-the-user interaction with organic-search , surprisingly little research has been dedicated to what happens after an ad is clicked , a situation we aim to correct . to this end , we define and study the process of context-transfer , that is , the user 's transition from web-search to the context of the landing page that follows an ad-click . we conclude that in the vast majority of cases the user is shown one of three types of pages , namely , homepage (the homepage of the advertiser) , category browse (a browse-able sub-catalog related to the original query) , and search transfer (the search-results of the same query re-executed on the target site) . we show that these three types of landing-pages can be accurately distinguished using automatic-text-classification . finally , using such an automatic classifier , we correlate the landing page type with conversion data provided by advertisers , and show that the conversion-rate (i.e. , users ' response-rate to ads) varies considerably according to the type . we believe our findings will further the understanding of users ' response to search-advertising in general , and landing-pages in particular , and thus help advertisers improve their web-sites and help-search engines select the most suitable ads .
