parallel-linkage we study the parallelization of the (record) linkage-problem - i.e. , to identify matching records between two collections of records , a and b . one of main idiosyncrasies of the linkage-problem , compared to database join , is the fact that once two records a in a and b in b are matched and merged to c , c needs to be compared to the rest of records in a and b again since it may incur new matching . this re-feeding stage of the linkage-problem requires its solution to be iterative , and complicates the problem significantly . toward this problem , we first discuss three plausible scenarios of inputs - when both collections are clean , only one is clean , and both are dirty . then , we show that the intricate interplay between match and merge can exploit the characteristics of each scenario to achieve good parallelization . our parallel-algorithms achieve 6.55-7 .49 times faster in speedup compared to sequential ones with 8 processors , and 11.15-18 .56 \ % improvement in efficiency compared to p-swoosh .
