legal document clustering with built-in topic-segmentation clustering is a useful tool for helping users navigate , summarize , and organize large quantities of textual-documents available on the internet , in news sources , and in digital-libraries . a variety of clustering-methods have also been applied to the legal domain , with various degrees of success . some unique characteristics of legal content as well as the nature of the legal domain present a number of challenges . for example , legal documents are often multi-topical , contain carefully crafted , professional , domain-specific-language , and possess a broad and unevenly distributed-coverage of legal-issues . moreover , unlike widely accessible documents on the internet , where search and categorization services are generally free , the legal profession is still largely a fee-for-service field that makes the quality (e.g. , in terms of both recall and precision) a key differentiator of provided services . this paper introduces a classification-based recursive soft-clustering-algorithm with built-in topic-segmentation . the algorithm leverages existing legal document metadata such as topical classifications , document citations , and click-stream data from user-behavior databases , into a comprehensive clustering-framework . techniques associated with the algorithm have been applied successfully to very-large-databases of legal documents , which include judicial opinions , statutes , regulations , administrative materials and analytical documents . extensive evaluations were conducted to determine the efficiency-and-effectiveness of the proposed algorithm . subsequent evaluations conducted by legal domain-experts have demonstrated that the quality of the resulting clusters based upon this algorithm is similar to those created by domain-experts .
