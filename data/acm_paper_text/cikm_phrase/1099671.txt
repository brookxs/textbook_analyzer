mailrank : using ranking for spam-detection can we use social-networks to combat spam ? this paper investigates the feasibility of mailrank , a new email ranking and classification-scheme exploiting the social-communication network created via email interactions . the underlying email network-data is collected from the email contacts of all mailrank users and updated automatically based on their email activities to achieve an easy maintenance . mailrank is used to rate the sender address of arriving emails such that emails from trustworthy senders can be ranked and classified as spam or non-spam . the paper presents two variants : basic mailrank computes a global reputation score for each email-address , whereas in personalized mailrank the score of each email-address is different for each mailrank user . the evaluation shows that mailrank is highly resistant against spammer attacks , which obviously have to be considered right from the beginning in such an application-scenario . mailrank also performs well even for rather sparse-networks , i.e. , where only a small set of peers actually take part in the ranking of email addresses .
