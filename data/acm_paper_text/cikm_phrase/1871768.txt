discovering , ranking and annotating cross-document relationships between concepts this paper presents cdrminer , a system for automatically discovering , ranking and annotating cross-document links between concepts . specifically , we focus on detecting hidden associations between two concepts and further generating annotations for each discovered hypothesis . we interpret such a relationship-query as finding the most meaningful concept chains and evidence trails across multiple documents that potentially connect them . these functionalities are implemented using an interactive-visualization paradigm which assists users for a better understanding and interpretation of discovered hypotheses , and matching their domain-knowledge with the algorithmic power of text-mining techniques .
