ptm : probabilistic-topic-mapping model for mining-parallel-document-collections many applications generate a large volume of parallel document-collections . a parallel document-collection consists of two sets of documents where the documents in each set correspond to each other and form semantic pairs (e.g. , pairs of problem and solution descriptions in a help-desk setting) . although much work has been done on text-mining , little previous work has attempted to mine such a novel kind of text-data . in this paper , we propose a new probabilistic-topic-model , called probabilistic-topic-mapping (ptm) model , to mine parallel document-collections to simultaneously discover latent topics in both sets of documents as well as the mapping of topics in one set to those in the other . we evaluate the ptm model on one real parallel document-collection in it-service domain . we show that ptm can effectively discover meaningful topics , as well as their mappings , and it 's also useful for improving text-matching and retrieval when there 's a vocabulary gap .
