valid-scope computation for location-dependent-spatial-query in mobile-broadcast environments wireless-data-broadcast is an efficient and scalable means to provide information-access for a large population of clients in mobile-environments . with location-based-services (lbss) deployed upon a broadcast-channel , mobile-clients can collect data from the channel to answer their location-dependent spatial queries (ldsqs) . since the results of ldsqs would become invalid when mobile-client moves to new locations , the knowledge of valid scopes for ldsq results is necessary to assist clients to determine if their previous ldsq results can be reused after they moved . this effectively improves query response-time and client energy-consumption . in this paper , we devise efficient-algorithms to determine valid scopes for various ldsqs including range , window and nearest-neighbor-queries along with ldsq processing over a broadcast-channel . we conduct an extensive set of experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms . while the proposed valid-scope algorithm incurs only little extra processing overhead , unnecessary ldsq reevaluation is significantly eliminated , thus providing faster query response and saving client energy .
