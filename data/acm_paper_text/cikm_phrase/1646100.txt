efficient feature-weighting methods for ranking feature-weighting-or-selection is a crucial process to identify an important subset of features from a data-set . removing irrelevant or redundant features can improve the generalization performance of ranking-functions in information-retrieval . due to fundamental differences between classification and ranking , feature-weighting methods developed for classification can not be readily applied to feature-weighting for ranking . a state-of-the-art feature-selection-method for ranking , called gas , has been recently proposed , which exploits importance of each feature and similarity between every pair of features . however , gas must compute the similarity-scores of all pairs of features , thus it is not scalable for high-dimensional-data and its performance degrades on nonlinear ranking-functions . this paper proposes novel algorithms , rankwrapper and rankfilter , which is scalable for high-dimensional-data and also performs reasonably well on nonlinear ranking-functions . rankwrapper and rankfilter are designed based on the key idea of relief algorithm . relief is a feature-selection-algorithm for classification , which exploits the notions of hits (data points within the same class) and misses (data points from different classes) for classification . however , there is no such notion of hits or misses in ranking . the proposed algorithms instead utilize the ranking distances of nearest data points in order to identify the key features for ranking . our extensive experiments show that rankwrapper and rankfilter generate higher accuracy overall than the gas and traditional relief algorithms adapted for ranking , and run substantially faster than the gas on high-dimensional-data .
