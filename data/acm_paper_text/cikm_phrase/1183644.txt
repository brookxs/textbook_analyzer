a document-centric-approach to static index-pruning in text-retrieval-systems we present a static index-pruning method , to be used in ad-hoc document-retrieval tasks , that follows a document-centric-approach to decide whether a posting for a given term should remain in the index or not . the decision is made based on the term 's contribution to the document 's kullback-leibler-divergence from the text-collection 's global language-model . our technique can be used to decrease the size of the index by over 90 \ % , at only a minor decrease in retrieval-effectiveness . it thus allows us to make the index small enough to fit entirely into the main-memory of a single pc , even for large text collections containing millions of documents . this results in great efficiency gains , superior to those of earlier pruning methods , and an average-response-time around 20 ms on the gov2 document-collection .
