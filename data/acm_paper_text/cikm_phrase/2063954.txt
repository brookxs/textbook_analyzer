detection of text-quality flaws as a one-class-classification problem for web-applications that are based on user-generated-content the detection of text-quality flaws is a key concern . our research contributes to automatic quality flaw-detection . in particular , we propose to cast the detection of text-quality flaws as a one-class-classification problem : we are given only positive examples (= texts containing a particular quality flaw) and decide whether or not an unseen text suffers from this flaw . we argue that common binary or multiclass-classification approaches are ineffective in here , and we underpin our approach by a real-world-application : we employ a dedicated one-class-learning approach to determine whether a given wikipedia article suffers from certain quality flaws . since in the wikipedia setting the acquisition of sensible test-data is quite intricate , we analyze the effects of a biased sample-selection . in addition , we illustrate the classifier effectiveness as a function of the flaw distribution in order to cope with the unknown (real-world) flaw-specific class imbalances . altogether , provided test-data with little noise , four from ten important quality flaws in wikipedia can be detected with a precision close to 1 .
