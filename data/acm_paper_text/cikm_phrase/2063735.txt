pattern change discovery between high-dimensional-data sets this paper investigates the general problem of pattern change discovery between high-dimensional-data sets . current methods either mainly focus on magnitude change-detection of low-dimensional data-sets or are under supervised frameworks . in this paper , the notion of the principal-angles between the subspaces is introduced to measure the subspace difference between two high-dimensional-data sets . principal-angles bear a property to isolate subspace change from the magnitude change . to address the challenge of directly computing the principal-angles , we elect to use matrix-factorization to serve as a statistical framework and develop the principle of the dominant subspace mapping to transfer the principal angle_based detection to a matrix-factorization problem . we show how matrix-factorization can be naturally embedded into the likelihood-ratio-test based on the linear-models . the proposed method is of an unsupervised nature and addresses the statistical-significance of the pattern changes between high-dimensional-data sets . we have showcased the different applications of this solution in several specific real-world-applications to demonstrate the power and effectiveness of this method .
