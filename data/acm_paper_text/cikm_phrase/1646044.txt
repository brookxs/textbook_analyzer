mashup-based information-retrieval for domain-experts in this paper , we tackle the problem of helping domain-experts to construct , parameterize and deploy mashups of data and code . we view a mashup as a data-processing flow , that describes how data is obtained from one or more sources , processed by one or more components , and finally sent to one or more sinks . our approach allows specifying patterns of flows , in a language called cascade . the patterns cover different possible variations of the flows , including variations in the structure of the flow , the components in the flow and the possible parameterizations of these components . we present a tool that makes use of this knowledge of flow patterns and associated metadata to allow domain-experts to explore the space of possible flows described in the pattern . the tool uses an ai-planning approach to automatically build a flow , belonging to the flow-pattern , from a high-level goal , specified as a set of tags . we describe examples from the financial-services domain to show the use of flow patterns in allowing domain-experts to construct a large variety of mashups rapidly .
