to divide-and-conquer search-ranking by learning query-difficulty learning-to-rank plays an important role in information-retrieval . in most of the existing solutions for learning-to-rank , all the queries with their returned search-results are learnt and ranked with a single model . in this paper , we demonstrate that it is highly beneficial to divide queries into multiple groups and conquer search-ranking based on query-difficulty . to this end , we propose a method which first characterizes a query using a variety of features extracted from user-search-behavior , such as the click entropy , the query-reformulation probability . next , a classification-model is built on these extracted features to assign a score to represent how difficult a query is . based on this score , our method automatically divides queries into groups , and trains a specific ranking-model for each group to conquer search-ranking . experimental-results on ranksvm and ranknet with a large-scale evaluation dataset show that the proposed method can achieve significant improvement in the task of web-search-ranking .
