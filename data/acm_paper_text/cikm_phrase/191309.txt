semantics-based information-brokering the rapid advances in computer and communication-technologies , and their merger , is leading to a global information market place . it will consist of federations of very-large number of information-systems that will cooperate to varying extents to support the users ' information-needs . we discuss an approach to information-brokering in the above environment . we discuss two of its tasks : information-resource discovery , which identifies relevant-information sources for a given query , and query-processing , which involves the generation of appropriate mapping from relevant but structurally heterogeneous-objects . query-processing consists of information focusing and information correlation . our approach is based on : semantic proximity , which represents semantic similarities based on the context of comparison , and schema-correspondences which are used to represent structural mappings and are associated with the context . the context of comparison of the two objects is the primary vehicle to represent the semantics for determining semantic proximity . specifically , we use a partial context-representation to capture the semantics in terms of the assumptions in the intended use of the objects and the intended meaning of the user-query . information focusing is supported by subsequent context-comparison . the same mechanism can be used to support information-resource discovery . context-comparison leads to changes in schema-correspondences that are used to support information correlation .
