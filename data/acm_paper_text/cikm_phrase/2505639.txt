personalized point-of-interest recommendation by mining users ' preference transition location-based-social-networks (lbsns) offer researchers rich-data to study people 's online activities and mobility-patterns . one important application of such studies is to provide personalized point-of-interest (poi) recommendations to enhance user-experience in lbsns . previous solutions directly predict users ' preference on locations but fail to provide insights about users ' preference transitions among locations . in this work , we propose a novel category-aware poi recommendation-model , which exploits the transition patterns of users ' preference over location categories to improve location-recommendation accuracy . our approach consists of two stages : (1) preference transition (over location categories) prediction , and (2) category-aware poi recommendation . matrix-factorization is employed to predict a user 's preference transitions over categories and then her preference on locations in the corresponding categories . real-data_based experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art poi recommendation models by at least 39.75 % in terms of recall .
