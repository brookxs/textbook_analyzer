instance - and bag-level manifold-regularization for aggregate-outputs-classification aggregate outputs learning differs from the classical supervised learning setting in that , training-samples are packed into bags with only the aggregate outputs (labels for classification or real values for regression) known . this setting of the problem is associated with several kinds of application background . we focus on the aggregate-outputs-classification problem in this paper , and set up a manifold-regularization framework to deal with it . the framework can be of both instance level and bag level for different testing goals . we propose four concrete algorithms based on our framework , each of which can cope with both binary and multi-class scenarios . the experimental-results on several datasets suggest that our algorithms outperform the state-of-art technique .
