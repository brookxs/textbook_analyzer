page-access-scheduling in join-processing the join relational operation is one of the most expensive among database operations . in this study , we consider the problem of scheduling page accesses in join-processing . this raises two interesting problems : 1) determining a page access sequence that uses the minimum number of buffer pages without any page reaccesses , and 2) determining a page access sequence that minimizes the number of page reaccesses for a given buffer-size . we use a graph-model to represent the pages from the relations that contain tuples to be joined , and present new heuristics for the two problems based on the sort-merge join and the simple tid algorithm . our experimental-results show that the new heuristics perform well .
