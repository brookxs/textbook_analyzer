using micro-information-units for internet-search internet-search is one of the most important applications of the-web . a search-engine takes the user 's keywords to retrieve and to rank those pages that contain the keywords . one shortcoming of existing search-techniques is that they do not give due consideration to the micro-structures of a web-page . a web-page is often populated with a number of small information units , which we call micro-information-units (miu) . each unit focuses on a specific topic and occupies a specific area of the page . during the search , if all the keywords in the user-query occur in a single miu of a page , the top ranking results returned by a search-engine are generally relevant and useful . however , if the query words scatter at different mius in a page , the pages returned can be quite irrelevant (which causes low precision) . the reason for this is that although a page has information on individual mius , it may not have information on their intersections . in this paper , we propose a technique to solve this problem . at the off-line pre-processing stage , we segment each page to identify the mius in the page , and index the keywords of the page according to the mius in which they occur . in searching , our retrieval and ranking-algorithm utilizes this additional-information to return those most relevant pages . experimental-results show that this method is able to significantly improve the search precision .
