a novel distributed p2p simulator architecture : d-p2p-sim in this paper we introduce a novel distributed-simulation environment with gui for p2p simulations (d-p2p-sim) . the key aim is to provide the appropriate integrated-set of tools in a single software-solution to evaluate the performance of various protocols . the basic architecture of the distributed p2p simulator is based on a multi-threading , asynchronous , message-passing and distributed-environment with graphical-user-interface to facilitate ease-of-use by both researchers and programmers .
