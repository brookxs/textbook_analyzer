correlated multi-label feature-selection multi-label-learning studies the problem where each instance is associated with a set of labels . there are two challenges in multi-label-learning : (1) the labels are interdependent and correlated , and (2) the data are of high-dimensionality . in this paper , we aim to tackle these challenges in one shot . in particular , we propose to learn the label-correlation and do feature-selection simultaneously . we introduce a matrix-variate normal prior-distribution on the weight vectors of the classifier to model the label-correlation . our goal is to find a subset of features , based on which the label-correlation regularized loss of label ranking is minimized . the resulting multi-label feature-selection problem is a mixed integer-programming , which is reformulated as quadratically constrained linear-programming (qclp) . it can be solved by cutting-plane algorithm , in each iteration of which a minimax-optimization problem is solved by dual-coordinate-descent and projected sub-gradient descent alternatively . experiments on benchmark data sets illustrate that the proposed methods outperform single-label feature-selection-method and many other state-of-the-art multi-label-learning methods .
