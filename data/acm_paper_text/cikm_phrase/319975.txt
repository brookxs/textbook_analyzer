extending complex ad-hoc olap large-scale-data-analysis and mining activities require sophisticated information-extraction queries . many queries require complex aggregation , and many of these aggregates are non-distributive . conventional solutions to this problem involve defining user defined aggregate-functions (udafs) . however , the use of udafs entails several problems . defining a new udaf can be a significant burden for the user , and optimizing queries involving udafs is difficult because of the black-box nature of the udaf . in this paper , we present a method for expressing nested aggregates in a declarative way . a nested aggregate , which is a rollup of another aggregated value , expresses a wide range of useful non-distributive aggregation . for example , most frequent type aggregation can be naturally expressed using nested aggregation , e.g. for each product , report its total sales during the month with the largest total sales of the product . by expressing compex aggregates declaratively , we relieve the user of the burden of defining udafs , and allow the evalution of the complex aggregates to be optimized . we use the extended multi-feature (emf) syntax as the basis for expressing nested aggregation . an advantage of this approach is that emf sql can already express a wide range of complex aggregation in a succinct way , and emf sql is easily optimized into efficient query plans . we show that nested aggregation-queries can be evaluated efficiently by using a small extension to the emf sql-query evaluation-algorithm . a side-effect of this extension is to extend emf sql to permit complex aggregation of data from multiple sources .
