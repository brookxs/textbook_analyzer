fast top-k simple shortest-paths discovery in graphs with the wide applications of large-scale graph-data such as social-networks , the problem of finding the top - k shortest-paths attracts increasing attention . this paper focuses on the discovery of the top - k simple shortest-paths (paths without loops) . the well known algorithm for this problem is due to yen , and the provided worstcase bound o (kn (m + nlogn)) , which comes from o (n) times single-source-shortest-path discovery for each of k shortest-paths , remains unbeaten for 30 years , where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges . in this paper , we observe that there are shared sub-paths among o (kn) single-source shortest paths . the basic idea behind our method is to pre-compute the shortest-paths to the target node , and utilize them to reduce the discovery cost at running-time . specifically , we transform the original graph by encoding the pre-computed paths , and prove that the shortest-path discovered over the transformed graph is equivalent to that in the original graph . most importantly , the path-discovery over the transformed graph can be terminated much earlier than before . in addition , two optimization strategies are presented . one is to reduce the total iteration times for shortest-path discovery , and the other is to prune the search-space in each iteration with an adaptively-determined threshold . although the worst-case complexity can not be lowered , our method is proven to be much more efficient in a general case . the final extensive experimental-results (on both real and synthetic graphs) also show that our method offers a significant performance-improvement over the existing ones .
