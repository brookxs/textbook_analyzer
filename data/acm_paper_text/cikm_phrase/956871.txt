replication and retrieval-strategies of multidimensional-data on parallel-disks aside from enhancing data-availability during disk failures , replication of data is also used to speed up i/o-performance of read-intensive applications . there are two issues that need to be addressed : (a) data-placement (which disks should store the copies of each data block ?) and (b) scheduling (given a query q , and a placement scheme p of the data , from which disk should each block in q be retrieved so that retrieval-time is minimized ?) in this paper , we consider range-queries and assume that the dataset is a multidimensional grid and r copies of each unit block of the-grid must be stored among m disks . to accurately measure performance of a scheduling-algorithm , we consider a metric that takes into account the scheduling-overhead as well as the time it takes to retrieve the data blocks from the disks . we describe several combinations of data-placement schemes and scheduling-algorithms and analyze their performance for range-queries with respect to the above metric . we then present simulation-results for the most interesting case r = 2 , showing that the strategies do perform better than the previously known method , especially for large-queries .
