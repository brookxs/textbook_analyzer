metkb : enriching rdf knowledge-bases with web entity-attribute tables there are many entity-attribute tables on the web that can be utilized for enriching the entities of an rdf knowledge-base . this requires the schema-mapping (matching) between the-web tables and the rdf knowledge-base . in this paper , we propose a feasible solution that is able to automatically search and rank entity-attribute tables from the-web , and effectively map the extracted tables with the rdf knowledge-base with very few manual efforts .
