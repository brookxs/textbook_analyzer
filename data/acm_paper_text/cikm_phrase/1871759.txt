exploiting sequential relationships for familial classification the pervasive nature of the-internet has caused a significant transformation in the field of genealogical research . this has impacted not only how research is conducted , but has also dramatically increased the number of people discovering their family-history . recent market-research (maritz marketing 2000 , harris interactive 2009) indicates that general interest in the united-states has increased from 45 \ % in 1996 , to 60 \ % in 2000 , and 87 \ % in 2009 . increased popularity has caused a dramatic need for improvements in algorithms related to extracting , accessing , and processing genealogical data for use in building family trees . this paper presents one approach to algorithmic improvement in the-family history domain , where we infer the familial relationships of households found in human transcribed united-states-census data . by applying advances made in natural-language-processing , exploiting the sequential nature of the census , and using state-of-the-art machine-learning-algorithms , we were able to decrease the error by 35 \ % over a hand coded baseline system . the resulting system is immediately applicable to hundreds of millions of other genealogical records where families are represented , but the familial relationships are missing .
