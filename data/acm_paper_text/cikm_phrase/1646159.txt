scalable-indexing of rdf-graphs for efficient join-processing current approaches to rdf graph indexing suffer from weak data-locality , i.e. , information regarding a piece of data appears in multiple locations , spanning multiple data structures . weak data-locality negatively impacts storage and query-processing costs . towards stronger data-locality , we propose a three-way triple tree (triplet) secondary-memory indexing-technique to facilitate flexible and efficient join evaluation on rdf-data . the novelty of triplet is that the index is built over the atoms occurring in the data-set , rather than at a coarser granularity , such as whole triples occurring in the data-set ; and , the atoms are indexed regardless of the roles (i.e. , subjects , predicates , or objects) they play in the triples of the data-set . we show-through extensive empirical-evaluation that triplet exhibits multiple orders of magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art , in terms of both storage and query-processing costs .
