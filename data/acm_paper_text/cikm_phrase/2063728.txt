a cross-domain adaptation method for sentiment-classification using probabilistic latent analysis sentiment-classification is becoming attractive in recent years because of its potential commercial-applications . it exploits supervised-learning methods to learn the classifiers from the annotated training documents . the challenge in sentiment-classification lies in that the sentiment domains are diverse , heterogeneous and fast-growing . the classifiers trained on one domain (source-domain) could not classify a document from another domain (target-domain) . the domain-adaptation technique is to address the problem by making use of labeled samples in the source-domain , and unlabeled-samples in the target-domain . this paper presents a new solution , a cross-domain topic-indexing (cdti) method , with which a common semantic-space is found from the prior between-domain term correspondences and the term co-occurrences in the cross-domain documents . these observations are characterized with the mixture-model in cdti , with each component being a possible topic shared by the source and target domains . such common topics are found to index the cross-domain content . we evaluate the algorithms on a multi-domain sentiment-classification task , which shows that cdti outperforms the state-of-the-art domain-adaptation method , i.e. spectral feature-alignment (sfa) , and the traditional latent-semantic-indexing method .
