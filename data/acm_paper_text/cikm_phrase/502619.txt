exploiting a controlled-vocabulary to improve collection-selection and retrieval-effectiveness vocabulary incompatibilities arise when the terms used to index a document-collection are largely unknown , or at least not well-known to the users who eventually search the collection . no matter how comprehensive or well-structured the indexing vocabulary , it is of little use if it is not used effectively in query-formulation . this paper demonstrates that techniques for mapping user queries into the controlled-indexing-vocabulary have the potential to radically improve document-retrieval performance . we also show how the use of controlled-indexing-vocabulary can be employed to achieve performance gains for collection-selection . finally , we demonstrate the potential benefit of combining these two techniques in an interactive-retrieval environment . given a user-query , our evaluation-approach simulates the human user 's choice of terms for query augmentation given a list of controlled-vocabulary terms suggested by a system . this strategy lets us evaluate interactive strategies without the need for human-subjects .
