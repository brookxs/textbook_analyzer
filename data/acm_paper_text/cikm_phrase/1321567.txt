ntjfsat : a novel method for query with not-predicates on xml-data previous researches , in the filed of xml-databases , have been done to evaluate xml-queries with and-branches . however , as far as we know , very little work has examined the efficient processing of xml-queries with not-predicates . also these methods have to process all of the query nodes in the document when dealing with queries with not-branch . in this paper , with some modification in tjfast method , we propose a new manner for answering to various not-queries . this method processes nodes efficiently , in a way that in the ideal state , we obtain part of the answer after the process of each node , and we do n't have any unreasonable processing of each node .
