concept-based interactive-query-expansion despite the recent advances in search-quality , the fast increase in the size-of-the-web collection has introduced new challenges for web-ranking algorithms . in fact , there are still many situations in which the users are presented with imprecise or very poor results . one of the key difficulties is the fact that users usually submit very short and ambiguous-queries , and they do not fully specify their information-needs . that is , it is necessary to improve the query-formation process if better answers are to be provided . in this work we propose a novel concept-based query-expansion technique , which allows disambiguating queries submitted to search-engines . the concepts are extracted by analyzing and locating cycles in a special type of query relations graph . this is a directed-graph built from query relations mined using association-rules . the concepts related to the current query are then shown to the user who selects the one concept that he interprets is most related to his query . this concept is used to expand the original query and the expanded query is processed instead . using a web test collection , we show that our approach leads to gains in average-precision figures of roughly 32 \ % . further , if the user also provides information on the type of relation between his query and the selected concept , the gains in average-precision go up to roughly 52 \ % .
