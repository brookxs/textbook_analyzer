mining undiscovered public knowledge from complementary and non-interactive biomedical-literature through semantic pruning two complementary and non-interactive literature sets of articles , when they are considered together , can reveal useful information of scientific interest not apparent in either of the two document-sets . swanson called the existence of such knowledge , undiscovered public knowledge (udpk) . this paper proposes a semantic-based mining-model for udpk . our method replaces manual ad-hoc pruning with using semantic-knowledge from the biomedical-ontologies . using the semantic types and semantic-relationships of the biomedical concepts , our prototype-system can identify the relevant concepts collected from medline and generate the novel hypothesis between these concepts . the system successfully replicates swanson 's two famous discoveries : raynaud disease/fish oils and migraine/magnesium . compared with previous approaches , our methods generate much fewer but more relevant novel hypotheses , and require much less human-intervention in the discovery procedure .
