finding redundant and complementary communities in multidimensional-networks community-discovery in networks is the problem of detecting , for each node , its membership to one of more groups of nodes , the communities , that are densely connected , or highly interactive . we define the community-discovery problem in multidimensional-networks , where more than one connection may reside between any two nodes . we also introduce two measures able to characterize the communities found . our experiments on real-world multidimensional-networks support the methodology proposed in this paper , and open the way for a new class of algorithms , aimed at capturing the multifaceted complexity of connections among nodes in a network .
