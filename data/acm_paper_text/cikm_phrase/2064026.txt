entity-timelines : visual-analytics and named-entity evolution the constantly evolving web reflects the evolution of society . knowledge about entities (people , companies , political parties , etc.) evolves over time . facts add up (e.g. , awards , lawsuits , divorces) , change (e.g. , spouses , ceos , political positions) , and even cease to exist (e.g. , countries split into smaller or join into bigger ones) . analytics of the evolution of the entities poses many challenges including extraction , disambiguation , and canonization of entities from large text collections as well as introduction of specific analysis and interactivity methods for the evolving entity data . in this demonstration proposal , we consider a novel problem of the evolution of named-entities . to this end , we have extracted , disambiguated , canonicalized , and connected named-entities with the yago ontology . to analyze the evolution we have developed a visual-analytics system . careful preprocessing and ranking of the ontological data allowed us to propose wide range of effective interactions and data-analysis techniques including advanced filtering , contrasting timeliness of entities and drill down/roll up evolving data .
