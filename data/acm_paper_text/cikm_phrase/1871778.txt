rdfviews : a storage tuning wizard for rdf applications in recent years , the significant growth of rdf-data used in numerous applications has made its efficient and scalable manipulation an important issue . in this paper , we present rdfviews , a system capable of choosing the most suitable views to materialize , in order to minimize the query response-time for a specific sparql-query workload , while taking into account the view-maintenance cost and storage space constraints . our system employs practical algorithms and heuristics to navigate through the search-space of potential view configurations , and exploits the possibly available semantic-information - expressed via an rdf schema - to ensure the completeness of the query-evaluation .
