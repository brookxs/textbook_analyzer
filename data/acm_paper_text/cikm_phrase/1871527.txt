index-structures for efficiently searching natural-language-text many existing indexes on text work at the document granularity and are not effective in answering the class of queries where the desired answer is only a term or a phrase . in this paper , we study some of the index-structures that are capable of answering the class of queries referred to here as wild-card-queries and perform an analysis of their performance . our experimental-results on a large class of queries from different sources (including query-logs and parse trees) and with various datasets reveal some of the performance barriers of these indexes . we then present word permuterm index (wpi) which is an adaptation of the permuterm index for natural-language-text applications and show that this index supports a wide range of wild-card-queries , is quick to construct and is highly scalable . our experimental-results comparing wpi to alternative methods on a wide range of wild-card-queries show a few orders of magnitude performance-improvements for wpi while the memory-usage is kept the same for all compared systems .
