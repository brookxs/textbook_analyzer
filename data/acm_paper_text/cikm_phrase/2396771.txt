social contextual-recommendation exponential growth of information generated by online-social-networks demands effective recommender-systems to give useful results . traditional techniques become unqualified because they ignore social relation data ; existing social-recommendation approaches consider social-network structure , but social-context has not been fully considered . it is significant and challenging to fuse social contextual-factors which are derived from users ' motivation of social-behaviors into social-recommendation . in this paper , we investigate social-recommendation on the basis of psychology and sociology studies , which exhibit two important factors : individual preference and interpersonal influence . we first present the particular importance of these two factors in online item adoption and recommendation . then we propose a novel probabilistic-matrix-factorization method to fuse them in latent spaces . we conduct experiments on both facebook style bidirectional and twitter style unidirectional social-network datasets in china . the empirical result and analysis on these two large-datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperform the existing approaches .
