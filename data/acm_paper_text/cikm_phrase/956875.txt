visualization of communication patterns in collaborative innovation networks - analysis of some w3c working groups collaborative innovation networks (coins) are groups of self-motivated individuals from various parts of an organization or from multiple organizations , empowered by the-internet , who work together on a new idea , driven by a common vision . in this paper we report first results of a project that examines innovation-networks by analyzing the e-mail archives of some w3c (www consortium) working groups . these groups exhibit ideal characteristics for our purpose , as they form truly global networks working together over the-internet to develop next generation technologies . we first describe the software-tools we developed to visualize the temporal communication-flow , which represent communication-patterns as directed-acyclic-graphs , we then show initial results , which revealed significant variations between the communication-patterns and network-structures of the different groups. , we were also able to identify distinctive communication-patterns among group leaders , both those who were officially appointed and other who were assuming unofficial coordinating roles .
