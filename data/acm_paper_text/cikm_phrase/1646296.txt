boosting knn text classification-accuracy by using supervised term-weighting-schemes the increasing availability of digital-documents in the last decade has prompted the development of machine-learning-techniques to automatically classify and organize text-documents . the majority of text-classification systems rely on the vector-space-model , which represents the documents as vectors in the term space . each vector component is assigned a weight that reflects the importance of the term in the document . typically , these weights are assigned using an information-retrieval (ir) approach , such as the famous tf-idf function . in this work , we study two weighting-schemes based on information-gain and chi-square statistics . these schemes take advantage of the category-label information to weight the terms according to their distributions across the different categories . we show that using these supervised-weights instead of conventional unsupervised weights can greatly improve the performance of the k-nearest-neighbor (knn) classifier . experimental evaluations , carried out on multiple text-classification tasks , demonstrate the benefits of this approach in creating accurate text classifiers .
