tc-dca : a system for text-classification based on document 's content allocation the text-classification methods heavily depend on machine-learning-algorithms with abstract mathematic metrics , which obstruct the direct observation and intuitive understanding of the text-specific classification . in this paper , we model a document as a document-classes-topics top-down hierarchical structure . furthermore , by running the document generation procedure , we can obtain each class 's content share , which not only can be used to make the classification decision but also can provide a natural visualization approach for text-classification . we implement this idea by a new tool named tc-dca , which provides the visualization-of-text classification result , where the target document is expressed graphically as its content 's allocation on every class . tc-dca can also perform the drilling down operation to reveal the classification effect of each word of the document .
