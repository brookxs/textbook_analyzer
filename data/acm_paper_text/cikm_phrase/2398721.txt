luke and mike : learning from user knowledge and managing interactive-knowledge extraction semantic-recognition and annotation of unqiue enities and their relations is a key in understanding the essence contained in large-text-corpora . it typically requires a combination of efficient automatic methods and manual verification . usually , both parts are seen as consecutive steps . in this demo we present mike , a user-interface enabling the integration of user-feedback into an iterative-extraction process . we show how an extraction-system can directly learn from such integrated user supervision . in general , this setup allows for stepwise training of the extraction-system to a particular domain , while using user-feedback early in the iterative-extraction process improves extraction quality and reduces the overall human effort needed .
