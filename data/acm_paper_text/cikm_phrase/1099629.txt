an rsa-based time-bound hierarchical key assignment scheme for electronic article subscription the time-bound hierarchical key assignment-problem is to assign time sensitive keys to security-classes in a partially ordered hierarchy so that legal-data accesses among classes can be enforced . two time-bound hierarchical key assignment schemes have been proposed in the literature , but both of them were proved insecure against collusive attacks . in this paper , we will propose an rsa-based time-bound hierarchical key assignment scheme and describe its possible application . the security-analysis shows that the new scheme is safe against the collusive attacks .
