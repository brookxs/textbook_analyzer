optimal proactive-caching in peer-to-peer-network : analysis and application as a promising new-technology with the unique properties like high efficiency , scalability and fault-tolerance , peer-to-peer (p2p) technology is used as the underlying network to build new internet-scale-applications . however , one of the well known issues in such an application (for example www) is that the distribution of data popularities is heavily tailed with a zipf-like-distribution . with consideration of the skewed popularity we adopt a proactive-caching approach to handle the challenge , and focus on two key problems : where (i.e. the placement-strategy : where to place the replicas) and how (i.e. the degree problem : how many replicas are assigned to one specific content) ? for the where problem , we propose a novel approach which can be generally applied to structured-p2p networks . next , we solve two optimization objectives related to the how problem : max_perf and min_cost . our solution is called <b> popcache </b> , and we discover two interesting properties : (1) the number of replicas assigned to each content is proportional to its popularity ; (2) the derived optimal-solutions are related to the entropy of popularity . to our knowledge , none of the previous works has mentioned such results . finally , we apply the results of popcache to propose a p2p base web-caching , called as web-popcache . by means of web cache trace-driven-simulation , our extensive evaluation results demonstrate the advantages of popcache and web-popcache .
