a query-model based on normalized log-likelihood leveraging information from relevance-assessments has been proposed as an effective means for improving retrieval . we introduce a novel language-modeling method which uses information from each assessed document and their aggregate . while most previous approaches focus either on features of the entire set or on features of the individual relevant documents , our model exploits features of both the documents and the set as a whole . when evaluated , we show that our model is able to significantly improve over state-of-art feedback methods .
