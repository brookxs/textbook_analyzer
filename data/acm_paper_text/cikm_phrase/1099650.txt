on the estimation of frequent-itemsets for data-streams : theory and experiments in this paper , we devise a method for the estimation of the true support of itemsets on data-streams , with the objective to maximize one chosen criterion among {precision , recall} while ensuring a degradation as reduced as possible for the other criterion . we discuss the strengths , weaknesses and range of applicability of this method that relies on conventional uniform-convergence results , yet guarantees statistical optimality from different standpoints .
