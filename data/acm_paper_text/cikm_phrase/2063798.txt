redrive : result-driven database exploration through recommendations typically , users interact with database-systems by formulating queries . however , many times users do not have a clear understanding of their information-needs or the exact content of the database , thus , their queries are of an exploratory nature . in this paper , we propose assisting users in database exploration by recommending to them additional items that are highly related with the items in the result of their original query . such items are computed based on the most interesting sets of attribute values (or fasets) that appear in the result of the original user-query . the interestingness of a faset is defined based on its frequency both in the query result and in the database instance . database frequency estimations rely on a novel approach that employs an e-tolerance closed rare fasets representation . we report evaluation results of the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our approach on both real and synthetic datasets .
