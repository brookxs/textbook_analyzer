answering questions with authority this paper presents a novel approach to textual question-answering (qa) which identifies answers to natural-language questions by leveraging large-collections of question-answer pairs extracted from web sources or generated automatically from text . instead of using the traditional retrieve-and-rerank approach common to most previous approaches to factoid-question-answering , we introduce a new model of answer authority which allows question-answering-systems to estimate the quality of answers not just in isolation - but in the larger context of the information contained in the corpus as a whole . our approach in this paper hinges on the creation of a new representation of the information stored in a document-collection , known as a question-answer database (quab) . we assume that a quab represents a weighted directed-graph consisting of the set of factoid question-answer pairs (qap) that can be asked - and answered - given the content of a corpus . once a set of qap have been generated , we use inferential relationships identified by a system for recognizing-textual-entailment in order to construct the link-structure necessary to compute the authority of each interconnected question or answer . we have found access to the quab graph not only improves the accuracy of current answer-retrieval techniques , but also allows for the determination of when no valid answer can be found for a question in a text-corpus . experimental-results show that the authority derived from a graph of question-answer pairs can increase the performance of a factoid qa-system by nearly 30 \ % .
