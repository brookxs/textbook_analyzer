the earth mover 's distance as a semantic-measure for document-similarity different words are usually assumed to be semantically independent in most existing similarity-measures , which is not often true in practice . the semantic relatedness between words can not be conveniently employed in the existing measures . we propose a novel similarity-measure based on the earth mover 's distance (emd) . in the proposed measure , the semantic distances between words are computed based on the electronic lexical database-wordnet and then the emd is employed to calculate the document similarity with a many-to-many matching between words . experiments and results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed similarity-measure .
