a system for knowledge-management in bioinformatics the emerging biochip technology has made it possible to simultaneously study expression (activity level) of thousands of genes or proteins in a single experiment in the laboratory . however , in order to extract relevant biological knowledge from the biochip experimental-data , it is critical not only to analyze the experimental-data , but also to cross-reference and correlate these large volumes of data with information available in external biological-databases accessible online . we address this problem in a comprehensive system for knowledge-management in bioinformatics called e2e . to the biologist or biological-applications , e2e exposes a common semantic view of inter-relationship among biological concepts in the form of an xml-representation called expressml , while internally , it can use any data-integration solution to retrieve data and return results corresponding to the semantic view . we have implemented an e2e prototype that enables a biologist to analyze her gene-expression-data in geml or from a public site like stanford , and discover knowledge through operations like querying on relevant annotated data represented in expressml using pathways data from kegg , publication data from medline and protein data from swiss-prot .
