measuring website similarity using an entity-aware click-graph query-logs record the actual usage of search systems and their analysis has proven critical to improving search-engine functionality . yet , despite the deluge of information , query-log-analysis often suffers from the sparsity of the query space . based on the observation that most queries pivot around a single entity that represents the main focus of the user 's need , we propose a new model for query-log-data called the entity-aware click-graph . in this representation , we decompose queries into entities and modifiers , and measure their association with clicked pages . we demonstrate the benefits of this approach on the crucial task of understanding which websites fulfill similar user-needs , showing that using this representation we can achieve a higher precision than other query log-based approaches .
