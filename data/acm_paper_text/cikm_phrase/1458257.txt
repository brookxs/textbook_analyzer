privacy-preserving-data-publishing for horizontally partitioned databases there is an increasing need for sharing data-repositories containing personal-information across multiple distributed , possibly untrusted , and private databases . such data-sharing is subject to constraints imposed by privacy of data subjects as well as data-confidentiality of institutions or data providers . we developed a set of decentralized protocols that enable data-sharing for horizontally partitioned databases given these constraints . our approach includes a distributed anonymization protocol that allows independent data providers to build a virtual anonymized database , and a distributed-querying protocol that allows clients to query the virtual database .
