concept-frequency distribution in biomedical-text summarization text-summarization is a data-reduction process . the use of text-summarization enables users to reduce the amount of text that must be read while still assimilating the core information . the data-reduction offered by text-summarization is particularly useful in the biomedical-domain , where physicians must continuously find clinical-trial study information to incorporate into their patient treatment efforts . such efforts are often hampered by the high-volume of publications . our contribution is two-fold : 1) to propose the frequency of domain-concepts as a method to identify important sentences within a full-text ; and 2) propose a novel frequency-distribution model and algorithm for identifying important sentences based on term or concept-frequency distribution . an evaluation of several existing summarization-systems using biomedical texts is presented in order to determine a performance baseline . for domain concept comparison , a recent high-performing frequency-based algorithm using terms is adapted to use concepts and evaluated using both terms and concepts . it is shown that the use of concepts performs closely with the use of terms for sentence-selection . our proposed frequency-distribution model and algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art approach .
