mining community-structure of named-entities from free-text although community-discovery has been studied extensively in the web environment , limited research has been done in the case of free-text . co-occurrence of words and entities in sentences and documents usually implies connections among them . in this paper , we investigate the co-occurrences of named-entities in text , and mine communities among these entities . we show that identifying communities from free-text can be transformed into a graph-clustering problem . a hierarchical-clustering algorithm is then proposed . our experiment shows that the algorithm is effective to discover named-entity communities from text-documents .
