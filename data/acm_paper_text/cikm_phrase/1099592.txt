clustering high-dimensional-data using an efficient and effective data space reduction this paper introduces a new algorithm for clustering data in high-dimensional feature spaces , called garden hd . the algorithm is organized around the notion of data-space reduction , i.e. the process of detecting dense areas (dense cells) in the space . it performs effective and efficient elimination of empty areas that characterize typical high-dimensional spaces and an efficient adjacency-connected agglomeration of dense cells into larger clusters . it produces a compact-representation that can effectively capture the essence of data . garden hd is a hybrid of cell-based and density-based-clustering . however , unlike typical clustering-methods in its class , it applies a recursive-partition of sparse regions in the space using a new space-partitioning strategy . the properties of this partitioning strategy greatly facilitate data-space reduction . the experiments on synthetic and real-data sets reveal that garden hd and its data-space reduction are effective , efficient , and scalable .
