a near optimal-algorithm for generating broadcast-programs on multiple-channels in a wireless-environment , the bandwidth of the channels and the energy of the portable-devices are limited . data-broadcast has become an excellent method for efficient data-dissemination . in this paper , the problem for generating a broadcast-program of a set of data items with the associated access frequencies on multiple-channels is explored . in our approach , an expected average access-time of the broadcast-data items is first derived . the broadcast-program is then generated , which minimizes the expected average access-time . simulation is performed to compare the performance of our approach with two existing approaches . the result of the experiments shows that our approach outperforms others and is in fact close to the optimal .
