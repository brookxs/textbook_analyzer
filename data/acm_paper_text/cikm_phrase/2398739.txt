mouna : mining opinions to unveil neglected arguments a query topic can be subjective involving a variety of opinions , judgments , arguments , and many other debatable aspects . typically , search-engines process queries independently from the nature of their topics using a relevance-based retrieval-strategy . hence , search-results about subjective topics are often biased towards a specific view point or version . in this demo , we shall present mouna , a novel approach for opinion-diversification . given a query on a subjective topic , mouna ranks search-results based on three scores : (1) relevance of documents , (2) semantic diversity to avoid redundancy and capture the different arguments used to discuss the query topic , and (3) sentiment diversity to cover a balanced set of documents having positive , negative , and neutral sentiments about the query topic . moreover , mouna enhances the representation of search-results with a summary of the different arguments and sentiments related to the query topic . thus , the user can navigate through the results and explore the links between them . we provide an example scenario in this demonstration to illustrate the inadequacy of relevance-based techniques for searching subjective topics and highlight the innovative aspects of mouna . a video showing the demo can be found in http://www.youtube.com/user/mounakacimi/videos .
