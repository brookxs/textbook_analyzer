evaluating partial tree-pattern queries on xml-streams the streaming evaluation is a popular way of evaluating queries on xml-documents . besides its many advantages , it is also the only option for a number of important xml-applications . unfortunately , existing algorithms focus almost exclusively on tree-pattern-queries (tpqs) . requirements for flexible-querying of xml-data have motivated recently the introduction of query-languages that are more general and flexible than tpqs . we consider a partial-tree-pattern-query (ptpq) language which generalizes and strictly contains tpqs . ptpqs can express a fragment of xpath which comprises reverse axes and the node identity equality ($ is $) operator , in addition to forward axes , wildcards and predicates . we outline an original streaming-algorithm for ptpqs . our algorithm is the first one to support the streaming evaluation of such a broad fragment of xpath .
