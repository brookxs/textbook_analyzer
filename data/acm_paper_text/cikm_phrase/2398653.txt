mathematical equation retrieval using plain words as a query this paper proposes how to effectively retrieve the mathematical-equations when the plain words are given as a query . the proposed system requires no complicated mathematical symbols , no particular input tool and no constraint of query . users can enter a query with plain words like the traditional information-retrieval . for this , we extract features from the plain texts that are converted from the real math equations . experimental-results show an outstanding performance , a mrr of 0.6585 .
