mining conserved xml-query paths for dynamic-conscious caching existing xml-query pattern-based caching-strategies focus on extracting the set of frequently issued query pattern trees based on the number of occurrences of the query pattern trees in the history . each occurrence of the same query pattern tree is considered equally important for the caching-strategy . however , the same query pattern tree may occur at different timepoints in the history of xml-queries . this temporal-feature can be used to improve the caching-strategy . in this paper , we propose a novel type of query pattern called conserved query paths for efficient caching by integrating the support and temporal-features together . conserved query paths are paths in query pattern trees that never change or do not change significantly most of the time (if not always) in terms of their support values during a specific time period . we proposed an algorithm to extract those conserved query paths . by ranking those conserved query paths , a dynamic-conscious caching (dcc) strategy is proposed for efficient xml query-processing . experiments show that the dcc caching-strategy outperforms the existing xml-query-pattern tree-based caching-strategies .
