effective , design-independent xml-keyword-search keyword-search techniques that take advantage of xml structure make it very easy for ordinary-users to query xml-databases , but current approaches to processing these queries rely on intuitively appealing heuristics that are ultimately ad-hoc . these approaches often retrieve irrelevant answers , overlook relevant answers , and can not rank answers appropriately . to address these problems for data-centric-xml , we propose coherency ranking (cr) , a domain - and database design-independent ranking-method for xml keyword queries that is based on an extension of the concept of mutual-information . with cr , the results of a keyword-query are invariant under schema reorganization . we analyze how previous approaches to xml-keyword-search approximate cr , and present efficient-algorithms to perform cr . our empirical-evaluation with 65 user-supplied queries over two real-world xml-data sets shows that cr has better precision-and-recall and provides better ranking than all previous approaches .
