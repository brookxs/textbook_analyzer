suffix-trees for very-large genomic sequences a suffix-tree is a fundamental data-structure for string-searching algorithms . unfortunately , when it comes to the use of suffix-trees in real-life applications , the current methods for constructing suffix-trees do not scale for large inputs . all the existing practical algorithms perform random-access to the input-string , thus requiring that the input be small enough to be kept in main-memory . we are the first to present an algorithm which is able to construct suffix-trees for input-sequences significantly larger than the size of the available main-memory . as a proof-of-concept , we show that our method allows to build the suffix-tree for 12gb of real dna-sequences in 26 hours on a single-machine with 2gb of ram . this input is four times the size of the human-genome , and the construction of suffix-trees for inputs of such magnitude was never reported before .
