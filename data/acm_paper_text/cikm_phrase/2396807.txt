a graph-based-approach for ontology-population with named-entities automatically populating ontology with named-entities extracted from the unstructured-text has become a key issue for semantic-web and knowledge-management techniques . this issue naturally consists of two subtasks : (1) for the entity mention whose mapping entity does not exist in the ontology , attach it to the right category in the ontology (i.e. , fine-grained-named-entity-classification) , and (2) for the entity mention whose mapping entity is contained in the ontology , link it with its mapping real-world entity in the ontology (i.e. , entity-linking) . previous studies only focus on one of the two subtasks and can not solve this task of populating ontology with named-entities integrally . this paper proposes apollo , a graph-based-approach for populating ontology with named-entities . apollo leverages the rich semantic-knowledge embedded in the wikipedia to resolve this task via random-walks-on-graphs . meanwhile , apollo can be directly applied to either of the two subtasks with minimal revision . we have conducted a thorough experimental-study to evaluate the performance of apollo . the experimental-results show that apollo achieves significant accuracy improvement for the task of ontology-population with named-entities , and outperforms the baseline methods for both subtasks .
