vrifa : a nonlinear svm visualization-tool using nomogram and localized radial-basis-function (lrbf) kernels prediction problems are prevalent in medical domains . for example , computer-aided-diagnosis or prognosis is a key component in a cdss (clinical-decision-support-system) . svms , especially svms with nonlinear kernels such rbf kernels , have shown superior accuracy in prediction problems . however , they are not favorably used by physicians for medical prediction problems because nonlinear svms are difficult to visualize , thus it is hard to provide intuitive interpretation of prediction results to physicians . nomogram was proposed to visualize svm-classification models . however , it can not visualize nonlinear svm models . localized rbf (lrbf) kernel was proposed which shows comparable accuracy as the rbf kernel while the lrbf kernel is easier to interpret since it can be linearly decomposed . this paper presents a new tool named vrifa , which integrates the nomogram and lrbf kernel to provide users with an interactive-visualization of nonlinear svm models . vrifa graphically exposes the internal-structure of nonlinear svm models showing the effect of each feature , the magnitude of the effect , and the change at the prediction output . vrifa also performs nomogram-based feature-selection while training a model in order to remove noise or redundant features and improve the prediction-accuracy . the tool has been used by biomedical-researchers for computer-aided-diagnosis and risk-factor analysis for diseases . vrifa is accessible at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/vrifa .
