the role of variance in term-weighting for probabilistic-information-retrieval in probabilistic-approaches to information-retrieval , the occurrence of a query-term in a document contributes to the probability that the document will be judged relevant . it is typically assumed that the weight assigned to a query-term should be based on the expected value of that contribution . in this paper we show that the degree to which observable document features such as term frequencies are expected to vary is also important . by means of stochastic-simulation , we show that increased variance results in degraded retrieval-performance . we further show that by decreasing term-weights in the presence of variance , this degradation can be reduced . hence , probabilistic-models of information-retrieval must take into account not only the expected value of a query-term 's contribution but also the variance of document features .
