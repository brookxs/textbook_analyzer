heuristic containment check of partial tree-pattern queries in the presence of index graphs the wide adoption of xml has increased the interest of the database community on tree-structured-data management-techniques . querying capabilities are provided through tree-pattern-queries . the need for querying tree-structured-data sources when their structure is not fully known , and the need to integrate multiple data sources with different tree-structures have driven , recently , the suggestion of query-languages that relax the complete specification of a tree-pattern . in this paper , we use a query-language which allows partial tree-pattern queries (ptpqs) . the structure in a ptpq can be flexibly specified fully , partially or not at all . to evaluate a ptpq , we exploit index graphs which generate an equivalent set of `` complete '' tree-pattern queries.in order to process ptpqs , we need to efficiently solve the ptpq satisfiability and containment problems . these problems become more complex in the context of ptpqs because the partial-specification of the structure allows new , non-trivial , structural expressions to be derived from those explicitly specified in a ptpq . we address the problem of ptpq satisfiability and containment in the absence and in the presence of index graphs , and we provide necessary and sufficient-conditions for each case . to cope with the high complexity of ptpq containment in the presence of index graphs , we study a family of heuristic approaches for ptpq containment based on structural-information extracted from the index graph in advance and on-the-fly . we implement our approaches and we report on their extensive experimental-evaluation and comparison .
