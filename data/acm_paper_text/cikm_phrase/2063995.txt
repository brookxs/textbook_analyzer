the where in the tweet twitter is a widely-used social-networking service which enables its users to post text-based messages , so-called tweets . poi tags on tweets can show more human-readable high-level information about a place rather than just a pair of coordinates . in this paper , we attempt to predict the poi tag of a tweet based on its textual content and time of posting . potential applications include accurate positioning when gps devices fail and disambiguating places located near each other . we consider this task as a ranking problem , i.e. , we try to rank a set of candidate pois according to a tweet by using language and time models . to tackle the sparsity of tweets tagged with pois , we use web-pages retrieved by search-engines as an additional source of evidence . from our experiments , we find that users indeed leak some information about their accurate locations in their tweets .
