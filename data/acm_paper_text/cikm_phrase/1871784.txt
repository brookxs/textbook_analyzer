i-see : integrated stream execution-environment over on-line data streams the primary objective of various data-stream applications is to monitor the on-going variations of data elements newly generated in data-streams , so that appropriate services can be delivered to users timely . basically , such monitoring activities can be divided into three categories : instant event-monitoring , frequent behavior-monitoring and analytic olap measures monitoring . several prototype systems for data-streams have been introduced but they are designated to support only the operations of one or two categories . however , many real-world-data stream applications often require mixed operations of the three categories . this demonstration introduces an i ntegrated s tream e xecution e nvironment (i-see) that can support the mixed-execution of the operations of the three categories seamlessly , so that an i-see system can provide the multifaceted analytic results of on-line data streams continuously for various emerging applications .
