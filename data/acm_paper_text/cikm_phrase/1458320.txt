answering general time sensitive queries time is an important dimension of relevance for a large number of searches , such as over blogs and news archives . so far , research on searching over such collections has largely focused on locating topically similar documents for a query . unfortunately , topic similarity alone is not always sufficient for document-ranking . in this paper , we observe that , for an important class of queries that we call time-sensitive queries , the publication time of the documents in a news-archive is important and should be considered in conjunction with the topic similarity to derive the final document-ranking . earlier work has focused on improving retrieval for `` recency '' queries that target recent-documents . we propose a more general-framework for handling time-sensitive queries and we automatically identify the important time-intervals that are likely to be of interest for a query . then , we build scoring-techniques that seamlessly integrate the temporal aspect into the overall ranking mechanism . we extensively evaluated our techniques using a variety of news article data-sets , including trec-data as well as real web-data analyzed using the amazon-mechanical-turk . we examined several alternatives for detecting the important time-intervals for a query over a news-archive and for incorporating this information in the retrieval-process . our techniques are robust and significantly improve result quality for time-sensitive queries compared to state-of-the-art retrieval techniques .
