efficient-algorithms for generalized subgraph-query processing we study a new type of graph-queries , which injectively maps its edges to paths of the graphs in a given database , where the length of each path is constrained by a given threshold specified by the weight of the corresponding matching edge . we give important applications of the new graph-query and identify new challenges of processing such a query . then , we devise the cost-model of the branch-and-bound-algorithm framework for processing the graph-query , and propose an efficient-algorithm to minimize the cost overhead . we also develop three indexing-techniques to efficiently answer the queries online . finally , we verify the efficiency of our proposed indexes with extensive experiments on large real and synthetic datasets .
