deexcelerator : a framework for extracting relational-data from partially structured-documents of the structured-data published on the web , for instance as datasets on open-data platforms such as data.gov , but also in the form of html tables on the general web , only a small part is in a relational form . instead the data is intermingled with formatting , layout and textual-metadata , i.e. , it is contained in partially structured-documents . this makes transformation into a true relational form necessary , which is a precondition for most forms of data-analysis and data-integration . studying data.gov as an example source for partially structured-documents , we present a classification of typical normalization problems . we then present the deexcelerator , which is a framework for extracting relations from partially structured-documents such as spreadsheets and html tables .
