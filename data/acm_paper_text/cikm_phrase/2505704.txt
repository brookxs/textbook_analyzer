incorporating user-preferences into click-models click-models are developed to interpret clicks by making assumptions on how users browse the search result page . most existing click-models implicitly assume that all users are homogeneous and act in the same way when browsing the search-results . however , a number of researches have shown that users have diverse behavioral-patterns , which is also observed in this paper by eye-tracking experiments and click-through log analysis . as a uniform click-model for all users can hardly capture the diverse click-behavior , in this paper we incorporate user-preferences into both a variety of existing click-models and a novel click-model . the experimental-results on a large-scale click-through-data set show consistent and significant performance-improvement of the click-models with user-preferences integrated .
