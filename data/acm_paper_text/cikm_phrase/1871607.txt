evaluation of top-k-queries in peer-to-peer-networks using threshold algorithms in p2p-networks , top-k-query-processing can provide a lot of advantages both in time and bandwidth consumption . several algorithms have been proposed for the evaluation of top-k-queries . a large percentage of them follow the threshold approach . we focus on the main adaptations of threshold algorithms fulfilling the requirements of modern p2p-applications . we introduce two algorithms optimized for ranking-queries in p2p-networks and present their characteristics . in the setting of a simulation of large p2p-networks , we evaluate the algorithms ' performance . our experiments demonstrate that in some cases a threshold algorithm can improve top-k-query-processing , while in others it is far more costly . the results show that distributed-query-processing can be more effective than a simple threshold algorithm in a p2p-network .
