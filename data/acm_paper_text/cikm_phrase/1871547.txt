pattern-discovery for large mixed-mode database in business and industry today , large-databases with mixed data-types (continuous and categorical) are very common . there are great needs to discover patterns from them for knowledge interpretation and understanding . in the past , for classification , this problem is solved as a discrete data problem by first discretizing the continuous-data based on the class-attribute interdependence relationship . however , so far no proper solution exists when class-information is unavailable . hence , important pattern post-processing tasks such as pattern clustering and summarization can not be applied to mixed-mode data . this paper presents a new method for solving the problem . it is based on two essential concepts . (1) though class-information is absent , yet for a correlated dataset , the attribute with the strongest interdependence with others in the group can be used to drive the discretization of the continuous-data . (2) for a large database , correlated attribute groups must first be obtained by attribute-clustering before (1) can be applied . based on (1) and (2) , pattern-discovery methods are developed for mixed-mode data . extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world data were conducted to validate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method .
