exposing the vagueness of query results on partly inaccessible databases query-processing on partly inaccessible databases generally does not yield exact , but vague result sets . a good notion of vague sets fulfills two aims : it keeps the degree of vagueness of the query result as small as possible , and it clarifies the degree of and the reasons for the vagueness to the end-user . the first goal requires a good internal-representation , while the second goal requires a good external-representation of a vague set . in this paper , we present a novel calculus for expressive vague sets that meets both requirements . this is the first approach that is well suited for both internal and external representation of vagueness induced by partial inaccessibility . it consists of a data-representation that is capable of holding all the necessary information . complementary , we have accordingly adapted the usual query-language operations . these adaptations are independent of a concrete query-language , to make them applicable to most existing query-languages . the adapted operations minimize the vagueness of the result , propagate the reasons of uncertainty of the individual vague candidates , and compute an expressive description of the missing elements .
