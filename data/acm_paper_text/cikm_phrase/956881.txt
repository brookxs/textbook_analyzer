the power-method : a comprehensive estimation-technique for multi-dimensional-queries existing estimation approaches for multi-dimensional databases often rely on the assumption that data-distribution in a small region is uniform , which seldom holds in practice . moreover , their applicability is limited to specific estimation tasks under certain distance-metric . this paper develops the power-method , a comprehensive technique applicable to a wide range of query-optimization problems under various metrics . the power-method eliminates the local uniformity assumption and is accurate even in scenarios where existing approaches completely fail . furthermore , it performs estimation by evaluating only one simple formula with minimal computational-overhead . extensive experiments confirm that the power-method outperforms previous techniques in terms of accuracy and applicability to various optimization scenarios .
