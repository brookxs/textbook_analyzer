data-thirsty business analysts need soda : search over data-warehouse querying large-data warehouses is very hard for non-tech savvy business users . deep technical knowledge of both sql as well as the schema of the database is required in order to build correct queries and to come up with new business insights . in this paper we introduce a novel system called soda (search over data-warehouse) that bridges the gap between the business world and the it world by enabling extended keyword-search in a data-warehouse . soda uses metadata information , dbpedia entries as well as base data to generate sql to allow intuitive exploration of the data . the process of query-classification , query-graph generation and sql generation is visualized to provide the analysts with information on how the query results are produced . experiments with real-data of a global financial institution comprising around 300 tables showed promising results .
