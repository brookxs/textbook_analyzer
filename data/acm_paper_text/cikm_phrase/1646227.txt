interpretable and reconfigurable clustering of document datasets by deriving word-based rules clusters of text-documents output by clustering-algorithms are often hard to interpret . we describe motivating real-world scenarios that necessitate reconfigurability and high interpretability of clusters and outline the problem of generating clusterings with interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models . we develop a clustering-algorithm toward the outlined goal of building interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models ; it works by generating rules with disjunctions and conditions on the frequencies of words , to decide on the membership of a document to a cluster . each cluster is comprised of precisely the set of documents that satisfy the corresponding rule . we show that our approach outperforms the unsupervised decision-tree-approach by huge margins . we show that the purity and f-measure losses to achieve interpretability are as little as 5 \ % and 3 \ % respectively using our approach .
