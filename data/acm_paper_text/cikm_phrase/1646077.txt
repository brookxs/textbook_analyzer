efficient information-retrieval in mobile-peer-to-peer-networks mobile-devices have become indispensable in daily-life , and hence how to take advantage of these portable and powerful facilities to share resources and information begins to emerge as an interesting problem . in this paper , we investigate the problem of information-retrieval in a mobile-peer-to-peer network . the prevailing approach to information-retrieval is to apply flooding methods because of its quick response and easy maintenance . obviously , this kind of approach wastes a huge amount of communication bandwidth which greatly affects the availability of the network , and the battery power which significantly shortens the serving time of mobile-devices in the network . to tackle this problem , we propose a novel approach by mimicking different human-behaviors of social-networks , which takes advantages of intelligence accuracy (ia) mechanism that evaluates the distance from a node to certain resources in the network . extensive experimental-results show the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our approach as well as its scalability in a volatile environment .
