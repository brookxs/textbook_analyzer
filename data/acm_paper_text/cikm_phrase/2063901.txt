leveraging wikipedia concept and category-information to enhance contextual-advertising as a prevalent type of web-advertising , contextual-advertising refers to the placement of the most relevant ads into a web-page , so as to increase the number of ad-clicks . however , some problems of homonymy and polysemy , low intersection of keywords etc. , can lead to the selection of irrelevant ads for a page . in this paper , we present a new contextual-advertising approach to overcome the problems , which uses wikipedia concept and category-information to enrich the content-representation of an ad (or a page) . first , we map each ad and page into a keyword vector , a concept-vector and a category vector . next , we select the relevant ads for a given page based on a similarity-metric that combines the above three feature-vectors together . last , we evaluate our approach by using real ads , pages , as well as a great number of concepts and categories of wikipedia . experimental-results show that our approach can improve the precision of ads-selection effectively .
