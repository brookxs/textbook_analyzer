aligning freebase with the yago ontology linked-open-data (lod) has emerged as the de-facto standard for publishing data on the web . the cross-domain large-scale freebase and yago datasets represent central hubs and reference-points for the lod cloud . freebase is an open-world dataset , which contains about 22 million entities and more than 350 million facts in more than 100 domains . the scale of freebase makes it difficult for the users to get an overview of the data and efficiently retrieve the desired information . integration of freebase with the yago ontology that contains more than 360,000 concepts enables us to provide more semantic-information for freebase and to facilitate novel applications , such as efficient query construction , over large-scale-data . in this paper we analyze the structure of yago in more depth and show how to match yago and freebase categories . the new yago+f structure that results from our matching tightly connects both datasets and provides an important next step to systematically interconnect lod subcollections . we make our yago+f structure available online in the hope that it can provide a good starting point for future-applications , which can build upon a wide variety of freebase data clearly arranged in the semantic-categories of yago .
