user assisted text-classification and knowledge-management while there are many aspects to managing corporate knowledge , one key issue is how to organize corporate documents into categories of interest . in this paper , we focus on using user assisted text-classification in conjunction with a web-portal , multiple document management-systems and an ontology , to provide a powerful solution for organizing information about a company 's technology . we propose a system that interacts with an author using an automatic text classifier to suggest controlled keywords to be used as metadata . the proposed approach does not require professional librarians or that the end-users have extensive training . the use of a controlled-vocabulary allows for a more consistent description of corporate documents , and promotes easier access by people across the company . it is easier to find similar documents which use different nomenclature . finally , the interactive nature of the system results in a more correct and precise description of each document than a fully-automatic-system would .
