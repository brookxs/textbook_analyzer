clustering declustered data for efficient retrieval modern databases increasingly integrate new kinds of information , such as multimedia-information in the form of image , video , and audio data . both the dimensionality and the amount of data that need to be processed is increasing rapidly , increasing the demand for the efficient retrieval of large amounts of multi-dimensional-data . declustering techniques for multi-disk architectures have been effectively used for storage . in this paper , we first establish that besides exploiting the parallelism , a careful organization of each disk must be considered for fast searching . we introduce the notion of page-allocation and data-space mapping which can be used to organize and retrieve multidimensional-data . we develop these notions based on three different partitioning-strategies : regular-grid partitioning , concentric hypercubes and hyperpyramids . we develop techniques that satisfy efficient retrieval by optimizing the number of buckets retrieved by the query , disk arm movement and i/o-parallelism . we prove that concentric hypercube-based mapping satisfies the optimal clustering and optimal-parallelism . we develop a technique based on hyperpyramid partitioning that reduces the number of buckets retrieved by the query and has efficient inter - and intra-disk organizations . we evaluate the performance of proposed techniques by comparing them with the current approaches . the new techniques lead to very significant improvement over the existing techniques , and result in fast retrieval of multi-dimensional-data .
