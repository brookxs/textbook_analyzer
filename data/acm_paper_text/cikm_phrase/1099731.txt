efficient evaluation of parameterized pattern queries many applications rely on sequence-databases and use extensively pattern-matching-queries to retrieve data of interest . this paper extends the traditional pattern-matching expressions to parameterized-patterns , featuring variables . parameterized-patterns are more expressive and allow to define concisely regular-expressions that would be very complex to describe without variables . they can also be used to express additional constraints on patterns ' variables.we show that they can be evaluated without additional cost with respect to traditional techniques (e.g. , the knuth-morris-pratt algorithm) . we describe an algorithm that enjoys low memory and cpu-time requirements , and provide experimental-results which illustrate the gain of the optimized solution .
