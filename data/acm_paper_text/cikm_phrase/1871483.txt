stablebuffer : optimizing write-performance for dbms applications on flash-devices flash-devices have been widely used in embedded-systems , laptop computers , and enterprise servers . however , the poor random writes have been an obstacle to running write-intensive dbms applications on flash-devices . in this paper , we exploit the recently discovered , efficient write patterns of flash-devices to optimize the performance of dbms applications . specifically , motivated by a focused write pattern , we propose to write pages temporarily to a small , pre-allocated storage space on the flash device , called stablebuffer , instead of directly writing to their actual destinations . we then recognize and flush efficient write patterns of the buffer to achieve a better write-performance . in contrast to prior log-based techniques , our stablebuffer solution does not require modifying the driver of flash-devices and hence works well for commodity flash-devices . we discuss the detailed-design and implementation of the stablebuffer solution . performance-evaluation based on a tpc-c-benchmark trace shows that stablebuffer improves the response-time and throughput of write operations by a factor of 1.5-12 , in comparison with a direct write-through strategy .
