proximity-based document-representation for named-entity retrieval one aspect in which retrieving named-entities is different from retrieving documents is that the items to be retrieved - persons , locations , organizations - are only indirectly described by documents throughout the collection . much work has been dedicated to finding references to named-entities , in particular to the problems of named-entity-extraction and disambiguation . however , just as important for retrieval-performance is how these snippets of text are combined to build named-entity representations . we focus on the trec expert-search task where the goal is to identify people who are knowledgeable on a specific topic . existing language-modeling techniques for expert-finding assume that terms and person entities are conditionally independent given a document . we present theoretical and experimental-evidence that this simplifying assumption ignores information on how named-entities relate to document-content . to address this issue , we propose a new document-representation which emphasizes text in proximity to entities and thus incorporates sequential-information implicit in text . our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves retrieval-performance . the main contribution of this work is an effective formal-method for explicitly modeling the dependency between the named-entities and terms which appear in a document .
