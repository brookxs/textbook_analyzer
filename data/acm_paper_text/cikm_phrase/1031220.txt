a framework for selective query-expansion query-expansion is a well-known technique that has been shown to improve <i> average </i> retrieval-performance . this technique has not been used in many operational systems because of the fact that it can greatly degrade the performance of some individual queries . we show how comparison between language-models of the unexpanded and expanded retrieval results can be used to predict when the expanded retrieval has strayed from the original sense of the query . in these cases , the unexpanded results are used while the expanded results are used in the remaining cases (where such straying is not detected) . we evaluate this method on a wide variety of trec collections .
