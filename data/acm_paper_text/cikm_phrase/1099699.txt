kalchas : a dynamic-xml search-engine this paper outlines the system-architecture and the core data structures of kalchas , a fulltext-search engine for xml-data with emphasis on dynamic-indexing , and identifies features worth demonstrating . the concept of dynamic index implies that the aim is to re ect the creation of , deletion of , and updates to relevant files in the search-index as early as possible . this is achieved by a number of techniques , including ideas drawn from partitioned b-trees and inverted-indices . the actual ranked-retrieval of document is implemented with xml-specific query-operators for lowest-common-ancestor queries.a live demonstration will discuss kalchas ' behaviour in typical use-cases , such as interactive-editing sessions and bulk-loading large amounts of static files as well as querying the contents of the indexed files ; it tries to clarify both the short-comings and the advantages of the method .
