a consensus_based approach to constrained-clustering of software-requirements managing large-scale-software projects involves a number of activities such as viewpoint extraction , feature-detection , and requirements-management , all of which require a human analyst to perform the arduous task of organizing requirements into meaningful topics and themes . automating these tasks through the use of data-mining-techniques such as clustering could potentially increase both the efficiency of performing the tasks and the reliability of the results . unfortunately , the unique characteristics of this domain , such as high-dimensional , sparse , noisy-data sets , resulting from short and ambiguous expressions of need , as well as the need for the interactive engagement of stakeholders at various stages of the process , present difficult challenges for standard clustering-algorithms . in this paper , we propose a semi-supervised-clustering framework , based on a combination of consensus-based and constrained-clustering techniques , which can effectively handle these challenges . specifically , we provide a probabilistic-analysis for informative constraint-generation based on a co-association matrix , and utilize consensus-clustering to combine multiple constrained partitions in order to generate high-quality , robust clusters . our approach is validated through a series of experiments on six well-studied trec-data sets and on two sets of user-requirements .
