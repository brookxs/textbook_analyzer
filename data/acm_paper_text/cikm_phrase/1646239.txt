to obtain orthogonal feature-extraction using training-data selection feature-extraction is an effective tool in data-mining and machine-learning . many feature-extraction methods have been investigated recently . however , few methods can achieve orthogonal-components . non-orthogonal components distort the metric structure of original data-space and contain reductant information . in this paper , we propose a feature-extraction method , named as incremental orthogonal basis analysis (ioba) , to cope with the challenging endeavors . first , ioba learns orthogonal-components for original data , not only theoretically but also numerically . second , an innovative way of training-data selection is proposed . this selection-scheme helps ioba pick up numerically orthogonal-components from training patterns . third , by designing a self-adaptive threshold technique , no prior-knowledge about the number of components is necessary to use ioba . moreover , without solving eigenvalue and eigenvector problems , ioba not only saves large computing loads , but also avoids ill-conditioned problems . results of experiments show the efficiency of the proposed ioba .
