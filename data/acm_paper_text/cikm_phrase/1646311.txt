yam : a schema matcher-factory in this paper , we present yam , a schema matcher-factory . yam (yet another matcher) is not (yet) another schema-matching system as it enables the generation of a la carte schema matchers according to user-requirements . these requirements include a preference for recall or precision , a training-data-set (schemas already matched) and provided expert correspondences . yam uses a knowledge-base that includes a (possibly large) set of similarity-measures and classifiers . based on the user-requirements , yam learns how to best apply these tools (similarity-measures and classifiers) in concert to achieve the best matching quality . in our demonstration , we will let users apply yam to build the best schema matcher for different user-requirements .
