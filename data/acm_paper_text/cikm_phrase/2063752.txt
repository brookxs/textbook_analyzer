classification and annotation in social corpora using multiple relations we consider the problem of learning to annotate documents with concepts or keywords in content information-networks , where the documents may share multiple relations . the concepts associated to a document will depend both on its content and on its neighbors in the network through the different relations . we formalize this problem as single and multi-label-classification in a multi-graph , the nodes being the documents and the edges representing the different relations . the proposed algorithm learns to weight the different relations according to their importance for the annotation-task . we perform experiments on different corpora corresponding to different annotation tasks on scientific articles , emails and flickr images and show how the model may take advantage of the rich relational information .
