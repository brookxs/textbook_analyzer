xkvalidator : a constraint validator for xml the role of xml in data-exchange is evolving from one of merely conveying the structure of data to one that also conveys its semantics . in particular , several proposals for key and foreign key constraints have recently appeared , and aspects of these proposals have been adopted within xmlschema.in this paper , we examine the problem of checking keys and foreign-keys in xml-documents using a validator based on sax . the algorithm relies on an indexing-technique based on the paths found in key definitions , and can be used for checking the correctness of an entire document (bulk checking) as well as for checking updates as they are made to the document (incremental checking) . the asymptotic performance of the algorithm is linear in the size of the document or update . furthermore , experimental-results demonstrate reasonable performance .
