using rankboost to compare retrieval-systems this paper presents a new pooling method for constructing the assessment sets used in the evaluation of retrieval-systems . our proposal is based on rankboost , a machine-learning voting algorithm . it leads to smaller pools than classical pooling and thus reduces the manual assessment workload for building test-collections . experimental-results obtained on an xml-document collection demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach according to different evaluation-criteria .
