casjoin : a cascade chain for text-similarity joins we are concerned with the problem of similarity-joins of text-data , where the task is to find all pairs of documents above an expected similarity . such a problem often serves as an indispensable step in many web-applications . a crucial issue is to preclude unnecessary candidate pairs as many as possible ahead of expensive similarity-evaluation . in this paper , we initiate an idea of adopting a cascade structure in text joins for a large speedup , where a latter stage can exclude a considerable number of invalid pairs survived in former stages . the proposed algorithm is shortly referred to as casjoin . we further adopt a prefix filter to build the stage of casjoin by introducing a novel vision to the dynamic-generation of document-vector . specifically , a vector is partitioned into a chain of multiple prefixes that are appended one by one for cascade joining . we evaluate our casjoin on a typical web-corpus , odp . experiments indicate that , comparing to the state-of-the-art prefix algorithms , casjoin can achieve a drastic reduction of candidates by as much as 98.15 \ % and a dramatic speedup of joining by up to 13.34 x.
