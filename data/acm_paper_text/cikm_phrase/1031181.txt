simple bm25 extension to multiple weighted fields this paper describes a simple way of adapting the bm25 ranking formula to deal with structured-documents . in the past it has been common to compute scores for the individual fields (e.g. title and body) independently and then combine these scores (typically linearly) to arrive at a final score for the document . we highlight how this approach can lead to poor performance by breaking the carefully constructed non-linear saturation of term-frequency in the bm25 function . we propose a much more intuitive alternative which weights term frequencies <i> before </i> the non-linear term-frequency saturation function is applied . in this scheme , a structured-document with a title weight of two is mapped to an unstructured document with the title content repeated twice . this more verbose unstructured document is then ranked in the usual way . we demonstrate the advantages of this method with experiments on reuters vol1 and the trec dotgov collection .
