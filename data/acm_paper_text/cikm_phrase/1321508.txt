rk-hist : an r-tree_based histogram for multi-dimensional-selectivity-estimation database-query engines typically rely upon query size estimators in order to evaluate the potential cost of alternate query plans . in multi-dimensional-database systems , such as those typically found in large-data warehousing environments , these selectivity estimators often take the form of multi-dimensional histograms . but while single dimensional histograms have proven to be quite accurate , even in the presence of data-skew , the multi-dimensional variations have generally been far less reliable . in this paper , we present a new histogram model that is based upon an r-tree space-partitioning . the localization of the r-tree boxes is in turn controlled by a hilbert-space-filling-curve , while a series of efficient area equalization heuristics restructures the initial boxes to provide improved bucket representation . experimental-results demonstrate significantly improved estimation-accuracy relative to state-of-the-art alternatives , as well as superior consistency across a variety of record distributions .
