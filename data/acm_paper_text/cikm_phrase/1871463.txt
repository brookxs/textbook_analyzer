a cross-lingual framework for monolingual biomedical-information-retrieval an important challenge for biomedical-information-retrieval (ir) is dealing with the complex , inconsistent and ambiguous biomedical terminology . frequently , a concept-based representation defined in terms of a domain-specific terminological resource is employed to deal with this challenge . in this paper , we approach the incorporation of a concept-based representation in monolingual biomedical-ir from a cross-lingual perspective . in the proposed framework , this is realized by translating and matching between text and concept-based representations . the approach allows for deployment of a rich set of techniques proposed and evaluated in traditional cross-lingual-ir . we compare six translation-models and measure their effectiveness in the biomedical-domain . we demonstrate that the approach can result in significant improvements in retrieval-effectiveness over word-based-retrieval . moreover , we demonstrate increased effectiveness of a clir-framework for monolingual biomedical-ir if basic translations models are combined .
