translating relevance-scores to probabilities for contextual-advertising information-retrieval-systems conventionally assess document-relevance using the bag-of-words-model . consequently , relevance-scores of documents retrieved for different queries are often difficult to compare , as they are computed on different (or even disjoint) sets of textual-features . many tasks , such as federation of search-results or global thresholding of relevance-scores , require that scores be globally comparable . to achieve this , in this paper we propose methods for non-monotonic transformation of relevance-scores into probabilities for a contextual-advertising selection engine that uses a vector-space-model . the calibration of the raw scores is based on historical click-data .
