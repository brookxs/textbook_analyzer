finding information-nebula over large-networks social and information-networks have been extensively studied over years . in this paper , we concentrate ourselves on a large information network that is composed of entities and relationships , where entities are associated with sets of keyword terms (kterms) to specify what they are , and relationships describe the link-structure among entities which can be very complex . our work is motivated but is different from the existing works that find a best subgraph to describe how user-specified entities are connected . we compute information-nebula (cloud) which is a set of top-k kterms p that are most correlated to a set of user-specified kterms q , over a large information network . our goal is to find how kterms are correlated given the complex-information network among entities . the information-nebula computing requests us to take all possible kterms into consideration for the top-k kterms selection , and needs to measure the similarity between kterms by considering all possible subgraphs that connect them instead of the best single one . in this work , we compute information-nebula using a global structural-context similarity , and our similarity-measure is independent of connection subgraphs . to the best of our knowledge , among the link-based-similarity methods , none of the existing work considers similarity between two sets of nodes or two kterms . we propose new algorithms to find top-k kterms p for a given set of kterms q based on the global structural-context similarity , without computing all the similarity-scores of kterms in the large information network . we performed extensive performance-studies using large real datasets , and confirmed the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach .
