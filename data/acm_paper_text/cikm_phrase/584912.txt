index-compression vs. retrieval-time of inverted-files for xml-documents query-languages for retrieval of xml-documents allow for conditions referring both to the content and the structure-of-documents . in this paper , we investigate two different approaches for reducing index-space of inverted-files for xml-documents . first , we consider methods for compressing index entries . second , we develop the new xs tree-data structure which contains the structural-description of a document in a rather compact form , such that these descriptions can be kept in main-memory . experimental-results on two large xml-document collections show that very high compression rates for indexes can be achieved , but any compression increases retrieval-time . on the other hand , highly compressed indexes may be feasible for applications where storage is limited , such as in pdas or e-book devices .
