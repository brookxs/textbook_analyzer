interactive pattern mining on hidden-data : a sampling-based solution mining frequent patterns from a hidden dataset is an important task with 43 various real-life applications . in this research , we propose a solution to this problem that is based on markov-chain-monte-carlo (mcmc) sampling of frequent-patterns . instead of returning all the frequent-patterns , the proposed paradigm returns a small set of randomly selected patterns so that the clandestinity of the dataset can be maintained . our solution also allows interactive sampling , so that the sampled patterns can fulfill the user 's requirement effectively . we show experimental-results from several real life datasets to validate the capability and usefulness of our solution ; in particular , we show examples that by using our proposed solution , an ecommerce marketplace can allow pattern-mining on user-session data without disclosing the data to the public ; such a mining paradigm helps the sellers of the marketplace , which eventually boost the marketplace 's own revenue .
