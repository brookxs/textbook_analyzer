trada : tree_based ranking-function adaptation machine learned ranking approaches have shown successes in web-search-engines . with the increasing demands on developing effective ranking-functions for different search domains , we have seen a big bottleneck , i.e. , the problem of insufficient training-data , which has significantly limited the fast development and deployment of machine learned ranking-functions for different web-search domains . in this paper , we propose a new approach called tree_based ranking-function adaptation (`` tree adaptation '') to address this problem . tree adaptation assumes that ranking-functions are trained with regression-tree_based modeling methods , such as gradient-boosting trees . it takes such a ranking-function from one domain and tunes its tree-based structure with a small amount of training-data from the target-domain . the unique features include (1) it can automatically identify the part of model that needs adjustment for the new domain , (2) it can appropriately weight training-examples considering both local and global distributions . experiments are performed to show that tree adaptation can provide better-quality ranking-functions for a new domain , compared to other modeling methods .
