ipog : fast interactive proximity querying on graphs given an author-conference graph , how do we answer proximity-queries (e.g. , what are the most related conferences for john smith ?) ; how can we tailor the search result if the user provides additional yes/no type of feedback (e.g. , what are the most related conferences for john smith given that he does not like icml ?) ? given the potential computational-complexity , we mainly devote ourselves to addressing the computational issues in this paper by proposing an efficient-solution (referred to as ipog-b) for bipartite-graphs . our experimental-results show that the proposed fast solution (ipogb) achieves significant speedup , while leading to the same ranking result .
