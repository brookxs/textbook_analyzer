query-taxonomy generation for web-search we propose an approach that organizes the search-result clusters into a hierarchical-structure , called a query-taxonomy , from the user 's perspective . the proposed approach is based on an unsupervised-classification method , which uses the dynamic-web as the training-corpus . with query-taxonomy , users can browse relevant-web documents more conveniently and comprehensibly . our experimental-results verify the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach to query-taxonomy generation in web-search .
