content-based-retrieval of mp3 music objects in recent years , the searching and indexing-techniques for multimedia-data are getting more attention in the area of multimedia-databases . as many research works were done on the content-based-retrieval of image and video data , less attention was received to the content-based-retrieval of audio data . in this paper , we propose an approach to retrieve mp3 music objects based on their content . in our approach , the coefficients extracting from the output of the polyphase filters are used to compute the mp3 features for indexing the mp3 objects . we also propose an mp3 similarity measuring function to provide users the ability to approximately retrieve the desired mp3 objects . experiments are performed and analyzed to show the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed method .
