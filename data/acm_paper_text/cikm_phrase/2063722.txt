mining direct antagonistic communities in explicit trust-networks there has been a recent increase of interest in analyzing trust and friendship networks to gain insights about relationship dynamics among users . many sites such as epinions , facebook , and other social-networking-sites allow users to declare trusts or friendships between different members of the community . in this work , we are interested in extracting direct antagonistic communities (dacs) within a rich trust-network involving trusts and distrusts . each dac is formed by two subcommunities with trust-relationships among members of each sub-community but distrust relationships across the sub-communities . we develop an efficient-algorithm that could analyze large trust-networks leveraging the unique property of direct-antagonistic-community . we have experimented with synthetic and real data-sets (mygamma and epinions) to demonstrate the scalability of our proposed solution .
