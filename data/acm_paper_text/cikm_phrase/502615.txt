structural proximity searching for large-collections of semi-structured-data the richness of the xml-data format allows data to be structured in a way which precisely captures the semantics required by the author . it is the structure of the data , however , which forms the basis of all xml-query-languages . without at least some notion of the structure , a user can not meaningfully query the data . this problem is compounded when one considers that heterogeneous-data adhering to different schema are likely to exist in the database (s) being queried . this paper proposes a solution based on an efficient proximity-index . in particular , we describe a family of encoding and-compression schemes which enable us to build an index to efficiently implement the proximity-search . our index is extremely small , and can reflect updates in the underlying database in modest time . experiments show that our algorithm and implementation are fast and scale well .
