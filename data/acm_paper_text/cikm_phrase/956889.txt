a novel method for stemmer generation based on hidden-markov-models in this paper , we present a method based on hidden-markov-models (hmms) to generate statistical stemmers . using a list of words as training-set , the method estimates the hmm parameters which are used to calculate the most probable stem for an arbitrary word . stemming is performed by computing the most-probable-path , through the hmm states , corresponding to the input word . linguistic-knowledge or a training-set of manually stemmed words are not required . we describe the method and the results of the experiments carried out using standard test-collections for five different languages .
