who will follow you back ? : reciprocal-relationship prediction we study the extent to which the formation of a two-way relationship can be predicted in a dynamic-social-network . a two-way (called reciprocal) relationship , usually developed from a one-way (parasocial) relationship , represents a more trustful relationship between people . understanding the formation of two-way relationships can provide us insights into the micro-level dynamics of the social-network , such as what is the underlying community-structure and how users influence each other . employing twitter as a source for our experimental-data , we propose a learning-framework to formulate the problem of reciprocal-relationship prediction into a graphical-model . the framework incorporates social-theories into a machine-learning-model . we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 90 \ % of reciprocal relationships in a dynamic-network . our study provides strong evidence of the existence of the structural-balance among reciprocal relationships . in addition , we have some interesting findings , e.g. , the likelihood of two `` elite '' users creating a reciprocal relationships is nearly 8 times higher than the likelihood of two ordinary-users . more importantly , our findings have potential implications such as how social-structures can be inferred from individuals ' behaviors .
