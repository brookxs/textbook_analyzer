supervised language-modeling for temporal-resolution of texts we investigate temporal-resolution of documents , such as determining the date of publication of a story based on its text . we describe and evaluate a model that build histograms encoding the probability of different temporal periods for a document . we construct histograms based on the kullback-leibler-divergence between the language-model for a test document and supervised language-models for each interval . initial results indicate this language-modeling-approach is effective for predicting the dates of publication of short stories , which contain few explicit mentions of years .
