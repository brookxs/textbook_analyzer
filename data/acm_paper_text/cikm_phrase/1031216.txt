restructuring batch view-maintenance efficiently materialized-views defined over distributed-data-sources are a well recognized technology for modern applications . state-of the-art incremental-view-maintenance requires o (<i> n </i> <sup> 2 </sup>) or more maintenance queries to remote-data sources with <i> n </i> being the number of data sources in the view-definition . in this poster , we illustrate basic ideas of novel view-maintenance strategies that dramatically reduce the number of maintenance queries . such reduction brings the tradeoff between the number of maintenance queries and the complexity of each query . these algorithms have been implemented in a working prototype-system . experimental-studies illustrate major performance-improvement in terms of total processing-time compared with existing batch algorithms .
