an efficient-algorithm for approximate biased quantile computation in data-streams we propose an efficient-algorithm for approximate biased quantile computation in large-data streams . our algorithm computes decomposable biased quantile summaries on fixed sized blocks and dynamically maintains the biased quantile summary for the entire stream as the exponential histogram over the block-wise quantile summaries . the algorithm is computationally efficient and achieves an amortized computational cost of o (log (1 ? ? log (? n))) and a space requirement of o (log3 ? n ? ?) . our algorithm does not assume prior-knowledge of the stream sizes or the range of data-values in the streams . in practice , our algorithm is able to efficiently maintain summaries over large-data streams with over tens of millions of observations and achieves significant performance-improvement over prior algorithms .
