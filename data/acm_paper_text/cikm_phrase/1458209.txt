redus : finding reducible subspaces in high-dimensional-data finding latent patterns in high-dimensional-data is an important research problem with numerous applications . the most well known approaches for high-dimensional-data analysis are feature-selection and dimensionality-reduction . being widely used in many applications , these methods aim to capture global patterns and are typically performed in the full feature-space . in many emerging applications , however , scientists are interested in the local latent patterns held by feature subspaces , which may be invisible via any global transformation . in this paper , we investigate the problem of finding strong linear and nonlinear correlations hidden in feature subspaces of high-dimensional-data . we formalize this problem as identifying reducible subspaces in the full dimensional space . intuitively , a reducible-subspace is a feature-subspace whose intrinsic dimensionality is smaller than the number of features . we present an effective algorithm , redus , for finding the reducible subspaces . two key components of our algorithm are finding the overall reducible-subspace , and uncovering the individual reducible subspaces from the overall reducible-subspace . a broad experimental-evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm .
