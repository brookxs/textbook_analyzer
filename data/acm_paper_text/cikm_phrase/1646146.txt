effective anonymization of query-logs user-search query-logs have proven to be very useful , but have vast potential for misuse . several incidents have shown that simple removal of identifiers is insufficient to protect the identity of users . publishing such inadequately anonymized data can cause severe breach of privacy . while significant effort has been expended on coming up with anonymity models and techniques for microdata , there is little corresponding work for query-log-data . query-logs are different in several important aspects , such as the diversity of queries and the causes of privacy-breach . this necessitates the need to design privacy models and techniques specific to this environment . this paper takes a first cut at tackling this challenge . our main contribution is to define effective anonymization models for query-log-data along with proposing techniques to achieve such anonymization . we analyze the inherent utility and privacy tradeoff , and experimentally validate the performance of our techniques .
