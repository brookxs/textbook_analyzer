threshold behavior of incentives in social-networks the advent of large-scale online-social-networks has resulted in a spurt of studies on the user-participation in the networks . we consider a query incentive model on social-networks , where user 's queries are answered through her friendship network and there are ` rewards ' or ` incentives ' in the system to answer the queries utilizing ones community . we model the friendship network as a random-graph with power-law degree-distribution , and show that the reward-function exhibits a theoretic threshold behavior on the scaling-exponent ? , a network parameter . specifically , there exists a threshold on ? above which the reward is exponential in the average-path-length in the network and below the threshold , the reward is proportional to the average-path-length . we demonstrate this finding on simulated power-law-networks and real-world data gathered from online-social-media such as flickr , digg , youtube and yahoo!-answers .
