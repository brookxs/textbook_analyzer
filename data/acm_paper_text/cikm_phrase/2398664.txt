predicting the performance of passage-retrieval for question-answering we present a novel approach to predicting the performance of passage-retrieval for question-answering . that is , estimating the effectiveness , for answer-extraction , of a list of passages retrieved in response to a question when relevance-judgments are not available . our prediction-model integrates two types of estimates . the first estimates the probability that the information-need expressed by the question is satisfied by the passages . this estimate is devised by adapting query-performance predictors developed for the document retrieval-task . the second type estimates the probability that the passages contain the answers . this estimate relies on the occurrences of named-entities that are likely to answer the question . empirical-evaluation demonstrates the merits of our prediction approach . for example , the prediction-quality is much better than that of the only previous prediction method devised for the task at hand .
