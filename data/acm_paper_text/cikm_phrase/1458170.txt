a new method for indexing genomes using on-disk suffix-trees we propose a new method to build persistent suffix-trees for indexing the genomic-data . our algorithm digest (disk-based genomic suffix-tree) improves significantly over previous work in reducing the random-access to the input-string and performing only two passes over disk data . digest is based on the two-phase multi-way merge-sort paradigm using a concise binary representation of the dna alphabet . furthermore , our method scales to larger genomic-data than managed before .
