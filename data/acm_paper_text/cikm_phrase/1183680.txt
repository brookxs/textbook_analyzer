trips and tides : new algorithms for tree-mining recent research in data-mining has progressed from mining-frequent-itemsets to more general and structured patterns like trees and graphs . in this paper , we address the problem of frequent-subtree-mining that has proven to be viable in a wide range of applications such as bioinformatics , xml-processing , computational-linguistics , and web-usage-mining . we propose novel algorithms to mine frequent subtrees from a database of rooted trees . we evaluate the use of two popular sequential encodings of trees to systematically generate and evaluate the candidate patterns . the proposed approach is very generic and can be used to mine embedded or induced subtrees that can be labeled , unlabeled , ordered , unordered , or edge-labeled . our algorithms are highly cache-conscious in nature because of the compact and simple array-based data-structures we use . typically , l1 and l2 hit rates above 99 \ % are observed . experimental-evaluation showed that our algorithms can achieve up to several orders of magnitude speedup on real datasets when compared to state-of-the-art tree-mining algorithms .
