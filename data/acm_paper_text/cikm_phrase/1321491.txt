extending query-translation to cross-language query-expansion with markov-chain-models dictionary-based approaches to query-translation have been widely used in cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) experiments . however , translation has been not only limited by the coverage of the dictionary , but also affected by translation ambiguities . in this paper we propose a novel method of query-translation that combines other types of term-relation to complement the dictionary-based translation . this allows extending the literal query-translation to related words , which produce a beneficial effect of query-expansion in clir . in this paper , we model query-translation by markov-chains (mc) , where query-translation is viewed as a process of expanding query terms to their semantically similar terms in a different language . in mc , terms and their relationships are modeled as a directed-graph , and query-translation is performed as a random-walk in the graph , which propagates probabilities to related terms . this framework allows us to incorporating different types of term-relation , either between two languages or within the source or target-languages . in addition , the iterative-training process of mc allows us to attribute higher probabilities to the target terms more related to the original query , thus offers a solution to the translation-ambiguity problem . we evaluated our method on three clir benchmark collections , and obtained significant improvements over traditional dictionary-based approaches .
