shrink : a structural-clustering algorithm for detecting hierarchical communities in networks community-detection is an important task for mining the structure-and-function of complex-networks . generally , there are several different kinds of nodes in a network which are cluster nodes densely connected within communities , as well as some special nodes like hubs bridging multiple communities and outliers marginally connected with a-community . in addition , it has been shown that there is a hierarchical-structure in complex-networks with communities embedded within other communities . therefore , a good algorithm is desirable to be able to not only detect hierarchical communities , but also identify hubs-and-outliers . in this paper , we propose a parameter-free hierarchical-network clustering-algorithm shrink by combining the advantages of density-based-clustering and modularity optimization-methods . based on the structural connectivity information , the proposed algorithm can effectively reveal the embedded hierarchical community structure with multiresolution in large-scale weighted undirected networks , and identify hubs-and-outliers as well . moreover , it overcomes the sensitive threshold problem of density-based-clustering algorithms and the resolution limit possessed by other modularity-based methods . to illustrate our methodology , we conduct experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets for community-detection , and compare with many other baseline methods . experimental-results demonstrate that shrink achieves the best performance with consistent improvements .
