on the reliability and intuitiveness of aggregated-search metrics aggregating search-results from a variety of diverse verticals such as news , images , videos and wikipedia into a single interface is a popular web-search presentation paradigm . although several aggregated-search (as) metrics have been proposed to evaluate as result pages , their properties remain poorly understood . in this paper , we compare the properties of existing as metrics under the assumptions that (1) queries may have multiple preferred verticals ; (2) the likelihood of each vertical preference is available ; and (3) the topical-relevance assessments of results returned from each vertical is available . we compare a wide range of as metrics on two test-collections . our main criteria of comparison are (1) discriminative power , which represents the reliability of a metric in comparing the performance of systems , and (2) intuitiveness , which represents how well a metric captures the various key aspects to be measured (i.e. various aspects of a user 's perception of as result pages) . our study shows that the as metrics that capture key as components (e.g. , vertical-selection) have several advantages over other metrics . this work sheds new lights on the further developments and applications of as metrics .
