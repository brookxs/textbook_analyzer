i know what you did last summer : query-logs and user-privacy we investigate the subtle cues to user identity that may be exploited in attacks on the privacy of users in web-search query-logs . we study the application of simple classifiers to map a sequence of queries into the gender , age , and location of the user issuing the queries . we then show how these classifiers may be carefully combined at multiple granularities to map a sequence of queries into a set of candidate users that is 300-600 times smaller than random chance would allow . we show that this approach remains accurate even after removing personally-identifiable-information such as names/numbers or limiting the size of the query-log . we also present a new attack in which a real-world acquaintance of a user attempts to identify that user in a large query-log , using personal-information . we show that combinations of small pieces of information about terms a user would probably search for can be highly effective in identifying the sessions of that user . we conclude that known schemes to release even heavily scrubbed query-logs that contain session information have significant privacy risks .
