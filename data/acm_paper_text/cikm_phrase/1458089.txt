a language for manipulating clustered web-documents results we propose a novel conception language for exploring the results retrieved by several internet-search services (like search-engines) that cluster retrieved documents . the goal is to offer users a tool to discover relevant hidden relationships between clustered documents . the proposal is motivated by the observation that visualization paradigms , based on either the ranked list or clustered results , do not allow users to fully exploit the combined use of several search-services to answer a request . when the same query is submitted to distinct search-services , they may produce partially overlapped clustered results , where clusters identified by distinct labels collect some common documents . moreover , clusters with similar labels , but containing distinct documents , may be produced as well . in such a situation , it may be useful to compare , combine and rank the cluster contents , to filter out relevant documents . in the proposed language , we define several operators (inspired by relational-algebra) that work on groups of clusters . new clusters (and groups) can be generated by combining (i.e. , overlapping , refining and intersecting) clusters (and groups) , in a set oriented fashion . furthermore , several ranking-functions are also proposed , to model distinct semantics of the combination .
