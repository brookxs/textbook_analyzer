adaptive information filtering : detecting changes in text-streams the task of information-filtering is to classify documents from a stream as either relevant or non-relevant according to a particular user-interest with the objective to reduce information load . when using an information-filter in an environment that is changing with time , methods for adapting the filter should be considered in order to retain classification-accuracy . we favor a methodology that attempts to detect changes and adapts the information-filter only if inevitable in order to minimize the amount of user-feedback for providing new training-data . yet , detecting changes may require costly user-feedback as well . this paper describes two methods for detecting changes without user-feedback . the first method is based on evaluating an expected error-rate , while the second one observes the fraction of classification decisions made with a confidence below a given threshold . further , a heuristics for automatically determining this threshold is suggested and the performance of this approach is experimentally explored as a function of the threshold parameter . some empirical-results show that both methods work well in a simulated change scenario with real-world data .
