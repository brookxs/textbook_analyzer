reorganizing web-sites based on user-access-patterns in this paper , an approach for reorganizing web-sites based on user-access-patterns is proposed . the approach consists of three steps : preprocessing , page-classification , and site-reorganization . in preprocessing , pages on a web-site are processed to create an internal-representation of the site , and page access information of its users is extracted from its server-log . in page-classification , the-web pages on the site are classified into two categories , index pages and content-pages , based on the page access information . after the pages are classified , in site-reorganization , the-web site is examined to find better ways to organize and arrange the pages on the site . our experiments on a large real-data set show that the approach is efficient and practical for adaptive-web-sites .
