generalized-inverse document-frequency inverse-document-frequency (idf) is one of the most useful and widely used concepts in information-retrieval . there have been various attempts to provide theoretical justifications for idf . one of the most appealing derivations follows from the robertson-sparck jones relevance weight . however , this derivation , and others related to it , typically make a number of strong assumptions that are often glossed over . in this paper , we re-examine these assumptions from a bayesian perspective , discuss possible alternatives , and derive a new , more generalized form of idf that we call generalized-inverse document-frequency . in addition to providing theoretical insights into idf , we also undertake a rigorous empirical-evaluation that shows generalized idf outperforms classical versions of idf on a number of ad-hoc-retrieval tasks .
