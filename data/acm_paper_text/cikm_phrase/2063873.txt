when close enough is good enough : approximate positional indexes for efficient ranked-retrieval previous research has shown that features based on term-proximity are important for effective retrieval . however , they incur substantial costs in terms of larger inverted-indexes and slower query-execution times as compared to term-based features . this paper explores whether term-proximity features based on approximate term positions are as effective as those based on exact term positions . we introduce the novel notion of approximate positional indexes based on dividing documents into coarse-grained buckets and recording term positions with respect to those buckets . we propose different approaches to defining the buckets and compactly-encoding bucket ids . in the context of linear ranking functions , experimental-results show that features based on approximate term positions are able to achieve effectiveness comparable to exact term positions , but with smaller indexes and faster query-evaluation .
