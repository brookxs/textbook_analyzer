interactive collaborative filtering in this paper , we study collaborative-filtering (cf) in an interactive setting , in which a recommender-system continuously recommends items to individual users and receives interactive-feedback . whilst users enjoy sequential recommendations , the recommendation predictions are constantly refined using up-to-date feedback on the recommended items . bringing the interactive mechanism back to the cf process is fundamental because the ultimate goal for a recommender-system is about the discovery of interesting items for individual users and yet users ' personal-preferences and contexts evolve over time during the interactions with the system . this requires us not to distinguish between the stages of collecting information to construct the user-profile and making recommendations , but to seamlessly integrate these stages together during the interactive-process , with the goal of maximizing the overall recommendation-accuracy throughout the interactions . this mechanism naturally addresses the cold-start-problem as any user can immediately receive sequential recommendations without providing ratings beforehand . we formulate the interactive cf with the probabilistic-matrix-factorization (pmf) framework , and leverage several exploitation-exploration algorithms to select items , including the empirical thompson sampling and upper confidence bound based algorithms . we conduct our experiment on cold-start users as well as warm-start users with drifting taste . results show that the proposed methods have significant improvements over several strong baselines for the movielens , eachmovie and netflix datasets .
