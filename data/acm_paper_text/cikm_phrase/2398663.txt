bridging offline and online social graph dynamics the online and offline worlds are converging . location-based-services , ubiquitous mobile devices and on-the-go social-network accessibility are blurring the distinction between in-person activities and their virtual counterpart . an important effect of this convergence is the rapid and powerful impact of offline events (meetings , conferences) on the evolution and temporal-dynamics of the online connectivity between members of social and professional-networks . however , these effects have been largely unexplored . we study these effects by using data from linkedin , a popular professional social-networking-site . we find that offline events may induce connectivity changes in the online network -- there is a dramatic increase in the number of connections between event attendees shortly after the date of the event . building on these insights , we describe a non-supervised method that exploits connectivity changes temporally correlated to real-world events to successfully infer more than 40 % of specific event attendees . finally , we revisit the link-prediction problem by including user contributed information about off-line events to achieve higher link-prediction performance .
