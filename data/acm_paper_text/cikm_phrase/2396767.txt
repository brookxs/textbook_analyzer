logucb : an explore-exploit algorithm for comments recommendation the highly dynamic nature of online commenting environments makes accurate ratings prediction for new comments challenging . in such a setting , in addition to exploiting comments with high predicted ratings , it is also critical to explore comments with high uncertainty in the predictions . in this paper , we propose a novel upper confidence bound (ucb) algorithm called logucb that balances exploration with exploitation when the average rating of a comment is modeled using logistic-regression on its features . at the core of our logucb algorithm lies a novel variance approximation technique for the bayesian-logistic-regression model that is used to compute the ucb value for each comment . in experiments with a real-life comments dataset from yahoo! news , we show that logucb with bag-of-words and topic features outperforms state-of-the-art explore-exploit algorithms .
