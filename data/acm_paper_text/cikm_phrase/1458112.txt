can all tags be used for search ? collaborative-tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizing web-resources , leading to a huge amount of user-generated metadata . these tags represent quite a few different aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search . this paper is the first to present an in-depth study of tagging behavior for very different kinds of resources and systems - web-pages (del.icio.us) , music (last.fm) , and images (flickr) - and compares the results with anchor-text characteristics . we analyze and classify sample tags from these systems , to get an insight into what kinds of tags are used for different resources , and provide statistics on tag distributions in all three tagging environments . since even relevant tags may not add new information to the search-procedure , we also check overlap of tags with content , with metadata assigned by experts and from other sources . we discuss the potential of different kinds of tags for improving search , comparing them with user queries posted to search-engines as well as through a user-survey . the results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging-systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags .
