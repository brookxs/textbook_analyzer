evaluating geo-social influence in location-based-social-networks the emerging location-based-social-network (lbsn) services not only allow people to maintain cyber links with their friends , but also enable them to share the events happening on them at different locations . the geo-social correlations among event participants make it possible to quantify mutual user influence for various events . such a quantification of influence could benefit a wide-spectrum of real-life applications such as targeted-advertising and viral-marketing . in this paper , we perform an in-depth analysis of the geo-social correlations among lbsn users at event level , based on which we address two problems : user influence evaluation and influential events discovery . to capture the geo-social closeness between lbsn users , we propose a unified influence metric . this metric combines a novel social proximity-measure named penalized hitting-time , with a geographical weight function modeled by power-law-distribution . we propose two approximate-algorithms , namely global iteration (gi) and dynamic neighborhood expansion (dne) , to efficiently evaluate user influence with tight theoretical error-bounds . we then adopt the sampling technique and the threshold algorithm to support efficient retrieval of top-k influential events . extensive experiments on both real-life and synthetic lbsn data-sets confirm that the proposed algorithms are effective , efficient , and scalable .
