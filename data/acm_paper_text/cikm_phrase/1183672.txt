bayesian adaptive user profiling with explicit & implicit-feedback research in information-retrieval is now moving into a personalized scenario where a retrieval or filtering system maintains a separate user-profile for each user . in this framework , information delivered to the user can be automatically personalized and catered to individual user 's information-needs . however , a practical concern for such a personalized system is the `` cold-start-problem '' : any user new to the system must endure poor initial performance until sufficient feedback from that user is provided.to solve this problem , we use both explicit and implicit-feedback to build a user 's profile and use bayesian hierarchical methods to borrow information from existing users . we analyze the usefulness of implicit-feedback and the adaptive performance of the model on two data-sets gathered from user-studies where users ' interaction with a document , or implicit-feedback , were recorded along with explicit-feedback . our results are two-fold : first , we demonstrate that the bayesian-modeling approach effectively trades off between shared and user-specific information , alleviating poor initial performance for each user . second , we find that implicit-feedback has very limited unstable predictive value by itself and only marginal value when combined with explicit-feedback .
