collaborative future event recommendation we demonstrate a method for collaborative-ranking of future-events . previous work on recommender-systems typically relies on feedback on a particular item , such as a movie , and generalizes this to other items or other people . in contrast , we examine a setting where no feedback exists on the particular item . because direct feedback does not exist for events that have not taken place , we recommend them based on individuals ' preferences for past events , combined collaboratively with other peoples ' likes and dislikes . we examine the topic of unseen item-recommendation through a user-study of academic (scientific) talk recommendation , where we aim to correctly estimate a ranking-function for each user , predicting which talks would be of most interest to them . then by decomposing user parameters into shared and individual dimensions , we induce a similarity-metric between users based on the degree to which they share these dimensions . we show that the collaborative-ranking predictions of future-events are more effective than pure content-based-recommendation . finally , to further reduce the need for explicit-user-feedback , we suggest an active-learning approach for eliciting feedback and a method for incorporating available implicit user cues .
