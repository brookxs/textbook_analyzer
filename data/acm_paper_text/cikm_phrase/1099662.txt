a new permutation approach for distributed association-rule-mining privacy-preserving-distributed-data-mining has become a promising research area . this paper addresses the problem of association-rule-mining where the global database is vertically partitioned . when transactions are distributed in different sites , scalar-product is a feasible tool to discover frequent-itemsets . we present a new protocol to compute scalar-product between two parties with a permutation approach . we analyze the protocol in detail and demonstrate its effectiveness and high privacy properties , and compare it to other published protocols .
