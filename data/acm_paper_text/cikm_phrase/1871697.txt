hierarchical auto-tagging : organizing q&a knowledge for everyone we propose a hierarchical auto-tagging system , taghats , to improve users ' knowledge-sharing . our system assigns three different levels of tags to q&a documents : category , theme , and keyword . multiple category tags can organize a document according to multiple-viewpoints , and multiple theme and keyword tags can identify what the document is about clearly . moreover , these hierarchical tags will be helpful in organizing documents to support everyone because different users have different demands in terms of tag specificity . our system consists of a hierarchical-classification method for assigning category and theme tags , a new keyword-extraction method that considers the structure of q&a documents , and a new method for selecting theme tag candidates from each category . experiments with the documents of oshiete ! goo demonstrate that our system is able to assign hierarchical tags to the documents appropriately and is capable of outperforming baseline methods significantly .
