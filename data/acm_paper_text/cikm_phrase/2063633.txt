passage-retrieval for incorporating global evidence in sequence-labeling many forms of linguistic-analysis , such as part-of-speech-tagging , named-entity-recognition , and other sequence-labeling tasks are performed on short spans of text and assume statistical dependence within a window of only a few tokens . we propose using passage-retrieval to induce non-local dependencies in structured-classification that generalizes earlier work in context aggregation for named-entity-recognition . we introduce a new method for feature-expansion inspired by psuedo-relevance feedback (prf) . our results on the conll 2003 task show that features from cross-document feature-expansion improves ner effectiveness over previous aggregation models . utilizing all the tokens in a sentence for query-context consistently perform best on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations . tagging models incorporating feature-expansion outperform the leading ner system when evaluated on out of domain data , a collection of publicly available scanned-books on the topic of historic deerfield , ma . finally , the results show that retrieval_based feature-expansion using an external collection of unlabeled-text can result in further effectiveness improvements .
