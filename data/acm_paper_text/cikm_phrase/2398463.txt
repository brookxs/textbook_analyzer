measuring robustness of complex-networks under mvc attack measuring robustness of complex-networks is a fundamental task for analyzing the structure-and-function of complex-networks . in this paper , we study the network-robustness under the maximal vertex coverage (mvc) attack , where the attacker aims to delete as many edges of the network as possible by attacking a small fraction of nodes . first , we present two robustness metrics of complex-networks based on mvc attack . we then propose an efficient randomized greedy-algorithm with near-optimal performance-guarantee for computing the proposed metrics . finally , we conduct extensive experiments on 20 real datasets . the results show that p2p and co-authorship-networks are extremely robust under the mvc attack while both the online social-networks and the email-communication networks exhibit vulnerability under the mvc attack . in addition , the results demonstrate the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our proposed algorithms for computing the corresponding robustness metrics .
