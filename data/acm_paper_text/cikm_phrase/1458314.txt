estimating retrieval-effectiveness using rank distributions in this paper , we consider the task of estimating query-effectiveness , i.e. , assessment of the retrieval-system performance in absence of the user relevance judgments . in our approach we model the score associated with each document in the result-set as a gaussian random variable . the mean and the variance of each document score can then be used to estimate the probability that a document will be ranked above another one and thus calculate the expected rank of the document in the ranked list . we propose to measure the effectiveness of the system-performance by comparing the predicted and actual ranks of the retrieved documents . in our experiments we consider two retrieval-models and five document scoring methods and evaluate their impact on the proposed estimation measures . our experiments with standardized data-sets that include document-relevance judgments and the task of predicting the relative query-effectiveness show that the expected rank metric is robust to variations in document scoring and retrieval algorithms .
