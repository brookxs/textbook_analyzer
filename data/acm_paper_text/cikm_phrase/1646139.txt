supporting context-based query in personal-dataspace many users need to refer to content in existing files (pictures , tables , emails , web-pages and etc.) when they write documents (programs , presentations , proposals and etc.) , and often need to revisit these referenced files for review , revision or reconfirmation . therefore it is meaningful to discover an approach to help users revisit these references effectively . traditional approaches (file explorer , desktop-search , and etc.) fail to work in this case . in this paper , we propose an efficient-solution for this problem . we firstly define a new personal-data relationship : context-based reference (cr) , which is generated by user-behaviors . we also propose efficient methods to identify cr relationship and present a new type of query based on it : context-based query (c-query) , which helps users efficiently revisit personal documents based on cr relationship . our experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods .
