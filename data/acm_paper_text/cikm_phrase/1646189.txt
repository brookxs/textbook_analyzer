feature-engineering on event-centric surrogate-documents to improve search-results we investigate the task of re-ranking search results based on query-log information . prior work has considered this problem as either the task of learning document rankings of using features based on user-behavior , or as the task of enhancing documents and queries using log-data . our contribution combines both . we distill log information into event-centric surrogate-documents (esds) , and extract features from these esds to be used in a learned ranking-function . our experiments on a legal-corpus demonstrate that features engineered on surrogate-documents lead to improved rankings , in particular when the original ranking is of poor quality .
