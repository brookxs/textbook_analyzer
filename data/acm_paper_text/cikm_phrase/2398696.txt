resq : rank-energy selective query-forwarding for distributed-search systems selective query-forwarding is a promising technique to help scale high-quality and cost-efficient query-evaluation in distributed-search systems . the basic idea is simple . after a local site receives a query , it determines non-local sites to forward the query to and returns an aggregation of local and non-local results . we introduce `` resq '' , a hybrid rank-energy selective query-forwarding model . the novel contribution of resq is to simultaneously consider both ranking quality and energy costs when making forwarding decisions . using a large-scale query-log and publicly-available energy price time-series , we demonstrate the ability of resq forwarding to achieve favorable tradeoffs between the possibility of returning high ranking query results and savings in temporally - and spatially-varying energy prices .
