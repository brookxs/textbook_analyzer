active relevance-feedback for difficult-queries relevance-feedback has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for improving retrieval-accuracy . the existing relevance-feedback algorithms based on language-models and vector-space-models are not effective in learning from negative-feedback documents , which are abundant if the initial query is difficult . the probabilistic-retrieval-model has the advantage of being able to naturally improve the estimation of both the relevant and non-relevant models . the dirichlet compound multinomial (dcm) distribution , which relies on hierarchical-bayesian-modeling techniques , is a more appropriate generative-model for the probabilistic-retrieval-model than the traditional multinomial-distribution . we propose a new relevance-feedback algorithm , based on a mixture-model of the dcm distribution , to effectively model the overlaps between the positive and negative feedback documents . consequently , the new algorithm improves the retrieval-performance substantially for difficult-queries . to further reduce human relevance evaluation , we propose a new active-learning-algorithm in conjunction with the new relevance-feedback model . the new active-learning-algorithm implicitly models the diversity , density and relevance of unlabeled-data in a transductive-experimental-design framework . experimental-results on several trec datasets show that both the relevance-feedback and active-learning-algorithm significantly improve retrieval-accuracy .
