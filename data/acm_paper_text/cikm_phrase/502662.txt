an optimal construction of invalidation-reports for mobile-databases mobile-computing is characterized by frequent disconnection , limited communication capability , narrow bandwidth , etc. . caching can play a vital role in mobile-computing by reducing the amount of data transferred . in order to reuse caches after short disconnections , invalidation-reports are broadcasted to clients to help update/invalidate their caches . detailed reports may not be desirable because they can be very long and consume large bandwidth . on the other hand , false invalidations may set in if detailed timing information of updates is not provided in the report . in this research , we aim to reduce the false-invalidation rates of the reports . it is found that false-invalidation rates are closely related to clients ' reconnection patterns (i.e. , the distribution of the time spans between disconnections and reconnections) . by using newton 's method , we show how a report with a minimal false-invalidation rate can be constructed for any given disconnection pattern .
