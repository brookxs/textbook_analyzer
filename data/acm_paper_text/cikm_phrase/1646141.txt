progressive skyline-query evaluation and maintenance in wireless-sensor-networks skyline-query has been received much attention due to its wide application backgrounds for multi-preference and decision-making . in this paper we consider skyline-query evaluation and maintenance in wireless-sensor-networks . we devise an evaluation-algorithm for finding skyline points progressively and a maintenance algorithm for skyline maintenance incrementally . we also conduct extensive experiments by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms on various datasets . the experimental-results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform existing algorithms in terms of network-lifetime prolongation .
