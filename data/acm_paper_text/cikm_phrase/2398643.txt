scalable-collaborative-filtering using incremental-update and local link-prediction the traditional collaborative-filtering approaches have been shown to suffer from two fundamental problems : data-sparsity and difficulty in scalability . to address these problems , we present a novel scalable item-based-collaborative-filtering method by using incremental-update and local link-prediction . by subdividing the computations and analyzing the factors in different cases of item-to-item similarity , we design the incremental-update strategies in item-based cf , which can make the recommender-system more efficient and scalable . based on the transitive structure of item similarity-graph , we use the local link-prediction method to find implicit candidates to alleviate the lack of neighbors in predictions and recommendations caused by the sparsity of data . the experiment results validate that our algorithm can improve the performance of traditional cf , and can increase the efficiency in recommendations .
