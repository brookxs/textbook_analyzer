effective keyword-search for valuable lcas over xml-documents in this paper , we study the problem of effective keyword-search over xml-documents . we begin by introducing the notion of valuable lowest-common-ancestor (vlca) to accurately and effectively answer keyword-queries over xml-documents . we then propose the concept of compact vlca (cvlca) and compute the meaningful compact connected trees rooted as cvlcas as the answers of keyword-queries . to efficiently compute cvlcas , we devise an effective optimization-strategy for speeding up the computation , and exploit the key properties of cvlca in the design of the stack-based-algorithm for answering keyword-queries . we have conducted an extensive experimental-study and the experimental-results show that our proposed approach achieves both high efficiency-and-effectiveness when compared with existing proposals .
