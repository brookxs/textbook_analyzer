predicting individual priorities of shared activities using support-vector-machines activity-centric-collaboration environments help knowledge-workers to manage the context of their shared work activities by providing a representation for an activity and its resources . activity-management systems provide more structure and organization than email to execute the shared activity but , as the number of shared activities increases , it becomes more and more difficult for users to focus on important activities that need their attention . this paper describes a personalized activity prioritization approach implemented on top of the lotus connections activities management-system . our prototype-implementation allows each user to view activities ordered by her/his predicted priorities . the predictions are made using a ranking support-vector-machine model trained with the user 's past interactions with the activities system . we describe the prioritization interface and the results of an offline experiment based on data from 13 users over 6-months . our results show that our feature-set derived from shared activity structures can significantly increase prediction-accuracy compared to a recency baseline .
