selecting related terms in query-logs using two-stage simrank it is commonly believed that query-logs from web-search are a gold mine for search business , because they reflect users ' preference over web-pages presented by search-engines , so a lot of studies based on query-logs have been carried out in the last few years . in this study , we assume that two queries are relevant to each other when they have same clicked page in their result lists , and we also consider the queries ' topics of user 's need . thus , we propose a two-stage simrank (called tss in this paper) algorithm based on simrank and some clustering-algorithms to compute the similarity among queries , and then use it to discover relevant terms for query-expansion , considering the information of topics and the global relationships of queries concurrently , with a query-log collected by a practical search engine . experimental-results on two trec test-collections show that our approach can discover qualified terms effectively and improve retrieval-performance .
