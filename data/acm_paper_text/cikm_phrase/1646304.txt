ds-cuber : an integrated olap environment for data-streams most of emerging applications deal with an infinite data stream in an incessant , immense and volatile manner . consequently , it is very important to analyze not only the varying characteristics of a source data-stream in a short-term period but also those in a long-term period . for this purpose , this paper demonstrates an olap system , ds-cuber (data-stream cuber) for the analysis-of-data streams . the proposed system consists of two analytic components : short-term and long-term , so that it can provide an integrated analysis-environment for infinite data streams . furthermore , each of these two components supports diversified exception-detection methods which can be used for the automatic-identification of abnormality in the data elements of a data-stream in order to guide the data-cube navigation of a user effectively . network-traffic flow streams are used to demonstrate the features of the ds-cube system .
