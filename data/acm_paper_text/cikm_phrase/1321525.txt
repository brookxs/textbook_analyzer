nugget discovery in visual-exploration environments by query-consolidation queries issued by casual users or specialists exploring a dataset often point us to important subsets of the data , be it clusters , outliers or other meaningful features . capturing and caching such queries (henceforth called nuggets) has many potential benefits , including the optimization of the system-performance and the search experience of users . unfortunately , current visual-exploration systems have not yet tapped into this potential resource of identifying and sharing important queries . in this paper , we introduce a query-consolidation strategy aimed at solving the general problem of isolating important queries from the potentially huge amount of queries submitted . our solution clusters redundant queries caused by exploration-style query-specification , which is prevalent in data-exploration systems . to measure the similarity between queries , we designed an effective distance-metric that incorporates both the query-specification and the actual query result . to overcome its high complexity when comparing queries with large result sets , we designed an approximation method , which is efficient while still providing excellent accuracy . a user-study conducted on multivariate-data sets comparing our proposed technique to others in the literature confirms that the proposed distance-metric indeed matches well with users ' intuition . as proof of feasibility , we integrated our proposed query-consolidation solution into the nugget management-system (nms) framework [22] , which is based on a visual-exploration system xmdvtool . a second user-study indicates that both the efficiency and accuracy of users ' visual-exploration are enhanced when supported by nms .
