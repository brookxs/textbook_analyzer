efficient web matrix processing based on dual reordering pagerank is one of the most important ranking-techniques used in search-engines nowadays . since billions of pages already existed in web , many pagerank acceleration-techniques were explored by many researchers . however , in the real web , just like the existence of pages without out-links , there are many pages without in-links . (in this paper , a web-page without in-links is called a reverse-dangling page .) given the-state-of-the-art , we propose a new reordered pagerank-algorithm , called two-way reordered pagerank-algorithm , which exploits both dangling-nodes and reverse-dangling nodes to reduce the computational-complexity of the pagerank vector .
