net & cot : translating relational schemas to xml-schemas using semantic-constraints two algorithms , called net and cot , to translate relational schemas to xml-schemas using various semantic-constraints are presented . the xml-schema representation we use is a language-independent formalism named xschema , that is both precise and concise . a given xschema can be mapped to a schema in any of the existing xml-schema language proposals . our proposed algorithms have the following characteristics : (1) net derives a nested structure from a flat relational-model by repeatedly applying the nest operator on each table so that the resulting xml-schema becomes hierarchical , and (2) cot considers not only the structure of relational schemas , but also semantic-constraints such as inclusion-dependencies during the translation . it takes as input a relational-schema where multiple tables are interconnected through inclusion-dependencies and converts it into a good xschema . to validate our proposals , we present experimental-results using both real schemas from the uci repository and synthetic schemas from tpc-h .
