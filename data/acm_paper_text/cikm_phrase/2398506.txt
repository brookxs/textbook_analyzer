joint bilingual name-tagging for parallel-corpora traditional isolated monolingual name taggers tend to yield inconsistent results across two languages . in this paper , we propose two novel approaches to jointly and consistently extract names from parallel-corpora . the first approach uses standard linear-chain conditional-random-fields (crfs) as the learning-framework , incorporating cross-lingual features propagated between two languages . the second approach is based on a joint crfs model to jointly decode sentence pairs , incorporating bilingual factors based on word-alignment . experiments on chinese-english parallel-corpora demonstrated that the proposed methods significantly outperformed monolingual name taggers , were robust to automatic-alignment noise and achieved state-of-the-art performance . with only 20 % of the training-data , our proposed methods can already achieve better performance compared to the baseline learned from the whole training-set .1
