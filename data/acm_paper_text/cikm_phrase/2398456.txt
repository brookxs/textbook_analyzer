mining long-lasting exploratory user-interests from search-history a user 's web-search history contains many valuable search-patterns . in this paper , we study search-patterns that represent a user 's long-lasting and exploratory-search interests . by focusing on long-lastingness and exploratoriness , we are able to discover search-patterns that are most useful for recommending new and relevant-information to the user . our approach is based on language-modeling and clustering , and specifically designed to handle web-search-logs . we run our algorithm on a real web-search log collection , and evaluate its performance using a novel simulated study on the same search-log dataset . experiment results support our hypothesis that long-lastingness and exploratoriness are necessary for generating successful recommendation . our algorithm is shown to effectively discover such search interest patterns , and thus directly useful for making recommendation based on personal-search history .
