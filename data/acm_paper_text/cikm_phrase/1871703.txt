mining networks with shared items recent advances in data-processing have enabled the generation of large and complex graphs . many researchers have developed techniques to investigate informative structures within these graphs . however , the vertices and edges of most real-world graphs are associated with its features , and only a few studies have considered their combination . in this paper , we specifically examine a large-graph in which each vertex has associated items . from the graph , we extract subgraphs with common itemsets , which we call itemset-sharing subgraphs (isses) . the problem has various potential applications such as the detection of gene-networks affected by drugs or the findings of popular research areas of contributing researchers . we propose an efficient-algorithm to enumerate isses in large-graphs . this algorithm enumerates isses with two efficient data-structures : a dfs itemset tree and a visited itemset table . in practive , the combination of these two structures enables us to compute optimal-solutions efficiently . we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm in mining isses from synthetic graphs with more than one million edges . we also present experiments performed using two real biological-networks and a citation-network . the experiments show that our algorithm can find interesting patterns in real datasets
