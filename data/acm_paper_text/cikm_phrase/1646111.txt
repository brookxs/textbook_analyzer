a social-recommendation framework based on multi-scale-continuous-conditional-random-fields this paper addresses the issue of social-recommendation based on collaborative-filtering (cf) algorithms . social-recommendation emphasizes utilizing various attributes information and relations in social-networks to assist recommender-systems . although recommendation techniques have obtained distinct developments over the decades , traditional cf algorithms still have these following two limitations : (1) relational dependency within predictions , an important-factor especially when the data is sparse , is not being utilized effectively ; and (2) straightforward methods for combining features like linear integration suffer from high computing complexity in learning the weights by enumerating the whole value space , making it difficult to combine various information into an unified approach . in this paper , we propose a novel model , multi-scale-continuous-conditional-random-fields (mccrf) , as a framework to solve above problems for social-recommendations . in mccrf , relational dependency within predictions is modeled by the markov property , thus predictions are generated simultaneously and can help each other . this strategy has never been employed previously . besides , diverse information and relations in social-network can be modeled by state and edge-feature functions in mccrf , whose weights can be optimized globally . thus both problems can be solved under this framework . in addition , we propose to utilize markov-chain-monte-carlo (mcmc) estimation-methods to solve the difficulties in training and inference processes of mccrf . experimental-results conducted on two real-world data have demonstrated that our approach outperforms traditional cf algorithms . additional experiments also show the improvements from the two factors of relational dependency and feature-combination , respectively .
