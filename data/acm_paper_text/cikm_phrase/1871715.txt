learning na ve-bayes transfer classifier throughclass-wise test distribution estimation text-classification is a well-known problem for various applications . for last decades , it is beleived that a large-corpus is one of the most important aspects for better classification . however , even though a great number of documents is available for training a classifier , it is practically impossible to achieve an ideal performance , since the distributions of labeled and unlabeled documents are often different . to overcome this problem , this paper describes a novel na ve-bayes-classifier for text-classification under distribution-difference between training-and-test-data . the proposed method approximates test distribution by weighting labeled documents to cope with the distribution-difference . unlike other transfer-learning which estimates the weights of labeled documents , the proposed method considerd both the documents and their estimated class labels . therefore , the proposed method naturally combines the advantage of semi-supervised-learning with those of transfer-learning .
