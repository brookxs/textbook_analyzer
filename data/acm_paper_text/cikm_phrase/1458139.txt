revisiting the relationship between document-length and relevance the scope hypothesis in information-retrieval (ir) states that a relationship exists between document-length and relevance , such that the likelihood of relevance increases with document-length . a number of empirical-studies have provided statistical evidence supporting the scope hypothesis . however , these studies make the implicit assumption that modern test-collections are complete (i.e. all documents are assessed for relevance) . as a consequence the observed evidence is misleading . in this paper we perform a deeper analysis of document-length and relevance taking into account that test-collections are incomplete . we first demonstrate that previous evidence supporting the scope hypothesis was an artefact of the test-collection , where there is a bias towards longer documents in the pooling process . we evaluate whether this length bias affects system comparison when using incomplete test-collections . the results indicate that test-collections are problematic when considering map as a measure of effectiveness but are relatively robust when using bpref . the implications of the study indicate that retrieval-models should not be tuned to favour longer documents , and that designers of new test-collections should take measures against length bias during the pooling process in order to create more reliable and robust-test collections .
