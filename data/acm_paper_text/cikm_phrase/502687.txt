o-preh : optimistic transaction-processing algorithm based on pre-reordering in hybrid-broadcast environments in recent years , there has been a lot of research effort in the periodic push model where the server repetitively disseminates information without explicit request . we call the broadcast model supporting backchannel as hybrid-broadcast . in this paper , we devise a new transaction-processing algorithm called o-preh , which is based on the notion of pre-reordering . if one or more conflicts for mobile-transactions are found from server 's periodic invalidation-report , conflict orders are determined not to violate the consistency (pre-reordering) and then the remaining operations have to be executed pessimistically .
