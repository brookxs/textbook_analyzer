acquisition of categorized named-entities for web-search the recognition of names and their associated categories within unstructured-text traditionally relies on semantic lexicons and gazetteers . the amount of effort required to assemble large lexicons confines the recognition to either a limited domain (e.g. , <i> medical-imaging </i>) , or a small set of pre-defined , broader categories of interest (e.g. , <i> persons </i> , <i> countries </i> , <i> organizations </i> , <i> products </i>) . this constitutes a serious limitation in an information-seeking context . in this case , the categories of potential interest to users are more diverse (<i> universities </i> , <i> agencies </i> , <i> retailers </i> , <i> celebrities </i>) , often refined (e.g. , <i> slr digital-cameras </i> , <i> programming-languages </i> , <i> multinational oil companies </i>) , and usually overlapping (e.g. , the same entity may be concurrently a <i> brand name </i> , a <i> technology company </i> , and an <i> industry leader </i>) . we present a lightly supervised method for acquiring named-entities in arbitrary categories . the method applies lightweight lexico-syntactic extraction-patterns to the unstructured-text of web-documents . the method is a departure from traditional approaches to named-entity-recognition in that : 1) it does not require any start-up seed names or training ; 2) it does not encode any domain-knowledge in its extraction-patterns ; 3) it is only lightly supervised , and data-driven ; 4) it does not impose any a-priori restriction on the categories of extracted names . we illustrate applications of the method in web-search , and describe experiments on 500 million web-documents and news-articles .
