combination of evidences in relevance-feedback for xml-retrieval the main objective in xml-retrieval is to select the relevant elements of xml-document instead of the whole document . many open issues appear when considering relevance-feedback (rf) in xml-documents . they are mainly related to the form of xml-documents , which mix content-and-structure information and to the new information granularity . in this paper , a new flexible method of relevance-feedback in xml-retrieval using two sources of evidence is described . we propose to use the context criterion to select terms to extend the initial query and to use generative structures to express structural constraints . both approaches are applied in different combined forms . experiments are carried out with the inex evaluation campaign and results show the effectiveness of our approach .
