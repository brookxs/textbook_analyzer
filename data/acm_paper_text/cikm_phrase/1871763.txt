experiences with using svm-based learning for multi-objective-ranking we describe our experiences in applying learning-to-rank techniques to improving the quality of search-results of an online hotel reservation-system . the search result quality-factors we use are average booking position and distribution of margin in top-ranked results . (we expect that total revenue will increase with these factors .) our application of the svmrank technique improves booking position by up to 25 \ % and margin distribution by up to 14 \ % .
