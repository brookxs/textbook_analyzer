an effective model of using negative-relevance-feedback for information-filtering over the years , people have often held the hypothesis that negative-feedback should be very useful for largely improving the performance of information-filtering systems ; however , we have not obtained very effective models to support this hypothesis . this paper , proposes an effective model that use negative-relevance-feedback based on a pattern-mining approach to improve extracted features . this study focuses on two main issues of using negative-relevance-feedback : the selection of constructive negative-examples to reduce the space of negative-examples ; and the revision of existing features based on the selected negative-examples . the former selects some offender documents , where offender documents are negative documents that are most likely to be classified in the positive group . the later groups the extracted features into three groups : the positive specific category , general category and negative specific category to easily update the weight . an iterative-algorithm is also proposed to implement this approach on rcv1 data-collections , and substantial experiments show that the proposed approach achieves encouraging performance .
