time-weight collaborative-filtering collaborative-filtering is regarded as one of the most promising recommendation-algorithms . the item-based approaches for collaborative-filtering identify the similarity between two items by comparing users ' ratings on them . in these approaches , ratings produced at different times are weighted equally . that is to say , changes in user purchase interest are not taken into consideration . for example , an item that was rated recently by a user should have a bigger impact on the prediction of future user behaviour than an item that was rated a long time ago . in this paper , we present a novel algorithm to compute the time weights for different items in a manner that will assign a decreasing weight to old data . more specifically , the users ' purchase habits vary . even the same user has quite different attitudes towards different items . our proposed algorithm uses clustering to discriminate between different kinds of items . to each item cluster , we trace each user 's purchase interest change and introduce a personalized decay factor according to the user own purchase behaviour . empirical-studies have shown that our new algorithm substantially improves the precision of item-based-collaborative-filtering without introducing higher-order computational-complexity .
