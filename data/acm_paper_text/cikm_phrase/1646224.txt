spatio-temporal association-rule-mining framework for real-time sensor-network-applications in this paper , we present a data-mining-framework to estimate missing or corrupted data in sensor-network-applications - a frequently occurring phenomenon in this domain . the framework is naturally germane to the spatio-temporal-analysis of relational-data stream evolution . our method utilizes association-rules to capture spatio-temporal-correlations in multivariate , dynamically evolving , and unbounded sensor-data-streams . existing approaches that tackled this problem do not account for the multi-dimensionality of the node data and their relationship ; furthermore they entail simplistic and/or premature assumptions on the temporal and spatial factors to overcome the complexity of the streaming environment . our technique , called mining autonomously spatio-temporal environmental rules (master) , comprehensively formulates the problem of mining patterns in sensor-data-streams , and yet remains provably adaptive to bounded-time and space costs while probabilistically assuring a bounded estimation-error . simulation-experiments show master 's efficiency in terms of overhead as well as the quality of estimation .
