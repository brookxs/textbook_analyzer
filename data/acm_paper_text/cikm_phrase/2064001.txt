accurate information-extraction for quantitative financial events in this paper , we present a novel financial event-extraction system that achieves very high extraction quality by combining the outcome of statistical-classifiers with a set of rules . using expert-annotated press releases as training-data , and novel feature-generation schemes , our system learns multiple binary classifiers for each `` slot '' in a financial event . at runtime , common parsing and search indexing-methods are used to normalize incoming press releases and to identify candidate event `` slots '' . rules are applied on candidates that satisfy a combination of classifiers , and the system-confidence on extracted events is estimated using a unique confidence model learned from training-data . we present results of experiments performed on european corporate press releases for extracting dividend events , and show that our system achieves a precision of 96 \ % and a recall of 79 \ % .
