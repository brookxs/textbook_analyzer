a storage-system for scalable knowledge-representation twenty years of ai-research in knowledge-representation has produced frame-knowledge representation systems (frss) that incorporate a number of important advances . however , frss lack two important capabilities that prevent them from scaling up to realistic applications : they can not provide high-speed access to large knowledge-bases (kbs) , and they do not support shared , concurrent kb access by multiple-users . our research investigates the hypothesis that one can employ an existing database-management-system (dbms) as a storage-subsystem for an frs , to provide high-speed access to large , shared kbs . we describe the design and implementation of a general storage-system that incrementally loads referenced frames from a dbms , and saves modified frames back to the dbms , for two different frss : loom and theo . we also present experimental-results showing that the performance of our prototype storage-subsystem exceeds that of flat files for simulated applications that reference or update up to one third of the frames from a large loom kb .
