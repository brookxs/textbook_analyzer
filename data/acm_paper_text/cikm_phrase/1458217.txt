search-advertising using web relevance-feedback the business of web-search , a $ 10 billion industry , relies heavily on sponsored-search , whereas a few carefully-selected paid advertisements are displayed alongside algorithmic search-results . a key technical challenge in sponsored-search is to select ads that are relevant for the user 's query . identifying relevant ads is challenging because queries are usually very short , and because users , consciously or not , choose terms intended to lead to optimal web-search-results and not to optimal ads . furthermore , the ads themselves are short and usually formulated to capture the reader 's attention rather than to facilitate query-matching . traditionally , matching of ads to queries employed standard information-retrieval-techniques using the bag-of-words approach . here we propose to go beyond the bag-of-words , and augment both queries and ads with additional knowledge-rich features . we use web-search-results initially returned for the query to create a pool of relevant documents . classifying these documents with respect to an external taxonomy and identifying salient named-entities give rise to two new feature-types . empirical-evaluation based on over 9,000 query-ad pairwise judgments confirms that using augmented queries produces highly relevant ads . our methodology also relaxes the requirement for each ad to explicitly specify the exhaustive list of queries (`` bid phrases '') that can trigger it .
