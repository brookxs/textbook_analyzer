classification-based resource-selection in some retrieval situations , a system must search across multiple collections . this task , referred to as federated-search , occurs for example when searching a distributed-index or aggregating content for web-search . resource-selection refers to the subtask of deciding , given a query , which collections to search . most existing resource-selection methods rely on evidence found in collection content . we present an approach to resource-selection that combines multiple sources of evidence to inform the selection decision . we derive evidence from three different sources : collection documents , the topic of the query , and query click-through-data . we combine this evidence by treating resource-selection as a multiclass machine-learning problem . although machine learned approaches often require large amounts of manually generated training-data , we present a method for using automatically generated training-data . we make use of and compare against prior resource-selection work and evaluate across three experimental testbeds .
