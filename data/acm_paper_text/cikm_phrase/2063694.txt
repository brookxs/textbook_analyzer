clues : a unified-framework supporting interactive-exploration of density-based clusters in streams although various mining algorithms have been proposed in the literature to efficiently compute clusters , few strides have been made to date in helping analysts to interactively explore such patterns in the stream context . we present a framework called clues to both computationally and visually support the process of real-time mining of density-based clusters . clues is composed of three major components . first , as foundation of clues , we develop an evolution-model of density-based clusters in data-streams that captures the complete spectrum of cluster evolution types across streaming windows . second , to equip clues with the capability of efficiently tracking cluster evolution , we design a novel algorithm to piggy-back the evolution tracking process into the underlying cluster-detection process . third , clues organizes the detected clusters and their evolution interrelationships into a multidimensional pattern space - presenting clusters at different time horizons and across different abstraction-levels . it provides a rich set of visualization-and-interaction techniques to allow the analyst to explore this multi-dimensional pattern space in real-time . our experimental-evaluation , including performance-studies and a user-study , using real streams from ground group movement monitoring and from stock transaction domains confirm both the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our proposed clues framework .
