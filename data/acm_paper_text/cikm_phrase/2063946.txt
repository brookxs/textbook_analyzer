privacy-preserving feature-selection for distributed-data using virtual dimension data-mining often suffers from the curse-of-dimensionality . huge numbers of dimensions or attributes in the data pose serious problems to the data-mining tasks . traditionally data-dimensionality reduction-techniques like principal-component-analysis have been used to address this problem.however , the need might be to remain in the original attribute-space and identify the key predictive attributes instead of moving to a transformed space . as a result feature-subset-selection has become an important area of research over the last few years . with the advent of network technologies data is sometimes distributed in multiple locations and often with multiple parties . the biggest concern while sharing data is data-privacy . here , in this paper a secure distributed protocol is proposed that will allow feature-selection for multiple parties without revealing their own data . the proposed distributed feature-selection-method has evolved from a method called virtual dimension-reduction used in the field of hyperspectral image processing for selection of subset of hyperspectral bands for further analysis . the experimental-results with real life datasets presented in this paper will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method .
