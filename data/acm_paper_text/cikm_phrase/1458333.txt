fast spatial-co-location mining without cliqueness checking in this paper , we propose a novel , spatial-co-location mining algorithm which automatically generates co-located spatial features without generating any non-clique candidates at each level . subsequently our algorithm is more efficient than other existing level-wise co-location algorithms because no cliqueness checking is performed in our algorithm . in addition , our algorithm produces a smaller number of co-location candidates than the other existing algorithms .
