a correlation-based model for unsupervised-feature-selection we propose a new model for feature evaluation and selection that assesses the propensity of the features to support two-set classification . for each item of the data-set , the collection of features induce a ranking (ordered-list) of the remaining items . the evaluation criterion favors features that result in the most consistent discrimination between relevant and non-relevant items within these ranked-lists . the discrimination boundaries within a single list are determined combinatorially , according to the degree of correlation among the relevant sets of its members . the model makes no special assumptions on the nature of the data . a selection heuristic based on the model is also proposed using sequential forward generation , and an experimental-comparison is made with other unsupervised-feature-selection methods .
