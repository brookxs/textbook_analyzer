facilitating knowledge-flow through the enterprise this paper is concerned with the issues we encountered when attempting to achieve enterprise level knowledge-reuse . we present 3 pilot studies where new visualization-techniques were used to allow manufacturing and service operations take advantage of engineering-knowledge embodied in 3d-models . though all these studies showed dramatic productivity increases , only one business unit from the studies is currently working to achieve the reuse . there are a number of reasons why this is so , but the key underlying theme is a lack of enterprise level commitment to knowledge-sharing and a lack of an adequate knowledge architecture for sharing-knowledge across organizational boundaries . we conclude with an approach for facilitating knowledge-flow across functional-units .
