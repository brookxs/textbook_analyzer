modeling lsh for performance-tuning although locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) is a promising approach to similarity-search in high-dimensional spaces , it has not been considered practical partly because its search-quality is sensitive to several parameters that are quite data dependent . previous research on lsh , though obtained interesting asymptotic results , provides little guidance on how these parameters should be chosen , and tuning parameters for a given dataset remains a tedious process . to address this problem , we present a statistical performance-model of multi-probe-lsh , a state-of-the-art variance of lsh . our model can accurately predict the average search-quality and latency given a small-sample dataset . apart from automatic-parameter-tuning with the performance-model , we also use the model to devise an adaptive lsh search-algorithm to determine the probing parameter dynamically for each query . the adaptive-probing method addresses the problem that even though the average-performance is tuned for optimal , the variance of the performance is extremely high . we experimented with three different datasets including audio , images and 3d-shapes to evaluate our methods . the results show the accuracy of the proposed model : the recall errors predicted are within 5 \ % from the real values for most cases ; the adaptive-search method reduces the standard-deviation of recall by about 50 \ % over the existing method .
