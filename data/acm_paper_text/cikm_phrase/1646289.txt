finding good feedback documents pseudo-relevance-feedback finds useful expansion terms from a set of top-ranked documents . it is often crucial to identify those good feedback documents from which useful expansion terms can be added to the query . in this paper , we propose to detect good feedback documents by classifying all feedback documents using a variety of features such as the distribution of query terms in the feedback document , the similarity between a single feedback document and all top-ranked documents , or the proximity between the expansion terms and the original query terms in the feedback document . by doing this , query-expansion is only performed using a selected set of feedback documents , which are predicted to be good among all top-ranked documents . experimental-results on standard trec test-data show that query-expansion on the selected feedback documents achieves statistically significant improvements over a strong pseudo-relevance-feedback mechanism , which expands the query using all top-ranked documents .
