efficient filtering and ranking schemes for finding inclusion-dependencies on the web-data integrity-constraints are fundamental in various applications , such as data-management , integration , cleaning , and schema-extraction . in this paper , we address the problem of finding inclusion-dependencies on the web . the problem is important because (1) applications of inclusion-dependencies , such as data-quality-management , are beneficial in the web-context , and (2) such dependencies are not explicitly given in general . in our approach , we enumerate pairs of html/xml elements that possibly represent inclusion-dependencies and then rank the results for verification . first , we propose a bit-based signature-scheme to efficiently select candidates (element pairs) in the enumeration process . the signature-scheme is unique in that it supports jaccard-containment to deal with the incomplete nature of data on the web , and preserves the semiorder inclusion relationship among sets of words . second , we propose a ranking-scheme to support a user in checking whether each enumerated pair actually suggests inclusion-dependencies . the ranking-scheme sorts the enumerated pairs so that we can examine a small number of pairs for simultaneously verifying many pairs .
