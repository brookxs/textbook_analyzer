concavity in ir-models we study the impact of concavity in ir-models and propose to use a generalized logarithm function , the n-logarithm to weight words in documents . we extend the-family of information_based information-retrieval (ir) models with this function . we show that that concavity is indeed an important property of ir-models . experiments conducted for ir tasks , latent-semantic-indexing and text-categorization show improvements .
