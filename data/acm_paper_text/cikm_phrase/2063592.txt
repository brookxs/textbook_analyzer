discovering urls through user-feedback search-engines rely upon crawling to build their web-page collections . a web-crawler typically discovers new urls by following the link-structure induced by links on web-pages . as the number of documents on the web is large , discovering newly created urls may take arbitrarily long , and depending on how a given page is connected to others , such a crawler may miss the pages altogether . in this paper , we evaluate the benefits of integrating a passive url-discovery mechanism into a web-crawler . this mechanism is passive in the sense that it does not require the crawler to actively fetch documents from the-web to discover urls . we focus here on a mechanism that uses toolbar-data as a representative source for new url-discovery . we use the toolbar logs of yahoo! to characterize the urls that are accessed by users via their browsers , but not discovered by yahoo! web-crawler . we show that a high fraction of urls that appear in toolbar logs are not discovered by the crawler . we also reveal that a certain fraction of urls are discovered by the crawler later than the time they are first accessed by users . one important conclusion of our work is that web-search-engines can highly benefit from user-feedback in the form of toolbar logs for passive url-discovery .
