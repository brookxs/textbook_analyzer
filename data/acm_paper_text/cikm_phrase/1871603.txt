automatically weighting tags in xml collection in xml-retrieval , nodes with different tags play different roles in xml-documents and then tags should be reflected in the relevance-ranking . an automatic-method is proposed in this paper to infer the weights of tags . we first investigate 15 features about tags , and then select five of them based on the correlations between these features and manual tag weights . using these features , a tag weight assignment model , atg , is designed . we evaluate the performance of atg on two real-data sets , ieeecs and wikipedia from two different perspectives . one is to evaluate the quality of the model by measuring the correlation between weights generated by our model and those given by experts . the other is to test the effectiveness of the model in improving retrieval-performance . experimental-results show that the tag weights generated by atg are highly correlated with the manually assigned weights and the atg model improves retrieval-effectiveness significantly .
