web-unit-mining : finding and classifying subgraphs of web-pages in web-classification , most researchers assume that the objects to classify are individual web-pages from one or more web-sites . in practice , the assumption is too restrictive since a web-page itself may not always correspond to a concept instance of some semantic-concept (or category) given to the classification-task . in this paper , we want to relax this assumption and allow a concept instance to be represented by a subgraph of web-pages or a set of web-pages . we identify several new issues to be addressed when the assumption is removed , and formulate the-web unit mining problem . we also propose an iterative web-unit-mining (iwum) method that first finds subgraphs of web-pages using some knowledge about web-site structure . from these web subgraphs , web units are constructed and classified into semantic-concepts (or categories) in an iterative manner . our experiments using the webkb dataset showed that iwum improves the overall classification-performance and works very well on the more structured parts of a web-site .
