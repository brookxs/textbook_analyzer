beyond-hyperlinks : organizing information-footprints in search-logs to support effective-browsing while current search-engines serve known-item search such as homepage finding very well , they generally can not support exploratory-search effectively . in exploratory-search , users do not know their information-needs precisely and also often lack the needed knowledge to formulate effective queries , thus querying alone , as supported by the current search-engines , is insufficient , and browsing into related information would be very useful . currently , browsing is mostly done by following hyperlinks embedded on web-pages . in this paper , we propose to leverage search-logs to allow a user to browse beyond-hyperlinks with a multi-resolution topic map constructed based on search-logs . specifically , we treat search-logs as `` footprints '' left by previous users in the information-space and build a multi-resolution topic map to semantically capture and organize them in multiple granularities . such a topic-map can support a user to zoom in , zoom out , and navigate horizontally over the information-space , and thus provide flexible and effective-browsing capabilities for end-users . to test the effectiveness of the proposed methods of supporting browsing , we rely on real search-logs and a commercial-search-engine to implement our proposed methods . our experimental-results show that the proposed topic-map is effective to support browsing beyond-hyperlinks .
