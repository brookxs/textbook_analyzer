towards noise-resilient document-modeling we introduce a generative probabilistic document-model based on latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) , to deal with textual-errors in the document-collection . our model is inspired by the fact that most large-scale text data are machine-generated and thus inevitably contain many types of noise . the new model , termed as te-lda , is developed from the traditional lda by adding a switch variable into the term generation-process in order to tackle the issue of noisy-text data . through extensive experiments , the efficacy of our proposed model is validated using both real and synthetic-data sets .
