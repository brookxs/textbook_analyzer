sparse structured probabilistic projections for factorized latent spaces building a common representation for several related data-sets is an important problem in multi-view-learning . cca and its extensions have shown that they are effective in finding the shared variation among all data-sets . however , these models generally fail to exploit the common structure of the data when the views are with private-information . recently , methods explicitly modeling the information into shared part and private parts have been proposed , but they presume to know the prior-knowledge about the latent-space , which is usually impossible to obtain . in this paper , we propose a probabilistic-model , which could simultaneously learn the structure of the latent-space whilst factorize the information correctly , therefore the prior-knowledge of the latent-space is unnecessary . furthermore , as a probabilistic-model , our method is able to deal with missing-data problem in a natural way . we show that our approach attains the performance of state-of-art methods on the task of human-pose-estimation when the motion-capture view is completely missing , and significantly improves the inference accuracy with only a few observed data .
