mining coherent-patterns from heterogeneous microarray-data microarray technology is a powerful tool for geneticists to monitor interactions among tens of thousands of genes simultaneously . there has been extensive research on coherent subspace-clustering of gene expressions measured under consistent experimental settings . however , these methods assume that all experiments are run using the same batch of microarray chips with similar characteristics of noise . algorithms developed under this assumption may not be applicable for analyzing data collected from heterogeneous settings , where the set of genes being monitored may be different and expression levels may be not directly comparable even for the same gene . in this paper , we propose a model , f-cluster , for mining subspace coherent-patterns from heterogeneous gene-expression-data . we compare our model with previously proposed models . we analyze the search-space of the problem and give a na ve solution for it .
