you are where you tweet : a content-based approach to geo-locating twitter users we propose and evaluate a probabilistic-framework for estimating a twitter user 's city-level location-based purely on the content of the user 's tweets , even in the absence of any other geospatial cues . by augmenting the massive human-powered sensing capabilities of twitter and related microblogging-services with content-derived location-information , this framework can overcome the sparsity of geo-enabled features in these services and enable new location-based personalized-information services , the targeting of regional advertisements , and so on . three of the key features of the proposed approach are : (i) its reliance purely on tweet content , meaning no need for user ip information , private login information , or external-knowledge bases ; (ii) a classification-component for automatically identifying words in tweets with a strong local geo-scope ; and (iii) a lattice-based neighborhood smoothing model for refining a user 's location estimate . the system estimates k possible locations for each user in descending order of confidence . on average we find that the location estimates converge quickly (needing just 100s of tweets) , placing 51 \ % of twitter users within 100 miles of their actual location .
