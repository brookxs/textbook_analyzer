usage_based effectiveness-measures : monitoring application-performance in information-retrieval the aim of an information-retrieval (ir) application is to support the user accessing relevant-information effectively and efficiently . it is well known that system-performance , in terms of finding relevant-information is heavily dependent upon the ir application (i.e. the ir-system exposed through the application 's interface) , as well as how the application is used by the user (i.e. how the user interacts with the system through the interface) . thus , a very pragmatic evaluation question that arises at the application level is : what is the effectiveness experienced by the user during the usage of the application ? to be able to answer this question , we represent the usage of an application by the stream of documents the user encounters while interacting with the application . this representation enables us to monitor and track the performance over time and usage . by taking a stream-based , time-centric view of the ir process , instead of a rank-list , topic/task centric view , the evaluation can be performed on any ir_based application . to illustrate the difference and the utility of this approach , we demonstrate how a new suite of usage_based effectiveness-measures can be applied . this work provides the conceptual foundations for measuring , monitoring and modeling the performance of any ir application which needs to be evaluated over time and in context .
