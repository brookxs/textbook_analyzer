i/o-efficient-algorithms for answering pattern-based aggregate-queries in a sequence-olap system many kinds of real-life data exhibit logical ordering among their data items and are thus sequential in nature . in recent years , the concept of sequence-olap (s-olap) has been proposed . the biggest distinguishing feature of solap from traditional olap is that data sequences managed by an s-olap system are characterized by the subsequence/substring patterns they possess . an s-olap system thus supports pattern-based grouping and aggregation . conceptually , an s-olap system maintains a sequence-data-cube which is composed of sequence cuboids . each sequence cuboid presents the answer of a pattern-based aggregate (pba) query . this paper focuses on the i/o aspects of evaluating pba queries . we study the problems of joining plan-selection and execution planning , which are the core issues in the design of i/o-efficient cuboid materialization algorithms . through an empirical-study , we show that our algorithms lead to a very i/o-efficient strategy for sequence cuboid materialization .
