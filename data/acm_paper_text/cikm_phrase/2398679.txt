a picture paints a thousand words : a method of generating image-text timelines manual timelines have greatly helped us to keep pace with the big world . in this paper , we introduce a novel solution which generates image-text timelines for news events based on evolutionary image-text summarization , which is an important and challenging problem . we first extract image 's semantic-information under translation-model , and then fuse the high quality images with text timeline under an image assignment-algorithm which can optimize the global coordination of the final timeline . the experimental-results show that news readers can receive more satisfaction from the image-text timelines we generate .
