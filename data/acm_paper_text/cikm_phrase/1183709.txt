performance thresholding in practical-text-classification in practical classification , there is often a mix of learnable and unlearnable classes and only a classifier above a minimum performance threshold can be deployed . this problem is exacerbated if the training-set is created by active-learning . the bias of actively learned training-sets makes it hard to determine whether a class has been learned . we give evidence that there is no general and efficient method for reducing the bias and correctly identifying classes that have been learned . however , we characterize a number of scenarios where active-learning can succeed despite these difficulties .
