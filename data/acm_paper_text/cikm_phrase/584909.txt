discovering the representative of a search-engine given a large number of search-engines on the internet , it is difficult for a person to determine which search-engines could serve his/her information-needs . a common solution is to construct a metasearch-engine on top of the search-engines . upon receiving a user-query , the metasearch-engine sends it to those underlying search-engines which are likely to return the desired documents for the query . the selection-algorithm used by a metasearch-engine to determine whether a search-engine should be sent the query typically makes the decision based on the search-engine representative , which contains characteristic information about the database of a search-engine . however , an underlying search-engine may not be willing to provide the needed information to the metasearch-engine . this paper shows that the needed information can be estimated from an uncooperative search-engine with good accuracy . two pieces of information which permit accurate search-engine-selection are the number of documents indexed by the search-engine and the maximum-weight of each term . in this paper , we present techniques for the estimation of these two pieces of information .
