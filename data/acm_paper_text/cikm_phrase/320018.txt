self maintenance of multiple-views in data-warehousing materialized-views (mv) at the data-warehouse (dw) can be kept up to date in response to changes in data sources without accessing-data sources for additional-information . this process is usually refered to as self maintenance of views . a number of algorithms have been proposed for self maintenance of views , which use auxiliary views (av) to keep some additional-information in dw . in this paper we propose an algorithm for self maintainability of multiple mvs using the above approach . our algorithm generates a simple maintenance query to incrementally maintain an mv along with its av at dw . the algorithm maintains these views by minimizing the number and the size of the avs . our approach provides better insight into view-maintenance issues by exploiting the dependencies and-constraints that might exist in the data sources and multiple mvs at dw .
