advancing the discovery of unique column combinations unique column combinations of a relational-database table are sets of columns that contain only unique values . discovering such combinations is a fundamental research problem and has many different data-management and knowledge-discovery applications . existing discovery algorithms are either brute-force or have a high memory-load and can thus be applied only to small datasets or samples . in this paper , the well-known gordian algorithm [9] and `` apriori-based '' algorithms [4] are compared and analyzed for further optimization . we greatly improve the apriori algorithms through efficient candidate-generation and statistics-based pruning methods . a hybrid solution hca-gordian combines the advantages of gordian and our new algorithm hca , and it outperforms all previous work in many situations .
