academic-conference homepage understanding using constrained-hierarchical-conditional-random-fields we address the problem of academic-conference homepage understanding for the-semantic-web . this problem consists of three labeling tasks - labeling conference function pages , function blocks , and attributes . different from traditional information-extraction-tasks , the data in academic-conference homepages has complex structural dependencies across multiple web-pages . in addition , there are logical constraints in the data . in this paper , we propose a unified approach , constrained-hierarchical-conditional-random-fields , to accomplish the three labeling tasks simultaneously . in this approach , complex structural dependencies can be well described . also , the constrained viterbi-algorithm in the inference-process can avoid logical errors . experimental-results on real-world conference data have demonstrated that this approach performs better than cascaded labeling methods by 3.6 \ % in f1-measure and that the constrained inference-process can improve the accuracy by 14.3 \ % . based on the proposed approach , we develop a prototype-system of use-oriented semantic academic-conference calendar . the user simply needs to specify what conferences he/she is interested in . subsequently , the system finds , extracts , and updates the semantic information from the-web , and then builds a calendar automatically for the user . the semantic conference data can be used in other applications , such as finding sponsors and finding experts . the proposed approach can be used in other information-extraction-tasks as well .
