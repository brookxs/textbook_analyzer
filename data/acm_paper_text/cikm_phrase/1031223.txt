web-page-clustering enhanced by summarization traditional web-page-clustering algorithms use the full-text in the documents to generate feature-vectors . such methods often produce unsatisfactory results because there is much noisy information , such as decoration , interaction , and advertisement , in web-pages . the varying-length problem of the-web pages is also a significant negative factor affecting the performance . in this paper , we investigate the use of several summarization techniques to tackle these issues when clustering web-pages . compared with the full-text representation of the web-pages , our experimental-results indicate that our proposed approach effectively solves the problems of noisy information and varying-length , and thus significantly boosts the clustering performance .
