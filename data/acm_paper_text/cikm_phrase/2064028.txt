p2prec : a social-based p2p recommendation-system p2prec is a social-based p2p recommendation-system for large-scale content-sharing that leverages content-based and social-based recommendation . the main idea is to recommend high quality documents related to query topics and contents held by useful friends (of friends) of the users , by exploiting friendship networks . we have implemented a prototype of p2prec using the shared-data overlay-network (son) , an open-source-development platform for p2p-networks using web-services , jxta and osgi . in this paper , we describe the demo of p2prec 's main services (installing p2prec peers , initializing peers , gossiping topics of interest among friends , key-word querying for contents) using our prototype implemented as an application of son .
