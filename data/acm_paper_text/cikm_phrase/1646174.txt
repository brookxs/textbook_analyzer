clustering queries for better document-ranking different queries require different ranking methods . it is however challenging to determine what queries are similar , and how to rank documents for them . in this paper , we propose a new method to cluster queries according to the similarity determined based on urls in their answers . we then train specific ranking-models for each query cluster . in addition , a cluster-specific measure of authority is defined to favor documents from authoritative websites on the corresponding topics . the proposed approach is tested using data from a search-engine . it turns out that our proposed topic-dependent models can significantly improve the search-results of eight most popular categories of queries .
