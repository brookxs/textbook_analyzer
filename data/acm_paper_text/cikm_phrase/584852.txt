categorizing information objects from user-access-patterns many web-sites have dynamic-information objects whose topics change over time . classifying these objects automatically and promptly is a challenging and important problem for site masters . traditional content-based and link-structure_based classification-techniques have intrinsic limitations for this task . this paper proposes a framework to classify an object into an existing category-structure by analyzing the users ' traversals in the category-structure . the key idea is to infer an object 's topic from the predicted preferences of users when they access the object . we compare two approaches using this idea . one analyzes collective user-behavior and the other each user 's accesses . we present experimental-results on actual data that demonstrate a much higher prediction-accuracy and applicability with the latter approach . we also analyze the correlation between classification-quality and various factors such as the number of users accessing the object . to our knowledge , this work is the first effort in combining object-classification with user-access prediction .
