estimating average-precision with incomplete and imperfect judgments we consider the problem of evaluating retrieval-systems using incomplete judgment information . buckley and voorhees recently demonstrated that retrieval-systems can be efficiently and effectively evaluated using incomplete-judgments via the bpref measure [6] . when relevance-judgments are complete , the value of bpref is an approximation to the value of average-precision using complete judgments . however , when relevance-judgments are incomplete , the value of bpref deviates from this value , though it continues to rank systems in a manner similar to average-precision evaluated with a complete judgment set . in this work , we propose three evaluation-measures that (1) are approximations to average-precision even when the relevance-judgments are incomplete and (2) are more robust to incomplete or imperfect relevance-judgments than bpref . the proposed estimates of average-precision are simple and accurate , and we demonstrate the utility of these estimates using trec-data .
