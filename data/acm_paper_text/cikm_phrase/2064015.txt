scalable similarity-search of timeseries with variable dimensionality timeseries can be similar in shape but differ in length . for example , the sound waves produced by the same word spoken twice have roughly the same shape , but one may be shorter in duration . stream-data-mining , approximate-querying of image and video databases , data-compression , and near-duplicate-detection are applications that need to be able to classify or cluster such timeseries , and to search for and rank timeseries that are similar to a chosen timeseries . we demonstrate software for clustering and performing similarity-search in databases of timeseries data , where the timeseries have high and variable dimensionality . our demonstration uses timeseries sensitive hashing (tsh) [3] to index the timeseries . tsh adapts locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) , which is an approximate-algorithm to index data points in a d - dimensional space under some (e.g. , euclidean) distance-function . tsh , unlike lsh , can index points that do not have the same dimensionality . as examples of the potential of tsh , the demonstration will index and classify timeseries from an image-database and timeseries describing human-motion extracted from a video-stream and a motion-capture-system .
