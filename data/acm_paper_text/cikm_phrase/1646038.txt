density-based-clustering using graphics-processors during the last few years , gpus have evolved from simple devices for the display signal preparation into powerful coprocessors that do not only support typical computer-graphics tasks but can also be used for general numeric and symbolic-computation tasks . as major advantage gpus provide extremely high parallelism combined with a high-bandwidth in memory transfer at low-cost . we want to exploit these dvantages in density-based-clustering , an important paradigm in clustering since typical algorithms of this category are noise and outlier robust and search for clusters of an arbitrary shape in metric and vector-spaces . moreover , with a time-complexity ranging from o (n log n) to o (n2) these algorithms are scalable to large-data-sets in a database-system . in this paper , we propose cuda-dclust , a massively-parallel algorithm for density-based-clustering for the use of a graphics-processing-unit (gpu) . while the result of this algorithm is guaranteed to be equivalent to that of dbscan , we demonstrate a high speed-up , particularly in combination with a novel index-structure for use in gpus .
