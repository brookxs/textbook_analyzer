variance maximization via noise-injection for active sampling in learning-to-rank active-learning for ranking , which is to selectively label the most informative examples , has been widely studied in recent years . in this paper , we propose a general active-learning for ranking strategy called variance maximization (vm) . the algorithm relies on noise-injection to perturb the original unlabeled-examples and generate the rank distribution of each example . using a dcg-like gain-function to measure each ranked list sampled from the rank distribution , variance maximization selects the unlabeled example with the largest variance in the gain . the vm strategy is applied at both the query level and the document level , and a two-stage active-learning-algorithm is further derived . experimental-results on both the letor 4.0 dataset and a real-world web-search-ranking dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed active-learning approach .
