page : a partition aware graph computation engine graph-partitioning is one of the key components in parallel graph computation , and the partition-quality significantly affects the overall computing-performance . in the existing graph computing-systems , `` good '' partition-schemes are preferred as they have smaller edge cut ratio and hence reduce the communication-cost among working nodes . however , in an empirical-study on giraph [1] , we found that the performance over well partitioned graph might be even two times worse than simple partitions . the cause is that the local message-processing cost in graph computing-systems may surpass the communication-cost in several cases . in this paper , we analyse the cost of parallel graph computing-systems as well as the relationship between the cost and underlying graph-partitioning . based on these observation , we propose a novel partition aware graph computation engine named page . page is equipped with two newly designed modules , i.e. , the communication module with a dual concurrent message processor , and a partition aware one to monitor the system 's status . the monitored information can be utilized to dynamically adjust the concurrency of dual concurrent message processor with a novel dynamic concurrency control model (dccm) . the dccm applies several heuristic-rules to determine the optimal concurrency for the message processor . we have implemented a prototype of page and conducted extensive studies on a moderate size of cluster . the experimental-results clearly demonstrate the page 's robustness under different graph-partition qualities and show its advantages over existing systems with up to 59 % improvement .
