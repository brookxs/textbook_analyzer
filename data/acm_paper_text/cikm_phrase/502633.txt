mining the-web to create minority language-corpora the-web is a valuable source of language specific resources but the process of collecting , organizing and utilizing these resources is difficult . we describe corpusbuilder , an approach for automatically generating web-search queries for collecting documents in a minority language . it differs from pseudo-relevance-feedback in that retrieved documents are labeled by an automatic language classifier as relevant or irrelevant , and this feedback is used to generate new queries . we experiment with various query-generation methods and query-lengths to find inclusion/exclusion terms that are helpful for retrieving documents in the target-language and find that using odds-ratio scores calculated over the documents acquired so far was one of the most consistently accurate query-generation methods . we also describe experiments using a handful of words elicited from a user instead of initial documents and show that the methods perform similarly . experiments applying the same approach to multiple languages are also presented showing that our approach generalizes to a variety of languages .
