xml-parsing : a threat to database-performance xml-parsing is generally known to have poor performance characteristics relative to transactional database-processing . yet , its potentially fatal impact on overall database-performance is being underestimated . we report real-word database-applications where xml-parsing performance is a key obstacle to a successful xml deployment . there is a considerable share of xml-database applications which are prone to fail at an early and simple road block : xml-parsing . we analyze xml-parsing performance and quantify the extra overhead of dtd and schema-validation . comparison with relational-database performance shows that the desired response-times and transaction rates over xml-data can not be achieved without major improvements in xml-parsing technology . thus , we identify research topics which are most promising for xml-parser performance in database-systems .
