hierarchical topic integration through semi-supervised hierarchical topic modeling lots of document-collections are well organized in hierarchical-structure , and such structure can help users browse and understand these collections . meanwhile , there are a large number of plain document-collections loosely organized , and it is difficult for users to understand them effectively . in this paper we study how to automatically integrate latent topics in a plain collection with the topics in a hierarchical structured collection . we propose to use semi-supervised topic-modeling to solve the problem in a principled way . the experiments show that the proposed method can generate both meaningful latent topics and expand high quality hierarchical topic structures .
