search-log anonymization and advertisement : are they mutually exclusive ? the revenue of search-engine providers strongly depends on targeted advertisement . targeted advertisement is becoming more reliant on personal-data . this puts user-privacy at risk . one way to improve privacy is to anonymize search-logs , but this reduces usefulness for ad placement . further , the usefulness depends on the target function used for the anonymization . this paper is the first to study this tradeoff systematically . we quantify the usefulness of an anonymized search-log for advertisement purposes , by estimating outcomes such as the number of clicks on ads or the number of ad impressions possible after anonymization . a main result is that anonymized search-logs are still useful for advertisement purposes , but the extent strongly depends on the target function .
