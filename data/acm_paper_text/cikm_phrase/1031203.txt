a dimensionality-reduction-technique for efficient similarity-analysis of time-series databases efficiently searching for similarities among time-series and discovering interesting patterns is an important and non-trivial problem with applications in many domains . the high-dimensionality of the data makes the analysis very challenging . to solve this problem , many dimensionality-reduction methods have been proposed . pca (piecewise constant approximation) and its variant have been shown efficient in time-series indexing and similarity-retrieval . however , in certain applications , too many false-alarms introduced by the approximation may reduce the overall performance dramatically . in this paper , we introduce a new piecewise dimensionality-reduction-technique that is based on vector-quantization . the new technique , pvqa (piecewise vector quantized approximation) , partitions each sequence into equi-length segments and uses vector-quantization to represent each segment by the closest (based on a distance-metric) codeword from a codebook of key-sequences . the efficiency of calculations is improved due to the significantly lower dimensionality of the new representation . we demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed technique on real and simulated datasets . by exploiting prior-knowledge about the data , the proposed technique generally outperforms pca and its variants in similarity-searches .
