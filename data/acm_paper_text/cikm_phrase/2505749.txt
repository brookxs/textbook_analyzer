g-tree : an efficient index for knn-search on road-networks in this paper we study the problem of knn-search on road-networks . given a query location and a set of candidate objects in a road-network , the knn-search finds the k nearest objects to the query location . to address this problem , we propose a balanced search-tree index , called g-tree . the g-tree of a road-network is constructed by recursively partitioning the road-network into sub-networks and each g-tree node corresponds to a sub-network . inspired by classical knn-search on metric-space , we introduce a best-first-search-algorithm on road-networks , and propose an elaborately-designed assembly-based method to efficiently compute the minimum distance from a g-tree node to the query location . g-tree only takes o (| v | log | v |) space , where | v | is the number of vertices in a network , and thus can easily scale up to large road-networks with more than 20 millions vertices . experimental-results on eight real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods , even by 2-3 orders of magnitude .
