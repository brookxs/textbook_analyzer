mining term-association-patterns from search-logs for effective query-reformulation search-engine-logs are an emerging new type of data that offers interesting opportunities for data-mining . existing work on mining such data has mostly attempted to discover knowledge at the level of queries (e.g. , query clusters) . in this paper , we propose to mine search-engine-logs for patterns at the level of terms through analyzing the relations of terms inside a query . we define two novel term-association-patterns (i.e. , context-sensitive term substitutions and term additions) and propose new methods for mining such patterns from search-engine-logs . these two patterns can be used to address the mis-specification and under-specification problems of ineffective queries . experiment results on real search-engine-logs show that the mined context-sensitive term substitutions can be used to effectively reword queries and improve their accuracy , while the mined context-sensitive term addition patterns can be used to support query-refinement in a more effective way .
