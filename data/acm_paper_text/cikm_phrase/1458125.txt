characterizing and predicting community members from evolutionary and heterogeneous-networks mining different types of communities from web-data have attracted a lot of research efforts in recent years . however , none of the existing community-mining techniques has taken into account both the dynamic as well as heterogeneous nature of web-data . in this paper , we propose to characterize and predict community members from the evolution of heterogeneous web-data . we first propose a general-framework for analyzing the evolution of heterogeneous-networks . then , the academic network , which is extracted from 1 million computer-science papers , is used as an example to illustrate the framework . finally , two example applications of the academic network are presented . experimental-results with a real and very-large heterogeneous academic network show that our proposed framework can produce good results in terms of community member recommendation . also , novel knowledge and insights can be gained by analyzing the community-evolution pattern .
