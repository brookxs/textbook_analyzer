expedite : a system for encoded xml-processing as xml becomes an increasingly popular format for information-exchange , the efficient processing of broadcast xml-data on a constrained device (for example , a cell-phone or a pda) becomes a critical task . in this paper we present the expedite system : a new model of data-processing in an information-exchange environment , which `` migrates '' the power of the data-sending server to receivers for efficient processing . it consists of a simple and general encoding-scheme for servers , and streaming query-processing algorithms on encoded xml-stream for data receivers with constrained computing abilities . experiments show the impressive performance of expedite .
