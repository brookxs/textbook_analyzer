ranking-based processing of sql queries a growing number of applications are built on top of search-engines and issue complex structured-queries . this paper contributes a customisable ranking-based processing of such queries , specifically sql . similar to how term-based statistics are exploited by term-based-retrieval models , ranking-aware processing of sql queries exploits tuple-based statistics that are derived from sources or , more precisely , derived from the relations specified in the sql-query . to implement this ranking-based processing , we leverage psql , a probabilistic variant of sql , to facilitate probability-estimation and the generalisation of document-retrieval models to be used for tuple retrieval . the result is a general-purpose framework that can interpret any sql-query and then assign a probabilistic-retrieval-model to rank the results of that query . the evaluation on the imdb and monster benchmarks proves that the psql-based approach is applicable to (semi -) structured and unstructured-data and structured-queries .
