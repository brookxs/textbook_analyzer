isampling : framework for developing sampling-methods considering user 's interest sampling is one of fundamental techniques for data-preprocessing and mining . it helps to reduce computational costs and improve the mining quality . a sampling-method is typically developed independently for a specific problem and for a specific user 's interest , because it is hard to develop a method that is generalized across various user 's interests . an absence of general-framework for sampling makes it inefficient to develop or revise a sampling-method as user 's interest changes . this paper proposes a general-framework , isampling , which facilitates a user developing sampling-methods and easily modifying the user 's sampling interest in the method . in the framework , a user explicitly describes her sampling interest into a graph-model called interest-model . then , isampling automatically selects a sample set according to the model , which satisfies the user 's interest . in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework , we develop new trajectory sampling-methods using our framework ; trajectory sampling has been a challenging problem due to its high complexity of data and various user 's interests . we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by showing how easily trajectory samples of different interests can be generated within our framework .
