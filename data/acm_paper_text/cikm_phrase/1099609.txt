incremental-evaluation of a monotone xpath fragment this paper shows a scheme for incremental-evaluation of xpath-queries . here , we focus on a monotone fragment of xpath , i.e. , when a data is deleted from (or inserted to) the database , only deletion (insertion , resp .) may occur to query answers . for efficiently processing deletions , we store information on partial matchings , i.e. , which elements were participating in matchings for which query answers , and also store counters showing how many matchings each query answer had . we use the information on the partial matchings also for skipping a part of computation upon data insertion . we investigate properties of the xpath fragment in order to keep the amount of information we store as small as possible .
