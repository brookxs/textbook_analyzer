predicting user activity level in social-networks the study of users ' social-behaviors has gained much research attention since the advent of various social-media such as facebook , renren and twitter . a major kind of applications is to predict a user 's future activities based on his/her historical social behaviors . in this paper , we focus on a fundamental task : to predict a user 's future activity levels in a social-network , e.g. weekly activeness , active or inactive . this problem is closely related to social customer-relationship-management (social crm) . compared to traditional crm , the three properties : user diversity , social-influence , and dynamic nature of social-networks , raise new challenges and opportunities to social crm . firstly , the user diversity property implies that a global predictive-model may not be precise for all users . on the other hand , historical-data of individual users are too sparse to build precisely personalized models . secondly , the social-influence property suggests that relationships between users can be embedded to further boost prediction results on individual users . finally , the dynamical nature of social-networks means that users ' behaviors may keep changing over time . to address these challenges , we develop a personalized and social regularized time-decay model for user-activity level prediction . experiments on the social-media renren validate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared with some baselines including traditional supervised-learning methods and node classification-methods in social-networks .
