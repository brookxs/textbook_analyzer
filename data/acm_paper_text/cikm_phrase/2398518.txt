diversionary comments under political blog posts an important issue that has been neglected so far is the identification of diversionary comments . diversionary comments under political blog posts are defined as comments that deliberately twist the bloggers ' intention and divert the topic to another one . the purpose is to distract readers from the original topic and draw attention to a new topic . given that political-blogs have significant impact on the society , we believe it is imperative to identify such comments . we then categorize diversionary comments into 5 types , and propose an effective technique to rank comments in descending order of being diversionary . to the best of our knowledge , the problem of detecting diversionary comments has not been studied so far . our evaluation on 2,109 comments under 20 different blog posts from digg.com shows that the proposed method achieves the high mean-average-precision (map) of 92.6 % . sensitivity-analysis indicates that the effectiveness of the method is stable under different parameter-settings .
