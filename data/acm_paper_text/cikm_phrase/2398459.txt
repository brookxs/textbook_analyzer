joint relevance and answer-quality learning for question-routing in community qa community-question-answering (cqa) has become a popular service for users to ask and answer questions . in recent years , the efficiency of cqa service is hindered by a sharp increase of questions in the community . this paper is concerned with the problem of question-routing . question-routing in cqa aims to route new questions to the eligible answerers who can give high quality answers . however , the traditional methods suffer from the following two problems : (1) word mismatch between the new questions and the users ' answering history ; (2) high variance in perceived answer-quality . to solve the above two problems , this paper proposes a novel joint learning-method by taking both word mismatch and answer-quality into a unified-framework for question-routing . we conduct experiments on large-scale real-world data-set from yahoo!-answers . experimental-results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional query likelihood language-model (qllm) as well as state-of-the-art cluster-based-language-model (cblm) and category-sensitive query likelihood language-model (tcslm) .
