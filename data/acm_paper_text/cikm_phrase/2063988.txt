aweto : efficient incremental-update and querying in rdf-storage system with the fast growth of the knowledge-bases built over the-internet , storing and querying millions or billions of rdf-triples in a knowledge-base have attracted increasing research interests . although the latest rdf-storage systems achieve good querying-performance , few of them pay much attention to the characteristic of dynamic growth of the knowledge-base . in this paper , to consider the efficiency of both querying and incremental-update in rdf-data , we propose a hash-based two-tier rdf-storage system (abbr . to aweto) with new index architecture and query-execution engine . the performance of our system is systematically measured over two large-scale datesets . compared with the other three state-of-the-art rdf-storage systems , our system achieves the best incremental-update efficiency , meanwhile , the query-efficiency is competitive .
