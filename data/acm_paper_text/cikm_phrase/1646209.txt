magiccube : choosing the best snippet for each aspect of an entity wikis are currently used in business to provide knowledge-management-systems , especially for individual organizations . however , building wikis manually is a laborious and time-consuming work . to assist founding wikis , we propose a methodology in this paper to automatically select the best snippets for entities as their initial explanations . our method consists of two steps . first , we focus on extracting snippets from a given set of web-pages for each entity . starting from a seed sentence , a snippet grows up by adding the most relevant neighboring sentences into itself . the sentences are chosen by the snippet growth model , which employs a distance-function and an influence function to make decisions . secondly , we pick out the best snippet for each aspect of an entity . the combination of all the selected snippets serves as the primary description of the entity . we present three ever-increasing methods to handle selection-process . experimental-results based on a real-data set show that our proposed method works effectively in producing primary descriptions for entities such as employee names .
