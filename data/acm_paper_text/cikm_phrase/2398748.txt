primates : a privacy-management system for social-networks while online-social-networks (osn) present unprecedented opportunities for sharing information and multimedia-content among users , they raise major privacy-issues as users could often access personal or confidential data of other users . most social-networks provide some basic access-control-policies , which however seem to be very limited given the diversity of user-relationships in the current social-networks (e.g. friend , acquaintance , son) as well as the needs of social-network users who might want to express sophisticated access-control-policies (e.g. invite all children of my colleagues to my child 's birthday party) . in this demonstration proposal , we present primates a privacy-management system for social-networks . primates allows users to specify access-control rules for their resources and enforces access-control over all shared-resources . the set of users who are allowed to access a given resource is defined by a set of constraints on the paths connecting the owner of a resource to its requester in the social-graph . we demonstrate the accuracy of our access-control-model and the scalability of our system .
