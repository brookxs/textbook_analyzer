mapping adaptation actions for the automatic reconciliation of dynamic-ontologies the highly dynamic nature of domain-ontologies has a direct impact on semantic-mappings established between concepts from different ontologies . mappings must therefore be maintained according to ongoing ontology changes . since many software applications exploit mappings for managing-information and knowledge , it is important to define appropriate adaptation-strategies to apply to existing mappings in order to keep their validity over time . in this article , we propose a set of mapping adaptation actions and present how they are used to maintain mappings up-to-date based on ontology-change operations of different nature . we conduct an experimental-evaluation using life-sciences ontologies and mappings . we measure the evolution of mappings based on the proposed approach to mapping adaptation . the results confirm that mappings must be individually adapted according to the different types of ontology-change .
