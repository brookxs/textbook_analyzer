the anatomy of a click : modeling user behavior on web-information-systems the ultimate goal of information-retrieval science continues to be providing relevant-information to users while placing minimal cognitive-load on them . the retrieval and presentation of relevant-information (say , search-results) as well as any dynamic-system behavior (e.g. , search-engine re-ranking) depends acutely on estimating user-intent . hence , it is critical to use all the available information about user-behavior at any stage of a search-session to accurately infer the user-intent . however , the simplistic interfaces provided by search-engines in order to minimize the user cognitive effort , and intrinsic limits imposed by privacy-concerns , latency requirements , and other web instrumentation challenges , result in only a subset of user actions that are predictive of the search-intent being captured . in this paper , we present a dynamic-bayesian-network (dbn) that models user-interaction with general web-information-systems , taking into account both observed (clicks etc.) as well as hidden (result examinations etc.) user actions . our model goes beyond the ranked list information-access paradigm and gives a solution where arbitrary context-information can be incorporated in a principled fashion . to account for heterogeneity in user-behavior as well as information-access tasks , we further propose a bi-clustering algorithm that partitions users and tasks , and learns separate models for each bicluster . we instantiate this general dbn model for a typical static search-interface comprising of a single query box and a ranked list of search-results using a set of seven common user actions and various predictive state attributes . experimental-results on real-world web-search log-data indicate that one can obtain superior predictive performance on various session properties (such as click positions and reformulations) compared to simpler instantiations of the dbn .
