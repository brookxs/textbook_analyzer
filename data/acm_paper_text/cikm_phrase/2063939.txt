improving k-nearest-neighbors algorithms : practical application of dataset-analysis in the last years , recommender-systems have achieved a great popularity . many different techniques have been developed and applied to this field . however , in many cases the algorithms do not obtain the expected results . in particular , when the applied model does not fit the real-data the results are especially bad . this happens because many times models are directly applied to a domain without a previous analysis of the data . in this work we study the most popular datasets in the movie-recommendation domain , in order to understand how the users behave in this particular context . we have found some remarkable facts that question the utility of the similarity-measures traditionally used in k-nearest-neighbors (knn) algorithms . these findings can be useful in order to develop new algorithms . in particular , we modify traditional knn algorithms by introducing a new similarity-measure specially suited for sparse contexts , where users have rated very few items . our experiments show slight improvements in prediction-accuracy , which proves the importance of a thorough dataset-analysis as a previous step to any algorithm-development .
