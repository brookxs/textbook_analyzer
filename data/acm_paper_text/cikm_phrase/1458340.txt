table-summarization with the help of domain lattices table-summarization is necessary in various scenarios where it is hard to display a large table . it can benefit from knowledge about acceptable value clustering alternatives . in this paper , we formulate the problem of table-summarization with the help of domain-knowledge lattices . we provide the outline of a fuzzy mechanism to express alternative-clustering strategies . we further sketch a novel ranked-set-cover_based evaluation mechanism (rsc) to tackle with the inherent complexity .
