multi-information fusion for uncertain semantic-representations of videos concept-based semantic-video-retrieval (cbsvr) usually uses semantic-representations of videos to handle user 's retrieval requests . it is obvious that the accuracy of semantic-video-retrieval depends on results of concept detectors , but the detection results are usually imprecise and uncertain . in this paper , we propose a multi-information fusion approach (mif) which is dedicated to solving the problem of uncertain semantic-representations of videos for improving retrieval-accuracy . this approach is based on a novel two-phase framework that involves the inferring phase and the fusing phase . in the inferring phase , the most relevant concepts to the user 's query are chosen by exploring both contextual-correlation among concepts and temporal-correlation among shots . in the fusing phase , the inferred probabilities of the related concepts are fused together with the detection results via-minimization of potential-function to refine the detector prediction . experiments on the widely used trecvid datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively improve the accuracy of semantic-concept-detection .
