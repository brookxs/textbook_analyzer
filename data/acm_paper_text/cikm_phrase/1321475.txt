wikify ! : linking documents to encyclopedic-knowledge this paper introduces the use of wikipedia as a resource for automatic-keyword-extraction and word-sense-disambiguation , and shows how this online encyclopedia can be used to achieve state-of-the-art results on both these tasks . the paper also shows how the two methods can be combined into a system able to automatically enrich a text with links to encyclopedic-knowledge . given an input document , the system identifies the important concepts in the text and automatically links these concepts to the corresponding wikipedia pages . evaluations of the system show that the automatic annotations are reliable and hardly distinguishable from manual annotations .
