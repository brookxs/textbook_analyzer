retrievability : an evaluation-measure for higher-order information-access tasks evaluation in information-retrieval (ir) has long focused on effectiveness and efficiency . however , new and emerging access tasks now demand alternative evaluation-measures which go beyond this traditional view . a retrieval-system provides a means of gaining access to documents , therefore intuitively , our view of the collection is shaped by the retrieval-system . in this paper , we outline some emerging information-access related scenarios that require knowledge about how the retrieval-system affects the users ' ability to access information . this provides the motivation for the proposed evaluation-measures and methodology where the focus is on capturing the behavior of the system , in terms of how retrievable it makes individual documents within the collection . to demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods , we perform an extensive analysis on two trec collections showing how the measures can be applied to evaluate different information-access questions . for higher-order information-access tasks that are inherently dependent on retrievability , our novel evaluation-methodology emphasizes that effectiveness is an insufficient characterization of a retrieval-system . this paper provides the foundations for the evaluation of higher-order access related tasks .
