indexing-techniques for wireless-data-broadcast under data-clustering and scheduling this paper investigates power conserving indexing-techniques for data disseminated on a broadcast-channel . a hybrid-indexing method combining strengths of the signature and the index-tree techniques is presented . different from previous studies , our research takes into consideration two important data-organization factors , namely , clustering and scheduling . cost-models for index , signature and hybrid-methods are derived by taking into account various data organizations accommodating these two factors . based on our analytical comparisons , the signature and the hybrid indexing-techniques are the best choices for power conserving indexing of various data organizations on wireless-broadcast channels .
