query-sensitive-similarity-measures for the calculation of interdocument relationships the application of document-clustering to information-retrieval has been motivated by the potential effectiveness gains postulated by the cluster-hypothesis . the hypothesis states that relevant documents tend to be highly similar to each other , and therefore tend to appear in the same clusters . in this paper we propose that , for any given query , pairs of relevant documents will exhibit an inherent similarity which is dictated by the query itself . our research describes an attempt to devise means by which this similarity can be detected . we propose the use of query-sensitive-similarity-measures that bias interdocument relationships towards pairs of documents that jointly possess attributes that are expressed in a query . we experimentally tested query-sensitive measures against conventional ones that do not take the context of the query into account . we calculated interdocument relationships for varying numbers of top-ranked documents for five document-collections . our results show a consistent and significant increase in the number of relevant documents that become nearest neighbours of any given relevant-document when query-sensitive measures are used . these results suggest that the effectiveness of a cluster-based ir-system has the potential to increase through the use of query-sensitive-similarity-measures .
