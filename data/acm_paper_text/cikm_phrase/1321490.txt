expertise drift and query-expansion in expert-search pseudo-relevance-feedback , or query-expansion , has been shown to improve retrieval-performance in the adhoc retrieval-task . in such a scenario , a few top-ranked documents are assumed to be relevant , and these are then used to expand and refine the initial user-query , such that it retrieves a higher quality ranking of documents . however , there has been little work in applying query-expansion in the expert-search task . in this setting , query-expansion is applied by assuming a few top-ranked candidates have relevant expertise , and using these to expand the query . nevertheless , retrieval is not improved as expected using such an approach . we show that the success of the application of query-expansion is hindered by the presence of topic-drift within the profiles of experts that the system considers . in this work , we demonstrate how topic-drift occurs in the expert-profiles , and moreover , we propose three measures to predict the amount of drift occurring in an expert 's profile . finally , we suggest and evaluate ways of enhancing query-expansion in expert-search using our new insights . our results show that , once topic-drift has been anticipated , query-expansion can be successfully applied in a general manner in the expert-search task .
