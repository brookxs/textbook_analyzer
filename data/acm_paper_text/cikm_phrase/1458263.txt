pbfilter : indexing flash-resident data through partitioned summaries nand-flash has become the most popular persistent data storage medium for mobile and embedded-devices . the hardware characteristics of nand-flash (e.g. page granularity for read/write with a block-erase-before-rewrite constraint , limited number of erase cycles) preclude in-place updates . in this paper , we propose a new indexing-scheme , called pbfilter , designed from the outset to exploit the peculiarities of nand-flash .
