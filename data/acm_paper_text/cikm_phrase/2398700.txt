where do the query terms come from ? : an analysis of query-reformulation in collaborative-web-search this paper presents a user-study aiming to investigate the query-reformulation in collaborative-web-search . 7 pairs of participants were recruited and each pair worked as a team on two collaborative exploratory web-search tasks . through the log-analysis , we compared possible sources for participants to draw query terms from . the results show that both search and collaborative actions are possible resources for new query terms . traditional resources for query-expansion such as previous search histories and relevant documents are still important resources for new query terms . the content in chat and workspace generated by participants themselves seems more likely to be the resource for new query terms than that of their partners . task-types also affect the influences on query-reformulations . for the academic task , previously saved relevance documents are the most important resources for new query terms while chat histories are the most important resources for the leisure task .
