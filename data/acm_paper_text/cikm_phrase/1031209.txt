scalable sequential-pattern-mining for biological-sequences biosequences typically have a small alphabet , a long length , and patterns containing gaps (i.e. , `` do n't care '') of arbitrary size . mining frequent patterns in such sequences faces a different type of explosion than in transaction sequences primarily motivated in market-basket analysis . in this paper , we study how this explosion affects the classic sequential-pattern-mining , and present a scalable two-phase algorithm to deal with this new explosion . the <i> segment phase </i> first searches for short patterns containing no gaps , called <i> segments </i> . this phase is efficient . the <i> pattern phase </i> searches for long patterns containing multiple segments separated by variable-length gaps . this phase is time consuming . the purpose of two phases is to exploit the information obtained from the first phase to speed up the pattern-growth and matching and to prune the search-space in the second phase . we evaluate this approach on synthetic and real life data-sets .
