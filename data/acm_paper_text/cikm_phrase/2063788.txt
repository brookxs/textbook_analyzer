efficient methods for finding influential locations with adaptive grids given a set s of servers and a set c of clients , an optimal-location query returns a location where a new-server can attract the greatest number of clients . optimal-location queries are important in a lot of real-life applications , such as mobile-service planning or resource-distribution in an area . previous studies assume that a client always visits its nearest server , which is too strict to be true in reality . in this paper , we relax this assumption and propose a new model to tackle this problem . we further generalize the problem to finding top-k optimal locations . the main challenge is that , even the fastest approach in existing studies needs to take hours to answer an optimal-location query on a typical real-world dataset , which significantly limits the applications of the query . using our relaxed model , we design an efficient grid-based approximation-algorithm called film (fast influential-location miner) to the queries , which is orders of magnitude faster than the best-known previous work and the number of clients attracted by a new-server in the result location often exceeds 98 \ % of the optimal . the algorithm is extended to finding k influential locations . extensive experiments are conducted to show the efficiency-and-effectiveness of film on both real and synthetic datasets .
