towards optimum query-segmentation : in doubt without query-segmentation is the problem of identifying those keywords in a query , which together form compound concepts or phrases like `` new york times '' . such segments can help a search-engine to better interpret a user 's intents and to tailor the search-results more appropriately . our contributions to this problem are threefold . (1) we conduct the first large-scale-study of human segmentation behavior based on more than 500000 segmentations . (2) we show that the traditionally applied segmentation-accuracy measures are not appropriate for such large-scale corpora and introduce new , more robust measures . (3) we develop a new query-segmentation approach with the basic idea that , in cases of doubt , it is often better to (partially) leave queries without any segmentation . this new in-doubt-without approach chooses different segmentation strategies depending on query-types . a large-scale evaluation shows substantial improvement upon the-state-of-the-art in terms of segmentation-accuracy . to draw a complete picture , we also evaluate the impact of segmentation strategies on retrieval-performance in a trec setting . it turns out that more accurate segmentation not necessarily yields better retrieval-performance . based on this insight , we propose an in-doubt-without variant which achieves the best retrieval-performance despite leaving many queries unsegmented . but there is still room for improvement : the optimum segmentation strategy which always chooses the segmentation that maximizes retrieval-performance , significantly outperforms all other tested approaches .
