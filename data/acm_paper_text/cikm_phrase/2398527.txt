quality-models for microblog retrieval microblog services typically contain very short documents (e.g. , tweets) containing comments about the latest news and events . many of these documents are not informative or have very little content due to their personal and ephemeral nature . providing effective retrieval in a microblog service will require addressing the challenge of distinguishing the high-quality , informative documents from the others . recent work has focused on finding features that indicate the quality of microblog documents , but the impact these quality features on retrieval is not clear . in this paper , we suggest a low-cost quality-model using surrogate judgments based on user-behavior (i.e. , retweets) that can be collected automatically . we analyze the relationship between document informativeness and relevance-judgments for microblog retrieval . then we demonstrate that our behavior-based quality-metric has a high correlation with manual judgments . also , we perform experiments to study the impact of the quality-model on microblog retrieval . the results based on the trec microblog track show that the proposed quality-model , combined with a variety of retrieval-models , can improve retrieval-performance and is competitive with a model trained using manual relevance-judgments .
