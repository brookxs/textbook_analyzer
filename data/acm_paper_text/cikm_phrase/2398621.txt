maximizing revenue from strategic recommendations under decaying trust suppose your sole interest in recommending a product to me is to maximize the amount paid to you by the seller for a sequence of recommendations . how should you recommend optimally if i become more inclined to ignore you with each irrelevant recommendation you make ? finding an answer to this question is a key challenge in all forms of marketing that rely on and explore social-ties ; ranging from personal recommendations to viral-marketing . we prove that even if the recommendee regains her initial-trust on each successful recommendation , the expected revenue the recommender can make over an infinite period due to payments by the seller is bounded . this can only be overcome when the recommendee also incrementally regains trust during periods without any recommendation . here , we see a connection to `` banner-blindness , '' suggesting that showing fewer ads can lead to a higher long-term revenue .
