how about utilizing ordinal information from the distribution of unlabeled-data problems of ordinal-regression arise in many fields such as information-retrieval , data-mining and knowledge-management . in this paper , we consider ordinal-regression in a semi-supervised scenario , i.e. , we try to utilize the ordinal information from the distribution of unlabeled-data . semi-supervised ordinal-regression is more applicable than traditional supervised ordinal-regression , because nowadays labeled-data is expensive and time-consuming as it needs human labor , whereas a large amount of unlabeled-data are far accessible with the development of internet-technology . we construct a general semi-supervised ordinal-regression framework to formulate this problem . based on the framework , we then propose a semi-supervised ordinal-regression method called semi-supervised ordinal svm (sosvm) . additionally , in order to make our proposed method more applicable to problems with large scaled labeled-data , we put forward a kernel_based dual-coordinate-descent-algorithm to efficiently solve sosvm . both rigorous theoretical-analysis and promising experimental evaluations on real-world datasets show the great performance and remarkable efficiency of sosvm .
