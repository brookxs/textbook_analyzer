exploring the existing category-hierarchy to automatically label the newly-arising topics in cqa this work investigates selecting concise labels for the newly-arising topics in community question answer . previous methods of generating labels do not take the information of the existing category-hierarchy into consideration . the main motivation of our paper is to utilize this information into the label generation-process . we propose a general-framework to address this problem . firstly , we map the questions into wikipedia concept sets , which are more meaningful than terms . secondly , important concepts are identified to represent the main focus of the newly-arising topics . thirdly , candidate labels are extracted from wikipedia category graph . finally , candidate labels are filtered and reranked by combination of structure-information of existing category-hierarchy and wikipedia category graph . the experiments show that in our test-collections , about 80 % `` correct '' labels appear in the top ten labels recommended by our system .
