mining generalised disjunctive-association-rules this paper introduces generalised disjunctive-association-rules such as `` people who buy bread also buy butter jam '' , and `` people who buy either raincoats or umbrellas also buy flashlights '' . a generalised disjunctive association rule allows the disjunction of conjuncts , `` people who buy jackets also buy bow ties or neckties and tiepins '' . such rules capture contextual inter-relationships among items.given a context (antecedent) , there may be a large number of generalised disjunctive-association-rules that satisfy the minsupp and minconf constraints . it is computationally expensive to find all such rules . we present algorithm thrifty traverse which borrows concepts such as subsumption from propositional-logic to mine a subset of such rules in a computationally feasible way . we experimented with our algorithm on us census-data as well as transaction-data from a grocery superstore to demonstrate its computational-feasibility , utility and scalability .
