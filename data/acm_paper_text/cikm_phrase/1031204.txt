combining structural and citation-based evidence for text-classification this paper discusses how citation-based information and structural content (e.g. , title , abstract) can be combined to improve classification of text-documents into predefined categories . we evaluate different measures of similarity derived from the citation structure and the structural content of the collection , and determine how they can be fused to improve classification effectiveness . to discover the best fusion framework , we apply genetic-programming (gp) techniques . our empirical experiments using documents from the acm digital-library and the acm computing classification system show that we can discover similarity-functions that work better than using evidence in isolation and whose combined performance through a simple-majority-voting is comparable to that of support-vector-machine classifiers .
