a vertical distance-based-outlier-detection method with local pruning `` one person 's noise is another person 's signal '' . outlier-detection is used to clean up datasets and also to discover useful anomalies , such as criminal activities in electronic-commerce , computer intrusion attacks , terrorist threats , agricultural pest infestations , etc. . thus , outlier-detection is critically important in the information-based society . this paper focuses on finding outliers in large-datasets using distance-based methods . first , to speedup outlier detections , we revise knorr and ng 's distance-based-outlier definition ; second , a vertical-data-structure , instead of traditional horizontal structures , is adopted to facilitate efficient outlier-detection further . we tested our methods against national hockey league dataset and show an order of magnitude of speed improvement compared to the contemporary distance-based-outlier-detection approaches .
