a peer-selection algorithm for information-retrieval a novel method for creating collection summaries is developed , and a fully decentralized peer-selection algorithm is described . this algorithm finds the most promising peers for answering a given query . specifically , peers publish per-term synopses of their documents . the synopses of a peer for a given term are divided into score intervals and for each interval , a kmv (k minimal values) synopsis of its documents is created . the synopses are used to effectively rank peers by their relevance to a multi-term quer . the proposed approach is verified by experiments on a large real-world dataset . in particular , two collections were created from this dataset , each with a different number of peers . compared to the state-of-the-art approaches , the proposed method is effective and efficient even when documents are randomly distributed among peers
