dynamic versioning concurrency-control for index-based data-access in main-memory-database systems we present a concurrency-control scheme using dynamic versioning for index-based data-access in main-memory-database systems . this scheme enables read-only-transactions read correct version without holding any locks or latches , while update transactions only obtain a few locks or latches without deadlocks . efficient version-management is designed to support high concurrency level and low space-overhead . the interaction between dynamic versioning and indexing is considered so that all available versions can be accessed through indexing . experiment results show that dynamic versioning can improve the performance in concurrent environment significantly .
