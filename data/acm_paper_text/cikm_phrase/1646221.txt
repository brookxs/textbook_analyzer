building domain-oriented sentiment-lexicon by improved information-bottleneck this paper describes an adapted information-bottleneck approach for construction of domain-oriented sentiment-lexicon . the basic idea is to use three kinds of relationships (ww inter , wd inter and wd intra ,) to infer the semantic orientation of the out-of-domain words . the experimental-results demonstrate that proposed method could dramatically improve the accuracy of the baseline approach on the construction of out-of-domain sentiment-lexicon .
