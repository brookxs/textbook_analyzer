similarity-based-retrieval from sequence-databases using automata as queries similarity-based-retrieval from sequence-databases is of importance in many applications such as time-series , video and textual-databases . in this paper , automata_based formalisms are introduced for specifying queries over such databases . various measures defining the distance of a database sequence from an automaton are defined . efficient methods for similarity-based-retrieval are presented for each of the distance-measures . these methods answer nearest-neighbor-queries (i.e. retrieval of k closest subsequences) , or range-queries (i.e. , retrieval of all sequences with in a given distance) .
