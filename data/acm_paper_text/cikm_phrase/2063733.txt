scalable density-based subspace-clustering for knowledge-discovery in high-dimensional databases , subspace-clustering detects clusters in arbitrary subspace projections . scalability is a crucial issue , as the number of possible projections is exponential in the number of dimensions . we propose a scalable density-based subspace-clustering method that steers mining to few selected subspace clusters . our novel steering technique reduces subspace processing by identifying and clustering promising subspaces and their combinations directly . thereby , it narrows down the search-space while maintaining accuracy . thorough experiments on real and synthetic databases show that steering is efficient and scalable , with high quality results . for future work , our steering paradigm for density-based subspace-clustering opens research potential for speeding up other subspace-clustering approaches as well .
