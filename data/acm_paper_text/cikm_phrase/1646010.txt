on-line-index-maintenance using horizontal partitioning in this paper , we propose a new merge-based index-maintenance strategy for information-retrieval-systems . the new model is based on partitioning of the inverted-index across the terms in it . we exploit the query-log to partition the on-disk inverted-index into two types of sub-indexes . inverted-lists of the terms contained in the queries that are frequently posed to the information-retrieval-systems are kept in one partition , called frequent-term index and the other inverted-lists form another partition , called infrequent-term index . we use a lazy-merge strategy for maintaining infrequent-term sub-indexes , and an active merge strategy for maintaining frequent-term sub-indexes . the sub-indexes are also similarly split into frequent and in-frequent parts . experimental-results show that the proposed method improves both index-maintenance performance and query-performance compared to the existing merge-based strategies .
