privacy without noise this paper presents several results on statistical-database privacy . we first point out a serious vulnerability in a widely-accepted approach which perturbs query results with additive-noise . we then show that for sum-queries which aggregate across all records , when the dataset is sufficiently large , the inherent uncertainty associated with unknown quantities is enough to provide similar perturbation and the same privacy can be obtained without external noise . sum query is a surprisingly general primitive supporting a large number of data-mining-algorithms such as svd , pca , k - means , id3 , svm , em , and all the algorithms in the statistical-query model . we derive privacy conditions for sum-queries and provide the first mathematical proof for the intuition that aggregates across a large number of individuals is private using a widely accepted notion of privacy . we also show how the results can be used to construct simulatable-query-auditing algorithms with stronger privacy .
