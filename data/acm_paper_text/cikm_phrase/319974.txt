requirement-based data-cube-schema-design on-line-analytical-processing (olap) requires efficient processing of complex decision-support queries over very-large-databases . it is well accepted that pre-computed data-cubes can help reduce the response-time of such queries dramatically . a very important design issue of an efficient olap system is therefore the choice of the right data-cubes to materialize . we call this problem the data-cube-schema-design problem . in this paper we show that the problem of finding an optimal data-cube schema for an olap system with limited-memory is np-hard . as a more computationally efficient alternative , we propose a greedy-approximation algorithm cmp and its variants . algorithm cmp consists of two phases . in the first phase , an initial schema consisting of all the cubes required to efficiently answer the user queries is formed . in the second phase , cubes in the initial schema are selectively merged to satisfy the memory-constraint . we show that cmp is very effective in pruning the search-space for an optimal schema . this leads to a highly efficient-algorithm . we report the efficiency and the effectiveness of cmp via an empirical-study using the tpc-d benchmark . our results show that the data-cube schemas generated by cmp enable very efficient olap-query processing .
