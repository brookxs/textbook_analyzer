jasmine : a real-time local-event detection system based on geolocation information propagated to microblogs we propose a system for detecting local events in the real-world using geolocation information from microblog documents . a local event happens when people with a common purpose gather at the same time and place . to detect such an event , we identify a group of twitter documents describing the same theme that were generated within a short time and a small geographic area . timestamps and geotags are useful for finding such documents , but only 0.7 \ % of documents are geotagged and not sufficient for this purpose . therefore , we propose an automatic geotagging method that identifies the location of non-geotagged documents . our geotagging method successfully increased the number of geographic groups by about 115 times . for each group of documents , we extract co-occurring terms to identify its theme and determine whether it is about an event . we subjectively evaluated the precision of our detected local events and found that it had 25.5 \ % accuracy . these results demonstrate that our system can detect local events that are difficult to identify using existing event-detection methods . a user can interactively specify the size of a desired event by manipulating the parameters of date , area size , and the minimum number of twitter users associated with the location . our system allows users to enjoy the novel experience of finding a local event happening near their current location in real-time .
