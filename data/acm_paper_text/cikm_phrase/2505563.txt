an efficient mapreduce algorithm for counting triangles in a very-large graph triangle-counting problem is one of the fundamental problem in various domains . the problem can be utilized for computation of clustering-coefficient , transitivity , trianglular connectivity , trusses , etc. . the problem have been extensively studied in internal memory but the algorithms are not scalable for enormous graphs . in recent years , the mapreduce has emerged as a de facto standard framework for processing large-data through parallel-computing . a mapreduce algorithm was proposed for the problem based on graph-partitioning . however , the algorithm redundantly generates a large number of intermediate-data that cause network overload and prolong the processing-time . in this paper , we propose a new algorithm based on graph-partitioning with a novel idea of triangle classification to count the number of triangles in a graph . the algorithm substantially reduces the duplication by classifying triangles into three types and processing each triangle differently according to its type . in the experiments , we compare the proposed algorithm with recent existing algorithms using both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets that are composed of millions of nodes and billions of edges . the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in most cases . especially , for a twitter dataset , the proposed algorithm is more than twice as fast as existing mapreduce algorithms . moreover , the performance gap increases as the graph becomes larger and denser .
