a structure-oriented relevance-feedback method for xml-retrieval relevance-feedback (rf) is a technique allowing to enrich an initial query according to the user-feedback . the goal is to express more precisily the user 's needs . some open issues appear when considering semi-structured-documents like xml-documents . most of the rf approaches proposed in xml-retrieval are simple adaptations of traditional rf to the new granularity-of-information . they enrich queries by adding terms extracted from relevant elements instead of terms extracted from whole documents . in this paper we show how structural constraints can also be used in rf . we propose a new approach that is able to extend the initial query by adding one or more generative structures . this approach is applied to unstructured queries . experiments are carried out on inex collection and results show the interest of our method .
