strategies for minimising errors in hierarchical web categorisation on the web , browsing and searching categories is a popular method of finding documents . two well-known category-based search systems are the yahoo! ~ and dmoz hierarchies , which are maintained by experts who assign documents to categories . however , manual categorisation by experts is costly , subjective , and not scalable with the increasing volumes of data that must be processed . several methods have been investigated for effective automatic text categorisation . these include selection of categorisation methods , selection of pre-categorised training-samples , use of hierachies , and selection of document fragments or features . in this paper , we further investigate categorisation into web-hierarchies and the role of hierarchical-information in improving categorisation effectiveness . we introduce new strategies to reduce errors in hierarchical-categorisation . in particular , we propose novel techniques that shift the assignment into higher level categories when lower level assignment is uncertain . our results show that absolute error-rates can be reduced by over 2 \ % .
