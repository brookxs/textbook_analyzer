a tool for automated-evaluation of algorithms testing algorithms and systems involves trying different sets of parameter-values on different domains or data-sets . even for a moderate number of parameters and domains the number of possible experiments can get very-large due to the combinatorial explosion . evaluating the outcome of these experiments requires comparing the results , which is often done by writing a script or inspecting the result files manually . for a new algorithm or version , the work has to be done over again . with hundreds , thousands , or even more possible experiments , both the preparation and the evaluation can become complex and tedious . in this demonstrator we present a software-tool , called et , for evaluating the parameters of an algorithm or system , either automatically or controlled by the user . it allows to launch large numbers of experiments in just a few clicks , visually explore the results and analyze the performance of the algorithm .
