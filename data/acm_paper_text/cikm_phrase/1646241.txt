the effect of negation on sentiment-analysis and retrieval-effectiveness we investigate the problem of determining the polarity of sentiments when one or more occurrences of a negation term such as `` not '' appear in a sentence . the concept of the scope of a negation term is introduced . by using a parse-tree and typed dependencies generated by a parser and special rules proposed by us , we provide a procedure to identify the scope of each negation term . experimental-results show that the identification of the scope-of-negation improves both the accuracy of sentiment-analysis and the retrieval-effectiveness of opinion-retrieval .
