twitter hyperlink recommendation with user-tweet-hyperlink three-way clustering twitter , the most famous micro-blogging service and online-social-network , collects millions of tweets every day . due to the length limitation , users usually need to explore other ways to enrich the content of their tweets . some studies have provided findings to suggest that users can benefit from added hyperlinks in tweets . in this paper , we focus on the hyperlinks in twitter and propose a new application , called hyperlink recommendation in twitter . we expect that the recommended hyperlinks can be used to enrich the information of user tweets . a three-way tensor is used to model the user-tweet-hyperlink collaborative relations . two tensor-based clustering approaches , tensor decomposition-based clustering (tdc) and tensor approximation-based clustering (tac) are developed to group the users , tweets and hyperlinks with similar interests , or similar contexts . recommendation is then made based on the reconstructed tensor using cluster information . the evaluation results in terms of mean-absolute-error (mae) shows the advantages of both the tdc and tac approaches over a baseline recommendation approach , i.e. , memory-based collaborative-filtering . comparatively , the tac approach achieves better performance than the tdc approach .
