labeling by landscaping : classifying tokens in context by pruning and decorating trees state-of-the-art approaches to token labeling within text-documents typically cast the problem either as a classification-task , without using complex structural-characteristics of the input , or as a sequential labeling task , carried out by a conditional-random-field (crf) classifier . here we explore principled ways for structure to be brought to bear on the task . in line with recent trends in statistical-learning of structured natural-language-input , we use a support-vector-machine (svm) classification framework deploying tree-kernels . we then propose tree transformations and decorations , as a methodology for modeling complex linguistic-phenomena in highly multi-dimensional feature spaces . we develop a general purpose tree engineering framework , which enables us to transcend the typically complex and laborious process of feature-engineering . we build kernel_based classifiers for two token labeling tasks : fine-grained event-recognition , and lexical answer-type detection in questions . for both , we show that in comparison with a corresponding linear-kernel svm , our method of using tree-kernels improves recognition , thanks to appropriately engineering tree-structures for use by the tree kernel . we also observe significant improvements when comparing with a crf-based realization of structured-prediction , itself performing at levels comparable to state-of-the-art .
