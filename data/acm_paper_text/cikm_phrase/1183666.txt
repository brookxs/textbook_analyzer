in search of meaning for time-series subsequence clustering : matching-algorithms based on a new distance-measure recent papers have claimed that the result of k-means-clustering for time-series subsequences (sts clustering) is independent of the time-series that created it . our paper revisits this claim . in particular , we consider the following question : given several time-series sequences and a set of sts cluster centroids from one of them (generated by the k-means-algorithm) , is it possible to reliably determine which of the sequences produced these cluster centroids ? while recent results suggest that the answer should be no , we answer this question in the affirmative . we present cluster-shape-distance , an alternate distance-measure for time-series subsequence clusters , based on cluster shapes . given a set of clusters , its shape is the sorted list of the pairwise euclidean distances between their centroids . we then present two algorithms based on this distance-measure , which match a set of sts cluster centroids with the time-series that produced it . while the first algorithm creates dqg reuse this term more smaller `` fingerprints '' for the sequences , the second is more accurate . in our experiments with a dataset of 10 sequences , it produced a correct match 100 \ % of the time.furthermore , we offer an analysis that explains why our cluster-shape-distance provides a reliable way to match sts clusters to the original sequences , whereas cluster set-distance fails to do so . our work establishes for the first time a strong relation between the result of k-means sts clustering and the time-series sequence that created it , despite earlier predictions that this is not possible .
