a novel optimization approach to efficiently process aggregate-similarity-queries in metric-access-methods a similarity-query considers an element as the query center and searches a dataset to find either the elements far up to a bounding radius or the k nearest ones from the query center . several algorithms have been developed to efficiently execute similarity-queries . however , there are queries that require more than one center , which we call aggregate-similarity-queries . such queries appear when the user gives multiple desirable examples , and requests data elements that are similar to all of the examples , as in the case of applying relevance-feedback . here we give the first algorithms that can handle aggregate-similarity-queries on metric-access-methods (mam) such as the m-tree and slim-tree . our method , which we call metric aggregate-similarity-search (mass) has the following properties : (a) it requires only the triangle-inequality property ; (b) it guarantees no false-dismissals , as we prove that it lower-bounds the aggregate distance scores ; (c) it can work with any mam ; (d) it can handle any number of query centers , which are either scattered all over the space or concentrated on a restricted region . experiments on both real and synthetic-data show that our method scales on both the number of elements and , if the dataset is in a spatial domain , also on its dimensionality . moreover , it achieves better results than previous related methods .
