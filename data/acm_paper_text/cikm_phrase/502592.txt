evaluating document-clustering for interactive-information-retrieval we consider the problem of organizing and browsing the top ranked portion of the documents returned by an information-retrieval-system . we study the effectiveness of a document-organization in helping a user to locate the relevant material among the retrieved documents as quickly as possible . in this context we examine a set of clustering-algorithms and experimentally show that a clustering of the retrieved documents can be significantly more effective than traditional ranked list approach . we also show that the clustering approach can be as effective as the interactive-relevance-feedback based on query-expansion while retaining an important advantage -- it provides the user with a valuable sense-of-control over the feedback process .
