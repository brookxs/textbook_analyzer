exploiting concept-hierarchy for result-diversification the goal of result-diversification is to maximize the coverage of query-subtopics while minimizing the redundancy in the search-results . intuitively , it is more desirable for a diversification system to cover independent subtopics since it would retrieve sets of non-overlapped relevant documents , which leads to less redundancy in the search-results . unfortunately , existing diversification methods assume that query-subtopics are independent and ignore their relations in the diversification process . to overcome this limitation , we propose to exploit concept-hierarchies to extract query-subtopics and infer their relations . we then apply axiomatic approaches to derive a structural diversification method that can leverage the subtopic relations in result-diversification . experimental-results over an enterprise collection show that the relations among query-subtopics are useful to improve the diversification performance .
