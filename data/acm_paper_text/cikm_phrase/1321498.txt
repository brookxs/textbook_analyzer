a two-stage approach to domain-adaptation for statistical-classifiers in this paper , we consider the problem of adapting statistical-classifiers trained from some source domains where labeled examples are available to a target-domain where no labeled example is available . one characteristic of such a domain-adaptation problem is that the examples in the source domains and the target-domain are known to follow different distributions . thus a regular classification-method would tend to overfit the source domains . we present a two-stage approach to domain-adaptation , where at the first < generalization stage , we look for a set-of-features generalizable across domains , and at the second adaptation stage , we pick up useful features specific to the target-domain . observing that the exact objective-function is hard to optimize , we then propose a number of heuristics to approximately achieve the goal of generalization and adaptation . our experiments on gene-name-recognition using a real-data set show the effectiveness of our general-framework and the heuristics .
