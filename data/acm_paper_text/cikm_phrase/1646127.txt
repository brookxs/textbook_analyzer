predicting the conversion probability for items on c2c ecommerce sites online ecommerce has been booming for a decade . for instance , as the largest online c2c marketplace (ebay) , millions of new items are listed daily . due to the overwhelming number of items , the process of finding the right items to buy is sometimes daunting . in order to address this problem , this paper describes the idea of predicting the probability that a newly listed item will be sold successfully . and adjust the item exposure chances proportional according to their conversion possibility . hence , by ranking higher items that users are likely to buy , the chance that users make the purchases could be increased as well as their user-satisfaction . for catalog products that have been listed repeatedly , this probability can be measured empirically . however , on c2c sites like ebay , lots of items are not product-based . they are unique , and from different sellers . therefore , in order to predict whether a new listing will be sold , we collect a large-scale item set as the training-data , and a set-of-features were used to model the average buyer shopping decision on c2c sites . experimental-results verified our system 's feasibility and effectiveness .
