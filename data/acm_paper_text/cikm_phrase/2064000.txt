domain-customization for aspect-oriented opinion-analysis with multi-level latent sentiment clues aspect-oriented opinion-mining detects the reviewers ' sentiment-orientation (e.g. positive , negative or neutral) towards different product-features . domain-customization is a big challenge for opinion-mining due to the accuracy loss across domains . in this paper , we show our experiences and lessons-learned in the domain-customization for the aspect-oriented opinion-analysis system opinionit . we present a customization method for sentiment-classification with multi-level latent sentiment clues . we first construct latent-semantic-association model to capture latent association among product-features from the unlabeled-corpus . meanwhile , we present an unsupervised-method to effectively extract various domain-specific sentiment clues from the unlabeled-corpus . in the customization , we tune the sentiment classifier on the labeled source-domain data by incorporating the multi-level latent sentiment clues (e.g. latent association among product-features , domain-specific and generic sentiment clues) . experimental-results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the accuracy loss of sentiment-classification without any labeled target-domain data .
