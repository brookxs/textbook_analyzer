characterizing and predicting search-engine-switching behavior search-engine-switching describes the voluntarily transition from one web-search-engine to another . in this paper we present a study of search-engine-switching behavior that combines large-scale log-based analysis and survey-data . we characterize aspects of switching-behavior , and develop and evaluate predictive-models of switching-behavior using features of the active query , the current session , and user-search history . our findings provide insight into the decision-making-processes of search-engine users and demonstrate the relationship between switching and factors such as dissatisfaction with the quality of the results , the desire for broader topic-coverage or verification of encountered-information , and user-preferences . the findings also reveal sufficient consistency in users ' search-behavior prior to engine switching to afford accurate prediction of switching events . predictive-models may be useful for search-engines who may want to modify the search experience if they can accurately anticipate a switch .
