kore : keyphrase overlap relatedness for entity-disambiguation measuring the semantic relatedness between two entities is the basis for numerous tasks in ir , nlp , and web-based knowledge extraction . this paper focuses on disambiguating names in a web or text-document by jointly mapping all names onto semantically related entities registered in a knowledge-base . to this end , we have developed a novel notion of semantic-relatedness between two entities represented as sets of weighted (multi-word) keyphrases , with consideration of partially overlapping phrases . this measure improves the quality of prior link-based models , and also eliminates the need for (usually wikipedia-centric) explicit interlinkage between entities . thus , our method is more versatile and can cope with long-tail and newly emerging entities that have few or no links associated with them . for efficiency , we have developed approximation techniques based on min-hash sketches and locality-sensitive-hashing . our experiments on semantic-relatedness and on named-entity-disambiguation demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines .
