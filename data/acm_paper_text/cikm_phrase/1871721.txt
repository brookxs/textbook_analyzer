fast dimension-reduction for document-classification based on imprecise spectrum-analysis this paper proposes an algorithm called imprecise spectrum-analysis (isa) to carry out fast dimension-reduction for document-classification . isa is designed based on the one-sided jacobi method for singular-value-decomposition (svd) . to speedup dimension-reduction , it simplifies the orthogonalization process of jacobi computation and introduces a new mapping formula for transforming original document-term vectors . to improve classification-accuracy using isa , a feature-selection-method is further developed to make inter-class feature-vectors more orthogonal in building the initial weighted term-document-matrix . our experimental-results show that isa is extremely fast in handling large term-document matrices and delivers better or competitive classification-accuracy compared to svd-based lsi .
