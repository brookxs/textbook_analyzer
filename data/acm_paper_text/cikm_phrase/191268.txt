quantitative-evaluation of a transaction facility for knowledge-base management system large knowledge-bases that are intended for applications such as cad , corporate repositories or process-control will have to be shared by multiple-users . for these systems to scale up , to give acceptable performance and to exhibit consistent behavior , it is mandatory to synchronize user transactions using a concurrency-control-algorithm . in this paper , we examine a novel concurrency-control policy called dynamic directed-graph (or ddg) policy that effectively exploits the rich semantic-structure of a knowledge-base . our analysis is carried out in the context of a real knowledge-based-system application from which knowledge-base structure and workload parameters are computed . these serve as a basis for studying the implementation alternatives that arise as a result of knowledge-base characteristics . the implementation alternatives that we consider include selection of portions of the knowledge-base structure to be exploited for concurrency-control , and also the dependence of concurrency on the traversal-strategy used to search through the knowledge-base . we analyze the effects of various workload parameters and conclude that the ddg policy improves substantially the response-time for short transactions when there is heavy data-contention .
