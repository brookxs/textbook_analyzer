social-recommendation across multiple relational domains social-networks enable users to create different types of personal items . in dealing with serious information-overload , the major problems of social-recommendation are sparsity and cold-start . in existing approaches , relational and heterogeneous-domains can not be effectively utilized for social-recommendation , which brings a challenge to model users and multiple-types of items together on social-networks . in this paper , we consider how to represent social-networks with multiple relational domains and alleviate the major problems in an individual domain by transferring knowledge from other domains . we propose a novel hybrid random walk (hrw) , which can integrate multiple heterogeneous domains including directed/undirected links , signed/unsigned links and within-domain/cross-domain links into a star-structured hybrid graph with user graph at the center . we perform random-walk until convergence and use the steady-state distribution for recommendation . we conduct experiments on a real social-network dataset and show that our method can significantly outperform existing social-recommendation approaches .
