efficiently encoding term co-occurrences in inverted-indexes precomputation of common term co-occurrences has been successfully applied to improve query-performance in large-scale search-engines based on inverted-indexes . the results of such precomputations are traditionally stored as additional posting lists in the index . during query-evaluation , these precomputed lists are used to reduce the number of query terms , as the results for multiple terms can be accessed through a single precomputed list . in this paper , we expand this paradigm by considering an alternative method for storing term co-occurrences in inverted-indexes . for a selected set of terms in the index , we store bitmaps that encode term co-occurrences . a bitmap of size k for term t augments each posting to store the co-occurrences of t with k other terms , across every document in the index . at query-evaluation , size k bitmaps can be used to answer queries that involve any of the 2 ^ k combinations of the additional terms . in contrast , a precomputed list , although typically shorter , can only be used to evaluate queries containing all of its terms . we evaluate the bitmaps technique we propose , and the baseline of adding precomputed posting lists and show that they are complementary , as they capture different aspects of the query-evaluation cost . we perform an experimental-evaluation on the trec wt10g corpus and show that a hybrid strategy combining both methods significantly lowers the cost-of-query evaluation compared to each method separately .
