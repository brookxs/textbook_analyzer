visual appearance of display-ads and its effect on click-through-rate one of the most important categories of online-advertising is display-advertising which provides publishers with significant revenue . similar to other categories , the main goal in display-advertising is to maximize user response rate for advertising campaigns , such as click-through rates (ctr) or conversion rates . previous studies have tried to optimize these parameters using objectives such as behavioral-targeting . however , there is no published work so far to address the effect of the visual appearance of ads (creatives) on user response rate via a systematic data-driven-approach . in this paper , we quantitatively study the relationship between the visual appearance and performance of creatives using large-scale-data in the world 's largest display-ads exchange system , rightmedia . we designed a set of 43 visual-features , some of which are novel and others are inspired by related work . we extracted these features from real creatives served on rightmedia . we also designed and conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of visual-features for ctr-prediction , ranking and performance classification . based on the evaluation results , we selected a subset of features that have the highest impact on ctr . we believe that the findings presented in this paper will be very useful for the online advertising industry in designing high-performance creatives . it also provides the research-community with the first ever data-set , initial insights into visual appearance 's effect on user response propensity , and evaluation benchmarks for further study .
