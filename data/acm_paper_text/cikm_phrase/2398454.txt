graft : an approximate graphlet counting algorithm for large-graph analysis graphlet frequency-distribution (gfd) is an analysis-tool for understanding the variance of local-structure in a graph . many recent works use gfd for comparing , and characterizing real-life networks . however , the main bottleneck for graph-analysis using gfd is the excessive computation-cost for obtaining the frequency of each of the graphlets in a large-network . to overcome this , we propose a simple , yet powerful algorithm , called graft , that obtains the approximate graphlet frequency for all graphlets that have upto 5 vertices . comparing to an exact counting algorithm , our algorithm achieves a speedup factor between 10 and 100 for a negligible counting error , which is , on average , less than 5 % ; for example , exact graphlet counting for ca-astroph takes approximately 3 days ; but , graft runs for 45 minutes to perform the same task with a counting accuracy of 95.6 % .
