rank-aware-clustering of structured-datasets in online applications such as yahoo! personals and yahoo! real-estate users define structured profiles in order to find potentially interesting matches . typically , profiles are evaluated against large-datasets and produce thousands of matches . in addition to filtering , users also specify ranking in their profile , and matches are returned in a ranked list . top results in a list are typically homogeneous , which hinders data-exploration . for example , a user looking for 1 - or 2-bedroom apartments sorted by price will see a large number of cheap 1-bedrooms in undesirable neighborhoods before seeing a different apartment . an alternative to ranking is to group matches on common attribute values , e.g. , cheap 1-bedrooms in good neighborhoods , 2-bedrooms with 2 baths , and choose groups in relationship with ranking . in this paper , we present a novel paradigm of rank-aware-clustering , and demonstrate its effectiveness on a large dataset from yahoo! personals , a leading online-dating site .
