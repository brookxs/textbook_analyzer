information-complete and redundancy-free keyword-search over large-data graphs keyword-search over graphs has a wide array of applications in querying structured , semi-structured and unstructured-data . existing models typically use minimal trees or bounded subgraphs as query answers . while such models emphasize relevancy , they would suffer from incompleteness of information and redundancy among answers , making it difficult for users to effectively explore query answers . to overcome these drawbacks , we propose a novel cluster-based model , where query answers are relevancy-connected clusters . a cluster is a subgraph induced from a maximal set of relevancy-connected nodes . such clusters are coherent and relevant , yet complete and redundancy free . they can be of arbitrary shape in contrast to the sphere-shaped bounded subgraphs in existing models . we also propose an efficient search algorithm and a corresponding graph-index for large , disk-resident data-graphs .
