maximal termsets as a query-structuring mechanism search-engines process queries conjunctively to restrict the size of the answer set . further , it is not rare to observe a mismatch between the vocabulary used in the text of web-pages and the terms used to compose the-web queries . the combination of these two features might lead to irrelevant query results , particularly in the case of more specific queries composed of three or more terms . to deal with this problem we propose a new technique for automatically structuring web-queries as a set of smaller subqueries . to select representative subqueries we use information on their distributions in the document-collection . this can be adequately modeled using the concept of maximal termsets derived from the formalism of association-rules theory . experimentation shows that our technique leads to improved results . for the trec-8 test-collection , for instance , our technique led to gains in average-precision of roughly 28 \ % with regard to a bm25 ranking formula .
