probabilistic latent preference analysis for collaborative-filtering a central goal of collaborative-filtering (cf) is to rank items by their utilities with respect to individual users in order to make personalized recommendations . traditionally , this is often formulated as a rating-prediction problem . however , it is more desirable for cf algorithms to address the ranking problem directly without going through an extra rating-prediction step . in this paper , we propose the probabilistic latent preference analysis (plpa) model for ranking-predictions by directly modeling-user-preferences with respect to a set of items rather than the rating scores on individual items . from a user 's observed ratings , we extract his preferences in the form of pairwise-comparisons of items which are modeled by a mixture-distribution based on bradley-terry model . an em-algorithm for fitting the corresponding latent-class-model as well as a method for predicting the optimal-ranking are described . experimental-results on real-world data-sets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over several existing cf algorithms based on rating predictions in terms of ranking-performance measure ndcg .
