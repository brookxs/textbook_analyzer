local anomaly descriptor : a robust unsupervised-algorithm for anomaly-detection based on diffusion space current popular anomaly-detection algorithms are capable of detecting global anomalies but oftentimes fail to distinguish local anomalies from normal instances . this paper aims to improve unsupervised-anomaly-detection via the exploration of physics-based diffusion space . building upon the embedding manifold derived from diffusion-maps , we devise local anomaly descriptor (lad) whose originality results from faithfully preserving intrinsic and informative density-relevant neighborhood information . this robust and effective algorithm is designed with a weighted umbrella laplacian operator to bridge global and local properties . to further enhance the efficacy of our proposed algorithm , we explore the utility of anisotropic gaussian kernel (agk) which can offer better manifold-aware affinity information . comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and uci real datasets verify that our lad outperforms existing anomaly-detection algorithms .
