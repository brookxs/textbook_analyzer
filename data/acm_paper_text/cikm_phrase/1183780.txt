query-specific-clustering of search-results based on document-context similarity-scores this paper presents a pilot-study of query-specific-clustering that uses our novel document-context_based similarity-scores as compared with document-similarity scores . clustering is applied to the top 1000 retrieved documents for a given query . clustering effectiveness is evaluated based on the mk1 score for trec-2 , trec-6 and trec-7 test-collections . encouraging results were obtained whereby document-context clustering produces better mk1 scores than document-clustering with a 95 \ % confidence level if precision-and-recall are equally important .
