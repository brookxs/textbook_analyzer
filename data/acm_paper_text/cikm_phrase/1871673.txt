community-based topic-modeling for social-tagging exploring community-is fundamental for uncovering the connections between structure-and-function of complex-networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology . in this paper , we propose a ttr-lda-community model which combines the latent-dirichlet-allocation model (lda) and the girvan-newman community-detection algorithm with an inference-mechanism . the model is then applied to data from delicious , a popular social-tagging-system , over the time period of 2005-2008 . our results show that 1) users in the same community tend to be interested in similar set of topics in all time periods ; and 2) topics may divide into several sub-topics and scatter into different communities over time . we evaluate the effectiveness of our model and show that the ttr-lda-community model is meaningful for understanding communities and outperforms ttr-lda and lda models in tag-prediction .
