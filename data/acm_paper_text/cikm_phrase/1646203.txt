using negative-voting to diversify answers in non-factoid-question-answering we propose a ranking-model to diversify answers of non-factoid questions based on an inverse notion of graph-connectivity . by representing a collection of candidate answers as a graph , we posit that novelty , a measure of diversity , is inversely proportional to answer vertices ' connectivity . hence , unlike the typical graph-ranking models , which score vertices based on the degree of connectedness , our method assigns a penalty score for a candidate-answer if it is strongly connected to other answers . that is , any redundant answers , indicated by a higher inter-sentence-similarity , will be ranked lower than those with lower inter-sentence-similarity . at the end of the ranking iterations , many redundant answers will be moved toward the bottom on the ranked list . the experimental-results show that our method helps diversify answer coverage of non-factoid questions according to f-scores from nugget pyramid-evaluation .
