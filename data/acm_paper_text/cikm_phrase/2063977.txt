pcmlogging : reducing transaction-logging overhead with pcm phase changing memory (pcm) , as one of the most promising next-generation memory-technologies , offers various attractive properties such as non-volatility , bit-alterability , and low idle-energy consumption . in this paper , we present pcmlogging , a novel logging scheme that exploits pcm devices for both data buffering and transaction-logging in disk-based databases . different from the traditional approach where buffered updates and transaction-logs are completely separated , they are integrated in the new logging scheme . our preliminary experiments show an up to 40 \ % improvement of pcmlogging in disk-i/o performance in comparison with a basic buffering and logging scheme .
