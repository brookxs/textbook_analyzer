a syntactic-approach for searching similarities within sentences textual data is the main electronic-form of knowledge-representation . sentences , meant as logic units of meaningful word-sequences , can be considered its backbone . in this paper , we propose a solution based on a purely syntactic-approach for searching similarities within sentences , named approximate sub 2 sequence-matching . this process being very time consuming , efficiency in retrieving the most similar parts available in large repositories of textual data is ensured by making use of new filtering techniques . as far as the design of the system is concerned , we chose a solution that allows us to deploy approximate sub 2 sequence-matching without changing the underlying database .
