automatic web data-extraction using tree-alignment this paper investigates the automatic-extraction of data from forums , blogs and news web sites . web-pages are increasingly dynamically generated using a common template populated with data from databases . this paper proposes a novel method that uses tree-alignment to automatically extract data from these types of web-pages . a new tree-alignment algorithm is presented for determining the optimal-matching structure of the input web-pages . based on the alignment , the trees are merged into one union tree whose nodes record statistical-information obtained from multiple web-pages . a heuristic-method is employed for determining the most probable content block and the alignment-algorithm detects repeating-patterns on the union tree . a wrapper built on the most probable content block and the repeating-patterns extracts data from web-pages . experimental-results show that the method achieves high extraction accuracy and has steady performance .
