compact full-text-indexing of versioned document-collections we study the problem of creating highly compressed full-text index-structures for versioned document-collections , that is , collections that contain multiple versions of each document . important examples of such collections are wikipedia or the-web page archive maintained by the-internet archive . a straightforward indexing-approach would simply treat each document version as a separate document , such that index-size scales linearly with the number of versions . however , several authors have recently studied approaches that exploit the significant similarities between different versions of the same document to obtain much smaller index-sizes . in this paper , we propose new techniques for organizing and compressing inverted-index structures for such collections . we also perform a detailed experimental-comparison of new techniques and the existing techniques in the literature . our results on an archive of the english version of wikipedia , and on a subset of the-internet archive collection , show significant benefits over previous approaches .
