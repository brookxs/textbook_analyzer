adding numbers to text-classification many real-world-problems involve a combination of both text - and numerical-valued features . for example , in email-classification , it is possible to use instance representations that consider not only the text of each message , but also numerical-valued features such as the length of the message or the time of day at which it was sent . text-classification methods have thus far not easily incorporated numerical-features . in earlier work we described an approach for converting numerical-features into bags of tokens so that text-classification methods can be applied to numerical-classification problems , and showed that the resulting learning-methods are competitive with traditional numerical-classification methods . in this paper we use this as a way to learn on problems that involve a combination of text and numbers . we show that the results outperform competing methods . further , we show that selecting a best classification-method using text-only features and then adding numerical-features to the problem (as might happen if numerical-features are only later added to a pre existing text-classification problem) gives performance that rivals a more time-consuming approach of evaluating all classification-methods using the full set of both text and numerical-features .
