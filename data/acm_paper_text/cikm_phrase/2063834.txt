fast fully dynamic landmark-based estimation of shortest-path distances in very-large-graphs computing the shortest-path between a pair of vertices in a graph is a fundamental primitive in graph algorithmics . classical exact-methods for this problem do not scale up to contemporary , rapidly evolving social networks with hundreds of millions of users and billions of connections . a number of approximate-methods have been proposed , including several landmark-based methods that have been shown to scale up to very-large-graphs with acceptable accuracy . this paper presents two improvements to existing landmark-based shortest-path estimation-methods . the first improvement relates to the use of shortest-path trees (spts) . together with appropriate short-cutting heuristics , the use of spts allows to achieve higher accuracy with acceptable time and memory overhead . furthermore , spts can be maintained incrementally under edge insertions and deletions , which allows for a fully-dynamic algorithm . the second improvement is a new landmark-selection strategy that seeks to maximize the coverage of all shortest-paths by the selected landmarks . the improved method is evaluated on the dblp , orkut , twitter and skype social-networks .
