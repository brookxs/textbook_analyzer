probabilistic correlation-based similarity-measure of unstructured records computing the similarity between unstructured records is a fundamental function in multiple-applications . approximate-string-matching and full-text-retrieval techniques do not show the best performance when applied directly , since the information are limited in unstructured records of short record length . in this paper , we propose a novel probabilistic correlation-based similarity-measure . rather than simply conducting the exact-matching tokens of two records , our similarity-evaluation enriches the information of records by considering the correlations of tokens . we define the probabilistic-correlation between tokens as the probability that these tokens appear in the same records . then we compute the weight of tokens and discover the correlations of records based on the probabilistic correlations of tokens . finally , we present extensive experimental-results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .
