locality-sensitive-hashing for scalable structural classification-and-clustering of web-documents web-content-management systems as well as web front-ends to databases usually use mechanisms based on homogeneous templates for generating and populating html-documents containing structured , semi-structured or plain-text data . wrapper_based information-extraction techniques leverage such templates as an essential cornerstone of their functionality but rely heavily on the availability of proper training-documents based on the specific template . thus , structural classification and structural-clustering of web-documents is an important contributing factor to the success of those methods . we introduce a novel technique to support these two tasks : template fingerprints . template fingerprints are locality-sensitive-hash values in the form of short sequences of characters which effectively represent the underlying template of a web-document . small changes in the document structure , as they may occur in template_based documents , lead to no or only minor variations in the corresponding fingerprint . based on the fingerprints we introduce a scalable index-structure and algorithm for large-collections of web-documents , which can retrieve structurally similar documents efficiently . the effectiveness of our approach is empirically validated in a classification-task on a data-set of 13,237 documents based on 50 templates from different domains . the general efficiency and scalability is evaluated in a clustering task on a data-set retrieved from the open-directory-project comprising more than 3.6 million web-documents . for both tasks , our template fingerprint approach provides results of high quality and demonstrates a linear runtime of o (n) w.r.t. the number of documents .
