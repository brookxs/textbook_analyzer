generating advertising keywords from video-content with the proliferation of online-distribution methods for videos , content owners require easier and more effective methods for monetization through advertising . matching advertisements with related-content has a significant impact on the effectiveness of the ads , but current methods for selecting relevant advertising keywords for videos are limited by reliance on manually supplied metadata . in this paper we study the feasibility of using text available from video-content to obtain high quality keywords suitable for matching advertisements . in particular , we tap into three sources of text for ad keyword-generation : production scripts , closed captioning tracks , and speech-to-text transcripts . we address several challenges associated with using such data . to overcome the high error-rates prevalent in automatic-speech-recognition and the lack of an explicit structure to provide hints about which keywords are most relevant , we use statistical and generative methods to identify dominant terms in the source-text . to overcome the sparsity of the data and resulting vocabulary mismatches between source-text and the advertiser 's chosen keywords , these terms are then expanded into a set of related keywords using related-term-mining methods . our evaluations present a comprehensive analysis of the relative-performance for these methods across a range of videos , including professionally produced films and popular videos from youtube .
