computational geography as the industry moves to personalization and mobility , users expect their applications to be location savvy , and relevant to their lives in increasing detail . while we can pinpoint a user at a location within 700 meters with just their ip-address , and within a meter with their gps-enabled mobile phone , we fall short when it comes to understanding their geographic-context . a person 's geographic-context includes their current and previous location , the things that surround them , their activity in a given place , as well as their thoughts and feelings in that place . understanding this context allows us to personalize their experience and refine their interactions with an application , on a hyper-local level .
