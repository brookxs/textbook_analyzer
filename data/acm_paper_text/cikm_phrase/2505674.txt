map search via a factor-graph model map search has received considerable attention in recent years . with map search , users can specify target locations with textual queries . however , these queries do not always include well-formed addresses or place names . they may contain transpositions , misspellings , fragments and so on . queries may significantly differ from items stored in the spatial-database . in this paper , we propose to connect this task to the semi-structured retrieval problem . a novel factor graph-based semi-structured retrieval-framework is introduced to incorporate concept weighting , attribute-selection , and word-based similarity-metrics together . we randomly sampled a number of queries from logs of a commercial map-search-engine and manually labeled their categories and relevant results for analysis and evaluation . the results of several experimental comparisons demonstrate that our method outperforms both state-of-the-art semi-structured retrieval-methods and some commercial systems in retrieving freeform location queries .
