efficient processing of twig-pattern-matching in fuzzy-xml in order to find all occurrences of a twig pattern in xml-documents , a considerable amount of twig-pattern-matching algorithms have been proposed . at the same time , previous work mainly focuses on twig pattern query under the complete semantics . however , there is often a need to produce partial answers because xml-data may have missing sub-elements . furthermore , the existed works fall short in their ability to support twig pattern query under different semantics in fuzzy-xml . in this paper , we study the problem of twig-matches in fuzzy-xml . we begin by introducing the extended region scheme to accurately and effectively represent nodes information in fuzzy-xml . we then discuss the fuzzy-query semantics and compute the membership information by using einstein-operator instead of zadeh 's min-max technique . on the basis , we propose two efficient-algorithms for querying twig under complete and incomplete semantics in fuzzy-xml . the experimental-results show that our proposed algorithms can perform on the fuzzy twig-pattern-matching efficiently .
