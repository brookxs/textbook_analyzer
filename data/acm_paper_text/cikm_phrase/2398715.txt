enabling ontology_based semantic-queries in biomedical-database systems while current biomedical-ontology repositories offer primitive query-capabilities , it is difficult or cumbersome to support ontology based semantic-queries directly in semantically annotated biomedical databases . the problem may be largely attributed to the mismatch between the models of the ontologies and the databases , and the mismatch between the query-interfaces of the two systems . to fully realize semantic-query capabilities based on ontologies , we develop a system dbontolink to provide unified semantic-query interfaces by extending database-query-languages . with dbontolink , semantic-queries can be directly and naturally specified as extended functions of the database-query-languages without any programming needed . dbontolink is adaptable to different ontologies through customizations and supports major biomedical-ontologies hosted at the ncbo bioportal . we demonstrate the use of dbontolink in a real-world biomedical-database with semantically annotated medical-image annotations .
