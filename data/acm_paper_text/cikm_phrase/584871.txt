efficient query monitoring using adaptive-multiple-key-hashing monitoring continual-queries or subscriptions is to determine the subset of all queries or subscriptions whose predicates match a given event . predicates contain not only equality but also non-equality clauses . event-matching is usually accomplished by first identifying a `` small '' candidate-set of subscriptions for an event and then determining the matched subscriptions from the candidate-set . prior work has focused on using equality clauses to identify the candidate-set . however , we found that completely ignoring non-equality clauses can result in a much larger candidate-set . in this paper , we present and evaluate an adaptive-multiple-key-hashing (amkh) method to judiciously include an effective subset of non-equality clauses in candidate-set identification . each subscription is mapped to a data point in a multidimensional-space based on its predicate clauses . amkh is then used to maintain subscriptions and perform event-matching . amkh further provides a controlling mechanism to limit the hash range of a non-equality clause , hence reducing the size of the candidate-set . simulations are conducted to study the performance of amkh . the results show that (1) a small number of non-equality clauses can be effectively included by amkh and (2) the attributes whose overall non-equality predicate clauses are most selective should be chosen for inclusion by amkh .
