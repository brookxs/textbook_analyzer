workload-aware indexing for keyword-search in social-networks more and more data is accumulated inside social-networks . keyword-search provides a simple interface for exploring this content . however , a lot of the content is private , and a search-system must enforce the privacy settings of the social-network . in this paper , we present a workload-aware keyword-search system with access-control based on a social-network . we make two technical contributions : (1) heapunion , a novel union operator that improves processing of search queries with access-control by up to a factor of two compared to the best previous solution ; and (2) highly accurate cost-models that vary in sophistication and accuracy ; these cost-models provide input to an optimization-algorithm that selects the most efficient organization of access-control meta-data for a given workload . our experimental-results with real and synthetic-data show that our approach outperforms previous work by up to a factor of three .
