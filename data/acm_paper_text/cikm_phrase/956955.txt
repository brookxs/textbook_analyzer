intelligent metasearch-engine for knowledge-management the explosive growth of available information-sources and the resulting information-overload pose several problems for users in many business organizations and educational institutions . first , searching through several information-sources , one at a time , is a source of enormous frustration for users . second , top-ranked documents in search-results are frequently irrelevant to what users are interested in . to address these problems , we have developed ixmeta , a powerful metasearch-engine that gathers , evaluates , ranks , and reports the most relevant results from multiple-information-sources , including library catalogs , proprietary databases , intranets , and web-search-engines . in addition to basic metasearch capabilities , ixmetafind uses personalization and clustering-techniques to find the most relevant results for users . in this paper , we briefly describe technologies used in ixmetafind and present pinpoint from sagebrush corporation , the smart research-tool in the kindergarten through twelfth grade (k-12) school-environment . pinpoint showcases ixmetafind in the knowledge-management domain of the k-12 school-environment .
