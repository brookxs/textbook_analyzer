exploring the corporate ecosystem with a semi-supervised entity-graph investment decisions in the financial-markets require careful analysis of information available from multiple data sources . in this paper , we present atlas , a novel entity-based information-analysis and content-aggregation platform that uses heterogeneous-data-sources to construct and maintain the `` ecosystem '' around tangible and logical entities such as organizations , products , industries , geographies , commodities and macroeconomic indicators . entities are represented as vertices in a directed-graph , and edges are generated using entity co-occurrences in unstructured documents and supervised information from structured-data sources . significance scores for the edges are computed using a method that combines supervised , unsupervised and temporal factors into a single score . important entity attributes from the structured-content and the entity neighborhood in the graph are automatically summarized as the entity `` fingerprint '' . a highly interactive user-interface provides exploratory access to the graph and supports common business use cases . we present results of experiments performed on five years of news and broker research data , and show that atlas is able to accurately identify important and interesting connections in real-world entities . we also demonstrate that atlas entity fingerprints are particularly useful in entity similarity-queries , with a quality that rivals existing human maintained databases .
