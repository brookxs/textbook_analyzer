smoothing document-language-model with local word graph smoothing document-model with word-graph is a new and effective method in information-retrieval . word-graph can naturally incorporate the dependency between the words ; random-walk-algorithm based on the graph can be used to estimate the weight of each vertex . in this paper , we present a new way to construct a local word graph for smoothing document-model , which exploits the document 's k-nearest-neighbors : the vertices represent the words in the document and its k-nearest-neighbors , and the weights of the edges are estimated through word-co-occurrence in the local document-set . we argue that word-graph is a key factor to the performance in graph-based smoothing-method . by using the local document-set , we can obtain a document specific word-graph , and achieve better retrieval-performance . experimental-results on three trec collections show that our proposed approach is effective .
