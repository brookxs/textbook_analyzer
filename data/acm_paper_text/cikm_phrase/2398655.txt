towards measuring the visualness of a concept in this paper , we propose a new method to measure the visualness of a concept . the visualness of a concept is generally defined as what extent a concept has visual characteristics . even though the visualness of a concept is important and useful for various image-search tasks , it has not received much spotlight yet . in this work , we especially focus on how to measure the visualness of a complex concept such as `` round table '' , `` dry bed '' rather than a simple concept like `` ball '' , `` apple '' . to measure the visualness , we first collect sample images of a complex concept using web-image-search engines , and then group the images based on the visual-features . finally , we compute visual purity and weighted entropy of the clusters , which will act as a visualness score for the concept . through various experiments , we show and discuss interesting results about the visualness of a concept .
