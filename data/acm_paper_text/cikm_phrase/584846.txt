query-association for effective retrieval we introduce a novel technique for document-summarisation which we call query-association . query-association is based on the notion that a query that is highly similar to a document is a good descriptor of that document . for example , the user-query `` richmond football club '' is likely to be a good summary of the content of a document that is ranked highly in response to the query . we describe this process of defining , maintaining , and presenting the relationship between a user-query and the documents that are retrieved in response to that query . we show that associated queries are an excellent technique for describing a document : for relevance-judgement , associated queries are as effective as a simple online query-biased summarisation technique . as future work , we suggest additional uses for query-association including relevance-feedback and query-expansion .
