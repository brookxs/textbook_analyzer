query-focused multi-document-summarization based on query-sensitive feature-space query-oriented relevance , information-richness and novelty are important requirements in query-focused-summarization , which , to a considerable extent , determine the summary-quality . previous work either rarely took into account all above demands simultaneously or dealt with part of them in the dynamic-process of choosing sentences to generate a summary . in this paper , we propose a novel approach that integrates all these requirements skillfully by treating them as sentence features , making that the finally generated summary could fully reflect the combinational effect of these properties . experimental-results on the duc2005 and duc2006 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .
