semi-supervised text-categorization by active search in automated-text-categorization , given a small number of labeled documents , it is very challenging , if not impossible , to build a reliable classifier that is able to achieve high classification-accuracy . to address this problem , a novel web-assisted text-categorization framework is proposed in this paper . important keywords are first automatically identified from the available labeled documents to form the queries . search-engines are then utilized to retrieve from the-web a multitude of relevant documents , which are then exploited by a semi-supervised framework . to our best knowledge , this work is the first study of this kind . extensive experimental-study shows the encouraging results of the proposed text-categorization framework : using google as the-web search-engine , the proposed framework is able to reduce the classification-error by 30 \ % when compared with the state-of-the-art supervised-text-categorization method .
