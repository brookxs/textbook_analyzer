rough-sets_based reasoning and pattern-mining for a two-stage information-filtering system this paper presents a novel two-stage information-filtering model which combines the merits of term-based and pattern - based approaches to effectively filter sheer volume of infor - mation . in particular , the first filtering stage is supported by a novel rough analysis-model which efficiently removes a large number of irrelevant documents , thereby addressing the overload problem . the second filtering stage is empow - ered by a semantically rich pattern-taxonomy mining-model which effectively fetches incoming documents according to the specific information-needs of a user , thereby addressing the mismatch problem . the experiments have been conducted to compare the proposed two-stage filtering (t-sm) model with other possible `` term-based + pattern-based '' or `` term-based + term-based '' if models . the results based on the rcv1 corpus show that the t-sm model significantly outperforms other types of `` two-stage '' if models .
