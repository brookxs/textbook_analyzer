qed : a novel quaternary encoding to completely avoid re-labeling in xml-updates the method of assigning labels to the nodes of the xml-tree is called a labeling-scheme . based on the labels only , both ordered and un-ordered queries can be processed without accessing the original xml file . one more important point for the labeling-scheme is the label update cost in inserting or deleting a node into or from the xml-tree . all the current labeling-schemes have high update cost , therefore in this paper we propose a novel quaternary encoding approach for the labeling-schemes . based on this encoding approach , we need not re-label any existing nodes when the update is performed . extensive experimental-results on the xml-datasets illustrate that our qed works much better than the existing labeling-schemes on the label updates when considering either the number of nodes or the time for re-labeling .
