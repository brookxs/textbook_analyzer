web-search personalization with ontological-user-profiles every user has a distinct background and a specific goal when searching for information on the web . the goal of web-search personalization is to tailor search-results to a particular user based on that user 's interests and preferences . effective personalization of information-access involves two important challenges : accurately identifying the user-context and organizing the information in such a way that matches the particular context . we present an approach to personalized-search that involves building models-of-user context as ontological profiles by assigning implicitly derived interest scores to existing concepts in a domain-ontology . a spreading-activation algorithm is used to maintain the interest scores based on the user 's ongoing behavior . our experiments show that re-ranking the search-results based on the interest scores and the semantic evidence in an ontological-user-profile is effective in presenting the most relevant results to the user .
