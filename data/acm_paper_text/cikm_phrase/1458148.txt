non-local evidence for expert-finding the task addressed in this paper , finding experts in an enterprise setting , has gained in importance and interest over the past few years . commonly , this task is approached as an association finding exercise between people and topics . existing techniques use either documents (as a whole) or proximity-based techniques to represent candidate experts . proximity-based techniques have shown clear precision-enhancing benefits . we complement both document and proximity-based approaches to expert-finding by importing global evidence of expertise , i.e. , evidence obtained using information that is not available in the immediate proximity of a candidate expert 's name occurrence or even on the same page on which the name occurs . examples include candidate priors , query-models , as well as other documents a candidate expert is associated with . using the cerc data-set created for the trec 2007 enterprise track we identify examples of non-local evidence of expertise . we then propose modified expert-retrieval models that are capable of incorporating both local (either document or snippet-based) evidence and non-local evidence of expertise . results show that our refined models significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches .
