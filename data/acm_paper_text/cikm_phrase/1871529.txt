result-size estimation for information-retrieval subqueries estimating the approximate result size of a query before its execution based on small summary statistics is important for query-optimization in database-systems and for other facets of query-processing . this also holds for queries over text-databases . research on selectivity-estimation for such queries has focused on boolean-retrieval , i.e. , a document may be relevant for the query or not . but with the coalescence of database and information retrieval (ir) technology , selectivity-estimation for other , more sophisticated relevance functions is gaining importance as well . these models generate a query-specific distribution of the documents over the [0 , 1] - interval . with document distributions , selectivity-estimation means estimating how many documents are how similar to a given query . the problem is much more complex than selectivity-estimation in the boolean context : beside document-frequency , query results also depend on other characteristics such as term frequencies and document lengths . selectivity-estimation must take them into account as well . this paper proposes and evaluates a technique for estimating the result of retrieval queries with non-boolean relevance functions . it estimates discretized document distributions over the range of the relevance function . despite the complexity , compared to boolean selectivity-estimation , it requires little additional data , and the additional data can be stored in existing data-structures with little extensions . our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our technique .
