matching query-processing in high-dimensional-space in many applications , such as online-dating or job hunting websites , users often need to search for potential matches based on the requirements or preferences imposed by both sides.we refer to this type of queries as matching queries . in spite of their wide applicabilities , there has been little attention devoted to improve their performance . as matching queries often appear in various forms even within a single application , we , in this paper , propose a general processing framework , which can efficiently process various forms of matching queries . moreover , we elaborate the detailed processing-algorithms for two particular forms of matching queries to illustrate the applicability of this framework . we conduct an extensive experimental-study with both synthetic and real datasets . the results indicate that , for various matching queries , our techniques can dramatically improve the query-performance , especially when the dimensionality is high .
