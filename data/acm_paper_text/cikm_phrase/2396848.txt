exploring personal-impact for group-recommendation group activities are essential ingredients of people 's social-life . the rapid growth of online-social-networking-services has greatly boosted group activities by providing convenient platform for users to organize and participate in such activities . therefore , recommender-systems , as a critical component in social-networking-services , now face new challenges in supporting group activities . in this paper , we study the group-recommendation problem , i.e. , making recommendations to a group of people in social-networking-services . we analyze the decision-making-process in a group to propose a personal-impact topic (pit) model for group-recommendations . the pit model effectively identifies the group-preference profile for a given group by considering the personal-preferences and personal impacts of group members . moreover , we further enhance the discovery of personal-impact with social-network information to obtain an extended personal-impact topic (e-pit) model . we have conducted comprehensive data-analysis and evaluations on three real datasets . the results show that our proposed group-recommendation techniques outperform baseline approaches .
