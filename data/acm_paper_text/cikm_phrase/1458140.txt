relating dependent indexes using dempster-shafer-theory traditional information-retrieval (ir) approaches assume that the indexing terms are independent , which is not true in reality . although some previous studies have tried to consider term-relationships , strong simplifications had to be made at the very basic indexing step , namely , dependent terms are assigned independent counts or probabilities . in this study , we propose to consider dependencies between terms using dempster-shafer-theory-of-evidence . an occurrence of a string in a document is considered to represent the set of all the terms implied in it . probability is assigned to such a set of terms instead of individual terms . during query-evaluation phase , a part of the probability of a set can be transferred to those of the query that are related , allowing us to integrate language-dependent relations in ir . this approach has been tested on several chinese-ir collections . our experimental-results show that our model can outperform the existing state-of-the-art approaches . the proposed method can be used as a general way to consider different types of relationship between terms and for other languages .
