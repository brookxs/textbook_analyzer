efficient multi-class unlabeled constrained semi-supervised svm semi-supervised-learning has been successfully applied to many fields such as knowledge-management , information-retrieval and data-mining as it can utilize both labeled and unlabeled-data . in this paper , we propose a general semi-supervised framework for multi-class-categorization . many classical supervised and semi-supervised method dealing with binary-classification or multi-class-classification including the standard regularization and the manifold-regularization can be viewed as special cases of this framework . based on this framework , we propose a novel method called multi-class unlabeled constrained svm (mcucsvm) and its special case : multi-class-laplacian-svm (mclapsvm) . we then put forward a general kernel version semi-supervised dual-coordinate-descent-algorithm to efficiently solve mcucsvm and makes it more applicable to problems with large number of classes and large-scale labeled-data . both rigorous theory and promising experimental-results on four real datasets show the great performance and remarkable efficiency of mcucsvm and mclapsvm .
