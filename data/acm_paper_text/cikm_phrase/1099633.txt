text-document clustering based on frequent-word-sequences in this paper , we propose a new text-clustering algorithm , named clustering based on frequent-word-sequences (cfws) . a word-sequence is frequent if it occurs in more than certain percentage of the documents in the text-database . in the past , the vector-space-model was commonly used for information-retrieval , but it treats documents as bags of words , ignoring the sequential-pattern of word occurrences in the documents . however , the meaning of natural-languages strongly depends on the word-sequences , and the frequent-word-sequences can provide compact and valuable information about the text-database . bisecting k-means and fihc algorithms are evaluated on the performance of text-clustering , and are compared with the proposed cfws algorithm . it has been shown that cfws has much better performance .
