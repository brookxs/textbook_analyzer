recency-sensitive model of web-page authority traditional link-based web-ranking algorithms run on a single web snapshot without concern of the dynamics of web-pages and links . in particular , the correlation of web-pages freshness and their classic pagerank is negative (see [11]) . for this reason , in recent years a number of authors introduce some algorithms of pagerank actualization . we introduce our new algorithm called actual pagerank , which generalizes some previous approaches and therefore provides better capability for capturing the dynamics of the-web . to the best of our knowledge we are the first to conduct ranking evaluations of a fresh-aware variation of pagerank on a large-data-set . the results demonstrate that our method achieves more relevant and fresh results than both classic pagerank and its `` fresh '' modifications .
