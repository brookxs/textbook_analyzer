cross-domain sentiment-classification using a two-stage method in this paper , we give out a two-stage approach for domain-adaptation problem in sentiment-classification . in the first stage , based on our observation that customers often use different words to comment on the similar topics in the different domains , we regard these common topics as the-bridge to link the different domain-specific features . we propose a novel topic-model named transfer-plsa to extract the topic-knowledge between different domains . through these common topics , the features in the source-domain are corresponded to the target features , so that those domain-specific-knowledge can be transferred across different domains . in the second step , we use the classifier trained on the labeled examples in the source-domain to pick up some informative examples in the target-domain . then we retrain the classifier on these selected examples , so that the classifier is adapted for the target-domain . experimental-results on sentiment-classification in four different domains indicate that our method outperforms other traditional methods .
