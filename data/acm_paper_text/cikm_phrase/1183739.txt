on subspace-clustering with density consciousness in this paper , a problem , called `` the density-divergence-problem '' is explored . this problem is related to the phenomenon that the densities of the clusters vary in different subspace cardinalities . we take the densities into consideration in subspace-clustering and explore an algorithm to adaptively determine different density thresholds to discover clusters in different subspace cardinalities .
