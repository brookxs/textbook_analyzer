analyzing and evaluating query-reformulation strategies in web-search-logs users frequently modify a previous search-query in hope of retrieving better results . these modifications are called query-reformulations or query-refinements . existing research has studied how web-search-engines can propose reformulations , but has given less attention to how people perform query-reformulations . in this paper , we aim to better understand how web searchers refine queries and form a theoretical foundation for query-reformulation . we study users ' reformulation strategies in the context of the aol query-logs . we create a taxonomy of query-refinement strategies and build a high precision rule-based-classifier to detect each type of reformulation . effectiveness of reformulations is measured using user click-behavior . most reformulation strategies result in some benefit to the user . certain strategies like add/remove words , word-substitution , acronym-expansion , and spelling-correction are more likely to cause clicks , especially on higher ranked results . in contrast , users often click the same result as their previous query or select no results when forming acronyms and reordering words . perhaps the most surprising finding is that some reformulations are better suited to helping users when the current results are already fruitful , while other reformulations are more effective when the results are lacking . our findings inform the design of applications that can assist searchers ; examples are described in this paper .
