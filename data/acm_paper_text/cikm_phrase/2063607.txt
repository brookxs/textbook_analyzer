searching microblogs : coping with sparsity and document-quality two of the main challenges in retrieval on microblogs are the inherent sparsity of the documents and difficulties in assessing their quality . the feature sparsity is immanent to the restriction of the medium to short-texts . quality-assessment is necessary as the microblog documents range from spam over trivia and personal chatter to news broadcasts , information-dissemination and reports of current hot-topics . in this paper we analyze how these challenges can influence standard retrieval-models and propose methods to overcome the problems they pose . we consider the sparsity 's effect on document-length-normalization and introduce `` interestingness '' as static quality-measure . our results show that deliberately ignoring length-normalization yields better retrieval results in general and that interestingness improves retrieval for underspecified queries .
