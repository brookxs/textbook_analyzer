an effective latent networks fusion_based model for event-recommendation in offline ephemeral social networks offline ephemeral social networks (offesns) are the networks created ad-hoc at a specific location for a specific purpose and lasting for short period of time , relying on mobile-social-media such as radio-frequency-identification (rfid) and bluetooth-devices . the primary purpose of people in the offesns is to acquire and share information via attending prescheduled events . event-recommendation over this kind of networks can facilitate attendees on selecting the prescheduled events and organizers on making resource-planning . however , because of lack of users ' preference and rating information , as well as explicit social-relations , the existing recommendation-methods can no longer work well to recommend the events in the offesns . to address the challenges such as how to derive latent preferences and social-relations and how to fuse the latent information in a unified-model , we first construct two heterogeneous interaction social-networks , an event participation network and a physical-proximity network . then , we use them to derive users ' latent preferences and latent networks on social-relations , including like-minded peers , co-attendees and friends . finally , we propose an lnf (latent networks fusion) model under a pairwise factor-graph to infer event attendance probabilities for recommendation . experiments on an rfid-based real conference dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with typical solutions .
