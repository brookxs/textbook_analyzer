robust periodicity detection-algorithms periodicity detection is an important pre-processing step for many time-series algorithms . it provides important information about the structural-properties of a time-series . feature-vectors based on periodicity can be used for clustering , classification , abnormality-detection , and human-motion understanding . the periodicity detection-task is not difficult in case of simple and uncontaminated signal . unfortunately , most of the real datasets exhibit one or more of the following properties : i) non-stationarity , ii) interlaced cyclic patterns and iii) data contamination , which makes the period detection extremely challenging . a seemingly straightforward solution is to develop individual specialized algorithms for handling each case separately . however , determining if a time-series is non-stationary or is contaminated in itself is an extremely difficult task . in this article , we propose generic algorithms which can detect periods in complex , noisy and incomplete datasets . the algorithm leverages the frequency characterization and autocorrelation structure inherent in a time-series to estimate its periodicity . we extend the methods to handle non-stationary-time-series by tracking the candidate periods using a kalman-filter . we also address the interesting problem of finding multiple interlaced periodicities .
