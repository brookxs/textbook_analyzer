efficient jaccard-based diversity analysis of large document collections we propose two efficient-algorithms for exploring topic diversity in large document corpora such as user-generated-content on the social-web , bibliographic-data , or other web-repositories . analyzing diversity is useful for obtaining insights into knowledge-evolution , trends , periodicities , and topic heterogeneity of such collections . calculating diversity statistics requires averaging over the similarity of all object pairs , which , for large-corpora , is prohibitive from a computational point-of-view . our proposed algorithms overcome the quadratic complexity of the average pair-wise similarity-computation , and allow for constant-time (depending on dataset properties) or linear-time approximation with probabilistic-guarantees . we show examples of diversity-based studies on large samples from corpora such as the social photo-sharing site flickr , the dblp bibliography , and us census-data .
