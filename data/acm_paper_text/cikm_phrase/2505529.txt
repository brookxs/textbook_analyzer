on mining mobile-apps usage behavior for predicting apps usage in smartphones predicting apps usage has become an important task due to the proliferation of apps , and the complex of apps . however , the previous research works utilized a considerable number of different sensors as training-data to infer apps usage . to save the energy-consumption for the task of predicting apps usages , only the temporal-information is considered in this paper . we propose a temporal-based apps predictor (abbreviated as tap) to dynamically predict the apps which are most likely to be used . first , we extract three apps usage features , global usage feature , temporal usage feature , and periodical usage feature from the apps usage trace . then , based on those explored features , we dynamically derive an apps usage probability-model to estimate the current usage probability of each app in each feature . finally , we investigate the usage probability in each feature and select k apps with highest usage probability from the probability model . in this paper , we propose two selection-algorithms , maxprob and minentropy . to evaluate the performance of tap , we use two real mobile-apps usage traces and assess the accuracy and efficiency . the experimental-results show that the proposed tap with the minentropy selection-algorithm could have shorter response-time of apps prediction . moreover , the accuracy reaches to 80 % when k is 5 , and when k is 7 , the accuracy achieves almost 100 % in both of the two real datasets .
