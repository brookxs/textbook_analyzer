designing semantics-preserving cluster representatives for scientific input conditions in scientific domains , knowledge is often discovered from experiments by grouping or clustering them based on the similarity of their output . the causes of similarity are analyzed based on the input conditions characterizing a given type of output , i.e. , a given cluster . this analysis helps in applications such as decision-support in industry . cluster representatives form at-a-glance depictions for such applications . randomly selecting a set of conditions in a cluster as its representative is not sufficient since distinct combinations of inputs could lead to the same cluster . in this paper , an approach called descond is proposed to design semantics-preserving cluster representatives for scientific input conditions . we define a notion of distance for conditions to capture semantics based on the types of their attributes and their relative-importance . using this distance , methods of building candidate cluster representatives with different levels-of-detail are proposed . candidates are compared using the descond encoding proposed in this paper that assesses their complexity and information loss , given user-interests . the candidate with the lowest encoding for each cluster is returned as its designed representative . descond is evaluated with real-data from materials-science . evaluation with domain expert interviews and formal user-surveys shows that designed representatives consistently outperform randomly selected ones and different candidates suit different users .
