extracting significant time varying features from text we propose a simple statistical-model for the frequency of occurrence of features in a stream of text . adoption of this model allows us to use classical significance-tests to filter the stream for interesting events . we tested the model by building a system and running it on a news-corpus . by a subjective-evaluation , the system worked remarkably well : almost all of the groups of identified tokens corresponded to news stories and were appropriately placed in time . a preliminary objective-evaluation was also used to measure the quality of the system and it showed some of the weaknesses and the power of our approach .
