facilitating pattern-discovery for relation-extraction with semantic-signature-based clustering hand-crafted textual patterns have been the mainstay device of practical relation-extraction for decades . however , there has been little work on reducing the manual effort involved in the discovery of effective textual patterns for relation-extraction . in this paper , we propose a clustering-based approach to facilitate the pattern-discovery for relation-extraction . specifically , we define the notion of semantic-signature to represent the most salient-features of a textual fragment . we then propose a novel clustering-algorithm based on semantic-signature , s2c , and its enhancement s2c + . experiments on two real-world-data sets show that , when compared with k-means-clustering , s2c and s2c + are at least an order of magnitude faster , while generating high quality clusters that are at least comparable to the best clusters generated by k-means without requiring any manual tuning . finally , a user-study confirms that our clustering-based approach can indeed help users discover effective textual patterns for relation-extraction with only a fraction of the manual effort required by the conventional approach .
