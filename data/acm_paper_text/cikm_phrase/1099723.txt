incremental test-collections corpora and topics are readily available for information-retrieval-research . relevance-judgments , which are necessary for system-evaluation , are expensive ; the cost of obtaining them prohibits in-house evaluation of retrieval-systems on new corpora or new topics . we present an algorithm for cheaply constructing sets of relevance-judgments . our method intelligently selects documents to be judged and decides when to stop in such a way that with very little work there can be a high degree of confidence in the result of the evaluation . we demonstrate the algorithm 's effectiveness by showing that it produces small sets of relevance-judgments that reliably discriminate between two systems . the algorithm can be used to incrementally design retrieval-systems by simultaneously comparing sets of systems . the number of additional judgments needed after each incremental-design change decreases at a rate reciprocal to the number of systems being compared . to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method , we evaluate trec ad-hoc submissions , showing that with 95 \ % fewer relevance-judgments we can reach a kendall 's tau rank-correlation of at least 0.9 .
