a combination of trie-trees and inverted-files for the indexing of set-valued-attributes set-valued-attributes frequently occur in contexts like market-basked analysis and stock-market trends . late research-literature has mainly focused on set containment joins and data-mining without considering simple queries on set valued attributes . in this paper we address superset , subset and equality queries and we propose a novel indexing-scheme for answering them on set-valued-attributes . the proposed index superimposes a trie-tree on top of an inverted-file that indexes a relation with set-valued-data . we show that we can efficiently answer the aforementioned queries by indexing only a subset of the most frequent of the items that occur in the indexed relation . finally , we show-through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms the-state-of-the-art mechanisms and scales gracefully as database-size grows .
