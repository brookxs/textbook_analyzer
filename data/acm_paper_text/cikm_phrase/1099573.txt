connecting topics in document-collections with stepping-stones and pathways in this paper , we present stepping-stones and pathways (ssp) , an alternative model of building and presenting answers for the cases when queries on document-collections can not be answered just by a ranked list . stepping-stones can handle questions like : `` what is the relation of topics x and y ? '' ssp addresses when the contents of a small set of related documents is needed as an answer rather than a single-document , or when `` query-splitting '' is required to satisfactorily explore a document space . query results are networks of document groups representing topics , each group relating to and connecting (by documents) to other groups in the network . thus , a network answers the user 's information-need . we devise new and more effective representations and techniques to visualize such answers , and to involve users as part of the answer-finding process . in order to verify the validity of our approach , and since the questions we aim to answer involve multiple topics , we performed a study involving a custom built broad collection of operating-systems research papers , and evaluated the results with interested computer-science students , using multiple measures .
