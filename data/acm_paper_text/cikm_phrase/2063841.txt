effects of search-success on search-engine re-use people 's experiences when interacting with online-services affects their decisions on reuse . users of web-search-engines are primarily focused on obtaining relevant-information pertaining to their query . search-engines that fail to satisfy users ' information-needs may find their market share to be negatively affected . however , despite its importance to search providers , the relationship be-tween search-success and search-engine reuse is poorly understood . in this paper , we present a longitudinal log-based study with a large cohort of search-engine users that quantifies the relationship between success and re-use of search-engines . we use time-series-analysis to define two groups of users : stationary and non-stationary . we find that recent changes in satisfaction rate do correlate moderately with changes in rate of return for stationary users . for non-stationary users , we find that satisfaction and rate of return change together and in the same direction . we also find that some effects are stronger for a smaller player on the market than for a clear market leader , but both are affected . this is the first study to explore these issues in the context of web-search , and our findings have implications for search providers seeking to better understand their users and improving their experience .
