timely crawling of high-quality ephemeral new content in this paper , we study the problem of timely finding and crawling of textit {ephemeral} new pages , i.e. , for which user traffic grows really quickly right after they appear , but lasts only for several days (e.g. , news , blog and forum posts) . traditional crawling policies do not give any particular priority to such pages and may thus crawl them not quickly enough , and even crawl already obsolete content . we thus propose a new metric , well thought out for this task , which takes into account the decrease of user-interest for ephemeral pages over time . we show that most ephemeral new pages can be found at a relatively small set of content sources and suggest a method for finding such a set . our idea is to periodically recrawl content sources and crawl newly created pages linked from them , focusing on high-quality (in terms of user-interest) content . one of the main difficulties here is to divide resources between these two activities in an efficient way . we find the adaptive balance between crawls and recrawls by maximizing the proposed metric . further , we incorporate search-engine click-logs to give our crawler an insight about the current user demands . the effectiveness of our approach is finally demonstrated experimentally on real-world-data .
