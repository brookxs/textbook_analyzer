online stratified-sampling : evaluating classifiers at web-scale deploying a classifier to large-scale-systems such as the-web requires careful feature-design and performance evaluation . evaluation is particularly challenging because these large-collections frequently change . in this paper we adapt stratified-sampling techniques to evaluate the precision of classifiers deployed in large-scale-systems . we investigate different types of stratification strategies , and then we derive a new online-sampling algorithm that incrementally approximates the theoretical optimal disproportionate sampling strategy . in experiments , the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms both simple random-sampling as well as other types of stratified-sampling , with an average reduction of about 20 \ % in labeling effort to reach the same confidence and interval-bounds on precision
