fast and accurate estimation of shortest-paths in large-graphs computing shortest-paths between two given nodes is a fundamental operation over graphs , but known to be nontrivial over large disk-resident instances of graph-data . while a number of techniques exist for answering reachability-queries and approximating node distances efficiently , determining actual shortest-paths (i.e. the sequence of nodes involved) is often neglected . however , in applications arising in massive online-social-networks , biological-networks , and knowledge graphs it is often essential to find out many , if not all , shortest-paths between two given nodes . in this paper , we address this problem and present a scalable sketch-based index-structure that not only supports estimation of node distances , but also computes corresponding shortest-paths themselves . generating the actual path-information allows for further improvements to the estimation-accuracy of distances (and paths) , leading to near-exact shortest-path approximations in real-world graphs . we evaluate our techniques - implemented within a fully functional rdf graph database-system - over large real-world social and biological-networks of sizes ranging from tens of thousand to millions of nodes and edges . experiments on several datasets show that we can achieve query response-times providing several orders of magnitude speedup over traditional path computations while keeping the estimation errors between 0 \ % and 1 \ % on average .
