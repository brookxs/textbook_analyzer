energy-efficient top-k-query-processing in wireless-sensor-networks technological advances have enabled the deployment of large-scale sensor-networks for environmental-monitoring and surveillance purposes . the large volume of data generated by sensors needs to be processed to respond to the users queries . however , efficient processing of queries in sensor-networks poses great challenges due to the unique characteristics imposed on sensor-networks including slow processing capability , limited storage , and energy-limited batteries , etc. . among various queries , top - k query is one of the fundamental operators in many applications of wireless-sensor-networks for phenomenon monitoring . in this paper we focus on evaluating top - k queries in an energy-efficient manner such that the network-lifetime is maximized . to achieve that , we devise a scalable , filter-based localized evaluation-algorithm for top - k query-evaluation , which is able to filter out as many unlikely top - k results as possible within the network from transmission . we also conduct extensive experiments by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on real datasets . the experimental-results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms significantly in network-lifetime prolongation .
