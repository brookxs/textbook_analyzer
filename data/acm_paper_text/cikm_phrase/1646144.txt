rs-wrapper : random-write optimization for solid-state-drive solid-state-drive (ssd) , emerging as new data-storage media with high random read speed , has been widely used in laptops , desktops , and data servers to replace hard-disk during the past few years . however , poor random-write performance becomes the bottle neck in practice . in this paper , we propose to insert unmodified data into random-write sequence in order to convert random writes into sequential writes , and thus data sequence can be flushed at the speed of sequential write . further , we propose a clustering strategy to improve the performance by reducing quantity of unmodified data to read . after exploring the intrinsic parallelism of ssd , we also propose to flush write sequences with the help of the simultaneous program between planes and parallel-program between devices for the first time . comprehensive experiments show that our method outperform the existing random-write solution up to one order of magnitude improvement .
