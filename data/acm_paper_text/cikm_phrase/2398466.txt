graph-based workflow recommendation : on improving business-process-modeling how to improve the modeling efficiency and accuracy has become a burning problem . the popularization of recommendation technique in e-commerce provide us new trajectories that can be used for addressing the problem . in this paper , we propose a graph-based workflow recommendation for improving business-process-modeling . the start point is so-called `` workflow repository '' including a set of already developed process-models . graph-mining method is used to extract the process patterns from the repository . based on graph-edit-distance (ged) [2] , we calculate the distance between patterns and the partial business-process , viewed as reference-model , which is under modeling and select the candidate nodes with smaller distances for recommendation . the performance-study show its feasibility for practical uses .
