mining competitive relationships by learning across heterogeneous-networks detecting and monitoring competitors is fundamental to a company to stay ahead in the global market . existing studies mainly focus on mining competitive relationships within a single data source , while competing information is usually distributed in multiple networks . how to discover the underlying patterns and utilize the heterogeneous knowledge to avoid biased aspects in this issue is a challenging problem . in this paper , we study the problem of mining competitive relationships by learning across heterogeneous-networks . we use twitter and patent records as our data sources and statistically study the patterns behind the competitive relationships . we find that the two networks exhibit different but complementary patterns of competitions . our proposed model , topical factor-graph model (tfgm) , defines a latent-topic layer to bridge the two networks and learns a semi-supervised-learning model to classify the relationships-between-entities (e.g. , companies or products) . we test the proposed model on two real-data sets and the experimental-results validate the effectiveness of our model , with an average of +46 % improvement over alternative methods .
