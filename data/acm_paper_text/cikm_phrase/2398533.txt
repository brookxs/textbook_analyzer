sketch-based indexing of n-words formulating and processing phrases and other term dependencies to improve query-effectiveness is an important problem in information-retrieval . however , accessing these types of statistics using standard inverted-indexes requires unreasonable processing-time or incurs a substantial space-overhead . establishing a balance between these competing space and time trade-offs can dramatically improve system-performance . in this paper , we present and analyze a new index-structure designed to improve query-efficiency in term-dependency retrieval-models , with bounded space requirements . by adapting a class of (&#949; , &#948;) - approximation-algorithms originally proposed for sketch summarization in networking-applications , we show how to accurately estimate various statistics important in term-dependency models with low , probabilistically bounded error-rates . the space requirements of the sketch index-structure is largely independent of this size and the number of phrase term dependencies . empirically , we show that the sketch index can reduce the space requirements of the vocabulary component of an index of all n-grams consisting of between 1 and 5 words extracted from the clueweb-part-b collection to less than 0.2 % of the requirements of an equivalent full index . we show that n-gram queries of 5 words can be processed more efficiently than in current alternatives , such as next-word indexes . we show retrieval using the sketch index to be up to 400 times faster than with positional indexes , and 15 times faster than next-word indexes .
