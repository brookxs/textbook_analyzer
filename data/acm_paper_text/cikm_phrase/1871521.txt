latent interest-topic model : finding the causal-relationships behind dyadic-data this paper presents a hierarchical generative-model that captures the latent relation of cause and effect underlying user behavioral-originated data such as papers , twitter and purchase history . our proposel , the latent interest topic-model (lit) , introduces a latent-variable into each document and each author layor in a coherent generative-model . we call the former variable the document class , and the latter variable the author class , where these classes are indicator variables that allow the inclusion of different types of probability , and can be shared over documents with similar-content and authors with similar interests , respectively . significantly , unlike other works , lit differentiates , respectively , document topics and user-interests by using these classes . consequently , lit is superior to previous models in explaining the causal-relationships behind the data by merging similar distributions ; it also makes the computation process easier . experiments on a research-paper corpus show that the proposed model can well capture document and author classes , and reduce the dimensionality of documents to a low-dimensional author-document space , making it useful as a generative-model .
