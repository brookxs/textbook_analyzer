mining gene-expression datasets using density-based-clustering given the recent advancement of microarray technologies , we present a density-based-clustering approach for the purpose of co-expressed gene-cluster-identification . the underlying hypothesis is that a set of co-expressed gene-clusters can be used to reveal a common biological function . by addressing the strengths and limitations of previous density-based-clustering approaches , we present a novel clustering-algorithm that utilizes a neighborhood defined by <i> k </i> - nearest-neighbors . experimental-results indicate that the proposed method identifies biologically meaningful and co-expressed gene-clusters .
