fast mining of complex time-stamped events given a collection of complex , time-stamped events , how do we find patterns and anomalies ? events could be meetings with one or more persons and one or more agenda items at zero or more locations (e.g. , teleconferences) , or they could be publications with authors , keywords , publishers , etc. . in such settings , we want to find time stamps that look similar to each other and group them ; we also want to find anomalies . in addition , we want our approach to provide interpretations of the clusters and anomalies by annotating them . furthermore , we want our approach to automatically find the right time-granularity in which to do analysis . lastly , we want fast , scalable-algorithms for all these problems . we address the above challenges through two main ideas . the first (t3) is to turn the problem into a graph-analysis problem , by carefully treating each time-stamp as a node in a graph . this viewpoint brings to bear the vast machinery of graph-analysis methods (pagerank , graph-partitioning , proximity analysis , and centerpiece subgraphs , to name a few) . thus , t3 can automatically group the time stamps into meaningful clusters and spot anomalies . moreover , it can select representative events/persons/locations for each cluster and each anomaly , as their interpretations . the second idea (mt3) is to use temporal-multi-resolution analysis (e.g. , minutes , hours , days) . we show that mt3 can quickly derive results from finer-to-coarser resolutions , achieving up to 2 orders of magnitude speedups . we verify the effectiveness as well as efficiency of t3 and mt3 on several real datasets .
