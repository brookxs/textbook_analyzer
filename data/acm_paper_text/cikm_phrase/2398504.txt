a probabilistic-approach to mining geospatial knowledge from social-annotations user-generated-content , such as photos and videos , is often annotated by users with free-text labels , called tags . increasingly , such content is also georeferenced , i.e. , it is associated with geographic coordinates . the implicit-relationships between tags and their locations can tell us much about how people conceptualize places and relations between them . however , extracting such knowledge from social-annotations presents many challenges , since annotations are often ambiguous , noisy , uncertain and spatially inhomogeneous . we introduce a probabilistic-framework for modeling georeferenced annotations and a method for learning-model parameters from data . the framework is flexible and general , and can be used in a variety of applications that mine geospatial knowledge from user-generated-content . specifically , we study three problems : extracting place semantics , predicting locations of photos and learning part-of relations between places . we show our method performs well compared to state-of-the-art approaches developed for the first two problems , and offers a novel solution to the problem of learning relations between places .
