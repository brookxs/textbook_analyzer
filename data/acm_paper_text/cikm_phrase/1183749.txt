integration of cluster-ensemble and em_based text-mining for microarray gene-cluster-identification and annotation in this paper , we design and develop a unified system ge-miner (gene-expression miner) to integrate cluster-ensemble , text-clustering and multi document-summarization and provide an environment for comprehensive gene-expression-data analysis . we present a novel cluster-ensemble approach to generate high quality gene-cluster . in our text-summarization module , given a gene-cluster , our expectation-maximization (em) based algorithm can automatically identify subtopics and extract most probable terms for each topic . then , the extracted top k topical terms from each subtopic are combined to form the biological explanation of each gene-cluster . experimental-results demonstrate that our system can obtain high quality clusters and provide informative key terms for the gene-clusters .
