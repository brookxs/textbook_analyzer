monochromatic and bichromatic reverse nearest-neighbor-queries on land surfaces finding reverse-nearest-neighbors (rnns) is an important operation in spatial-databases . the problem of evaluating rnn queries has already received considerable attention due to its importance in many real-world-applications , such as resource-allocation and disaster-response . while rnn query-processing has been extensively studied in euclidean-space , no work ever studies this problem on land surfaces . however , practical applications of rnn queries involve terrain surfaces that constrain object movements , which rendering the existing algorithms inapplicable . in this paper , we investigate the evaluation of two types of rnn queries on land surfaces : monochromatic rnn (mrnn) queries and bichromatic rnn (brnn) queries . on a land-surface , the distance between two points is calculated as the length of the shortest-path along the surface . however , the computational cost of the state-of-the-art shortest-path-algorithm on a land-surface is quadratic to the size of the surface-model , which is usually quite huge . as a result , surface rnn query-processing is a challenging problem . leveraging some newly-discovered properties of voronoi-cell approximation structures , we make use of standard index-structures such as an r-tree to design efficient-algorithms that accelerate the evaluation of mrnn and brnn queries on land surfaces . our proposed algorithms are able to localize query-evaluation by accessing just a small fraction of the surface data near the query point , which helps avoid shortest-path evaluation on a large surface . extensive experiments are conducted on large real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms .
