extracting structured-information from wikipedia articles to populate infoboxes roughly every third wikipedia article contains an infobox - a table that displays important facts about the subject in attribute-value form . the schema of an infobox , i.e. , the attributes that can be expressed for a concept , is defined by an infobox template . often , authors do not specify all template attributes , resulting in incomplete infoboxes . with ipopulator , we introduce a system that automatically populates infoboxes of wikipedia articles by extracting attribute values from the article 's text . in contrast to prior work , ipopulator detects and exploits the structure of attribute values to independently extract value parts . we have tested ipopulator on the entire set of infobox templates and provide a detailed analysis of its effectiveness . for instance , we achieve an average extraction precision of 91 \ % for 1,727 distinct infobox template attributes .
