functionality and architecture of a cooperative-database system : a vision a database-system fostering the cooperative usage and modification of a common data pool should provide standard database functionality (e.g. application-independent correctness criteria and data-modelling) plus means for a step-wise , cooperative refinement of data over a long period of time . key ingredients are a hierarchical organization-of-work , a sound data-model covering cooperative uncertainly , and support for long-living cooperative processes . furthermore , mechanisms for data passing and hiding , negotiation means , and notification are of prominent importance . in the paper , the rationale behind such a functionality is described . furthermore , a proposal is made for the software-architecture of what is called a cooperative-database system (cdbms) .
