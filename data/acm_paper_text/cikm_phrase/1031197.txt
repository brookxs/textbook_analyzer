protein-structure-alignment using geometrical features a novel approach for similarity-search on protein-structure databases is proposed which incorporates the three-dimensional coordinates of the main atoms of each amino acid and extracts a geometrical signature along with the direction of the given amino acid . as a result , each protein is presented by a series of feature-vectors representing local geometry , shape , direction , and secondary-structure assignment of its amino acid constituents . furthermore , a residue-to-residue distance-matrix is calculated and is incorporated into a local-alignment dynamic-programming-algorithm to find the similar portions of two given proteins and finally a sequence-alignment step is used as the last filtration step . the optimal superimposition of the detected similar regions is used to assess the quality of the results . the proposed algorithm is fast and accurate and hence could be used for the analysis of large protein-structure-similarity .
