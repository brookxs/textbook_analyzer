visualization and clustering of crowd video-content in mpca subspace this paper presents a novel approach for the visualization and clustering of crowd video contents by using multilinear principal-component-analysis (mpca) . in contrast to feature-point-based approach and frame-based dimensionality-reduction approach , the proposed method maps each short video segment to a point in mpca subspace to take temporal-information into account naturally through tensorial representations . specifically , mpca projects each short segment of a video to a low-dimensional tensor first . a few mpca features are then selected according to the variance captured as the final representation . thus , a video is visualized as a trajectory in mpca subspace . the trajectory generated enables visual interpretation of video-content in a compact space as well as visual-clustering of video-events . the proposed method is evaluated on the pets 2009 datasets through comparison with three existing methods for video-visualization . the mpca visualization shows superior performance in clustering segments of the same event as well as identifying the transitions between events .
