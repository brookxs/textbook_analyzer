using wikipedia-categories for compact representations of chemical documents today , web-pages are usually accessed using text-search engines , whereas documents stored in the deep-web are accessed through domain-specific web-portals . these portals rely on external-knowledge bases , respectively ontologies , mapping documents to more general concepts allowing for suitable classifications and navigational browsing . since automatically generated ontologies are still not satisfactory for advanced information retrieval tasks , most portals heavily rely on hand-crafted domain-specific ontologies . this , however , also leads to high creation and maintaining costs . on the other hand , a freely available community maintained , if somewhat general , knowledge-base is offered by wikipedia . during the last years the coverage of wikipedia has reached a large pool of information including articles from almost all domains . in this paper , we investigate the use of wikipedia-categories to describe the content of chemical documents in a compact form . we compare the results to the domain-specific chebi ontology and the results show that wikipedia-categories indeed allow useful descriptions for chemical documents that are even better than descriptions from the chebi ontology .
