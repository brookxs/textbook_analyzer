hierarchical-graph indexing traffic-analysis , in the context of telecommunications or internet and web-data , is crucial for large-network operations . data in such networks is often provided as large-graphs with hundreds of millions of vertices and edges . we propose efficient techniques for managing such graphs at the storage level in order to facilitate its processing at the interface level (visualization) . the methods are based on a hierarchical-decomposition of the graph edge set that is inherited from a hierarchical-decomposition of the vertex set . real-time navigation is provided by an efficient two level indexing schema called the gkd * - tree . the first level is a variation of a kd - tree-index that partitions the edge set in a way that conforms to the hierarchical-decomposition and the data-distribution (the gkd - tree) . the second level is a redundant r - tree that indexes the leaf pages of the gkd - tree . we provide computational results that illustrate the superiority of the gkd - tree against conventional indexes like the kd-tree and the r * - tree both in creation as well as query response-times .
