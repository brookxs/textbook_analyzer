web-news extraction via path ratios in addition to the news content , most web-news pages also contain navigation panels , advertisements , related news links etc. . these non-news items not only exist outside the news region , but are also present in the news content region . effectively extracting the news content and filtering the noise have important effects on the follow-up activities of content-management and analysis . our extensive case-studies have indicated that there exists potential relevance between web-content layouts and their tag paths . based on this observation , we design two tag path features to measure the importance of nodes : text to tag path ratio (tpr) and extended text to tag path ratio (etpr) , and describe the calculation process of tpr by traversing the parsing-tree of a web-news page . in this paper , we present content-extraction via path ratios (cepr) - a fast , accurate and general on-line method for distinguishing news content from non-news content by the tpr/etpr histogram effectively . in order to improve the ability of cepr in extracting short-texts , we propose a gaussian-smoothing method weighted by a tag path edit-distance . this approach can enhance the importance of internal-link nodes but ignore noise nodes existing in news content . experimental-results on the cleaneval datasets and web-news pages randomly selected from well-known websites show that cepr can extract across multi-resources , multi-styles , and multi-languages . the average f and average score with cepr is 8.69 % and 14.25 % higher than cetr , which demonstrates better web-news extraction performance than most existing methods .
