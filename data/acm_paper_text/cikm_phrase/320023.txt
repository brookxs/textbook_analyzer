practical evaluation of ir within automated-classification systems this paper describes some of the work we have done to evaluate and compare the use of three ir systems (verity , lsi , and smart) as black boxes within an automated-classification environment . we use automated-classification to make a quantitative comparison of the effectiveness of the systems within this context . in so doing , we also develop criteria for the construction of a useful training-set . these results lead to metrics useful in the integration of ir systems into larger applications . we conclude with an initial api for an ir component within an automated-classification architecture .
