topic-driven web-search result organization by leveraging wikipedia semantic-knowledge effective organization of web search-results can greatly improve the utility of search-engine and enhance the quality of search-results . however , the organization of search-results is difficult because the sub-topics of a query are usually not explicitly given . in this paper , we propose a novel topic-driven search-result-organization method , which can first detect the sub-topics of a query by finding the coherent wikipedia concept groups from its search-results ; then organize these results using a topic-driven-clustering algorithm ; in the end we score and rank the topics using the support-vector-regression model . empirical-results show that our method can achieve competitive performance .
