gumshoe quality toolkit : administering programmable search enterprise-search is challenging due to various reasons , notably the dynamic terminology and domain structure that are specific to the enterprise , combined with the fact that search deployments are typically managed by domain-experts who are not necessarily search experts . to address that , it has been proposed to design search architectures that feature two principles : comprehensibility of the ranking mechanism and customizability of the search-engine by means of intuitive runtime rules . the proposed demonstration operates on top of an engine implementation based on this search philosophy , and provides an administrator toolkit to realize the two principles . in particular , the toolkit provides a complete visualization of the provenance (hence ranking) of search-results , embeds an editor for programming runtime rules , facilitates the investigation of (the cause of) missing or low-ranked desired results , and provides suggestions of rewrite-rules to handle such results .
