efficient indexing and querying of xml-data using modified pr fer-sequences with the advent of xml as the new standard for information-representation-and-exchange , indexing and querying of xml-data is of major concern . in this paper , we propose a method for representing an xml-document as a sequence based on a variation of pr fer-sequences . we incorporate new components in the node encodings such as level , number of a certain kind of descendants and develop methods for holistic processing of tree-pattern-queries . the query-processing involves converting the query also into a sequence and performing subsequence-matching on the document sequence . we establish certain interesting properties of the proposed method of sequencing that give rise to a new efficient pattern-matching algorithm . the sequence-data is stored in a two level b + - trees to support query-processing . we also propose an optimization for parent-child axis to speed up the query-processing . our approach does not require any post-processing and guarantees results that are free of false-positives and duplicates . experimental-results show that our system performs significantly better than previous systems in a large number of cases .
