index-filtering and view-materialization in rolap environment using materialized-view to accelerate olap queries is one of the most common methods used in rolap systems . however , high storage and computation-cost make this method very difficult to be implemented in the actual environment . among various issues associated with this , index-selection and view-materialization are two of the top challenges . in this paper , we propose to build indexes on subsets of the primary-keys rather than the full sets if the index selectivity for these smaller indexes can be maintained above the required level . based on that we propose an index-filtering rule , dominant prime (dprime) index set filter , to filter out candidate indexes that have insufficient index selectivity or have cheaper alternatives . in the second part , we propose a view-materialization method , nested relation approach , to group tuples with the same value for index attributes into one super tuple using a nested relation and implement this method using oracle varray . in performance tests , our method outperforms others significantly .
