classical-music for rock fans ? : novel recommendations for expanding user-interests most recommender-algorithms produce types similar to those the active user has accessed before . this is because they measure user-similarity only from the co-rating behaviors against items and compute recommendations by analyzing the items possessed by the users most similar to the active user . in this paper , we define item novelty as the smallest distance from the class the user accessed before to the class that includes target items over the taxonomy . then , we try to accurately recommend highly novel items to the user . first , our method measures user-similarity by employing items rated by users and a taxonomy of items . it can accurately identify many items that may suit the user . second , it creates a graph whose nodes are users ; weighted edges are set between users according to their similarity . it analyzes the user graph and extracts users that are related on the graph though the similarity between the active user and each of those users is not high . the users so extracted are likely to have highly novel items for the active user . an evaluation conducted on several datasets finds that our method accurately identifies items with higher novelty than previous methods .
