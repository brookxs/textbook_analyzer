calculating similarity between texts using graph-based text-representation model knowledge-discovery from a large volumes of texts usually requires many complex-analysis steps . the graph-based text-representation model has been proposed to simplify the steps . the model represents texts in a formal manner , subject-graphs , and provides text-handling operations whose inputs and outputs are identical in form , i.e. a set of subject-graphs , so they can be combined in any order . a subject graph uses node weight to represent the significance of each term , and link weight to represent that of each term-term association . this paper concentrates on the algorithms for making subject-graphs and calculating the similarity between them . an evaluation shows that subject-graphs can calculate the similarity between texts more precisely than term vectors , since they incorporate the significance of association between terms .
