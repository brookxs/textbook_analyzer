structured collaborative-filtering in a general collaborative-filtering (cf) setting , a user-profile contains a set of previously rated items and is used to represent the user 's interest . unfortunately , most cf approaches ignore the underlying structure of user-profiles . in this paper , we argue that a certain class of interest is best represented jointly by several items , drawing an analogy to `` phrases '' in text-retrieval , which are not equivalent to the separate meaning of their words . at an alternative stance , we also consider the situation where , analogously to word synonyms , two items might be substitutable when representing a class of interest . we propose an approach integrating these two notions as opposing poles on a continuum spectrum . upon this , we model the underlying structure in user-profiles , drawing an analogy with text-retrieval . the approach gives rise to a novel structured-vector space model for cf. we show that item-based cf approaches are a special case of the proposed method .
