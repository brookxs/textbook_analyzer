a scalable and effective full-text-search in p2p-networks we consider the problem of full-text-search involving multi-term queries in a network of self-organizing , autonomous peers . existing approaches do not scale well with respect to the number of peers , because they either require access to a large number of peers or incur a high communication cost in order to achieve good query results . in this paper , we present a novel algorithmic-framework for processing multi-term queries in p2p-networks that achieves high recall while using (per-query) a small number of peers and a low communication-cost , thereby enabling high query throughput . our approach is based on per-query peer-selection strategy using two-dimensional histograms of score distributions . a full utilization of the histograms incurs a high communication cost . we show how to drastically reduce this cost by employing a two-phase peer-selection algorithm . we also describe an adaptive-approach to peer-selection that further increases the recall . experiments on a large real-world collection show that the recall is indeed high while the number of involved peers and the communication-cost are low .
