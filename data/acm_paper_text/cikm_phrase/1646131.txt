3se : a semi-structured search-engine for heterogeneous-data in graph-model as the ubiquitous interplay of structured , semi-structured and unstructured-data from different sources , neither db-style structured-query requiring knowledge of full schema and complex language , nor ir-style keyword-search ignoring latent structures , can satisfy users . in this paper , we present a novel semi-structured search-engine (3se) that provides easy , flexible , precise and rapid access to heterogeneous-data represented by a semi-structured graph-model . by using an intuitive 3se query-language (3sql) , users are able to pose queries on heterogeneous-data in a varying degree of structural-constraint according to their knowledge of schema . 3se evaluates 3sql queries as the top - k answers composed of `` logical-units '' and relationship paths between them , and thus can extract meaningful information even if the query conditions are vague , ambiguous , and inaccurate .
