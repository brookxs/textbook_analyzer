vanity fair : privacy in querylog bundles a recently proposed approach to address privacy-concerns in storing web-search querylogs is bundling logs of multiple-users together . in this work we investigate privacy-leaks that are possible even when querylogs from multiple-users are bundled together , without any user or session-identifiers . we begin by quantifying users ' propensity to issue own-name vanity queries and geographically revealing queries . we show that these propensities interact badly with two forms of vulnerabilities in the bundling scheme . first , structural vulnerabilities arise due to properties of the heavy tail of the user-search frequency-distribution , or the distribution of locations that appear within a user 's queries . these heavy tails may cause a user to appear visibly different from other users in the same bundle . second , we demonstrate analytical vulnerabilities based on the ability to separate the queries in a bundle into threads corresponding to individual users . these vulnerabilities raise privacy-issues suggesting that bundling must be handled with great care .
