a novel email-abstraction scheme for spam-detection prior studies on collaborative spam-filtering with near-duplicate similarity-matching scheme mainly represent each email by a succinct abstraction derived from email content text . since these abstractions of emails can not fully catch the evolving nature of spams , we propose in this paper a novel email-abstraction scheme , which considers email layout structure to represent emails . with the proposed abstraction , we design a near-duplicate-matching scheme to efficiently match each incoming email with a huge spam database .
