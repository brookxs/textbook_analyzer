loyalty-based selection : retrieving objects that persistently satisfy criteria a traditional query returns a set of objects that satisfy user defined criteria at the time query was issued . the results are based on the values of objects at query time and may be affected by outliers . intuitively , an object better meets the user 's needs if it persistently satisfies the criteria , i.e. , it satisfies the criteria for majority of the time in the past t time units . in this paper , we propose a measure named loyalty that reflects how persistently an object satisfies the criteria . formally , the loyalty of an object is the total time (in past t time units) it satisfies the query criteria . in this paper , we study top-k loyalty queries over sliding-windows that continuously report k objects with the highest loyalties . each object issues an update when it starts satisfying the criteria or when it stops satisfying the criteria . we show that the lower-bound cost of updating the results of a top-k loyalty query is o (logn) , for each object update , where n is the number of updates issued in last t time units . we conduct a detailed complexity-analysis and show that our proposed algorithm is optimal . moreover , effective pruning techniques are proposed to improve the efficiency . we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing it with a classic sweep line algorithm .
