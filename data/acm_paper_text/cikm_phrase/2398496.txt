shaping communities out of triangles community-detection has arisen as one of the most relevant topics in the field of graph-data mining due to its importance in many fields such as biology , social-networks or network-traffic-analysis . the metrics proposed to shape communities are too lax and do not consider the internal layout of the edges in the community , which lead to undesirable results . we define a new community metric called wcc . the proposed metric meets a minimum set of basic properties that guarantees communities with structure and cohesion . we experimentally show that wcc correctly quantifies the quality of communities and community partitions using real and synthetic datasets , and compare some of the most used community-detection algorithms in the state-of-the-art .
