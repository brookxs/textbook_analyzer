a system for query-specific document-summarization there has been a great amount of work on query-independent summarization of documents . however , due to the success of web-search-engines query-specific document-summarization (query result snippets) has become an important problem , which has received little attention . we present a method to create query-specific summaries by identifying the most query-relevant fragments and combining them using the semantic associations within the document . in particular , we first add structure to the documents in the preprocessing stage and convert them to document graphs . then , the best summaries are computed by calculating the top spanning-trees on the document graphs . we present and experimentally evaluate efficient-algorithms that support computing summaries in interactive time . furthermore , the quality of our summarization-method is compared to current approaches using a user-survey .
