on combining-multiple-clusterings many problems can be reduced to the problem of combining-multiple-clusterings . in this paper , we first summarize different application-scenarios of combining-multiple-clusterings and provide a new perspective of viewing the problem as a categorical-clustering problem . we then show the connections between various consensus and clustering criteria and discuss the complexity-results of the problem . finally we propose a new method to determine the final clustering . experiments on kinship terms and clustering popular-music from heterogeneous feature-sets show the effectiveness of combining-multiple-clusterings .
