what can quantum-theory bring to information-retrieval the probabilistic-formalism of quantum-physics is said to provide a sound basis for building a principled information-retrieval-framework . such a framework can be based on the notion of information-need vector-spaces where events , such as document-relevance or observed user-interactions , correspond to subspaces . as in quantum-theory , a probability-distribution over these subspaces is defined through weighted sets of state vectors (density operators) , and used to represent the current view of the retrieval-system on the user-information need . tensor spaces can be used to capture different aspects of information-needs . our evaluation shows that the framework can lead to acceptable performance in an ad-hoc-retrieval task . going beyond this , we discuss the potential of the framework for three active challenges in information-retrieval , namely , interaction , novelty and diversity .
