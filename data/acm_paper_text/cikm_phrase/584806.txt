analysis of pre-computed partition top method for range top-k-queries in olap data cubes in decision-support-systems , having knowledge on the top k values is more informative and crucial than the maximum value . unfortunately , the naive method involves high computational cost and the existing methods for range-max query are inefficient if applied directly . in this paper , we propose a pre-computed partition top method (ppt) to partition the data-cube and pre-store a number of top values for improving query-performance . the main focus of this study is to find the optimum values for two parameters , i.e. , the partition factor (b) and the number of pre-stored values (r) , through analytical approach . a cost-function based on poisson-distribution is used for the analysis . the analytical results obtained are verified against simulation-results . it is shown that the ppt method outperforms other alternative methods significantly when proper b and r are used .
