tellmyrelevance ! : predicting the relevance of web-search-results from cursor interactions it is crucial for the success of a search-driven web-application to answer users ' queries in the best possible way . a common approach is to use click-models for guessing the relevance of search-results . however , these models are imprecise and waive valuable information one can gain from non-click user-interactions . we introduce tellmyrelevance ! -- a novel automatic end-to-end pipeline for tracking cursor interactions at the client , analyzing these and learning according relevance-models . yet , the models depend on the layout of the search-results page involved , which makes them difficult to evaluate and compare . thus , we use a random mouse-cursor as an extension to our pipeline for generating layout-dependent baselines . based on these , we can perform evaluations of real-world relevance-models . a large-scale interaction-log-analysis showed that we can learn relevance-models whose predictions compare favorably to predictions of an existing state-of-the-art click-model .
