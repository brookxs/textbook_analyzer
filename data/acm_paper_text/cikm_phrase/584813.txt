vulnerabilities in similarity-search_based systems similarity_based queries are common in several modern database-applications , such as multimedia , scientific , and biomedical databases . in most of these systems , database responds with the tuple with the closest match according to some metric . in this paper we investigate some important security issues related to similarity-search in databases . we investigate the vulnerability of such systems against users who try to copy the database by sending automated queries . we analyze two models for similarity-search , namely reply model and score model . reply model responds with the tuple with best match and score model responds with only the score of similarity-search . for these models we analyze possible ways of attacks and strategies that can be used to detect attacks . our analysis shows that in score model it is much easier to plug the vulnerabilities than in reply model . sophisticated attacks can easily be used in reply model and the database is limited in capability to prevent such attacks .
