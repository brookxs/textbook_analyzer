finding top k most influential spatial facilities over uncertain objects uncertainty is inherent in many important applications , such as location-based-services (lbs) , sensor monitoring and radio-frequency-identification (rfid) . recently , considerable research efforts have been put into the field of uncertainty-aware spatial-query-processing . in this paper , we study the problem of finding top k most influential facilities over a set of uncertain objects , which is an important spatial-query in the above applications . based on the maximal utility principle , we propose a new ranking-model to identify the top k most influential facilities , which carefully captures influence of facilities on the uncertain objects . by utilizing two uncertain object indexing-techniques , r-tree and u-quadtree , effective and efficient-algorithms are proposed following the filtering and verification paradigm , which significantly improves the performance of the algorithms in terms of cpu and i/o costs . comprehensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques .
