information preservation in static index-pruning we develop a new static index-pruning criterion based on the notion of information preservation . this idea is motivated by the fact that model degeneration , as does static index-pruning , inevitably reduces the predictive-power of the resulting model . we model this loss in predictive-power using conditional-entropy and show that the decision in static index-pruning can therefore be optimized to preserve information as much as possible . we evaluated the proposed approach on three different test-corpora , and the result shows that our approach is comparable in retrieval-performance to state-of-the-art methods . when efficiency is of concern , our method has some advantages over the reference methods and is therefore suggested in web-retrieval settings .
