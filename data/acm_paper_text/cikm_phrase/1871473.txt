improved latent concept-expansion using hierarchical markov random-fields most existing query-expansion approaches for ad-hoc-retrieval adopt overly simplistic textual representations that treat documents as bags of words and ignore inherent document-structure . these simple representations often lead to incorrect independence assumptions in the proposed approaches and result in limited retrieval-effectiveness . in this paper , we propose a novel query-expansion technique that models the various types of dependencies that exist between original query terms and expansion terms within a robust , unified-framework . the proposed model is called hierarchical markov random-fields (hmrfs) , based on latent concept-expansion (lce) . by exploiting implicit (or explicit) hierarchical-structure within documents , hmrfs can incorporate hierarchical interactions which are important for modeling term dependencies in an efficient manner . our rigorous experimental-evaluation carried out using several trec-data sets shows that our proposed query-expansion technique consistently and significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art query-expansion approaches , including relevance-based-language-models and lce .
