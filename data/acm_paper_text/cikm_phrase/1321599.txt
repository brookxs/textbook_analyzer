ranking very many typed entities on wikipedia we discuss the problem of ranking very many entities of different types . in particular we deal with a heterogeneous set of types , some being very generic and some very specific . we discuss two approaches for this problem : i) exploiting the entity containment graph and ii) using a web-search-engine to compute entity relevance . we evaluate these approaches on the real task of ranking wikipedia entities typed with a state-of-the-art named-entity tagger . results show that both approaches can greatly increase the performance of methods based only on passage-retrieval .
