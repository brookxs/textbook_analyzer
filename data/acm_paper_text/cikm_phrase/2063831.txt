high efficiency and quality : large-graphs matching graph-matching plays an essential role in many real applications . in this paper , we study how to match two large-graphs by maximizing the number of matched edges , which is known as maximum-common-subgraph matching and is np-hard . to find exact-matching , it can not handle a graph with more than 30 nodes . to find an approximate-matching , the quality can be very poor . we propose a novel two-step approach which can efficiently match two large-graphs over thousands of nodes with high matching quality . in the first step , we propose an anchor-selection/expansion approach to compute a good initial matching . in the second step , we propose a new approach to refine the initial matching . we give the optimality of our refinement and discuss how to randomly refine the matching with different combinations . we conducted extensive testing using real and synthetic datasets , and will report our findings .
