digging for knowledge with information-extraction : a case-study on human gene-disease-associations we present the information-extraction-system text2semrel . the system (semi -) automatically constructs knowledge-bases from textual data consisting of facts about entities using semantic-relations . an integral part of the system is a graph-based interactive-visualization and search layer . the second contribution in this paper is the presentation of a case-study on the (semi -) automatic-construction of a knowledge-base consisting of gene-disease-associations . the resulting knowledge-base , the l iterature-derived h uman g ene - d isease n etwork (lhgdn) , is now an integral part of the linked life data initiative and represents currently the largest publicly available gene-disease repository . the lhgdn is compared against several curated state-of-the-art databases . a unique feature of the lhgdn is that the semantics of the associations constitute a wide variety of biomolecular conditions .
