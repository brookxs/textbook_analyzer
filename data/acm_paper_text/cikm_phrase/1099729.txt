semantic querying of tree-structured-data sources using partially specified tree patterns nowadays , huge volumes of data are organized or exported in a tree-structured form . querying capabilities are provided through queries that are based on branching path-expression . even for a single knowledge domain structural differences raise difficulties for querying data sources in a uniform way . in this paper , we present a method for semantically querying tree-structured-data sources using partially specified tree patterns . based on dimensions which are sets of semantically related nodes in tree-structures , we define dimension graphs . dimension graphs can be automatically extracted from trees and abstract their structural-information . they are semantically rich constructs that support the formulation of queries and their efficient evaluation . we design a tree-pattern query-language to query multiple tree-structured-data sources . a central feature of this language is that the structure can be specified fully , partially , or not at all in the queries . therefore , it can be used to query multiple trees with structural differences . \ % and we study the derivation of structural expressions in queries by introducing a set of inference-rules for structural expressions . we define two types of query unsatisfiability and we provide necessary and sufficient-conditions for checking each of them . our approach is validated through experimental-evaluation .
