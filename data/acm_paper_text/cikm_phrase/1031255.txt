motion adaptive-indexing for moving continual-queries over moving-objects this paper describes a <i> motion adaptive </i> indexing-scheme for efficient evaluation of moving continual-queries (mcqs) over moving-objects . it uses the concept of <i> motion-sensitive bounding-boxes </i> (<i> msb </i> s) to model moving-objects and moving queries . these bounding-boxes automatically adapt their sizes to the dynamic motion behaviors of individual objects . instead of indexing frequently changing object positions , we index less frequently changing object and query <i> msb </i> s , where updates to the bounding-boxes are needed only when objects and queries move across the boundaries of their boxes . this helps decrease the number of updates to the indexes . more importantly , we use <i> predictive query results </i> to optimistically precalculate query results , decreasing the number of searches on the indexes . motion-sensitive bounding-boxes are used to incrementally update the predictive query results . our experiments show that the proposed motion adaptive-indexing scheme is efficient for the evaluation of moving continual range-queries .
