selectively diversifying web-search-results search-result-diversification is a natural approach for tackling ambiguous-queries . nevertheless , not all queries are equally ambiguous , and hence different queries could benefit from different diversification strategies . a more lenient or more aggressive diversification strategy is typically encoded by existing approaches as a trade-off between promoting relevance or diversity in the search-results . in this paper , we propose to learn such a trade-off on a per-query basis . in particular , we examine how the need for diversification can be learnt for each query - given a diversification approach and an unseen query , we predict an effective trade-off between relevance and diversity based on similar previously seen queries . thorough experiments using the trec clueweb09 collection show that our selective approach can significantly outperform a uniform diversification for both classical and state-of-the-art diversification approaches .
