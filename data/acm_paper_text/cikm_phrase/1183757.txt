k-nearest-neighbor classification across multiple private databases distributed privacy-preserving-data-mining tools are critical for mining multiple databases with a minimum information-disclosure . we present a framework including a general-model as well as multi-round algorithms for mining horizontally partitioned databases using a privacy-preserving k-nearest-neighbor (k nn) classifier .
