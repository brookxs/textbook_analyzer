active-exploration : simultaneous sampling and labeling for large-graphs modern information networks , such as social-networks , are often characterized with large sizes and dynamic changing structures . to analyze these networks , existing solutions commonly rely on graph-sampling techniques to reduce network sizes , and then carry out succeeding mining processes , such as labeling network-nodes to build classification-models . such a sampling-then-labeling paradigm assumes that the whole network is available for sampling and the sampled network is useful for all subsequent tasks (such as network-classification) . yet real-world networks are rarely immediately available unless the sampling process progressively crawls every single node and its connections . meanwhile , without knowing the underlying analytic objective , the sampled network can hardly produce quality results . in this paper , we propose an active-exploration framework for large-graphs where the goal is to carry out network sampling and node-labeling at the same time . to achieve this goal , we consider a network as a markov-chain and compute its stationary-distribution by using supervised random-walks . the stationary-distribution of the sampled network help identify important nodes to be explored in the next step , and the labeling process labels the most informative node which in turn strengthens the sampling process . the mutually and simultaneously enhanced sampling and labeling processes ensure that the final network contains a maximum number of nodes directly related to the underlying mining tasks .
