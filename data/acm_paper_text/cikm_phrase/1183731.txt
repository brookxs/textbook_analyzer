approximate reverse k-nearest neighbor queries in general-metric-spaces in this paper , we propose an approach for efficient approximative r k nn search in arbitrary metric-spaces where the value of k is specified at query time . our method uses an approximation of the nearest-neighbor-distances in order to prune the search-space . in several experiments , our solution scales significantly better than existing non-approximative approaches while producing an approximation of the true query result with a high recall .
