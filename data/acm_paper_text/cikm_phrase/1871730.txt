incorporating terminology evolution for query-translation in text-retrieval with association-rules time-stamped documents such as newswire articles , blog posts and other web-pages are often archived online . when these archives cover long spans of time , the terminology within them could undergo significant changes . hence , when users pose queries pertaining to historical-information , over such documents , the queries need to be translated , taking into account these temporal-changes , to provide accurate responses to users . for example , a query on sri lanka should automatically retrieve documents with its former name ceylon . we call such concepts sitacs , i.e. , semantically identical temporally altering concepts . in order to discover sitacs , we propose an approach based on a novel framework constituting an integration of natural-language-processing , association-rule-mining , and contextual-similarity as a learning-technique . the proposed approach has been experimented with real-data and has been found to yield good results with respect to efficiency and accuracy .
