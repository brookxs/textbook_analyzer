information-access in implicit-culture framework the goal of a system for implicit-culture support (sics) is to establish an implicit culture phenomenon , namely when the elements of a set behave according to the culture of a generally different group of agents . earlier work claimed that implicit-culture support can be seen as a generalization of collaborative-filtering . in this paper , we recall the concept of implicit-culture , show how it is useful for automatically exploit tacit-knowledge and we present an implementation of a system for implicit-culture support .
