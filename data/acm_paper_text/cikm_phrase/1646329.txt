asic : algebra-based structural-index comparison structural-indices play a significant role in improving the efficiency of xml-query-evaluation . being able to compare various structural-indexing techniques is critical for a dbms to select which indices to support , for the query-optimizer to choose an index to use in query-evaluation , and for dbas to configure a database-application . we present asic , an algebra-based structural-index comparison framework that aids users in understanding the ability of different types of structural-indices in answering xpath-queries which have been characterized using the xpath-algebra . asic allows users to select , configure and construct structural-indices for comparison , guides users to compare the selected indices by evaluating queries of a particular xpath sub-algebra , and visually displays the index-structures , query-evaluation plans , and performance results for analysis and comparison .
