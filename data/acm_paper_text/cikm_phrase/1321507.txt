mapgraph : efficient methods for complex olap hierarchies online-analytical-processing is a database paradigm that provides for the rich analysis of multi-dimensional-data . olap is often supported by a logical-structure known as the cube . however , supporting efficient olap-query resolution in enterprise scale environments is an issue of considerable complexity . in practice , the difficulty of the problem is exacerbated by the existence of dimension hierarchies that sub-divide core dimensions into aggregation layers of varying granularity . common hierarchy-sensitive query-operations such as rollup and drilldown can be very costly on large cubes . moreover , facilities for the representation of more complex hierarchical-relationships are not well supported by conventional techniques . this paper presents a robust hierarchy infrastructure called mapgraph that supports the efficient and transparent manipulation of attribute-hierarchies within olap environments . experimental-results verify that , when compared to the alternatives , very little additional overhead is introduced , even when advanced functionality is exploited .
