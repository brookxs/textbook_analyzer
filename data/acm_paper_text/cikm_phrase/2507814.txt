a hybrid-approach for privacy-preserving processing of knn queries in mobile-database-systems in mobile object database-systems , both query issuers and queried objects are subject to location-privacy intrusion . one solution to this problem is to have users reduce their location resolution when making location-update . such location cloaking allows mobile-objects to achieve a desired level of protection , but may not produce accurate query results . alternatively , one can apply cryptography techniques such as secure-multiparty-computation to compute the spatial-relationship among mobile-objects without having mobile-objects to disclose their location at all . this strategy produces high quality query results , but in general are computation-intensive , especially when a large number of mobile-objects are involved . in this paper , we present a hybrid-approach that mitigates the above dilemma . our idea is to compute approximate-query results based on cloaked location-information and then refine query results by applying homomorphic-encryption . we demonstrate that this approach can be used for efficient and privacy-preserving processing of knn queries and evaluate its performance through simulation .
