expert-identification in community-question-answering : exploring question selection-bias community-question-answering (cqa) services enables users to ask and answer questions . in these communities , there are typically a small number of experts amongst the large population of users . we study which questions a user select for answering and show that experts prefer answering questions where they have a higher chance of making a valuable contribution . we term this preferential selection as question selection-bias and propose a mathematical-model to estimate it . our results show that using gaussian classification-models we can effectively distinguish experts from ordinary-users over their selection biases . in order to estimate these biases , only a small amount of data per user is required , which makes an early identification of expertise a possibility . further , our study of bias evolution reveals that they do not show significant changes over time indicating that they emanates from the intrinsic characteristics of users .
