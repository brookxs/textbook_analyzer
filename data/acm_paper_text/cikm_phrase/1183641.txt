mining compressed commodity workflows from massive rfid data sets radio-frequency-identification (rfid) technology is fast becoming a prevalent tool in tracking commodities in supply-chain-management applications . the movement of commodities through the supply-chain forms a gigantic workflow that can be mined for the discovery of trends , flow correlations and outlier paths , that in turn can be valuable in understanding and optimizing business processes.in this paper , we propose a method to construct compressed probabilistic workflows that capture the movement trends and significant exceptions of the overall data-sets , but with a size that is substantially smaller than that of the complete rfid workflow . compression is achieved based on the following observations : (1) only a relatively small minority of items deviate from the general-trend , (2) only truly non-redundant deviations , ie , those that substantially deviate from the previously recorded ones , are interesting , and (3) although rfid data is registered at the primitive level , data-analysis usually takes place at a higher abstraction-level . techniques for workflow compression based on non-redundant transition and emission probabilities are derived ; and an algorithm for computing approximate path probabilities is developed . our experiments demonstrate the utility and feasibility of our design , data-structure , and algorithms .
