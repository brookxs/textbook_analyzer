discovering quasi-equivalence relationships from database-systems association-rule-mining has recently attracted strong attention and proven to be a highly successful technique for extracting useful information from very-large-databases . in this paper , we explore a generalized affinity-based association-mining which discovers quasi-equivalent media-objects in a distributed information-providing environment consisting of a network of heterogeneous-databases which could be relational-databases , hierarchical databases , object-oriented-databases , multimedia-databases , etc. . online-databases , consisting of millions of media-objects , have been used in business management , government administration , scientific and engineering data management , and many other applications owing to the recent advances in high-speed communication-networks and large-capacity storage-devices . because of the navigational characteristic , queries in such an information-providing environment tend to traverse equivalent media-objects residing in different databases for the related data records . as the number of databases increases , query-processing efficiency depends heavily on the capability to discover the equivalence relationships of the media-objects from the network of databases . theoretical terms along with an empirical-study of real databases are presented .
