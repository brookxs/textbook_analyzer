link-prediction : the power of maximal-entropy-random-walk link-prediction is a fundamental problem in social-network-analysis . the key technique in unsupervised link-prediction is to find an appropriate similarity-measure between nodes of a network . a class of wildly used similarity-measures are based on random-walk on graph . the traditional random-walk (trw) considers the link-structures by treating all nodes in a network equivalently , and ignores the centrality of nodes of a network . however , in many real networks , nodes of a network not only prefer to link to the similar node , but also prefer to link to the central nodes of the network . to address this issue , we use maximal-entropy-random-walk (merw) for link-prediction , which incorporates the centrality of nodes of the network . first , we study certain important properties of merw on graph $ g$ by constructing an eigen-weighted graph g . we show that the transition-matrix and stationary-distribution of merw on g are identical to the ones of trw on g. based on g , we further give the maximal entropy graph laplacians , and show how to fast compute the hitting-time and commute time of merw . second , we propose four new graph-kernels and two similarity-measures based on merw for link-prediction . finally , to exhibit the power of merw in link-prediction , we compare 27 various link-prediction methods over 3 synthetic and 8 real networks . the results show that our newly proposed merw_based methods outperform the state-of-the-art method on most datasets .
