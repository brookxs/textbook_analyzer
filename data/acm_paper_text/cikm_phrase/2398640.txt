finding influential products on social domination game in this paper , we propose a new type of market-model called the social domination game-model . given a set c of customers and a set p of products , this model simulates market competition among p and estimates market shares , considering both the dominance relation between c and p and the influence relation among the members of c. with this model , we propose a greedy product positioning algorithm for designing a new-product that approximately maximizes market share . our experimental-results show that the proposed algorithm creates a new-product gaining up to 97.5 % market share of the best product 's market share obtained by the exact method , while significantly outperforming the exact method in terms of running-time , i.e. , by up to two orders of magnitude .
