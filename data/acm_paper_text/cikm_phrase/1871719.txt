affinity-driven prediction and ranking of products in online product review sites large online product review websites (e.g. , epinions , blippr) to various types of products . typically , each product in these sites is associated with a group of members who have provided ratings and comments on it . these people form a product-community . a potential member can join a produce community by giving a new rating to the product . we refer to this phenomenon of a product-community 's ability to `` attract '' new members as product affinity . the knowledge of a ranked list of products based on product affinity is of much importance to be utilized for implementing policies , marketing research , online-advertisement , and other applications . in this paper , we identify and analyze an array of features that exert effect on product affinity and propose a novel model , called affrank , that utilizes these features to predict the-future rank of products according to their affinities . evaluated on a real-world dataset , we demonstrate the effectiveness and superior prediction-quality of affrank compared to baseline methods . our experiments show that features such as affinity-rank history , affinity evolution distance , and average rating are the most important factors affecting future rank of products .
