adapt : adaptive database-schema design for multi-tenant applications multi-tenant data-management is a major application of software-as-a-service (saas) . many companies outsource their data to a third party which hosts a multi-tenant database-system to provide data-management service . the system should have high-performance , low space and excellent scalability . one big challenge is to devise a high-quality database-schema . independent tables shared instances and shared tables shared instances are two state-of-the-art methods . however , the former has poor scalability , while the latter achieves good scalability at the expense of poor performance and high space-overhead . in this paper , we trade-off between the two methods and propose an adaptive database-schema design-approach to achieve good scalability and high-performance with low space . to this end , we identify the important attributes and use them to generate a base table . for other attributes , we construct supplementary tables . we propose a cost-based model to adaptively generate the tables above . our method has the following advantages . first , our method achieves high scalability . second , our method can trade-off performance and space requirement . third , our method can be easily applied to existing databases (e.g. , mysql) with minor revisions . fourth , our method can adapt to any schemas and query workloads . experimental-results show our method achieves high-performance and good scalability with low space and outperforms state-of-the-art method .
