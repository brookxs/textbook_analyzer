efficient phrase querying with flat-position-index a large proportion of search-engine-queries contain phrases , namely a sequence of adjacent words . in this paper , we propose to use flat-position-index (a.k.a schema-independent index) for phrase-query-evaluation . in the flat-position-index , the entire document-collection is viewed as a huge sequence of tokens . each token is represented by one flat position , which is a unique position offset from the beginning of the collection . each indexed term is associated with a list of the flat positions about that term in the sequence . to recover docid from flat positions efficiently , we propose a novel cache sensitive look-up-table (cslt) , which is much faster than existing search-algorithms . experiments on trec gov2 data-collection show that flat-position-index can reduce the index-size and speed up phrase querying substantially , compared with traditional word-level index .
