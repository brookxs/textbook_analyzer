summarizing local-context to personalize global web-search the pc desktop is a very rich repository of personal-information , efficiently capturing user 's interests . in this paper we propose a new approach towards an automatic personalization of web-search in which the user specific information is extracted from such local desktops , thus allowing for an increased quality of user profiling , while sharing less private-information with the search-engine . more specifically , we investigate the opportunities to select personalized query expansion terms for web-search using three different desktop oriented approaches : summarizing the entire desktop data , summarizing only the desktop documents relevant to each user-query , and applying natural-language-processing-techniques to extract dispersive lexical compounds from relevant desktop-resources . our experiments with the google-api showed at least the latter two techniques to produce a very strong improvement over current web search .
