travel-route-recommendation using geotags in photo-sharing sites the ability to create geotagged-photos enables people to share their personal-experiences as tourists at specific locations and times . assuming that the collection of each photographer 's geotagged-photos is a sequence of visited locations , photo-sharing sites are important sources for gathering the location histories of tourists . by following their location sequences , we can find representative and diverse travel routes that link key landmarks . in this paper , we propose a travel-route-recommendation method that makes use of the photographers ' histories as held by flickr . recommendations are performed by our photographer-behavior-model , which estimates the probability of a photographer visiting a landmark . we incorporate user-preference and present location-information into the probabilistic behavior-model by combining topic-models and markov-models . we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a real-life dataset holding information from 71,718 photographers taken in the united-states in terms of the prediction-accuracy of travel behavior .
