creating user-interfaces that entice people to manage better information much research in information-management begins by asking how to manage a given information corpus . but information-management-systems can only be as good as the information they manage . they struggle and often fail to correctly infer meaning from large blobs of text and the mysterious actions and demands of users . and they are useless for managing-information that is never captured . instead of accepting the existing information as an immutable condition , i will argue that there are significant opportunities to help and motivate people to improve the quality and quantity of information their tools manage , and to exploit that better information to benefit its users . the greatest challenge in doing so is developing systems , and particularly user-interfaces , that overcome humans ' perverse reluctance to invest small present-moment effort for large future payoffs . effective systems must minimize the effort needed to record high-quality information and maximize the perceived future benefits of that information investment . i will support these ideas with examples covering structured-data management and presentation , notetaking , collaborative-filtering , and social-media .
