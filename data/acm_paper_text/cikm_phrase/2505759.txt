context-aware top-k-processing using views search-applications where queries are dependent on their context are becoming increasingly relevant in today 's online applications . for example , the context may be the location of the user in location - aware search or the social-network of the query initiator in social-aware search . processing such queries efficiently is inherently difficult , and requires techniques that go beyond the existing , context-agnostic ones . a promising direction for efficient , online answering -- especially in the case of top-k-queries -- is to materialize and exploit previous query results (views) . we consider context-aware query-optimization based on views , focusing on two important sub-problems . first , handling the possible differences in context between the various views and an input query leads to view results having uncertain scores , i.e. , score ranges valid for the new context . as a consequence , current top-k-algorithms are no longer directly applicable and need to be adapted to handle such uncertainty in object scores . second , adapted view-selection techniques are needed , which can leverage both the descriptions of queries and statistics over their results . we present algorithms that address these two problems , and illustrate their practical use in two important application-scenarios : location-aware search and social-aware search . we validate our approaches via extensive experiments , using both synthetic and real-world datasets .
