iloc : a framework for incremental location-state acquisition and prediction based on mobile-sensors much research focuses on predicting a person 's geo-spatial traversal-patterns using a history of recorded geo-coordinates . in this paper , we focus on the problem of predicting location-state transitions . location-states for a user refer to a set of anchoring points/regions in space , and the prediction-task produces a sequence of predicted location states for a given query time window . if this problem can be solved accurately and efficiently , it may lead to new location-based-services (lbs) that can smartly recommend information to a user based on his current and future location states . the proposed iloc (i ncremental (l ocation-state acquisition and prediction) framework solves the prediction problem by utilizing the sensor information provided by a user 's mobile-device . it incrementally learns the location states by constantly monitoring the signal environment of the mobile-device . further , the framework tightly integrates the learning and prediction modules , allowing iloc to update location-states continuously and predict future location-states at the same time . our extensive experiments show that the quality of the location-states learned by iloc are better than the state-of-the-art . we also show that when other learners failed to produce reasonable predictions , iloc provides good forecasts . as for the efficiency , iloc processes the data in a single pass , which fits well to many data-stream-processing models .
