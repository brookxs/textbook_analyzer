predicting aggregate social-activities using continuous-time stochastic-process how to accurately model and predict the-future status of social-networks has become an important problem in recent years . conventional solutions to such a problem often employ topological-structure of the sociogram , i.e. , friendship links . however , they often disregard different levels of activeness of social-actors and become insufficient to deal with complex dynamics of user-behaviors . in this paper , to address this issue , we first refine the notion of social-activity to better describe dynamic user behaviors in social-networks . we then propose a parameterized social-activity model (psam) using continuous-time stochastic-process for predicting aggregate social-activities . with social-activities evolving over time , psam itself also evolves and therefore dynamically captures the real-time characteristics of the current active population . our experiments using two real social-networks (facebook and citeseer) reveal that the proposed psam model is effective in simulating social-activity evolution and predicting aggregate social-activities accurately at different time-scales .
