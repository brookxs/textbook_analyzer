trajectory queries and octagons in moving-object-databases an important class of queries in moving-object-databases involves trajectories . we propose to divide trajectory predicates into topological and non-topological parts ; extend the 9 intersection model of egenhofer-franzosa to a 3-step evaluation-strategy for trajectory queries : a filter step , a refinement step , and a tracing step.the filter and refinement steps are similar to region searches . as in spatial-databases , approximations of trajectories are typically used in evaluating trajectory queries . in earlier studies , minimum bounding-boxes (mbr s) are used to approximate trajectory segments which allow index-structures to be built , e.g. , tb-trees and r * - trees . the use of mbr s hinders the efficiency since mbr s are very coarse approximations especially for trajectory segments . to overcome this problem , we propose a new type of approximations , `` minimum bounding octagon prism '' mbop . we extend r * - tree to a new index-structure `` octagon-prism tree '' (op-tree) for mbop s of trajectory segments . we conducted experiments to evaluate efficiency of op-trees in performing region searches and trajectory queries . the results show that op-trees improve region searches significantly over synthetic trajectory-data sets to tb-trees and r * - trees and can significantly reduce the evaluation cost of trajectory queries compared to tb-trees .
