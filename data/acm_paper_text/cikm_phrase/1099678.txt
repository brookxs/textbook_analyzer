predicting accuracy of extracting information from unstructured-text collections exploiting lexical and semantic-relationships in large unstructured-text collections can significantly enhance managing , integrating , and querying information locked in unstructured-text . most notably , named-entities and relations between entities are crucial for effective question-answering and other information-retrieval and knowledge-management tasks . unfortunately , the success in extracting these relationships can vary for different domains , languages , and document-collections . predicting extraction performance is an important step towards scalable and intelligent knowledge management , information-retrieval and information-integration . we present a general language-modeling method for quantifying the difficulty of information-extraction-tasks . we demonstrate the viability of our approach by predicting performance of real-world information-extraction-tasks , named-entity-recognition and relation-extraction .
