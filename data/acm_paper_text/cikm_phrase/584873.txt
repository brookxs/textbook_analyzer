mining temporal classes from time-series-data in this investigation , we discuss how to mine temporal class schemes to model a collection of time-series-data . from the viewpoint of temporal-data-mining , this problem can be seen as discretizing time-series-data or aggregating them . also this can be considered as screening (or noise-filtering) . from the viewpoint of temporal-databases , the issue is how we represent the data and how we can obtain intensional aspects as temporal schemes . in other words , we discuss scheme-discovery for temporal-data . given a collection of temporal objects along with time axis (called log) , we examine the data and we introduce a notion of temporal frequent classes to describe them . as the main results of this investigation , we can show that there exists one and only one interval decomposition and the temporal classes related to them . also we give experimental-results that prove the feasibility to time-series-data .
