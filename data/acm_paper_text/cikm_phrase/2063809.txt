context-based people-search in labeled social-networks in online-social-networking-services , there are a range of scenarios in which users want to search a particular person given the targeted person one 's name . the challenge of such people-search is namesake , which means that there are many people possess the same names in the social-network . in this paper , we propose to leverage the query-contexts to tackle such problems . for example , given the information of one 's graduation year and city , the last names of some individuals , one may wish to find classmates from his/her high-school . we formulate such problem as the context-based people-search . given a social-network in which each node is associated with a set of labels and given a query set of labels consisting of a targeted name label and other context labels , our goal is to return a ranking list of persons who possess the targeted name label and connects to other context labels with minimum communication-costs through an effective subgraph in the social-network . we consider the interactions among query labels to propose a grouping-based method to solve the context-based people-search . our method consists of three major parts . first , we model those nodes with query labels into a group graph which is able to reduce the search-space to enhance the time efficiency . second , we identify three different kinds of connectors which connecting different groups , and exploit connectors to find the corresponding detailed graph-topology from the group graph . third , we propose a connector-steiner tree-algorithm to retrieve a resulting ranked list of individuals who possess the targeted label . experimental-results on the dblp bibliography data show that our grouping-based method can reach the good quality of returned persons as a greedy-search-algorithm at a considerable outperformance on the time efficiency .
