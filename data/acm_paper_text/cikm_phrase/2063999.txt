sentiment-classification via l2-norm deep-belief-network automatic-analysis of sentiments expressed in large-scale online-reviews is very important for intelligent business-applications . sentiment-classification is the most popular task of sentiment-analysis , which is more challenging than traditional topic-based-text-classification . basic features , such as vocabulary words , are not enough to classify sentiments well . deep-belief-network (dbn) is introduced to discover more abstract features of sentiments . to capture full information of the features , large-size network can be constructed , but at the same time , large-size network tends to over fit the training-data and even noise , which will reduce the generalization ability of the network . in this paper , l2-norm deep-belief-network (l2dbn) is proposed , which uses l2-norm-regularization to optimize the network parameters of dbn . l2dbn is first initialized by an unsupervised layer-wise training-algorithm , and then fine-tuned by a supervised procedure . network parameters are optimized using both classification loss and network-complexity . experimental-results show that the proposed l2dbn outperforms the state-of-the-art method and the basic dbn on golden , noisy and heterogeneous datasets .
