using navigation data to improve ir functions in the context of web-search as part of the process of delivering content , devices like proxies and gateways log valuable information about the activities and navigation-patterns of users on the web . in this study , we consider how this navigation data can be used to improve web-search . a query posted to a search-engine together with the set of pages accessed during a search-task is known as a search-session . we develop a mixture-model for the observed set of search-sessions , and propose variants of the classical em-algorithm for training . the model itself yields a type of navigation-based query-clustering . by implicitly borrowing-strength between related queries , the mixture formulation allows us to identify the `` highly relevant '' urls for each query cluster . next , we explore methods for incorporating existing labeled-data (the yahoo! directory , for example) to speed convergence and help resolve low-traffic clusters . finally , the mixture formulation also provides for a simple , hierarchical-display of search-results based on the query clusters . the effectiveness of our approach is evaluated using proxy-access-logs for the outgoing lucent proxy .
