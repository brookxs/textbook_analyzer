building recommendation-systems using peer-to-peer shared-content peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are used for sharing content by millions of users . often , meta-data used for searching is missing or wrong , making it difficult for users to find content . moreover , searching for new content is almost impossible . recommender-systems are unable to handle p2p data due to inherent difficulties , such as implicit ranking , noise and the extreme dimensions and sparseness of the network . this paper introduces methods for using p2p data in recommender-systems . we present a method for creating content-similarity graph while overcoming inherent noise . using this graph , a clustering-method is presented for detecting proximity between files using the `` wisdom-of-the-crowds '' . evaluation using songs shared by over 1.2 million users in the gnutella network , shows that these techniques can leverage p2p data for building efficient recommender-systems .
