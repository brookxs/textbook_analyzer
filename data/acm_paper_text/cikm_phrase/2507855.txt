generalizing diversity detection in blog-feed-retrieval the goal of a blog-retrieval system is to retrieve and rank blogs , as collections of documents , in response to a given query . previous studies have shown that diversity among the top retrieved posts from a blog is a positive feature for indicating relevance of the blog to the query . however , existing methods capture the diversity of a blog using post-level properties that limits their application to a specific category of retrieval-methods . in this paper , we propose a blog-level diversity measure where there is no assumption made about the underlying blog-ranking technique . the proposed measure enables us to integrate diversity in any existing blog-retrieval method . our experimental-results show that the proposed method , while being more general , produces comparable results to the post-level diversity detection methods .
