exploring path-query results through relevance-feedback feedback driven data-exploration schemes have been implemented for non-structured-data (such as text) and document-centric-xml collections where formulating precise queries is often impossible . in this paper , we study the problem of enabling exploratory access , through ranking , to data-centric-xml . given a path-query and a set of results identified by the system to this query over the data , we consider feedback which captures the user 's preference for some features over the others . the feedback can be `` positive '' or `` negative '' . to deal with feedback , we develop a probabilistic feature significance measure and describe how to use this for ranking results in the presence of dependencies between the path features . we bring together these techniques in axp , a system for adaptive and exploratory path retrieval . the experimental-results show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques .
