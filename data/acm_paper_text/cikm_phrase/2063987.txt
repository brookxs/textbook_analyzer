efficient association-discovery with keyword-based constraints on large-graph data in many domains , such as social-networks and chem-informatics , data can be represented naturally in graph-model , with nodes being data entries and edges the relationships between them . we study the application-requirements in these domains and find that discovering constrained acyclic paths (cap) is highly in demand . in this paper , we define the cap search-problem and introduce a set of quantitative metrics for describing keyword-based constraints . we propose a series of algorithms to efficiently evaluate cap queries on large-scale-graph data . extensive experiments illustrate that our algorithms are both efficient and scalable .
