joke retrieval : recognizing the same joke told differently in a corpus of jokes , a human might judge two documents to be the `` same joke '' even if characters , locations , and other details are varied . a given joke could be retold with an entirely different vocabulary while still maintaining its identity . since most retrieval-systems consider documents to be related only when their word content is similar , we propose joke retrieval as a domain where standard language-models may fail . other meaning-centric domains include logic puzzles , proverbs and recipes ; in such domains , new techniques may be required to enable us to search effectively . for jokes , a necessary component of any retrieval-system will be the ability to identify the `` same joke , '' so we examine this task in both ranking and classification settings . we exploit the structure of jokes to develop two domain-specific alternatives to the `` bag-of-words '' document-model . in one , only the punch lines , or final sentences , are compared ; in the second , certain categories of words (e.g. , professions and countries) are tagged and treated as interchangeable . each technique works well for certain jokes . by combining the methods using machine-learning , we create a hybrid that achieves higher performance than any individual approach .
