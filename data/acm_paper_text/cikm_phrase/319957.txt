training a selection function for extraction in this paper we compare performance of several heuristics in generating informative generic/query-oriented extracts for newspaper articles in order to learn how topic prominence affects the performance of each heuristic . we study how different query-types can affect the performance of each heuristic and discuss the possibility of using machine-learning-algorithms to automatically learn good combination functions to combine several heuristics . we also briefly describe the design , implementation , and performance of a multilingual-text summarization-system summarist .
