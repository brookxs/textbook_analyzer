tut : a statistical model for detecting trends , topics and user-interests in social-media the rapid-development of online-social-media sites is accompanied by the generation of tremendous web-contents . web users are shifting from data consumers to data producers . as a result , topic-detection-and-tracking without taking users ' interests into account is not enough . this paper presents a statistical model that can detect interpretable trends and topics from document streams , where each trend (short for trending story) corresponds to a series of continuing events or a storyline . a topic is represented by a cluster of words frequently co-occurred . a trend can contain multiple topics and a topic can be shared by different trends . in addition , by leveraging a recurrent chinese restaurant process (rcrp) , the number of trends in our model can be determined automatically without human-intervention , so that our model can better generalize to unseen data . furthermore , our proposed model incorporates user-interest to fully simulate the generation-process of web-contents , which offers the opportunity for personalized-recommendation in online-social-media . experiments on three different datasets indicated that our proposed model can capture meaningful topics and trends , monitor rise and fall of detected trends , outperform baseline approach in terms of perplexity on held-out dataset , and improve the result of user-participation prediction by leveraging users ' interests to different trends .
