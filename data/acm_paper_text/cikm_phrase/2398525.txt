interest-matching information-propagation in multiple online-social-networks online-social-networks have become an imperative channel for extremely fast information-propagation and influence . thus , the problem of finding a minimum number of seed users who can eventually influence as many users in the network as possible has become one of the central research topics recently . unfortunately , most of related works have only focused on the network-topologies and largely ignored many other important factors such as the users ' engagements and the negative or positive impacts between users . more challengingly , the behavior of information-propagation across multiple networks simultaneously remains an untrodden area and becomes an urgent need . our work is the first attempt to tackle the above problem in multiple networks , considering these lacking important factors . in order to capture the users ' engagement , we propose to targeting the set of interest-matching users whose interests are similar to what we try to propagate . then , we develop our iterative semi-supervising learning_based approach to identify the minimum seed users . we validate the effectiveness of our solution by using real-world twitter-foursquare networks and academic collaboration multiple networks .
