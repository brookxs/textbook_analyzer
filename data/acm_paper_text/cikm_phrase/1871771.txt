eui : an embedded engine for understanding user-intents from mobile-devices we design and implement a novel embedded-software engine , called eui , to understand user-intents from usage-data within mobile-devices . by developing the eui engine in mobile-devices , we expect to move towards `` proactive '' devices for mobile-personalized-services . to this end , we seek to embed the open-directory-project (odp) into mobile-devices , and build a robust classifier with the embedded odp . thus , the eui engine classifies the usage-data within mobile-devices into some odp categories . our implementation handles some challenging issues in embedding the odp and building a robust classifier . the demonstration shows that our implementation understands the semantics of the usage-data effectively .
