adaptive non-linear clustering in data-streams data-stream-clustering has emerged as a challenging and interesting problem over the past few years . due to the evolving nature , and one-pass restriction imposed by the data-stream model , traditional clustering-algorithms are inapplicable for stream-clustering . this problem becomes even more challenging when the data is high-dimensional and the clusters are not linearly separable in the input space . in this paper , we propose a nonlinear stream-clustering algorithm that adapts to the stream 's evolutionary changes . using the kernel-methods for dealing with the non-linearity of data-separation , we propose a novel 2-tier stream-clustering architecture . tier-1 captures the temporal-locality in the stream , by partitioning it into segments , using a kernel-based novelty-detection approach . tier-2 exploits this segment structure to continuously project the streaming-data nonlinearly onto a low-dimensional space (lds) , before assigning them to a cluster . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experimental-evaluation on various real-world datasets .
