estimating query-difficulty for news prediction retrieval news prediction retrieval has recently emerged as the task of retrieving predictions related to a given news story (or a query) . predictions are defined as sentences containing time references to future-events . such future-related-information is crucially important for understanding the temporal development of news stories , as well as strategies planning and risk-management . the aforementioned work has been shown to retrieve a significant number of relevant predictions . however , only a certain news topics achieve good retrieval-effectiveness . in this paper , we study how to determine the difficulty in retrieving predictions for a given news story . more precisely , we address the query-difficulty-estimation problem for news prediction retrieval . we propose different entity-based predictors used for classifying queries into two classes , namely , easy and difficult . our prediction-model is based on a machine-learning-approach . through experiments on real-world-data , we show that our proposed approach can predict query-difficulty with high accuracy .
