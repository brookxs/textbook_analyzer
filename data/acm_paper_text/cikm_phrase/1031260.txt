dynamic extraction topic descriptors and discriminators : towards automatic context-based topic search effective knowledge-management may require going beyond initial knowledge-capture , to support decisions about how to extend previously-captured knowledge . electronic <i> concept-maps , </i> interlinked with other concept-maps and multimedia-resources , can provide rich <i> knowledge-models </i> for human-knowledge capture and sharing . this paper presents research on methods for supporting experts as they extend these knowledge-models , by searching the-web for new context-relevant topics as candidates for inclusion . this topic search problem presents two challenges : first , how to formulate queries to seek topics that reflect the context of the current knowledge-model , and , second , how to identify candidate topics with the right balance of novelty and relevance . more generally , this problem raises the broad question of the interaction of topic information from the local analysis space (a collected set of documents) and the global-search space (the-web) . the paper develops a framework for understanding this interaction , and proposes and evaluates techniques for addressing the query-formation and topic-identification questions by dynamically extracting topic descriptors and discriminators from a knowledge-model , to characterize information-needs for retrieval and filtering of relevant material . using these techniques , we have developed a support-tool that starts from a knowledge-model under construction and automatically produces a set of suggestions for topics to include , proactively supporting users as they extend knowledge-models .
