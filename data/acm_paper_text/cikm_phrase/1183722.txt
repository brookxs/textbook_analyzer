privacy-preserving sequential-pattern-mining in distributed-databases research in the areas of privacy-preserving techniques in databases and subsequently in privacy-enhancement technologies have witnessed an explosive growth-spurt in recent years . this escalation has been fueled by the growing mistrust of individuals towards organizations collecting and disbursing their personally-identifiable-information (pii) . digital-repositories have become increasingly susceptible to intentional or unintentional abuse , resulting in organizations to be liable under the privacy legislations that are being adopted by governments the world over . these privacy-concerns have necessitated new advancements in the field of distributed-data-mining wherein , collaborating parties may be legally bound not to reveal the private-information of their customers . in this paper , we present a new algorithm pripsep (pri vacy p reserving se quential p atterns) for the mining of sequential-patterns from distributed-databases while preserving privacy . a salient feature of pripsep is that due to its flexibility it is more pertinent to mining operations for real-world-applications in terms of efficiency and functionality . under some reasonable assumptions , we prove that our architecture and protocol employed by our algorithm for multi-party-computation is secure .
