distributed-pagerank computation based on iterative-aggregation-disaggregation methods pagerank has been widely used as a major factor in search-engine ranking-systems . however , global link-graph information is required when computing pagerank , which causes prohibitive communication-cost to achieve accurate results in distributed solution . in this paper , we propose a distributed-pagerank computation algorithm based on iterative-aggregation-disaggregation (iad) method with block-jacobi smoothing . the basic idea is divide-and-conquer . we treat each web-site as a node to explore the block-structure of hyperlinks . local pagerank is computed by each node itself and then updated with a low communication-cost with a coordinator . we prove the global-convergence of the block-jacobi method and then analyze the communication-overhead and major advantages of our algorithm . experiments on three real web-graphs show that our method converges 5-7 times faster than the traditional power-method . we believe our work provides an efficient and practical distributed solution for pagerank on large-scale web-graphs .
