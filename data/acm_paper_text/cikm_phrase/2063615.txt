keyword-search over rdf-graphs large knowledge-bases consisting of entities and relationships between them have become vital sources-of-information for many applications . most of these knowledge-bases adopt the semantic-web data-model rdf as a representation-model . querying these knowledge-bases is typically done using structured-queries utilizing graph-pattern languages such as sparql . however , such structured-queries require some expertise from users which limits the accessibility to such data sources . to overcome this , keyword-search must be supported . in this paper , we propose a retrieval-model for keyword-queries over rdf-graphs . our model retrieves a set of subgraphs that match the query keywords , and ranks them based on statistical-language-models . we show that our retrieval-model outperforms the-state-of-the-art ir and db models for keyword-search-over-structured-data using experiments over two real-world datasets .
