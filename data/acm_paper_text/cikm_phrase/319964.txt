task-oriented world-wide-web retrieval by document-type classification this paper proposes a novel approach to accurately searching web-pages for relevant-information in problem-solving by specifying a web-document category instead of the user 's task . accessing information from world-wide-web pages as an approach to problem-solving has become commonplace . however , such a search is difficult with current search-services , since these services only provide keyword-based-search methods that are equivalent to narrowing down the target references according to domains . however , problem-solving usually involves both a domain and a task . accordingly , our approach is based on problem-solving tasks . to specify a user 's problem-solving task , we introduce the concept of document types that directly relate to the problem-solving tasks ; with this approach , users can easily designate problem-solving tasks . we implemented pagetypesearch system based on our approach . classifier of pagetypesearch classifies web-pages into the document types by comparing their pages with typical structural-characteristics of the types . we compare pagetypesearch using the document typeindices with a conventional keyword-based-search system in experiments . the average-precision of the document type-based search is 88.9 \ % , while the average-precision of the keyword-based-search is 31.2 \ % . moreover , the number of irrelevant references gathered by our system is about one-thirteenth that of traditional keyword-based-search systems . our approach has practical advantages for problem-solving by introducing the viewpoint of tasks to achieve higher performance .
