a pattern-based selective recrawling approach for object-level vertical-search traditional recrawling methods learn navigation-patterns in order to crawl related web pages . however , they can not remove the redundancy found on the web , especially at the object level . to deal with this problem , we propose a new hypertext resource-discovery method , called `` selective recrawling '' for object-level vertical-search applications . the goal of selective recrawling is to automatically generate url patterns , then select those pages that have the widest coverage , and least irrelevance and redundancy relative to a pre-defined vertical domain . this method only requires a few seed objects and can select the set of url patterns that covers the greatest number of objects . the selected set can continue to be used for some time to recrawl web-pages and can be renewed periodically . this leads to significant savings in hardware and network resources . in this paper we present a detailed framework of selective recrawling for object-level vertical-search . the selective recrawling method automatically extends the set of candidate websites from initial seed objects . based on the objects extracted from these websites it learns a set of url patterns which covers the greatest number of target objects with little redundancy . finally , the navigation-patterns generated from the selected url-pattern set are used to guide future crawling . experiments on local event data show that our method can greatly reduce downloading of web-pages while maintaining comparative object-coverage .
