ranking in folksonomy systems : can context help ? folksonomy systems have shown to contribute to the quality of web search-ranking strategies . in this paper , we analyze and compare different graph-based-ranking algorithms , namely folkrank , socialpagerank , and socialsimrank . we enhance these algorithms by exploiting the context of tag assignmets , and evaluate the results on the groupme ! dataset . in groupme ! , users can organize and maintain arbitrary web-resources in self-defined groups . when users annotate resources in groupme ! , this can be interpreted in context of a certain group . the grouping activity delivers valuable semantic-information about resources and their context . we show how to use this information to improve the detection of relevant search-results , and compare different strategies for ranking result lists in folksonomy systems .
