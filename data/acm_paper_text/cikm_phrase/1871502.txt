the gist of everything new : personalized top-k-processing over web-2.0-streams web-2.0 portals have made content-generation easier than ever with millions of users contributing news stories in form of posts in weblogs or short textual snippets as in twitter . efficient and effective filtering solutions are key to allow users stay tuned to this ever-growing ocean of information , releasing only relevant trickles of personal interest . in classical information filtering systems , user-interests are formulated using standard ir techniques and data from all available information-sources is filtered based on a predefined absolute quality-based threshold . in contrast to this restrictive approach which may still overwhelm the user with the returned stream of data , we envision a system which continuously keeps the user updated with only the top - k relevant new information . freshness of data is guaranteed by considering it valid for a particular time-interval , controlled by a sliding-window . considering relevance as relative to the existing pool of new information creates a highly dynamic setting . we present pol-filter which together with our maintenance module constitute an efficient-solution to this kind of problem . we show by comprehensive performance-evaluations using real-world data , obtained from a weblog crawl , that our approach brings performance gains compared to state-of-the-art .
