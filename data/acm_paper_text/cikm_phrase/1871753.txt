unsupervised public-health event-detection for epidemic-intelligence recent pandemics such as swine-flu have caused concern for public-health officials . given the ever increasing pace at which infectious-diseases can spread globally , officials must be prepared to react sooner and with greater epidemic-intelligence gathering capabilities . however , state-of-the-art systems for epidemic-intelligence have not kept the pace with the growing need for more robust public-health event-detection . in this paper , we propose a game-changing approach where public-health events are detected in an unsupervised manner . we address the problems associated with adapting an unsupervised learner to the medical-domain and in doing so , propose an approach which combines aspects from different feature-based event-detection methods . we evaluate our approach with a real-world dataset with respect to the quality of article clusters . our results show that we are able to achieve a precision of 66 \ % and a recall of 81 \ % when evaluated using manually annotated , real-world-data . this shows promising results for the use of such techniques in this new problem setting .
