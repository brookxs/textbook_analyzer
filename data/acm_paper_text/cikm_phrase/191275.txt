isolation of transaction aborts in object-oriented-database-systems we address the problem of recovery in object-oriented data-bases from considerations of the semantics of committed transactions and the efficiency of recovery procedures . the recovery-strategy used is update-in-place . we show that efficient recovery procedures should allow transactions to abort independently of one another by executing inverse operations . we refer to these requirements collectively as the recovery isolation-property . we present a formal-definition of recovery isolation and prove that schedules possessing this property do not suffer from rollback dependencies . recovery isolation is useful in constructing concurrency-control protocols that go beyond commutativity , and in parallel and high-performance database-systems . we define the notion of strict schedules for object-oriented-databases as an extension of the analogous definition for read and write operations . we show that strict schedules possess the recovery isolation-property .
