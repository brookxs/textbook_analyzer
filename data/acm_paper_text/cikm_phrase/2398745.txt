hadoopxml : a suite for parallel-processing of massive xml-data with multiple twig pattern queries the volume of xml-data is tremendous in many areas , but especially in data-logging and scientific areas . xml-data in the areas are accumulated over time as new data are continuously collected . it is a challenge to process massive xml-data with multiple twig pattern queries given by multiple-users in a timely manner . we showcase hadoopxml , a system that simultaneously processes many twig pattern queries for a massive volume of xml-data with hadoop . specifically , hadoopxml provides an efficient way to process a single large xml file in parallel . it processes multiple twig pattern queries simultaneously with a shared input scan . users do not need to iterate m/r jobs for each query . hadoopxml also reduces many i/os by enabling twig pattern queries to share their path solutions each other . moreover , hadoopxml provides a sophisticated runtime load-balancing scheme for fairly assigning multiple twig pattern joins across nodes . with synthetic and real-world xml dataset , we demonstrate how efficiently hadoopxml processes many twig pattern queries in a shared and balanced way .
