bootstrapping for hierarchical document classification managing the hierarchical organization of data is starting to play a key role in the knowledge-management community due to the great amount of human-resources needed to create and maintain these organized repositories of information . machine-learning community has in part addressed this problem by developing hierarchical supervised classifiers that help maintainers to categorize new resources within given hierarchies . although such learning-models succeed in exploiting relational knowledge , they are highly demanding in terms of labeled examples , because the number of categories is related to the dimension of the corresponding hierarchy . hence , the creation of new directories or the modification of existing ones require strong investments.this paper proposes a semi-automatic process (interleaved with human suggestions) whose aim is to minimize (simplify) the work required to the administrators when creating , modifying , and maintaining directories . within this process , bootstrapping a taxonomy with examples represents a critical factor for the effective exploitation of any supervised-learning model . for this reason we propose a method for the bootstrapping-process that makes a first hypothesis of categorization for a set of unlabeled documents , with respect to a given empty hierarchy of concepts . based on a revision of self-organizing-maps , namely taxsom , the proposed model performs an unsupervised-classification , exploiting the a-priori knowledge encoded in a taxonomy structure both at the terminological and topological level . the ultimate goal of taxsom is to create the premise for successfully training a supervised classifier .
