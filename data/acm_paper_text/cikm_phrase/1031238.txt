distance-function design and fusion for sequence-data sequence-data-mining plays a key role in many scientific studies and real-world-applications such as bioinformatics , data-stream , and sensor-networks , where sequence-data are processed and their semantics interpreted . in this paper we address two relevant issues : sequence-data-representation , and representation-to-semantics-mapping . for representation , since the best one is dependent upon the application being used and even the type of query , we propose representing sequence-data in multiple-views . for each representation , we propose methods to construct a <i> valid kernel </i> as the distance-function to measure <i> similarity </i> between sequences . for mapping , we then find the best combination of the individual distance-functions , which measure similarity of different views , to depict the target semantics . we propose a <i> super-kernel function-fusion </i> scheme to achieve the optimal-mapping . through theoretical-analysis and empirical studies on uci and real-world datasets , we show our approach of multi-view representation and fusion to be mathematically valid and very effective for practical purposes .
