social-ranking for spoken-web search spoken-web is an alternative web for low-literacy-users in the developing-world . people can create audio content over phone and share on the spoken-web . this enables easy creation of locally relevant content . even on the world-wide-web in developed regions , the recent increase in traffic is due to the locally relevant content created on social-networking-sites . this paper argues that content-search and ranking in the new scenario needs a re-look . the generic-model of using in-links for ranking such content is not an appropriate measure of the content relevance in such a collaborative-web 2.0 world . this paper aims to bring the social-context in spoken-web ranking . we formulate a relationship function between the query-creator and the content-creator and use this as one measure of the content relevance to the user . the relationship function uses the geographical-location of the two people and their prior browsing preferences as parameters to determine the relationship between the two users . further we also determine the trustability of the content-based on the content creator 's acceptance measure by the social-network . we use these two features in addition to the term-frequency - inverse-term-frequency match to rank the search-results in context of the social-network of the query-creator and provide a more specific and socially relevant result to the user .
