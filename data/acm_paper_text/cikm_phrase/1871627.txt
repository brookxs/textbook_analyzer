prusm : a prudent schema-matching approach for web-forms there has been a substantial increase in the number of web-data sources whose contents are hidden and can only be accessed through form interfaces . to leverage this data , several applications have emerged that aim to automate and simplify the access to these data sources , from hidden-web crawlers and meta-searchers to web-information-integration systems . a requirement shared by these applications is the ability to understand these forms , so that they can automatically fill them out . in this paper , we address a key problem in form understanding : how to match elements across distinct forms . although this problem has been studied in the literature , existing approaches have important limitations . notably , they only handle small form collections and assume that form elements are clean and normalized , often through manual pre-processing . when a large number of forms is automatically gathered , matching form schemata presents new challenges : data heterogeneity is compounded with the web-scale and noise introduced by automated processes . we propose prusm , a prudent schema-matching strategy the determines matches for form elements in a prudent fashion , with the goal of minimizing error-propagation . a experimental-evaluation of prusm using widely available data-sets shows that the approach effective and able to accurately match a large number of form schemata and without requiring any manual pre-processing .
