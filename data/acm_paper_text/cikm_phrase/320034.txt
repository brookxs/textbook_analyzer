quality-of-service transferred to information-retrieval : the adaptive-information-retrieval system users often quit an information-retrieval-system (ir-system) very frustrated , because they can not find the information matching their information-needs . we have identified the following two main reasons : too high expectations and wrong use of the system . our approach which addresses both issues is based on the transfer of the concept of quality-of-service to ir systems : the user first negotiates the retrieval-success-rates with the ir-system , so he knows what to expect from the system in advance . second , by dynamic-adaptation to the retrieval context , the ir-system tries to improve the user 's queries and thereby tries to exploit the underlying information-source as best as possible .
