image-retrieval at memory 's edge : known image-search based on user-drawn sketches with the increasingly growing size of digital-image-collections , known image-search is gaining more and more importance . especially in collections where individual objects are not tagged with metadata describing their content , content-based-image-retrieval (cbir) is a promising approach , but usually suffers from the unavailability of query images that are good enough to express the user 's information-need . in this paper , we present the qbs system that provides cbir based on user-drawn sketches . the qbs system combines angular radial partitioning for the extraction of features in the user-provided sketch , taking into account the spatial-distribution of edges , and the image-distortion model . this combination offers several highly relevant invariances that allow the query sketch to slightly deviate from the searched image in terms of rotation , translation , relative size , and/or unknown objects in the background . to illustrate the benefits of the approach , we present search-results from the evaluation of the qbs system on the basis of the mirflickr collection with 25,000 objects and compare the retrieval results of pure metadata-driven approaches , pure content-based-retrieval using different sketches , and combinations thereof .
