biastrust : teaching biased users about controversial topics deciding whether a claim is true or false often requires understanding the evidence supporting and contradicting the claim . however , when learning about a controversial claim , human biases and viewpoints may affect which evidence documents are considered `` trustworthy '' or credible . it is important to overcome this bias and know both viewpoints to get a balanced perspective . in this paper , we study various factors that affect learning about the truthfulness of controversial claims . we designed a user-study to understand the impact of these factors . specifically , we studied the impact of presenting evidence with contrasting viewpoints and source expertise rating on how users accessed the evidence documents . this would help us optimize how to teach users about controversial topics in the most effective way , and to design better claim verification systems . we find that users do not seek contrasting viewpoints by themselves , but explicitly presenting contrasting evidence helps them get a well-rounded understanding of the topic . furthermore , explicit-knowledge of the source credibility and the context not only affects what users read , but also how credible they perceive the document to be .
