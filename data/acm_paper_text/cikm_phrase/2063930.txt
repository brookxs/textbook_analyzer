mining query-structure from click-data : a case-study of product queries most of the information on the web is inherently structured , product pages of large online-shopping sites such as amazon.com being a typical example . yet , unstructured keyword-queries are still the most common way to search for such structured-information , producing an ambiguities and poor ranking , and by that degrading user-experience . this problem can be resolved by query-segmentation , that is , transformation of unstructured keyword-queries into structured-queries . the resulting queries can be used to search product databases more accurately , and improve result-presentation and query-suggestion . the main contribution of our work is a novel approach to query-segmentation based on unsupervised-machine-learning . its highlight is that query and click-through logs are used for training . extensive experiments over a large query and click-log from a leading shopping engine demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline .
