authentication of moving range queries a moving-range-query continuously reports the query result (e.g. , restaurants) that are within radius $ r $ from a moving query point (e.g. , moving tourist) . to minimize the communication-cost with the mobile-clients , a service-provider that evaluates moving range queries also returns a safe region that bounds the validity of query results . however , an untrustworthy service-provider may report incorrect safe regions to mobile-clients . in this paper , we present efficient techniques for authenticating the safe regions of moving range queries . we theoretically proved that our methods for authenticating moving range queries can minimize the data sent between the service-provider and the mobile-clients . extensive experiments are carried out using both real and synthetic datasets and results show that our methods incur small communication-costs and overhead .
