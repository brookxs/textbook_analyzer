relational-feature engineering of natural-language-processing we present a new framework for feature-engineering of natural-language-processing that is based on a relational-data-model of text . it includes fast and flexible methods for implementing and extracting new features and thereby reduces the effort of creating an nlp-system for a particular task . in an instantiation and evaluation of the framework for the problem of coreference-resolution in multiple languages , we were able to obtain competitive results in a short implementation period . this demonstrates the potential power of our framework for feature-engineering .
