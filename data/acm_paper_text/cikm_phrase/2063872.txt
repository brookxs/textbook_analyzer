an unsupervised ranking-method based on a technical difficulty terrain users look for information that can suit their level of expertise , but it often takes a mammoth effort to trace such information . one has to sift through multiple pages to look for one that fits the appropriate technical background . in this paper , a query-independent ranking-system is proposed for technical web-pages . the pages returned by the system are sorted by their relative technical difficulty in either ascending or descending order specified by the user . the technical difficulty of a document i.e. terms in sequence , is first computed by the combination of each individual term 's geometry in the low-dimensional latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) space , which can be visualized as a conceptual terrain . then the pages are ranked based on the expected cost to get over the terrain . results indicate that our terrain_based method outperforms traditional readability measures .
