on the foundations of probabilistic-information integration information-integration has been a subject of research for several decades and still remains a very active research area . many new-applications depend or benefit from large-scale-integration . examples include large research projects in life-sciences , need for data-sharing among government-agencies , reliance of corporations on business-intelligence (which requires data-integration from many heterogeneous-sources) , and integration of information on the web . the importance of information-integration with uncertainty has been observed in recent years . frequently , information from multiple sources are uncertain and possibly inconsistent . further the process of integration often depends on approximate schema-mappings , another source of uncertainty . an integration system is useful only to the extent that the information it produces can be trusted . hence , providing a measure of certainty for integrated information is of crucial importance in many important applications . in this paper we study the problem of integration of uncertain-information . we present a simple and intuitive approach to the representation and integration of uncertain-information from multiple sources , and show that our integration approach coincides with a recent formalism for uncertain-information integration . we extend the model to probabilistic possible-worlds , and show certain unintuitive constraints are imposed upon probabilities of possible-worlds of sources . in particular , we show the probabilities of possible worlds of a source are not independent , rather , they are dependent on probabilities of other sources . we study the problem of determining the probabilities for the result of integration . finally , we present a practical approach to relaxing probabilistic constraints in integration .
