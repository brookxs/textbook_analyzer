salsa : computing the skyline without scanning the whole sky skyline-queries compute the set of pareto-optimal tuples in a relation , ie those tuples that are not dominated by any other tuple in the same relation . although several algorithms have been proposed for efficiently evaluating skyline-queries , they either require to extend the relational server with specialized access-methods (which is not always feasible) or have to perform the dominance tests on all the tuples in order to determine the result . in this paper we introduce salsa (sort and limit skyline algorithm) , which exploits the sorting machinery of a relational engine to order tuples so that only a subset of them needs to be examined for computing the skyline result . this makes salsa particularly attractive when skyline-queries are executed on top of systems that do not understand skyline semantics or when the skyline logic runs on clients with limited power and/or bandwidth .
