logsig : generating system events from raw textual logs modern computing-systems generate large amounts of log-data . system-administrators or domain-experts utilize the log-data to understand and optimize system behaviors . most system-logs are raw textual and unstructured . one main fundamental challenge in automated log-analysis is the generation of system events from raw textual logs . log messages are relatively short-text messages but may have a large vocabulary , which often result in poor performance when applying traditional text-clustering techniques to the log-data . other related methods have various limitations and only work well for some particular system-logs . in this paper , we propose a message-signature_based algorithm logsig to generate system events from textual log messages . by searching the most representative message signatures , logsig categorizes log messages into a set of event types . logsig can handle various types of log-data , and is able to incorporate human 's domain-knowledge to achieve a high-performance . we conduct experiments on five real-system log-data . experiments show that logsig outperforms other alternative algorithms in terms of the overall performance .
