efficient parsing-based search over structured-data parsing-based search , i.e. , parsing keyword-search queries using grammars , is often used to override the traditional `` bag-of-words ' '' semantics in web-search and enterprise-search scenarios . compared to the `` bag-of-words '' semantics , the parsing-based semantics is richer and more customizable . while a formalism for parsing-based semantics for keyword-search has been proposed in prior work and ad-hoc implementations exist , the problem of designing efficient-algorithms to support the semantics is largely unstudied . in this paper , we present a suite of efficient-algorithms and auxiliary indexes for this problem . our algorithms work for a broad classes of grammars used in practice , and cover a variety of database matching-functions (set - and substring-containment , approximate and exact equality) and scoring-functions (to filter and rank different parses) . we formally analyze the time-complexity of our algorithms and provide an empirical-evaluation over real-world-data to show that our algorithms scale well with the size of the database and grammar .
