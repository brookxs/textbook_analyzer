graph-of-word and tw-idf : new approach to ad-hoc ir in this paper , we introduce novel document-representation (graph-of-word) and retrieval-model (tw-idf) for ad-hoc ir . questioning the term independence-assumption behind the traditional bag-of-word model , we propose a different representation of a document that captures the relationships between the terms using an unweighted directed-graph of terms . from this graph , we extract at indexing time meaningful term-weights (tw) that replace traditional term frequencies (tf) and from which we define a novel scoring-function , namely tw-idf , by analogy with tf-idf . this approach leads to a retrieval-model that consistently and significantly outperforms bm25 and in some cases its extension bm25 + on various standard trec datasets . in particular , experiments show that counting the number of different contexts in which a term occurs inside a document is more effective and relevant to search than considering an overall concave term-frequency in the context of ad-hoc ir .
