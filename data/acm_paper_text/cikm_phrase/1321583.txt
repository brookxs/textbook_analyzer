towards efficient search on unstructured-data : an intelligent-storage approach applications that create and consume unstructured-data have grown both in scale of storage requirements and complexity of search primitives . we consider two such applications : exhaustive-search and integration of structured and unstructured-data . current block-based storage-systems are either incapable or inefficient to address the challenges bought forth by the above applications . we propose a storage framework to efficiently store and search unstructured and structured-data while controlling storage-management costs . experimental-results based on our prototype show that the proposed system can provide impressive performance and feature benefits .
