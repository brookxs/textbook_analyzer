topic-and-keyword-re-ranking for lda-based topic-modeling topic-based text summaries promise to help average users quickly understand a text-collection and derive insights . recent research has shown that the latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) model is one of the most effective approaches to topic-analysis . however , the lda-based results may not be ideal for human-understanding and consumption . in this paper , we present several topic-and-keyword-re-ranking approaches that can help users better understand and consume the lda-derived topics in their text-analysis . our methods process the lda output based on a set of criteria that model a user 's information-needs . our evaluation demonstrates the usefulness of the methods in summarizing several large-scale , real-world data-sets .
