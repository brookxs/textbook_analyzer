do ads compete or collaborate ? : designing click-models with full relationship incorporated traditionally click-models predict click-through-rate (ctr) of an advertisement (ad) independent of other ads . recent researches however indicate that the ctr of an ad is dependent on the quality of the ad itself but also of the neighboring ads . using historical click-through-data of a commercially available ad server , we identify two types (competing and collaborating) of influences among sponsored ads and further propose a novel click-model , full relation-model (frm) , which explicitly models dependencies between ads . on a test-data , frm shows significant improvement in ctr-prediction as compared to earlier click-models .
