maximizing the sustained throughput of distributed continuous queries monitoring-systems today often involve continuous-queries over streaming-data , in a distributed collaborative system . the distribution of query-operators over a network of processors , and their processing sequence , form a query configuration with inherent constraints on the throughput it can support . in this paper we propose to optimize stream queries with respect to a version of throughput measure , the profiled input throughput . this measure is focused on matching the expected behavior of the input streams . to prune the search-space we used hill-climbing techniques that proved to be efficient and effective .
