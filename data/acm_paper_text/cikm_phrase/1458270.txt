a note on search-based forecasting of ad volume in contextual-advertising in contextual-advertising , estimating the number of impressions of an ad is critical in planning and budgeting advertising campaigns . however , producing this forecast , even within large margins of error , is quite challenging . we attack this problem by simulating the presence of a given ad with its associated bid over historical-data , involving billions of impressions . this apparently enormous computational task is reduced to a search-task involving only the set of distinct pages in the data . furthermore the search is made more efficient using a two-level search-process . experimental-results show that our approach can accurately forecast the expected number of impressions of contextual-ads in real-time .
