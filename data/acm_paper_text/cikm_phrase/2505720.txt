cqarank : jointly model topics and expertise in community-question-answering community-question-answering (cqa) websites , where people share expertise on open-platforms , have become large repositories of valuable knowledge . to bring the best value out of these knowledge repositories , it is critically important for cqa services to know how to find the right experts , retrieve archived similar questions and recommend best-answers to new questions . to tackle this cluster of closely related problems in a principled approach , we proposed topic expertise-model (tem) , a novel probabilistic-generative-model with gmm hybrid , to jointly model topics and expertise by integrating textual content-model and link-structure-analysis . based on tem results , we proposed cqarank to measure user-interests and expertise score under different topics . leveraging the question-answering history based on long-term community reviews and voting , our method could find experts with both similar topical preference and high topical expertise . experiments carried out on stack-overflow data , the largest cqa focused on computer-programming , show that our method achieves significant improvement over existing methods on multiple metrics .
