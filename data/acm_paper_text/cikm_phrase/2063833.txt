skynets : searching for minimum trees in graphs with incomparable-edge-weights query-processing over weighted data-graphs often involves searching for a minimum weighted subgraph -- a tree -- which covers the nodes satisfying the given query criteria (such as a given set of keywords) . existing works often focus on graphs where the edges have scalar valued weights . in many applications , however , edge weights need to be represented as ranges (or interval s) of possible values . in this paper , we introduce the problem of skynet s , for searching minimum weighted subgraphs , covering the nodes satisfying given query criteria , over interval-weighted graphs . the key challenge is that , unlike scalars which are often totally ordered , depending on the application-specific semantics of the ? operator , intervals may be partially ordered . naturally , the need to maintain alternative , incomparable solutions can push the computational-complexity of the problem (which is already high for the case with totally ordered scalar edge weights) even higher . in this paper , we first provide alternative definitions of the ? operator for intervals and show that some of these lend themselves to efficient solutions . to tackle the complexity challenge in the remaining cases , we propose two optimization criteria that can be used to constrain the solution-space . we also discuss how to extend existing approximation-algorithms for steiner-trees to discover solutions to the skynet problem . for efficient calculation of the results , we introduce a novel skyline-union operator . experiments show that the proposed approach achieves significant gains in efficiency , while providing close to optimal results .
