e-discovery it is common practice in the u.s. for courts to require that the parties to a legal case make available to one another all material relevant to the case , including electronically held data and documents . for large corporations , such relevant-information may encompass terabytes of e-mail and other files spanning many years . the challenge of e-discovery in response to a court order is (in a relatively short amount of time) to identify , assemble , individuate , access , categorize , and analyze an organization 's electronically held material , segregate all `` privileged '' material (which can be legally withheld) , and present to the court all (and only) the required documents . the techniques needed to accomplish such a task necessarily include search , clustering , classification , filtering , social-network-analysis , extraction , and more - and no one of these is sufficient . the panel will describe this problem in detail , providing additional background and context on e-discovery generally , and will explore specific techniques and cases that amply demonstrate why e-discovery is quintessentially a `` cikm '' problem -- multi-disciplinary , multi-technology , and `` multi-difficult '' .
