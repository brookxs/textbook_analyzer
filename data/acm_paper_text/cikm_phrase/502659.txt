binary-interpolation search for solution mapping on broadcast and on-demand channels in a mobile-computing environment we explore in this paper the problem of dynamic-data and channel allocations with the number of communication-channels and the number of data items given . it is noted that the combined use of broadcast and on-demand channels can utilize the bandwidth effectively for data-dissemination in a mobile-computing environment . we first derive the an-alytical models of the expected delays when the data are requested through the broadcast and on-demand channels . then , we transform this problem into to a guided-search problem . in light of the theoretical properties derived , we devise an algorithm based on binary-interpolation search , referred to as algorithm bis , to obtain solutions of high quality efficiently . in essence , algorithm bis is guided to explore the solution-space with higher likelihood to be the optimal first , thereby leading to an efficient and effective search . it is shown by our simulation-results that the solution obtained by algorithm bis is of very high quality and is in fact very close to the optimal one . sensitivity-analysis on several parameters , including the number of data items and the number of communication-channels , is conducted .
