using the current browsing context to improve search-relevance in this paper , we investigate the problem of improving the relevance of a web-search-engine by adapting it to the dynamic needs of the user . we examine a representative case of sudden information-need change , namely the exposure of the user to news data . in our earlier work we showed that the majority of queries submitted by users after browsing documents in the news domain are related to the most recently browsed document . we explore several methods of biasing the search by performing query-expansion and re-ranking of the search-results of a major search-engine for queries identified as good candidates for contextualization . we show that these methods highly increase the similarity between the obtained top 10 search-results and the most recently browsed document .
