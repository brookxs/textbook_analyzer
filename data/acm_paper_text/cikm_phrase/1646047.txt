product-query-classification web-query-classification is an effective way to understand web user intents , which can further improve web-search and online-advertising relevance . however , web-queries are usually very short which can not fully reflect their meanings . what is more , it is quite hard to obtain enough training-data for training accurate classifiers . therefore , previous work on query-classification has focused on two issues . one is how to represent web-queries through query-expansion . the other is how to increase the amount of training-data . in this paper , we took product-query-classification as an example , which is to classify web-queries into a predefined product taxonomy , and systematically studied the impact of query-expansion and the size of training-data . we proposed two methods of enriching web-queries and three approaches of collecting training-data . thereafter , we conducted a series of experiments to compare the classification-performance of using different combinations of training-data and query representations over a real-data set . the data-set consists of hundreds of thousands queries collected from a popular commercial-search-engine . from the experiments , we found some interesting observations , which were not discussed before . finally , we proposed an effective and efficient product-query-classification method based on our observations .
