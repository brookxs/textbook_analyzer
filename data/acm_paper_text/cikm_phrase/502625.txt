a music-recommendation-system based on music data grouping and user-interests with the growth of the world-wide-web , a large amount of music data is available on the internet . in addition to searching expected music objects for users , it becomes necessary to develop a recommendation-service . in this paper , we design the music-recommendation-system (mrs) to provide a personalized-service of music-recommendation . the music objects of midi format are first analyzed . for each polyphonic music object , the representative track is first determined , and then six features are extracted from this track . according to the features , the music objects are properly grouped . for users , the access-histories are analyzed to derive user-interests . the content-based , collaborative and statistics-based recommendation-methods are proposed , which are based on the favorite degrees of the users to the music groups . a series of experiments are carried out to show that our approach is feasible .
