exploiting asymmetry in hierarchical topic extraction topic or feature-extraction is often used as an important step in document-classification and text-mining . topics are succinct representation of content in a document-collection and hence are very effective when used as content identifiers in peer-to-peer-systems and other large-scale distributed content-management-systems . effective topic-extraction is dependent on the accuracy of term-clustering that often has to deal with problems like synonymy and polysemy . retrieval techniques based on spectral-analysis like latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) are often used to effectively solve these problems . most of the spectral retrieval schemes produce term-similarity measures that are symmetric and often , not an accurate characterization of term-relationships . another drawback of lsi is its running-time that is polynomial in the dimensions of the m x n matrix , a . this can get prohibitively large for some ir applications . in this paper , we present efficient-algorithms using the technique of locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) to extract topics from a document-collection based on the asymmetric relationships between terms in a collection . the relationship is characterized by the term co-occurrences and other higher-order similarity-measures . our lsh_based scheme can be viewed as a simple alternative to lsi . we show the efficacy of our algorithms via experiments on a set of large documents . an interesting feature of our algorithms is that it produces a natural hierarchical-decomposition of the topic-space instead of a flat clustering .
