peer-production of structured-knowledge - : an empirical-study of ratings and incentive-mechanisms creating and maintaining semantic-structures such as ontologies on a large-scale is a labor-intensive task , which a sole individual can not perform . established automated solutions for this task do not yet exist . peer-production is a promising approach to create structured-knowledge : members of an online-community create and maintain semantic-structures collaboratively . to motivate members to participate and to ensure the quality of the data , rating-based incentive-mechanisms are promising . members mutually rate the quality of their contributions and are rewarded for good contributions and truthful ratings . until now , there has been no systematic evaluation of such rating mechanisms in the context of structured-knowledge . we have developed a platform for the collaborative-creation of semantic-structures . to evaluate the effect of ratings and incentive-mechanisms on the quality of peer-produced data , we have conducted an extensive empirical-study in an online-community . we show that ratings are a reliable measure of the quality of contributions by comparing user-ratings with an ex post evaluation by experts . further experimental-results are that incentive-mechanisms increase the quality of contributions . we conclude that ratings and incentive-mechanisms are promising to foster and improve the peer-production of structured-knowledge .
