semi-supervised-learning to rank with preference regularization we propose a semi-supervised-learning to rank-algorithm . it learns from both labeled-data (pairwise preferences or absolute labels) and unlabeled-data . the data can consist of multiple groups of items (such as queries) , some of which may contain only unlabeled items . we introduce a preference regularizer favoring that similar items are similar in preference to each other . the regularizer captures manifold structure in the data , and we also propose a rank-sensitive version designed for top-heavy retrieval metrics including ndcg and mean-average-precision . the regularizer is employed in sslambdarank , a semi-supervised version of lambdarank . this algorithm directly optimizes popular retrieval metrics and improves retrieval-accuracy over lambdarank , a state-of-the-art ranker that was used as part of the winner of the yahoo! learning-to-rank challenge 2010 . the algorithm runs in linear-time in the number of queries , and can work with huge datasets .
