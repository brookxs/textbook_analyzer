content-coverage maximization on word networks for hierarchical topic summarization this paper studies text-summarization by extracting hierarchical topics from a given collection of documents . we propose a new approach of text-modeling via network-analysis . we convert documents into a word influence network , and find the words summarizing the major topics with an efficient influence-maximization algorithm . besides , the influence capability of the topic words on other words in the network reveal the relations among the topic words . then we cluster the words and build hierarchies for the topics . experiments on large-collections of web-documents show that a simple method based on the influence analysis is effective , compared with existing generative topic-modeling and random-walk_based ranking .
