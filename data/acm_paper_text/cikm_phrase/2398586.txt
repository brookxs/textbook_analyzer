finding the optimal-path over multi-cost graphs shortest-path query is an important problem in graphs and has been well-studied . however , most approaches for shortest-path query are based on single-cost (weight) graphs . in this paper , we introduce the definition of multi-cost graph and study a novel query : the optimal-path-query over multi-cost graphs . we propose a best-first branch-and-bound search-algorithm with two optimizing strategies . furthermore , we propose a novel index named k-cluster index to make our method more space and time efficient for large-graphs . we discuss how to construct and utilize k-cluster index . we confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms using real-life datasets in experiments .
