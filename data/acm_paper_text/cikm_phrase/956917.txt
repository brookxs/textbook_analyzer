raindrop : a uniform and layered algebraic framework for xqueries on xml-streams xml-stream applications bring the challenge of efficiently processing queries on sequentially accessible token-based data . while the automata model is naturally suited for pattern-matching on tokenized xml-streams , the algebraic model in contrast is a well-established technique for set-oriented processing of self-contained tuples . however , neither automata nor algebraic-models are well-equipped to handle both computation paradigms . the goal of the raindrop project is to accommodate these two paradigms within one algebraic framework to take advantage of both . in our query-model , both tokenized data and self-contained tuples are supported in a uniform manner . query plans can be flexibly rewritten using equivalence-rules to change what computation is done using tokenized data versus tuples . this paper highlights the four abstraction-levels in raindrop , namely , semantics-focused plan , stream logical plan , stream physical plan and execution-plan . various optimization-techniques are provided at each level . the necessity of such a uniform and layered plan is shown by experimental-study
