ws-graphmatching : a web-service tool for graph-matching some emerging applications deal with graph-data and relie on graph-matching and mining . the service-oriented graph-matching and mining tool has been required . in this demo we present the-web service tool ws-graphmatching which supports the efficient and visualized matching of polytrees , series-parallel-graphs , and arbitrary graphs with bounded feedback-vertex-set . its embedded matching-algorithms take in account the similarity of vertex-to-vertex and graph structures , allowing path contraction , vertex deletion , and vertex insertions . it provides one-to-one matching queries as well as queries in batch modes including one-to-many matching mode and many-to-many matching mode . it can be used for predicting unknown structured-information , comparing and finding conserved patterns , and resolving ambiguous identification of vertices . ws-graphaligner is available as web-server at : http://odysseus.cs.fiu.edu:8080/minepw/pages/gmapping/gmmain.html .
