blog-cascade affinity : analysis and prediction information-propagation within the blogosphere is of much importance in implementing policies , marketing research , launching new products , and other applications . in this paper , we take a microscopic view of the information-propagation pattern in blogosphere by investigating blog-cascade affinity . a blog-cascade is a group of posts linked together discussing about the same topic , and cascade affnity refers to the phenomenon of a blog 's inclination to join a specific cascade . we identify and analyze an array of features that may affect a blogger 's cascade joining behavior and utilize these features to predict cascade affinity of blogs . evaluated on a real dataset consisting of 873,496 posts , our svm-based prediction achieved accuracy of 0.723 measured by f1 . our experiments also showed that among all features identified , the number of friends was the most important-factor affecting bloggers ' inclination to join cascades .
