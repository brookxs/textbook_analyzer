optimizing unified-loss for web-ranking specialization in this paper , we proposed a novel divide-and-conquer-approach to optimize the overall relevance in an unified-framework for query-clustering and query-based ranking . in our model , latent topics and specialized ranking-models are learned iteratively so that an unified objective-function , which lower-bounds the conditional-probability of observed grades annotated by human editors on training-data , is maximized . we conducted experiments comparing the proposed method with several baseline approaches on two data-sets . experimental-results illustrate that our method can significantly improve the ranking relevance over these baselines
