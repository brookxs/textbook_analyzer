question-identification on twitter in this paper , we investigate the novel problem of automatic question identification in the microblog environment . it contains two steps : detecting tweets that contain questions (we call them `` interrogative tweets '') and extracting the tweets which really seek information or ask for help (so called `` qweets '') from interrogative tweets . to detect interrogative tweets , both traditional rule-based-approach and state-of-the-art learning-based method are employed . to extract qweets , context-features like short-urls and tweet-specific features like retweets are elaborately selected for classification . we conduct an empirical-study with sampled one hour 's english tweets and report our experimental-results for question-identification on twitter .
