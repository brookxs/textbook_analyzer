ensembling bayesian-network-structure-learning on limited data in recent years , bagging method has been applied to learn bayesian-networks (bns) , especially on limited datasets . however , the bns learned using bagging method from limited datasets can be biased towards complex-models . we present an efficient approach to produce more accurate bns from limited datasets . based on the markov condition of bn learning , we proposed a novel sampling-method , called root nodes based sampling (rns) , and a bns fusion-method . the experimental-results reveal that our ensemble-method can achieve more accurate results in terms of accuracy on limited datasets .
