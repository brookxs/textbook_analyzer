extracting a website 's content-structure from its link-structure hierarchical-models are commonly used to organize a website 's content . a website 's content-structure can be represented by a topic-hierarchy , a directed tree rooted at a website 's homepage in which the vertices and edges correspond to web-pages and hyperlinks . in this work , we propose an algorithm for extracting a website 's topic-hierarchy from its link-structure . the proposed algorithm consists of a construction stage and a refining stage , in which we analyze the semantic relationships between web-pages based on link-structure , web-page-content and directory-structure . we 've done extensive experiments using different websites and obtained very promising results .
