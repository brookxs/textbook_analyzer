learning document aboutness from implicit-user-feedback and document-structure capturing the `` aboutness '' of documents has been a key research focus throughout the history of automated textual-information processing . in this work , we represent aboutness using words and phrases that best reflect the central topics of a document . we present a machine-learning-approach that learns to score and rank words and phrases in a document according to their relevance to the document . we use implicit-user-feedback available in search-engine click-logs to characterize the user-perceived notion of term-relevance . using a small set of manually generated training-data , we show that the surrogate training-data from click-logs correlates well with this data , thus eliminating the need to create data for training manually which is both expensive and fundamentally difficult to obtain for such a task . further , we use a diverse set-of-features in our learning-model that capitalize heavily on the structural and visual-properties of web-documents . in our extensive experimentation , we pay particular attention to tail web-pages and show that our approach trained on mainly head web-pages generalizes and performs well on all kinds of documents . in several evaluation-methods using manually generated summaries and term-relevance judgments , our system shows 25 \ % improvement over other aboutness solutions .
