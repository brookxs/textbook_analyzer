operational-requirements for scalable search systems prior research into search-system scalability has primarily addressed query-processing efficiency [1 , 2 , 3] or indexing efficiency [3] , or has presented some arbitrary system-architecture [4] . little work has introduced any formal theoretical-framework for evaluating architectures with regard to specific operational-requirements , or for comparing architectures beyond simple timings [5] or basic simulations [6 , 7] . in this paper , we present a framework based upon queuing network theory for analyzing search systems in terms of operational-requirements . we use response-time , throughput , and utilization as the key operational characteristics for evaluating performance . within this framework , we present a scalability strategy that combines index-partitioning and index-replication to satisfy a given set of requirement .
