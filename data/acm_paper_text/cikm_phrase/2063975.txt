a cluster based mobile peer to peer architecture in wireless-ad-hoc-networks with the rapid-development of wireless-communication technologies and mobile devices , the mobile peer to peer (mp2p) network has been emerged . since the existing mp2p architectures have high management cost , in this paper , we propose a hierarchical mp2p architecture using clustering mobile peers . the proposed method-clusters the mobile peers by considering three aspects like the maximum connection time , the minimum hop-count and the number of the connected peers . the connection times between the connected peers can be determined by the location , velocity vector and communication range of the mobile peers . since the maximum connection time of the connected peers are considered , the network-topology is relatively stable . therefore , the management cost of the network is decreased and the success-rate of contents search is increased . experiments have shown that our proposed method outperforms the existing schemes .
