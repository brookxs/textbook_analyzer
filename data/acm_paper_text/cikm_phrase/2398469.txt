effective and efficient ? : bilingual sentiment-lexicon extraction using collocation alignment bilingual sentiment-lexicon is fundamental resource for cross-language sentiment-analysis but its compilation remains a major bottleneck in computational-linguistics . traditional word-alignment-algorithm faces with the status of large alignment space , which may introduce redundant computations as well as alignment errors . in this paper , we use collocation alignment to extract bilingual sentiment-lexicon overcoming the drawbacks of word-alignment . the idea of collocation alignment is inspired by the strong cohesion between feature words and opinion-words in sentiment corpus . experimental-results show that our approach not only decreases the computing time dramatically but also improves the precision of extracted bilingual word pairs due to the smaller alignment space .
