a language-model-approach to capture commercial-intent and information relevance for sponsored-search a fundamental task of sponsored-search is how to find the best match between web-search-queries and textual advertisements . to address this problem , we explicitly characterize the criteria for an advertisement to be a ` good match ' to a query from two aspects (it should be relevant with the query from information perspective , and it should be able to capture and satisfy the commercial-intent in the query) . correspondingly , we introduce in this paper a mixture language model of two parts : a commercial model which characterizes language bias of commercial-intent leveraging on users ' clicks on advertisements , and an informational model which is a traditional language-model with consideration of the entropy of each word to capture informational relevance . we then introduce a regularized expectation-maximization (em) algorithm model for parameters estimation , and integrate query commercial-intent into the scoring-function to boost overall click efficiency . empirical-evaluation shows that our model achieves better performance as compared to a well tuned classical language-model and deliberated tfidf-plsi model (6 \ % and 5 \ % precision improvement at our operating point in production-environment of 30 \ % recall , and 5.3 \ % and 6.3 \ % auc improvement) , and performs superior to the kl-divergence language-model for tail-queries (0.5 \ % ndcg improvement) . live traffic test shows over 2 \ % ctr lift and 2.5 \ % rps lift as well .
