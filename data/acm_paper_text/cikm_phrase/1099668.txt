situation-aware risk-management in autonomous-agents we present a novel approach to enable decision-making in a highly distributed multiagent environment where individual agents need to act in an autonomous fashion . our architecture-framework integrates risk-management , knowledge-management , and agent-deliberation to enable sophisticated , autonomous decision-making . instead of a centralized knowledge-repository , our approach supports a highly distributed knowledge base in which each agent manages a fraction of the knowledge needed by the entire system .
