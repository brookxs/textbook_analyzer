discovering health-related knowledge in social-media using ensembles of heterogeneous features social-media is emerging as a powerful source of communication , information-dissemination and mining . being colloquial and ubiquitous in nature makes it easier for users to express their opinions and preferences in a seamless , dynamic manner . epidemic surveillance-systems that utilize social-media to detect the emergence of diseases have been proposed in the literature . these systems mostly employ traditional document classification-techniques that represent a document with a bag of n-grams . however , such techniques are not optimal for social-media where sparsity and noise are norms . the authors address the limitations posed by the traditional n-gram_based methods and propose to use-features that represent different semantic aspects of the data in combination with ensemble machine-learning-techniques to identify health-related messages in a heterogenous pool of social-media-data . furthermore , the results reveal significant improvement in identifying health related social-media content which can be critical in the emergence of a novel , unknown disease epidemic .
