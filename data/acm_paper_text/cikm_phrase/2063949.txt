authormagic : an approach to author-disambiguation in large-scale digital-libraries a collaboration of leading research centers in the field of high-energy-physics (hep) has built inspire , a novel information-infrastructure , which comprises the entire corpus of about one million documents produced within the discipline , including a rich set of metadata , citation-information and half a million full-text documents , and offers a unique opportunity for author-disambiguation strategies . the presented approach features extended metadata comparison metrics and a three-step unsupervised graph-clustering technique . the algorithm aided in identifying 200 ' 000 individuals from 6 ' 500 ' 000 author signatures . preliminary tests based on knowledge of external experts and a pilot of a crowd-sourcing system show a success-rate of more than 96 \ % within the selected test-cases . the obtained author clusters serve as a recommendation for inspire users to further clean the publication list in a crowd-sourced approach .
