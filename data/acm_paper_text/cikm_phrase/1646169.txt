multi-task-learning for learning-to-rank in web-search both the quality and quantity of training-data have significant impact on the performance of ranking-functions in the context of learning-to-rank for web-search . due to resource-constraints , training-data for smaller search-engine markets are scarce and we need to leverage existing training-data from large markets to enhance the learning of ranking-function for smaller markets . in this paper , we present a boosting framework for learning-to-rank in the multi-task-learning context for this purpose . in particular , we propose to learn non-parametric common structures adaptively from multiple-tasks in a stage-wise way . an algorithm is developed to iteratively discover super-features that are effective for all the tasks . the estimation of the functions for each task is then learned as a linear combination of those super-features . we evaluate the performance of this multi-task-learning method for web-search-ranking using data from a search-engine . our results demonstrate that multi-task-learning methods bring significant relevance improvements over existing baseline methods .
