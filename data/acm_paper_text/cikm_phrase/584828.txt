structural-extraction from visual layout of documents most information-extraction-systems focus on the textual content of the documents . they treat documents as sequences or of words , disregarding the physical and typographical layout of the information . . while this strategy helps in focusing the extraction-process on the key semantic-content of the document , much valuable information can also be derived form the document physical appearance . often , fonts , physical positioning and other graphical characteristics are used to provide additional context to the information . this information is lost with pure-text analysis . in this paper we describe a general procedure for structural-extraction , which allows for automatic-extraction of entities from the document based on their visual characteristics and relative position in the document-layout . our structural-extraction procedure is a learning-algorithm , which knows how to automatically generalizes from examples . the procedure is a general one , applicable to any document-format with visual and typographical information . we also then describe a specific implementation of the procedure to pdf-documents , called pes (pdf extraction-system) . pes works with pdf-documents and is able to extract such fields such as author (s) , title , date , etc. with very high accuracy .
