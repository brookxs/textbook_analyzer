the downside of markup : examining the harmful effects of css and javascript on indexing today 's web the continued development and maturation of advanced html features such as cascading-style-sheets (css) , javascript , and ajax , as well as their widespread adoption by browsers , has enabled web-pages to flourish with sophistication and interactivity . unfortunately , this presents challenges to the-web search community , as a web-page 's representation in the browser (i.e. , what users see) can diverge dramatically from its raw html content (i.e. , what search-engines index and retrieve) . for example , interactive pages may contain content in regions that are not visible before a user-action , such as focusing a tab , but which are nonetheless still contained within the raw html . we study this divergence by comparing raw html to its fully rendered form across a number of metrics spanning presentation , geometry , and content , using a large , representative sample of popular web-pages . we find that a large divergence currently exists , and we show via a historical-analysis that this divergence has grown more pronounced over the last decade . the general finding of our study is that continuing to index the-web via simple html-parsing will diminish the effectiveness of retrieval on the modern web , and that the ir community should work toward more sophisticated web-page-processing in indexing technology .
