advances in phonetic word-spotting phonetic-speech-retrieval is used to augment word_based retrieval in spoken-document-retrieval systems , for in and out-of-vocabulary-words . in this paper , we present a new indexing and ranking-scheme using metaphones and a bayesian phonetic edit-distance . we conduct an extensive set of experiments using a hundred hours of hub4 data with ground-truth transcript and twenty-four thousands query words . we show improvement of up to 15 \ % in precision compare to results obtained speech-recognition alone , at a processing-time of 0.5 sec per query .
