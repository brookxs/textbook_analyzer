resource-aware kernel-density estimators over streaming-data a fundamental building-block of many data-mining and analysis approaches is density-estimation as it provides a comprehensive statistical-model of a data-distribution . for that reason , its application to transient-data streams is highly desirable . a convenient , nonparametric-method for density-estimation utilizes kernels . however , its computational-complexity collides with the rigid processing requirements of data-streams . in this work , we present a new approach to this problem that combines linear processing cost with a constant amount of allocated memory . our approach also supports a dynamic-memory adaptation to changing system-resources .
