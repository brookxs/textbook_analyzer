interconnection-semantics for keyword-search in xml a framework for describing semantic-relationships among nodes in xml-documents is presented . in contrast to earlier work , the xml-documents may have id references (i.e. , they correspond to graphs and not just trees) . a specific interconnection-semantics in this framework can be defined explicitly or derived automatically . the main advantage of interconnection-semantics is the ability to pose queries on xml-data in the style of keyword-search . several methods for automatically deriving interconnection-semantics are presented . the complexity of the evaluation and the satisfiability problems under the derived semantics is analyzed . for many important cases , the complexity is tractable and hence , the proposed interconnection-semantics can be efficiently applied to real-world xml-documents .
