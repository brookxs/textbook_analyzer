learning to recommend questions based on user-ratings at community-question-answering services , users are usually encouraged to rate questions by votes . the questions with the most votes are then recommended and ranked on the top when users browse questions by category . as users are not obligated to rate questions , usually only a small proportion of questions eventually gets rating . thus , in this paper , we are concerned with learning to recommend questions from user-ratings of a limited size . to overcome the data-sparsity , we propose to utilize questions without users rating as well . further , as there exist certain noises within user-ratings (the preference of some users expressed in their ratings diverges from that of the majority of users) , we design a new algorithm called ` majority-based perceptron-algorithm ' which can avoid the influence of noisy instances by emphasizing its learning over data instances from the majority users . experimental-results from a large-collection of real questions confirm the effectiveness of our proposals .
