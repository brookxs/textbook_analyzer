a spam resistant family of concavo-convex ranks for link-analysis a parameterized family of non-linear , link analytic ranking-functions is proposed that includes pagerank as a special case and uses the convexity property of those functions to be more resistant to link-spam attacks . a contribution of the paper is the construction of such a scheme with provable uniqueness and convergence guarantees . the paper also demonstrates that even in an unlabelled scenario this family can have spam resistance comparable to trustrank [3] that uses labels of spam or nat-spam on a training-set . the proposed method can use labels , if available , to improve its performance to provide state-of-the-art level of link-spam protection .
