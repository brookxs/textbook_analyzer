full-text citation-analysis : enhancing bibliometric and scientific publication ranking the goal of this paper is to use innovative text and graph-mining algorithms along with full-text citation-analysis and topic-modeling to enhance classical bibliometric-analysis and publication ranking . by utilizing citation-contexts extracted from a large number of full-text publications , each citation or publication is represented by a probability-distribution over a set of predefined topics , where each topic is labeled by an author contributed keyword . we then used publication/citation topic distribution to generate a citation-graph with vertex prior and edge transitioning probability-distributions . the publication importance score for each given topic is calculated by pagerank with edge and vertex prior distributions . based on 104 topics (labeled with keywords) and their review papers , the cited publications of each review paper are assumed as `` important publications '' for ranking-evaluation . the result shows that full text citation and publication content prior topic distribution along with the pagerank-algorithm can significantly enhance bibliometric-analysis and scientific publication ranking-performance for academic ir-system .
