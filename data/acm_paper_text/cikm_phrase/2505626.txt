content-centric flow mining for influence-analysis in social-streams the problem of discovering information-flow trends and influencers in social-networks has become increasingly relevant both because of the increasing amount of content available from online networks in the form of social-streams , and because of its relevance as a tool for content trends analysis . an important part of this analysis is to determine the key patterns of flow and corresponding influencers in the underlying network . almost all the work on influence-analysis has focused on fixed models of the network-structure , and edge-based transmission between nodes . in this paper , we propose a fully content-centered model of flow-analysis in social-network streams , in which the analysis is based on actual content transmissions in the network , rather than a static model of transmission on the edges . first , we introduce the problem of information-flow mining in social-streams , and then propose a novel algorithm inflowmine to discover the information-flow patterns in the network . we then leverage this approach to determine the key influencers in the network . our approach is flexible , since it can also determine topic-specific influencers . we experimentally show the effectiveness and efficiency of our model .
