nonlinear static-rank computation mainstream link-based static-rank algorithms (e.g. pagerank and its variants) express the importance of a page as the linear-combination of its in-links and compute page-importance scores by solving a linear system in an iterative way . such linear algorithms , however , may give apparently unreasonable static-rank results for some link-structures . in this paper , we examine the static-rank computation problem from the viewpoint of evidence-combination and build a probabilistic-model for it . based on the model , we argue that a nonlinear formula should be adopted , due to the correlation or dependence between links . we focus on examining some simple formulas which only consider the correlation between links in the same domain . experiments conducted on 100 million web-pages (with multiple static-rank quality-evaluation metrics) show that higher quality static-rank could be yielded by the new nonlinear algorithms . the convergence of the new algorithms is also proved in this paper by nonlinear functional-analysis .
