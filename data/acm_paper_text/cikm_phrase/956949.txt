itopn : incremental extraction of the n most visible objects the visual-exploration of large-databases calls for a tight-coupling of database and visualization-systems . current visualization-systems typically fetch all the data and organize it in a scene tree , which is then used to render the visible data . for immersive data explorations , where an observer navigates in a potentially huge data-space and explores selected data regions this approach is inadequate . a scalable approach is to make the database-system observer-aware and exchange the data that is visible and most relevant to the observer.in this paper we present itopn an incremental-algorithm for extracting the most visible objects relative to the current position of the observer . we implement itopn and compare it to an improved version of the r-tree that extends lru with the caching of the top levels of the r-tree (lw-lru) . our experiments show that itopn is orders of magnitude faster than lw-lru given the same amount of memory . our experiments also show that for lw-lru to perform as fast as itopn it needs three times as much memory .
