efficient interactive-query-expansion with complete-search we present an efficient realization of the following interactive-search engine feature : as the user is typing the query , words that are related to the last query word and that would lead to good hits are suggested , as well as selected such hits . the realization has three parts : (i) building clusters of related terms , (ii) adding this information as artificial words to the index such that (iii) the described feature reduces to an instance of prefix search and completion . an efficient-solution for the latter is provided by the completesearch engine , with which we have integrated the proposed feature . for building the clusters of related terms we propose a variant of latent-semantic-indexing that , unlike standard approaches , is completely transparent to the user . by experiments on two large test-collections , we demonstrate that the feature is provided at only a slight increase in query-processing time and index-size .
