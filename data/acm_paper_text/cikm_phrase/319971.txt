metadata and data-structures for the historical newspaper digital-library we examine metadata and data-structure issues for the historical newspaper digital-library . this project proposes to digitize and then do ocr and linguisting processing on several years worth of historical-newspapers . newspapers are very complex-information objects so developing a rich description of their content is challenging . in addition to frameworks for the logical-structure and physical-layout , we propose metadata relevant to the image-processing and to the historians who will use this collection . finally , we consider how the metadata-infrastructure might be managed as it evolves with improved text-processing capabilities and how an infrastructure might be developed to support a-community of users .
