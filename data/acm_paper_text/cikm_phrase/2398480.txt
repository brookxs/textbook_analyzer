frequent grams based embedding for privacy-preserving record-linkage in this paper , we study the problem of privacy-preserving record-linkage which aims to perform record-linkage without revealing anything about the non-linked records . we propose a new secure embedding strategy based on frequent variable-length grams which allows record-linkage on the embedded space . the frequent grams used for constructing the embedding base are mined from the original database under the framework of differential-privacy . compared with the state-of-the-art secure-matching schema [15] , our approach provides formal , provable privacy guarantees and achieves better scalability while providing comparable utility .
