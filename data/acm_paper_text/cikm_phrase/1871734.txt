on bootstrapping recommender-systems recommender-systems perform much better on users for which they have more information . this gives rise to a problem of satisfying users new to a system . the problem is even more acute considering that some of these hard to profile new-users judge the unfamiliar system by its ability to immediately provide them with satisfying recommendations , and may be the quickest to abandon the system when disappointed . rapid profiling of new-users is often achieved through a bootstrapping-process - a kind of an initial interview - that elicits users to provide their opinions on certain carefully chosen items or categories . this work offers a new bootstrapping-method , which is based on a concrete optimization goal , thereby handily outperforming known approaches in our tests .
