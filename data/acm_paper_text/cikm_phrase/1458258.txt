ce2 : towards a large-scale hybrid-search engine with integrated ranking support the-web contains a large amount of documents and increasingly , also semantic data in the form of rdf-triples . many of these triples are annotations that are associated with documents . while structured-query is the principal mean to retrieve semantic data , keyword-queries are typically used for document-retrieval . clearly , a form of hybrid-search that seamlessly integrates these formalisms to query both documents and semantic data can address more complex-information-needs . in this paper , we present ce 2 , an integrated solution that leverages mature database and information retrieval technologies to tackle challenges in hybrid-search on the large-scale . for scalable-storage , ce 2 integrates database with inverted-indices . hybrid-query processing is supported in ce 2 through novel algorithms-and-data-structures , which allow for advanced ranking schemes to be integrated more tightly into the process . experiments conducted on dbpedia and wikipedia show that ce 2 can provide good performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency .
