a framework for mining topological patterns in spatio-temporal-databases mining topological patterns in spatial-databases has received a lot of attention . however , existing work typically ignores the temporal aspect and suffers from certain efficiency problems . they are not scalable for mining topological patterns in spatio-temporal-databases . in this paper , we study the problem for mining topological patterns by incorporating the temporal aspect in the mining process . we introduce a summary-structure that records the instances ' count information of a feature in a region within a time-window . using this structure , we design an algorithm , topologyminer , to find interesting topological patterns without the need to generate candidates . experimental-results show that topologyminer is effective and scalable in finding topological patterns and outperforms apriori-like algorithm by a few orders of magnitudes .
