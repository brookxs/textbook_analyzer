temporal corpus summarization using submodular word coverage in many areas of life , we now have almost complete electronic archives reaching back for well over two decades . this includes , for example , the body of research papers in computer-science , all news-articles written in the us , and most people 's personal email . however , we have only rather limited methods for analyzing and understanding these collections . while keyword-based-retrieval systems allow efficient access to individual documents in archives , we still lack methods for understanding a corpus as a whole . in this paper , we explore methods that provide a temporal summary of such corpora in terms of landmark documents , authors , and topics . in particular , we explicitly model the temporal nature of influence between documents and re-interpret summarization as a coverage-problem over words anchored in time . the resulting models provide monotone sub-modular objectives for computing informative and non-redundant summaries over time , which can be efficiently optimized with greedy-algorithms . our empirical-study shows the effectiveness of our approach over several baselines .
