walking in the crowd : anonymizing trajectory-data for pattern-analysis recently , trajectory-data-mining has received a lot of attention in both the industry and the academic-research . in this paper , we study the privacy threats in trajectory-data publishing and show that traditional anonymization methods are not applicable for trajectory-data due to its challenging properties : high-dimensional , sparse , and sequential . our primary contributions are (1) to propose a new privacy-model called lkc - privacy that overcomes these challenges , and (2) to develop an efficient anonymization algorithm to achieve lkc - privacy while preserving the information utility for trajectory-pattern mining .
