efficient techniques for document-sanitization sanitization of a document involves removing sensitive-information from the document , so that it may be distributed to a broader audience . such sanitization is needed while declassifying documents involving sensitive or confidential information such as corporate emails , intelligence reports , medical-records , etc. . in this paper , we present the erase framework for performing document-sanitization in an automated manner . erase can be used to sanitize a document dynamically , so that different users get different views of the same document based on what they are authorized to know . we formalize the problem and present algorithms used in erase for finding the appropriate terms to remove from the document . our preliminary experimental-study demonstrates the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed algorithms .
