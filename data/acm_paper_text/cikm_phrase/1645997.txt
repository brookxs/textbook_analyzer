an integrated discriminative probabilistic-approach to information-extraction probabilistic-graphical-models for sequence-data enable us to effectively deal with inherent uncertainty in many real-world domains . however , they operate on a mostly propositional level . logic approaches , on the other hand , can compactly represent a wide variety of knowledge , especially first-order ones , but treat uncertainty only in limited ways . therefore , combining probability and first-order-logic is highly desirable for information-extraction which requires uncertainty modeling as well as dependency and deeper knowledge-representation . in this paper , we model both segmentations in observation sequence and relations of segments simultaneously in our proposed integrated discriminative probabilistic-framework . we propose the metropolis-hastings , a markov-chain-monte-carlo (mcmc) algorithm for approximate bayesian-inference to find the maximum a posteriori assignment of all the variables of this model . this integrated model has several advantages over previous probabilistic-graphical-models , and it offers a great capability of extracting implicit relations and new relation-discovery for relation-extraction from encyclopedic documents , and capturing sub-structures in named-entities for named-entity-recognition . we performed extensive experiments on the above two well-established information-extraction-tasks , illustrating the feasibility and promise of our approach .
