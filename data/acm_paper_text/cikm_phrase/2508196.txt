consumer-centric sla manager for cloud-hosted databases we present an end-to-end framework for consumer-centric sla management of virtualized database servers . the framework facilitates adaptive and dynamic-provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own sla performance-requirements , avoiding the cost of any sla violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing-resources . in this framework , the sla of the consumer-applications are declaratively defined in terms of goals which are subjected to a number of constraints that are specific to the application-requirements . the framework continuously monitors the application-defined sla and automatically triggers the execution of necessary corrective actions (scaling out/in the database tier) when required . the framework is database platform-agnostic , uses virtualization-based database-replication mechanisms and requires zero source-code-changes of the cloud-hosted application .
