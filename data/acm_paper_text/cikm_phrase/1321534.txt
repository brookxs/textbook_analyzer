efficient evaluation of high-selective xml twig patterns with parent-child-edges in tree-unaware-rdbms recent study showed that native twig join-algorithms and tree-aware relational framework significantly outperform tree-unaware approaches in evaluating structural-relationships in xml-twig-queries . in this paper , we present an efficient strategy to evaluate high-selective twig queries containing only parent-child relationships in a tree-unaware relational environment . our scheme is built on top of our s <scp> ucxent </scp> + + system . we show that by exploiting the encoding-scheme of s <scp> ucxent </scp> + + , we can devise efficient strategy for evaluating such twig queries . extensive performance-studies on various data-sets and queries show that our approach performs better than a representative tree-unaware approach (g <scp> lobal </scp> - o <scp> rder </scp>) and a state-of-the-art native twig join-algorithm (tjf <scp> ast </scp>) on all benchmark-queries with the highest observed gain factors being 243 and 95 , respectively . additionally , our approach reduces significantly the performance gap between tree-aware and tree-unaware approaches and even outperforms a tree-aware approach (m <scp> onet </scp> db/xq <scp> uery </scp>) for certain high-selective twig queries . we also report our insights to the plan choices a relational optimizer made during twig-query-evaluation by visually characterizing its behavior over the relational selectivity space .
