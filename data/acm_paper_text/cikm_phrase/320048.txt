architecture of a networked image-search and retrieval-system large-scale networked image-retrieval-systems face a number of problems that are not fully satisfied by current systems . on one hand , integrated solutions that store all image-data centrally are often limited in terms of scalability and autonomy of data providers . on the other hand , www-based search-engines proved to be fairly scalable , and data providers retain their autonomy . however , such engines often confront users with links to servers that are not available or to images that no longer exist , i.e. , they are unable to keep their meta-database consistent with the repositories ' contents . furthermore , existing solutions often neglect the cost of image delivery . the considerable variations in the effective-bandwidth in today 's internet lead to highly unpredictable response-times , which are often intolerable from the user 's point-of-view . this paper presents the architecture of chariot , a networked image-search and retrieval-system that tackles these concerns . with respect to scalability and autonomy , chariot follows the approach of www-based search-engines by maintaining only the meta-data in a central-database . various specialized components (feature-extraction , indexes , images servers) are coordinated by a middleware component that employs transactional process-management to enforce consistency between the meta-data and all components . moreover , chariot incorporates mechanisms to provide more predictable response-times for the image delivery over the-internet by employing network-aware image servers . these servers trade-off the quality of the images to be delivered with the bandwidth required to transmit the images .
