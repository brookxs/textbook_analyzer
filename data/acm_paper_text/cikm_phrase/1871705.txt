embedding tolerance relations in formal-concept-analysis : an application in information-fusion this paper shows how to embed a similarity relation between complex descriptions in concept-lattices . we formalize similarity by a tolerance relation : objects are grouped within a same concept when having similar descriptions , extending the ability of fca to deal with complex-data . we propose two different approaches . ~ a first classical manner defines a discretization procedure . a second way consists in representing data by pattern structures , from which a pattern concept-lattice can be constructed directly . in this case , considering a tolerance relation can be mathematically defined by a projection in a meet-semi-lattice . this allows to use concept-lattices for their knowledge-representation-and-reasoning abilities without transforming data . we show finally that resulting lattices are useful for solving information-fusion problems .
