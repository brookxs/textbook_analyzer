fast correlation analysis on time-series datasets there has been increasing interest for efficient techniques for fast correlation analysis of time-series-data in different application-domains . we present three algorithms for (1) bivariate correlation queries , (2) multivariate correlation queries , and (3) correlation queries based on a new correlation-measure we introduce using dynamic-time-warping . to support these algorithms , we use a variant of the compact multi-resolution-index (cmri) . in addition to conventional nearest-neighbor and range-queries supported by cmri , the proposed algorithms compute all answers to user-defined , ad-hoc and parametric correlation queries . the results of our experiments indicate a speed-up of two orders of magnitude over the brute-force-algorithm , and an order of magnitude improvement on average , while offering more functionalities than provided by existing techniques such as statstream and the spatial cone-tree .
