schema-free structured querying of dbpedia data we need better ways to query large linked data-collections such as dbpedia . using the sparql-query language requires not only mastering its syntax but also understanding the rdf-data model , large ontology vocabularies and uris for denoting entities . natural-language-interface systems address the problem , but are still subjects of research . we describe a compromise in which non-experts specify a graphical-query `` skeleton '' and annotate it with freely chosen words , phrases and entity names . the combination reduces ambiguity and allows the generation of an interpretation that can be translated into sparql . key research contributions are the robust methods that combine statistical association and semantic-similarity to map user terms to the most appropriate classes and properties in the underlying ontology .
