on the inference of average-precision from score distributions modelling the document scores returned from an ir-system for a given query using parameterised score distributions is an area of research that has become more popular in recent years . score-distribution (sd) models are useful for a number of ir tasks . these include data-fusion , query-performance-prediction , determining thresholds in filtering applications , and tasks in the area of distributed-retrieval . the inference of performance-metrics , such as average-precision , from these sd models is an important consideration . in this paper , we study the accuracy of a number-of-methods of inferring average-precision from an sd model .
