overlapping community-structure-detection in networks many systems in nature and human society take the form of networks with community-structures . in this paper , we describe a simple algorithm cocd (clique-based overlapping community-detection) to efficiently mine the overlapping-communities in large-scale-networks , which is useful for us to have a better understanding of the nested sub-structures embedded in the whole network .
