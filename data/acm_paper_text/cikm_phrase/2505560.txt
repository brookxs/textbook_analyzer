flexible and adaptive subspace search for outlier analysis there exists a variety of traditional outlier models , which measure the deviation of outliers with respect to the full attribute-space . however , these techniques fail to detect outliers that deviate only w.r.t. an attribute subset . to address this problem , recent techniques focus on a selection of subspaces that allow : (1) a clear distinction between clustered-objects and outliers ; (2) a description of outlier reasons by the selected subspaces . however , depending on the outlier model used , different objects in different subspaces have the highest deviation . it is an open-research issue to make subspace selection adaptive to the outlier score of each object and flexible w.r.t. the use of different outlier models . in this work we propose such a flexible and adaptive subspace selection-scheme . our generic processing allows instantiations with different outlier models . we utilize the differences of outlier scores in random subspaces to perform a combinatorial refinement of relevant subspaces . our refinement allows an individual selection of subspaces for each outlier , which is tailored to the underlying outlier model . in the experiments we show the flexibility of our subspace search w.r.t. various outlier models such as distance-based , angle-based , and local-density-based outlier-detection .
