a generative retrieval-model for structured-documents structured-documents contain elements defined by the author (s) and annotations assigned by other people or processes . structured-documents pose challenges for probabilistic-retrieval-models when there are mismatches between the structured-query and the actual structure in a relevant-document or erroneous structure introduced by an annotator . this paper makes three contributions . first , a new generative retrieval-model is proposed to deal with the mismatch problem . this new model extends the basic keyword language-model by treating structure as hidden-variable during the generation-process . second , variations of the model are compared . third , term-level and structure-level smoothing strategies are studied . evaluation was conducted with inex xml-retrieval and question-answering retrieval tasks . experimental-results indicate that the optimal structured-retrieval model is task dependent , two-level dirichlet-smoothing significantly outperforms two-level jelinek-mercer-smoothing , and with accurate structured-queries , the proposed structured-retrieval model outperforms keyword-retrieval significantly , on both qa and inex datasets .
