a probabilistic description-oriented approach for categorizing web-documents the automatic categorisation of web-documents is becoming crucial for organising the huge amount of information available in the internet . we are facing a new challenge due to the fact that web-documents have a rich structure and are highly heterogeneous . two ways to respond to this challenge are (1) using a representation of the content of web-documents that captures these two characteristics and (2) using more effective classifiers . our categorisation approach is based on a probabilistic description-oriented representation of web-documents , and a probabilistic interpretation of the k - nearest-neighbour classifier . with the former , we provide an enhanced document-representation that incorporates the structural and heterogeneous nature of web-documents . with the latter , we provide a theoretical sound justification for the various parameters of the k - nearest-neighbour classifier . experimental-results show that (1) using an enhanced representation of web-documents is crucial for an effective categorisation of web-documents , and (2) a theoretical interpretation of the k - nearest-neighbour classifier gives us improvement over the standard k - nearest-neighbour classifier .
