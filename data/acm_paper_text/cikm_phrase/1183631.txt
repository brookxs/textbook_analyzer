investigating the exhaustivity dimension in content-oriented xml element-retrieval evaluation inex , the evaluation initiative for content-oriented xml-retrieval , has since its establishment defined the relevance of an element according to two graded dimensions , exhaustivity and specificity . the former measures how exhaustively an xml element discusses the topic of request , whereas specificity measures how focused the element is on the topic of request . the reason for having two dimensions was to provide a more stable measure of relevance than if assessors were asked to rate the relevance of an element on a single scale . however , obtaining relevance-assessments is a costly task . as each document must be assessed for relevance by a human assessor . in xml-retrieval this problem is exacerbated as the elements of the document must also be assessed with respect to the exhaustivity and specificity dimensions . a continuous discussion in inex has been whether such a sophisticated definition of relevance , and in particular the exhaustivity dimension , was needed . this paper attempts to answer this question through extensive statistical-tests to compare the conclusions about system-performance that could be made under different assessment scenarios .
