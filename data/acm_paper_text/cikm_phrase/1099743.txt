balancing performance and confidentiality in air-index studies on the performance issues (i.e. , access latency and energy-conservation) of wireless-data-broadcast have appeared in the literature . however , the important security issues have not been well addressed . this paper investigates the tradeoff-between-performance-and-security of signature-based air-index schemes in wireless-data-broadcast . from the performance perspective , keeping low false drop-probability helps clients retrieve the information from a broadcast-channel efficiently . meanwhile , from the security perspective , achieving high false guess probability prevents the hacker from guessing the information easily . there is a tradeoff between these two aspects . an administrator of the wireless-broadcast system may balance this tradeoff by carefully configuring the signatures used in broadcast . this study provides a guidance for parameter-settings of the signature-schemes in order to meet the performance and security-requirements . experiments are performed to validate the analytical results and to obtain optimal signature configuration corresponding to different application criteria .
