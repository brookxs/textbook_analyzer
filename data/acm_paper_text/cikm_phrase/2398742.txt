exploration of monte-carlo based probabilistic query-processing in uncertain graphs this demo presents a framework for running probabilistic-graph queries on uncertain graphs and visualizing their results . the framework supports the most common uncertainty model for uncertain graphs , i.e. existential uncertainty for the edges of the graph . a large variety of meaningful graph-queries are supported , such as shortest-path , range , kn , reverse kn , reachability and various aggregation-queries . since the problem of exact probability computation according to possible-world-semantics is in #p - time for many combinations of model and query , and since ignoring uncertainty (e.g. by using expectations only) will yield counterintuitive and hard to interpret results , our framework uses an optimized version of monte-carlo sampling to estimate the results which allows us not only to perform queries that conform to possible-world-semantics but also to sample only parts of a graph relevant for a given query . the main strength of this framework is the visualization combined with statistic hypothesis-tests , which gives the user not only the estimated result of a query , but also an indication of how significant and reliable these results are . the aim of this demonstration is to give an intuition that a sampling_based approach to probabilistic graphs is viable , and that the estimated results quickly converge even for very-large-graphs . a video demonstrating our framework can be downloaded at http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/publikationen/videos/pgraph.html
