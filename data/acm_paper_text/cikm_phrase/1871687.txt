taxonomic clustering of web-service for efficient discovery the world-wide-web (www) has become a major platform for hosting , discovering , and composing web-services . web-service-clustering is a technique for efficiently facilitating web-service-discovery . most web-service-clustering approaches are based on suitable semantic-similarity distance-measure and a threshold . threshold-selection is essentially difficult and often leads to unsatisfactory accuracy . in this paper we propose a taxonomic clustering-algorithm for grouping functionally similar web-services . we have tested the algorithm on both simulation-based randomly generated test-data and the standard owl-s tc test-data-set . we have observed promising results both in terms of accuracy and performance .
