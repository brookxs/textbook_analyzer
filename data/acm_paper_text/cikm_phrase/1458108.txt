a step towards incremental-maintenance of the composed schema-mapping schema-mapping plays a fundamental role in modern information systems . mapping-composition is an operator that combines a chain of successive schema-mappings into a single schema-mapping . by pre-computing the composed schema-mapping , the system can achieve significant performance benefits . however , when a change occurs on any mapping in the chain , the composed schema-mapping has to be maintained correspondingly . in this paper we consider a restricted form of the problem in the xml setting and propose an incremental-maintenance approach . specifically , given a chain of successive mappings , we transform intermediately them into trees that consist of atomic rules and then divide the composition into sub-compositions of the atomic rules . the dividing composition approach provides a fine-grained perspective of the composition relationships between the mappings . we depict such information through an auxiliary-data structure called composition relationship-graph (crg) . when changes occur on any mapping in the chain , the corresponding maintenance algorithms are developed based on the dividing approach and the crg , which compute the changes on the composed mapping and then repair it into the new version , such that the computation involves only the atomic rules that are relevant with the maintenance . we evaluate our maintenance approach and report the first experiments results , which show that it is efficient .
