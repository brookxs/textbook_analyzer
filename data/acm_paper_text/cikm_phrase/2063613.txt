tag-clouds revisited tagging has become a very common feature in web-2.0-applications , providing a simple and effective way for users to freely annotate resources to facilitate their discovery and management . subsequently , tag-clouds have become popular as a summarized representation of a collection of tagged resources . a tag-cloud is typically a visualization of the top-k most frequent tags in the underlying collection . in this paper , we revisit tag-clouds , to examine whether frequency is the most suitable criterion for tag-ranking . we propose alternative tag-ranking strategies , based on methods for random-walk-on-graphs , diversification , and rank-aggregation . to enable the comparison of different tag-selection and ranking methods , we propose a set of evaluation-metrics that consider the use of tag-clouds for search , navigation and recommendations . we apply these tag-ranking methods and evaluation-metrics to empirically compare alternative tag-clouds in a dataset obtained from flickr , comprising 488,112 tagged-photos organized in 451 groups , and 112,514 distinct tags .
