pruning long documents for distributed-information-retrieval query-based-sampling is a method of discovering the contents of a text-database by submitting queries to a search-engine and observing the documents returned . in prior research sampled documents were used to build resource descriptions for automatic database selection , and to build a centralized sample database for query-expansion and result-merging . an unstated assumption was that the associated storage costs were acceptable.when sampled documents are long , storage costs can be large . this paper investigates methods of pruning long documents to reduce storage costs . the experimental-results demonstrate that building resource descriptions and centralized sample databases from the pruned contents of sampled documents can reduce storage costs by 54-93 \ % while causing only minor losses in the accuracy of distributed-information-retrieval .
