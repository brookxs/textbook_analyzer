opportunity map : a visualization-framework for fast identification of actionable knowledge data-mining-techniques frequently find a large number of patterns or rules , which make it very difficult for a human analyst to interpret the results and to find the truly interesting and actionable-rules . due to the subjective nature of `` interestingness '' , human-involvement in the analysis-process is crucial . in this paper , we propose a novel visual-data-mining framework for the purpose of identifying actionable knowledge quickly and easily from discovered rules and data . this framework is called the opportunity map . it is inspired by some interesting ideas from quality engineering , in particular quality function deployment (qfd) and the house of quality . it associates summarized data or discovered rules with the application objective using an interactive matrix , which enables the user to quickly identify where the opportunities are . the proposed system can be used to visually analyze discovered rules , and other statistical-properties of the data . the user can also interactively group actionable attributes and values , and see how they affect the targets of interest . combined with drill-down and comparative-analysis , the user can analyze rules and data at different levels-of-detail . the proposed visualization-framework thus represents a systematic and yet flexible method of rule-analysis . applications of the system to large-scale-data sets from our industrial partner have yielded promising results .
