semi-supervised-ranking aggregation ranking-aggregation is important in data-mining and information-retrieval . in this paper , we proposed a semi-supervised-ranking aggregation method , in which the order of several item pairs are labeled as side-information . the core idea is to learn a ranking-function based on the ordering agreement of different rankers . the ranking scores assigned by this ranking-function on the labeled-data are consistent with the given pairwise order constraints while the ranking scores on the unlabeled-data obey the intrinsic manifold structure of the rank items . the experiment results show our method work well .
