processing search queries in a distributed-environment endeca 's approach to processing search queries in a distributed-computing-environment is predicated on concerns of correctness , scalability , and flexibility in deployment . using a master-slave architecture , we are able to support classic search as well as more advanced features . we avoid bottlenecking the master with excessive computation or communication by limiting the information from the slaves in the expected case .
