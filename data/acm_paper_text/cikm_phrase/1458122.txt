local-approximation of pagerank and reverse-pagerank we consider the problem of approximating the pagerank of a target node using only local-information provided by a link-server . this problem was originally studied by chen , gan , and suel (cikm 2004) , who presented an algorithm for tackling it . we prove that local-approximation of pagerank , even to within modest approximation factors , is infeasible in the worst-case , as it requires probing the link-server for ? (n) nodes , where n is the size of the graph . the difficulty emanates from nodes of high in-degree and/or from slow-convergence of the pagerank random-walk . we show that when the graph has bounded in-degree and admits fast pagerank convergence , then local pagerank approximation can be done using a small number of queries . unfortunately , natural graphs , such as the-web graph , are abundant with high in-degree nodes , making this algorithm (or any other local-approximation algorithm) too costly . on the other hand , reverse natural graphs tend to have low in-degree while maintaining fast pagerank convergence . it follows that calculating reverse-pagerank locally is frequently more feasible than computing pagerank locally . we demonstrate that reverse-pagerank is useful for several applications , including computation of hub scores for web-pages , finding influencers in social-networks , obtaining good seeds for crawling , and measurement of semantic-relatedness between concepts in a taxonomy .
