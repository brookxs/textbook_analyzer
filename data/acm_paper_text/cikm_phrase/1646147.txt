a framework for safely publishing communication traces a communication-trace is a detailed record of the communication between two entities . communication traces are vital for research in computer networks and study of network-protocols in various domains , but their release is severely constrained by privacy-and-security concerns . in this paper , we propose a framework in which a trace owner can match an anonymizing transformation with the requirements of analysts . the trace owner can release multiple transformed traces , each customized to an analyst 's needs , or a single transformation satisfying all requirements . the framework enables formal-reasoning about anonymization policies , for example to verify that a given trace has utility for the analyst , or to obtain the most secure anonymization for the desired level of utility . because communication traces are typically very-large , we also provide techniques that allow efficient application of transformations using relational-database-systems .
