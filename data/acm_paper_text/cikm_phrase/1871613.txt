formal-approach and automated-tool for constructing ontology from object-oriented-database model extracting domain-knowledge from databases can facilitate the development of web-ontologies . in this paper , a formal-approach and an automated-tool for constructing ontologies from object-oriented-database models (oodms) are developed . the approach and tool can automatically translate an oodm and its corresponding database instances into the ontology structure and ontology instances , respectively . case-studies show that the approach is feasible and the automated construction tool is efficient .
