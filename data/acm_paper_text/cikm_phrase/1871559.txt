improving one-class-collaborative-filtering by incorporating rich-user-information one-class-collaborative-filtering (occf) is an emerging setup in collaborative-filtering in which only positive examples or implicit-feedback can be observed . compared with the traditional collaborative-filtering setting where the data has ratings , occf is more realistic in many scenarios when no ratings are available . in this paper , we propose to improve occf accuracy by exploiting the rich-user-information that is often naturally available in community-based interactive information systems , including a user 's search-query history , purchasing and browsing activities . we propose two ways to incorporate such user-information into the occf models : one is to linearly combine scores from different sources and the other is to embed user-information into collaborative-filtering . experimental-results on a large-scale retail data-set from a major e-commerce company show that the proposed methods are effective and can improve the performance of the one-class-collaborative-filtering over baseline methods through leveraging rich-user-information .
