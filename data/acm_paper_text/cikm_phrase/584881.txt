condorcet fusion for improved retrieval we present a new algorithm for improving retrieval results by combining document-ranking functions : condorcet-fuse . beginning with one of the two major classes of voting procedures from social-choice-theory , the condorcet procedure , we apply a graph-theoretic analysis that yields a sorting-based algorithm that is elegant , efficient , and effective . the algorithm performs very well on trec-data , often outperforming existing metasearch algorithms whether or not relevance-scores and training-data is available . condorcet-fuse significantly outperforms borda-fuse , the analogous representative from the other major class of voting algorithms .
