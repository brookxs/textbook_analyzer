web-dl : an experience in building digital-libraries from the-web the-web contains a huge volume of information , almost all unstructured and , therefore , difficult to manage . in digital-libraries , however , information is explicitly organized , described , and managed . in this paper , we propose an architecture that allows the construction of digital-libraries from the-web , using standard protocols and archival technologies , and incorporating powerful digital-library and data-extraction tools , thus benefiting from the breadth of the-web contents , but supporting services and organization available in digital-libraries . the proposed architecture was applied to the networked-digital-library-of-theses-and-dissertations , providing an important first step toward rapid construction of large dls from the-web , as well as a large-scale solution for interoperability between independent digital-libraries .
