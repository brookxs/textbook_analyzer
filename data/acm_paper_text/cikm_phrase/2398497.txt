the early-adopter graph and its application to web-page recommendation in this paper we present a novel graph-based data abstraction for modeling the browsing-behavior of web users . the objective is to identify users who discover interesting pages before others . we call these users early adopters . by tracking the browsing activity of early adopters we can identify new interesting pages early , and recommend these pages to similar users . we focus on news and blog pages , which are more dynamic in nature and more appropriate for recommendation . our proposed model is called early-adopter graph . in this graph , nodes represent users and a directed arc between users u and v expresses the fact that u and v visit similar pages and , in particular , that user u tends to visit those pages before user v . the weight of the edge is the degree to which the temporal rule `` v visits a page before v '' holds . based on the early-adopter graph , we build a recommendation-system for news and blog pages , which outperforms other out-of-the-shelf recommendation-systems based on collaborative-filtering .
