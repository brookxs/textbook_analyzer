on skyline groups we formulate and investigate the novel problem of finding the skyline k-tuple groups from an n-tuple dataset - i.e. , groups of k tuples which are not dominated by any other group of equal size , based on aggregate-based group dominance relationship . the major technical challenge is to identify effective anti-monotonic properties for pruning the search-space of skyline groups . to this end , we show that the anti-monotonic property in the well-known apriori-algorithm does not hold for skyline group pruning . we then identify order-specific property which applies to sum , min , and max and weak candidate-generation property which applies to min and max only . experimental-results on both real and synthetic datasets verify that the proposed algorithms achieve orders of magnitude performance-gain over a baseline method .
