a new framework to combine descriptors for content-based-image-retrieval in this paper , we propose a novel framework using genetic-programming to combine image-database descriptors for content-based-image-retrieval (cbir) . our framework is validated through several experiments involving two image-databases and specific domains , where the images are retrieved based on the shape of their objects .
