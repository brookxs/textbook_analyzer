improving web-page-classification by label-propagation over click graphs in this paper , we present a semi-supervised-learning method for web-page-classification , leveraging click-logs to augment training-data by propagating class labels to unlabeled similar documents . current state-of-the-art classifiers are supervised and require large amounts of manually labeled-data . we hypothesize that unlabeled documents similar to our positive and negative labeled documents tend to be clicked through by the same user queries . our proposed method leverages this hypothesis and augments our training-set by modeling the similarity between documents in a click-graph . we experiment with three different web-page classifiers and show empirical evidence that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces the amount of human effort to label training-data .
