indexing text-data under space constraints an important class of queries is the like predicate in sql . in the absence of an index , like-queries are subject to performance-degradation . the notion of indexing on substrings (or <i> q </i> - grams) has been explored earlier without sufficient consideration of efficiency . <i> q </i> - grams are used to prune away rows that do not qualify for the query . the problem is to identify a finite number of grams subject to storage-constraint that gives maximal pruning for a given query workload . our contributions include : i) a formal problem-definition , that produces results within a provable error-bound , ii) performance-evaluation of the application of the novel method to real-data , and iii) parallelization of the algorithm , scaling considerations and a proposal to handle scaling-issues .
