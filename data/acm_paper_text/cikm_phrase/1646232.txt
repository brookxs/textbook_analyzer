fragment-based clustering-ensembles clustering-ensembles combine different clustering solutions into a single robust and stable one . most of existing methods become highly time-consuming when the data size turns to large . in this paper , we study the properties of the defined ` clustering fragment ' and put forward a useful proposition . solid proofs are presented with two widely used goodness measures for clustering-ensembles . finally , a new ensemble framework termed as fragment-based clustering-ensembles is proposed . theoretically , most of existing methods can be improved by adopting this framework . to evaluate the proposed framework , three new methods are introduced by bring three popular clustering-ensemble methods into our framework . the experimental-results on several public data-sets show that the three introduced methods are greatly improved in computational-complexity and also achieved better or similar accurate results than the original methods .
