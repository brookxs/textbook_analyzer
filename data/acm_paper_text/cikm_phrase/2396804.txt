rdf pattern-matching using sortable views in the last few years , rdf is becoming the dominating data-model used in semantic-web for knowledge-representation-and-inference . in this paper , we revisit the problem of pattern-matching query in rdf model , which is usually expensive in efficiency due to the huge cost on join operations . to alleviate the efficiency pain , view-materialization techniques are usually deployed to accelerate the query-processing . however , given an arbitrary view , it remains difficult to identify how to reuse the view for a particular query , because of the np-hardness behind the algorithm matching patterns and views . to fully exploit the benefit of the materialized-views , we propose a new paradigm to enhance the effectiveness of the materialized-view . instead of choosing materialized-views in arbitrary form , our paradigm aims to select the views only if they are sortable . the property of sortability raises huge gains on the pattern-view matching , bringing down the cost to linear-complexity in terms of the pattern size . on the other side , the costs on identifying sortable views and searching over the views using inverted-index are affordable . moreover , sortable views generally improve the overall performance of pattern-matching , by means of a cost-model used to optimize the query-rewriting on the most appropriate views . finally , we demonstrate extensive experimental-results to verify the superiority of our proposal on both efficiency-and-effectiveness .
