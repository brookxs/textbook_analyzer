online spam-blog detection through blog-search in this work , we propose a novel post-indexing spam-blog (or splog) detection-method , which capitalizes on the results returned by blog-search engines . more specifically , we analyze the search-results of a sequence of temporally-ordered queries returned by a blog-search engine , and build and maintain blog profiles for those blogs whose posts frequently appear in the top-ranked search-results . with the blog profiles , 4 splog scoring-functions were evaluated using real-data collected from a popular blog-search engine . our experiments show that the proposed method could effectively detect splogs with a high accuracy .
