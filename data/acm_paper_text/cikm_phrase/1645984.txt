helping editors choose better seed-sets for entity set expansion sets of named-entities are used heavily at commercial search engines such as google , yahoo and bing . acquiring sets of entities typically consists of combining semi-supervised expansion algorithms with manual cleaning of the resulting expanded sets . in this paper , we study the effects of different seed-sets in a state-of-the-art semi-supervised expansion system and show a tremendous variation in expansion performance depending on the choice of seeds . we further show that human editors , in general , provide very bad seed-sets , which perform well-below the average random seed set . we identify three factors of seed set composition , namely prototypicality , ambiguity and coverage , and we investigate their effects on expansion performance . finally , we propose various automatic systems for improving editor-generated seed-sets , which seek to remove ambiguous and other error-prone seed instances . an extensive experimental-analysis shows that expansion quality , measured in r-precision , can be improved on average by a maximum of 46 \ % by removing the right seeds from a seed set . our automatic methods outperform the human editors seed-sets and on average improve expansion performance by up to 34 \ % over the original seed-sets .
