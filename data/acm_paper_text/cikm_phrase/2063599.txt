a task level metric for measuring web-search satisfaction and its application on improving relevance-estimation understanding the behavior of satisfied and unsatisfied web-search users is very important for improving users search experience . collecting labeled-data that characterizes search-behavior is a very challenging problem . most of the previous work used a limited amount of data collected in lab studies or annotated by judges lacking information about the actual intent . in this work , we performed a large-scale user-study where we collected explicit judgments of user-satisfaction with the entire search-task . results were analyzed using sequence models that incorporate user-behavior to predict whether the user ended up being satisfied with a search or not . we test our metric on millions of queries collected from real web-search traffic and show empirically that user-behavior-models trained using explicit judgments of user-satisfaction outperform several other search-quality metrics . the proposed model can also be used to optimize different search-engine components . we propose a method that uses task level success prediction to provide a better interpretation of clickthrough-data . clickthough data has been widely used to improve relevance-estimation . we use our user-satisfaction-model to distinguish between clicks that lead to satisfaction and clicks that do not . we show that adding new features derived from this metric allowed us to improve the estimation of document-relevance .
