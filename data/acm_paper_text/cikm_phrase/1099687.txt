a novel refinement approach for text-categorization in this paper we present a novel strategy , dragpushing , for improving the performance of text classifiers . the strategy is generic and takes advantage of training errors to successively refine the classification-model of a base classifier . we describe how it is applied to generate two new classification algorithms ; a refined centroid classifier and a refined na ve-bayes-classifier . we present an extensive experimental-evaluation of both algorithms on three english collections and one chinese-corpus . the results indicate that in each case , the refined classifiers achieve significant performance-improvement over the base classifiers used . furthermore , the performance of the refined centroid classifier implemented is comparable , if not better , to that of state-of-the-art support-vector-machine (svm) - based classifier , but offers a much lower computational cost .
