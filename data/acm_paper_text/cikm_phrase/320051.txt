word-segmentation and recognition for web-document framework it is observed that a better approach to web-information understanding is to base on its document framework , which is mainly consisted of (i) the title and the url name of the page , (ii) the titles and the url names of the-web pages that it points to , (iii) the alternative information-source for the embedded web objects , and (iv) its linkage to other web-pages of the same document . investigation reveals that a high percentage of words inside the document framework are compound-words which can not be understood by ordinary dictionaries . they might be abbreviations or acronyms , or concatenations of several (partial) words . to recover the content hierarchy of web-documents , we propose a new word segmentation and recognition mechanism to understand the information derived from the-web document framework . a maximal bi-directional matching-algorithm with heuristic-rules is used to resolve ambiguous-segmentation and meaning in compound-words . an adaptive-training process is further employed to build a dictionary of recognisable abbreviations and acronyms . empirical-results show that over 75 \ % of the compound-words found in the web-document framework can be understood by our mechanism . with the training-process , the success-rate of recognising compound-words can be increased to about 90 \ % .
