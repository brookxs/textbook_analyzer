fast on-line-index construction by geometric partitioning inverted-index structures are the mainstay of modern text-retrieval-systems . they can be constructed quickly using off-line merge-based methods , and provide efficient support for a variety of querying modes . in this paper we examine the task of on-line-index construction -- that is , how to build an inverted-index when the underlying data must be continuously queryable , and the documents must be indexed and available for search as soon they are inserted . when straightforward approaches are used , document insertions become increasingly expensive as the size of the database grows . this paper describes a mechanism based on controlled partitioning that can be adapted to suit different balances of insertion and querying operations , and is faster and scales better than previous methods . using experiments on 100gb of web-data we demonstrate the efficiency of our methods in practice , showing that they dramatically reduce the cost of on-line-index construction .
