fact-based question-decomposition for candidate-answer re-ranking factoid questions often contain one or more assertions (facts) about their answers . however , existing question-answering (qa) systems have not investigated how the multiple facts may be leveraged to enhance system-performance . we argue that decomposing complex factoid questions can benefit qa , as an answer candidate is more likely to be correct if multiple independent facts support it . we categorize decomposable questions as parallel or nested , depending on processing-strategy required . we present a novel decomposition framework -- for parallel and nested questions -- which can be overlaid on top of traditional qa-systems . it contains decomposition rules for identifying fact sub-questions , a question-rewriting component and a candidate re-ranker . in a particularly challenging domain for our baseline qa-system , our framework shows a statistically significant improvement in end-to-end qa performance .
