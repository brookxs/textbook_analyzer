on the structural-properties of massive telecom call graphs : findings and implications with ever growing competition in telecommunications markets , operators have to increasingly rely on business-intelligence to offer the right incentives to their customers . toward this end , existing approaches have almost solely focussed on the individual behaviour of customers . call graphs , that is , graphs induced by people calling each other , can allow telecom-operators to better understand the interaction-behaviour of their customers , and potentially provide major insights for designing effective incentives.in this paper , we use the call-detail-records of a mobile operator from four geographically disparate regions to construct call graphs , and analyse their structural-properties . our findings provide business insights and help devise strategies for mobile telecom operators . another goal of this paper is to identify the shape of such graphs . in order to do so , we extend the well-known reachability-analysis approach with some of our own techniques to reveal the shape of such massive graphs . based on our analysis , we introduce the treasure-hunt model to describe the shape of mobile call graphs . the proposed techniques are general enough for analysing any large-graph . finally , how well the proposed model captures the shape of other mobile call graphs needs to be the subject of future studies .
