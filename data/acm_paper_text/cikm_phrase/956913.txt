multi-resolution disambiguation of term occurrences we describe a system for extracting mentions of terms such as company and product names , in a large and noisy-corpus of documents , such as the world-wide-web . since natural-language terms are highly ambiguous , a significant challenge in this task is disambiguating which occurrences of each term are truly related to the right meaning , and which are not . we describe our approach for disambiguation , and show that it achieves very high accuracy with only limited training . this serves as a necessary first step for applications that strive to do analytics on term mentions .
