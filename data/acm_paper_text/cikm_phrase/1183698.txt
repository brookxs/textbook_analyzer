optimisation methods for ranking-functions with multiple parameters optimising the parameters of ranking-functions with respect to standard ir rank-dependent cost-functions has eluded satisfactory analytical treatment . we build on recent advances in alternative differentiable pairwise cost-functions , and show that these techniques can be successfully applied to tuning the parameters of an existing family of ir scoring-functions (bm25) , in the sense that we can not do better using sensible search-heuristics that directly optimize the rank-based cost-function ndcg . we also demonstrate how the size of training-set affects the number of parameters we can hope to tune this way .
