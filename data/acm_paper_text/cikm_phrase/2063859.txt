effectiveness beyond the first crawl tier modern web-crawlers seek to visit quality documents first , and re-visit them more frequently than other documents . as a result , the first-tier crawl of a web-corpus is typically of higher quality compared to subsequent crawls . in this paper , we investigate the impact of first-tier documents on adhoc retrieval-performance . in particular , we analyse the retrieval-performance of runs submitted to the adhoc task of the trec 2009 web track in terms of how they rank first-tier documents and how these documents contribute to the performance of each run . our results show that the performance of these runs is heavily dependent on their ability to rank first-tier documents . moreover , we show that , different from leading web-search-engines , their attempt to go beyond the first tier almost always results in decreased performance . finally , we show that selectively removing spam from different tiers can be a direction for fully exploiting documents beyond the first tier .
