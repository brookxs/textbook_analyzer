combining link and content for collective-active-learning in this paper , we study a novel problem collective-active-learning , in which we aim to select a batch set of `` informative '' instances from a networking data-set to query the user in order to improve the accuracy of the learned classification-model . we perform a theoretical investigation of the problem and present three criteria (i.e. , minimum redundancy , maximum uncertainty and maximum impact) to quantify the informativeness of a set of selected instances . we define an objective-function based on the three criteria and present an efficient-algorithm to optimize the objective-function with a bounded approximation rate . experimental-results on a real-world-data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach .
