two-tier similarity-model for story-link-detection the paper presents a novel approach to story-link-detection , where the goal is to determine whether a pair of news stories are linked , i.e. , talk about the same event . the present work marks a departure from the prior work in that we measure similarity at two distinct levels of textual organization , the document and its collection , and combine scores at both levels to determine how well stories are linked . experiments on the tdt-5 corpus show that the present approach , which we call a ` two-tier similarity-model , ' comfortably beats conventional approaches such as clarity enhanced kl-divergence , while performing robustly across diverse languages .
