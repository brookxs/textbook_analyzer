inferring query-aspects from reformulations using clustering when the information-need is not clear from the user-query , a good strategy would be to return documents that cover as many aspects of the query as possible . to do this , the possible aspects of the query need to be automatically identified . in this paper , we propose to do this by clustering reformulated queries generated from publicly available resources and using each cluster to represent an aspect of the query . our results show that the automatically generated reformulations for the trec web track queries match up quite well with actual sub-topics of these queries identified by trec experts . moreover , agglomerative-clustering using query-to-query similarity based on co-occurrence in text passages can provide clusters of high quality that potentially can be used to identify aspects .
