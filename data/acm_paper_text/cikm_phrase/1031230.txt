improving document representations using relevance-feedback : the rfa algorithm in this paper we present a document-representation improvement technique , named the relevance-feedback accumulation (rfa) algorithm . using prior relevance-feedback assessments and a data-mining measure called `` support '' , the algorithm 's learning function gradually improves document representations , over time and across users . results show that the modified document representations yield lower dimensionality while improving retrieval-effectiveness . the algorithm is efficient and scalable , suited for retrieval-systems managing large document collections .
