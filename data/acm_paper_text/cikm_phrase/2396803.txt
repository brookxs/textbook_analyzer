interpreting keyword-queries over web-knowledge bases many keyword-queries issued to web-search-engines target information about real-world entities , and interpreting these queries over web-knowledge bases can often enable the search-system to provide exact answers to queries . equally important is the problem of detecting when the reference knowledge-base is not capable of answering the keyword-query , due to lack of domain coverage . in this work we present an approach to computing structured-representations of keyword-queries over a reference knowledge-base . we mine frequent query structures from a web-query log and map these structures into a reference knowledge-base . our approach exploits coarse linguistic-structure in keyword-queries , and combines it with rich structured-query representations of information-needs .
