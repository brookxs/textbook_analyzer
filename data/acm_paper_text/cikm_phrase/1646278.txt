an improved feedback approach using relevant local posts for blog-feed-retrieval blog-feed-search aims to identify a blog feed with a recurring interest in a given topic . in this paper , we investigate the `` pseudo-relevance-feedback '' for blog-feed-search task , where its unit of relevance-judgment is not based on a blog post but a blog feed (the collection of all its constituent posts) . this paper focuses on two characteristics of feed-search task , blog feed 's topical diversity and multifaceted property of query . we propose a novel feed-level selection of local posts which uses only highly relevant local posts in each top-ranked feed , in order to capture the correct and diverse relevant-information to a given topic . experimental-results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional feedback approaches . especially , the proposed approach gives 2 \ % further increase of ndcg over the best performing result of trec '08 blog-distillation task .
