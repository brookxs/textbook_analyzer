ready for prime time : pre-generation of web-pages in tiscover in large-data - and access-intensive web-sites , efficient and reliable access is hard to achieve . this situation gets even worse for web-sites providing precise structured-query facilities and requiring topicality of the presented information even in face of a highly dynamic-content . the achievement of these partly conflicting goals is strongly influenced by the approach chosen for page-generation , ranging from composing a web-page upon a user 's request to its generation in advance . the official austrian web-based tourism information and booking system tiscover tries to reconcile these goals by employing a hybrid-approach of page-generation . in tiscover , web-pages are not only generated on request in order to support precise structured-queries on the content managed by a database-system . rather , the whole web-site is also pre-generated out of the extremely dynamic-content and synchronized with the database on the basis of metadata . thus , topicality of information is guaranteed , while ensuring efficient and reliable access . this paper discusses the hybrid approach as realized in tiscover , focussing in particular on the concepts used for pre-generation . 1
