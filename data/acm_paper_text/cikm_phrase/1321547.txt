effective top-k computation in retrieving structured-documents with term-proximity support modern web-search-engines are expected to return top - k results efficiently given a query . although many dynamic-index-pruning strategies have been proposed for efficient top - k computation , most of them are prone to ignore some especially important factors in ranking-functions , e.g. term-proximity (the distance relationship between query terms in a document) . the inclusion of term-proximity breaks the monotonicity of ranking-functions and therefore leads to additional challenges for efficient-query-processing . this paper studies the performance of some existing top - k computation approaches using term-proximity-enabled ranking-functions . our investigation demonstrates that , when term-proximity is incorporated into ranking-functions , most existing index-structures and top - k strategies become quite inefficient . according to our analysis and experimental-results , we propose two index-structures and their corresponding index-pruning strategies : structured and hybrid , which performs much better on the new settings . moreover , the efficiency of index-building and maintenance would not be affected too much with the two approaches .
