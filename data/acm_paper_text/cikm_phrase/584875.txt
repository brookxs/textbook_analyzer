evaluating contents-link coupled web-page-clustering for web-search-results clustering is currently one of the most crucial techniques for dealing (e.g. resources locating , information interpreting) with massive amount of heterogeneous-information on the web . unlike clustering in other fields , web-page-clustering separates unrelated pages and clusters related-pages (to a specific topic) into semantically meaningful groups , which is useful for discrimination , summarization , organization and navigation of unstructured web-pages . we have proposed a contents-link coupled clustering-algorithm that clusters web-pages by combining contents and link-analysis . in this paper , we particularly study the effects of out-links (from the-web pages) , in-links (to the-web page) and terms on the final clustering results as well as how to effectively combine these three parts to improve the quality of clustering results . we apply it to cluster web-search-results . preliminary experiments and evaluations are conducted on various topics . as the experimental-results show , the proposed clustering-algorithm is effective and promising .
