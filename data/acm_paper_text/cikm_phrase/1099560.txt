score region-algebra : building a transparent xml-r database a unified database framework that will enable better comprehension of ranked xml-retrieval is still a challenge in the xml-database field . we propose a logical algebra , named score region-algebra , that enables transparent specification of information-retrieval (ir) models for xml-databases . the transparency is achieved by a possibility to instantiate various retrieval-models , using abstract score functions within algebra operators , while logical query-plan and operator definitions remain unchanged . our algebra operators model three important aspects of xml-retrieval : element relevance score computation , element score-propagation , and element score-combination . to illustrate the usefulness of our algebra we instantiate four different , well known ir scoring models , and combine them with different score-propagation and combination functions . we implemented the algebra operators in a prototype-system on top of a low-level database kernel . the evaluation of the system is performed on a collection of ieee articles in xml-format provided by inex . we argue that state-of-the-art xml-ir models can be transparently implemented using our score region-algebra framework on top of any low-level physical database engine or existing rdbms , allowing a more systematic investigation of retrieval-model behavior .
