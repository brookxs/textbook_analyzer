bp-tree : an efficient index for similarity-search in high-dimensional metric-spaces similarity-search in high-dimensional metric-spaces is a key operation in many applications , such as multimedia-databases , image-retrieval , object-recognition , and others . the high-dimensionality of the data requires special index-structures to facilitate the search . most of existing indexes are constructed by partitioning the data-set using distance-based criteria . however , those methods either produce disjoint partitions , but ignore the distribution properties of the data ; or produce non-disjoint groups , which greatly affect the search-performance . in this paper , we study the performance of a new index-structure , called ball-and-plane tree (bp-tree) , which overcomes the above disadvantages . bp-tree is constructed by recursively dividing the data-set into compact clusters . distinctive from other techniques , it integrates the advantages of both disjoint and non-disjoint paradigms in order to achieve a structure of tight and low overlapping-clusters , yielding significantly improved performance . results obtained from an extensive experimental-evaluation with real-world-data sets show that bp-tree consistently outperforms state-of-the-art solutions .
