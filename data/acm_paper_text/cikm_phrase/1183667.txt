incremental-hierarchical-clustering of text-documents incremental hierarchical text-document clustering-algorithms are important in organizing documents generated from streaming on-line sources , such as , newswire and blogs . however , this is a relatively unexplored area in the text-document clustering literature . popular incremental-hierarchical-clustering algorithms , namely cobweb and classit , have not been widely used with text-document-data . we discuss why , in the current form , these algorithms are not suitable for text-clustering and propose an alternative formulation that includes changes to the underlying distributional assumption of the algorithm in order to conform with the data . both the original classit algorithm and our proposed algorithm are evaluated using reuters newswire articles and ohsumed-dataset .
