a system for finding biological-entities that satisfy certain conditions from texts finding biological-entities (such as genes or proteins) that satisfy certain conditions from texts is an important and challenging task in biomedical-information-retrieval and text-mining . it is essential for many biomedical-applications , such as drug-discovery which normally requires collecting existing scientific facts from documents . this paper presents an effective ir-system for this task , in which 1) domain-knowledge is incorporated to improve retrieval-effectiveness ; 2) query-expansion with related concepts on multiple semantic levels is employed ; 3) a gene symbol disambiguation technique is implemented . we evaluated these techniques and examined two different concept-based ir-models . experiments based upon the proposed framework yield significant improvement (22 \ % for automatic and 16.7 \ % for non-automatic) over the best reported results of passage-retrieval in the genomics track of trec 2007 .
