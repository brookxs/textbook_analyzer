towards integrative enterprise knowledge portals knowledge portals make an important contribution to enabling enterprise knowledge management by providing users with a consolidated , personalized user interface that allows efficient access to various types of (structured and unstructured) information . today 's portal systems allow combining access modules to different information-sources side by side on a single portal webpage . however , there is no interaction between those so called portlets . when a user navigates within one portlet , the others remain unchanged , which means that each source has to be searched individually for relevant information.this paper discusses integration-aspects within enterprise knowledge portals and presents an approach for communicating the user-context (revealing the user 's information-need) among portlets , utilizing semantic-web-technologies . for example , the query-context of an olap portlet , which provides access to structured-data stored in a data-warehouse , can be used by an information-retrieval portlet in order to automatically provide the user with related documents found in the organization 's document-management-system . the paper shortly presents a prototype that we are building to evaluate our approach , demonstrating such an olap and information-retrieval integration .
