query-expansion using probabilistic-local-feedback with application to multimedia-retrieval as one of the most effective query-expansion approaches , local-feedback is able to automatically discover new query terms and improve retrieval-accuracy for different retrieval-models . however , the performance of local-feedback is heavily dependent on the assumption that most top-ranked documents are relevant to the query topic . although this assumption might be sensible for ad-hoc text-retrieval , it is usually violated in many other retrieval tasks such as multimedia-retrieval . in this paper , we develop a robust local analysis approach called probabilistic-local-feedback (plf) based on a discriminative probabilistic-retrieval framework . the proposed model is effective for improving retrieval-accuracy without assuming the most top-ranked documents are relevant . it also provides a sound probabilistic interpretation and a convergence guarantee on the iterative result updating process . although derived from variational techniques , this approach only involves an iterative-process of simple operations on ranking-features and thus can be computed efficiently in practice . our multimedia-retrieval experiments on trecvid ' 03 - '05 collections have demonstrated the advantage of the proposed plf approaches which can achieve noticeable gains in terms of mean-average-precision over various baseline methods and prf-augmented results .
