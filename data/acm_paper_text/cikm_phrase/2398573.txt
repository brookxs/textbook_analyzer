theme chronicle model : chronicle consists of timestamp and topical words over each theme this paper presents a topic-model that discovers the correlation patterns in a given time-stamped document-collection and how these patterns evolve over time . our proposal , the theme chronicle model (tcm) divides traditional topics into temporal and stable topics to detect the change of each theme over time ; previous topic-models ignore these differences and characterize trends as merely bursts of topics . tcm introduces a theme topic (stable topic) , a trend topic (temporal topic) , timestamps , and a latent switch variable in each token to realize these differences . its topic layers allow tcm to capture not only word-co-occurrence patterns in each theme , but also word-co-occurrence patterns at any given time in each theme as trends . experiments on various data-sets show that the proposed model is useful as a generative-model to discover fine-grained tightly coherent topics , takes advantage of previous models , and then assigns values for new documents .
