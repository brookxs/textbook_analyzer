post-rank reordering : resolving preference misalignments between search-engines and end-users no search-engine is perfect . a typical type of imperfection is the preference misalignment between search-engines and end-users , e.g. , from time to time , web users skip higher-ranked documents and click on lower-ranked ones . although search-engines have been aggressively incorporating clickthrough-data in their ranking , it is hard to eliminate such misalignments across millions of queries . therefore , we , in this paper , propose to accompany a search-engine with an `` always-on '' component that reorders documents on a per-query basis , based on user click patterns . because of positional bias and dependencies between clicks , we show that a simple sort based on click counts (and its variants) , albeit intuitive and useful , is not precise enough . in this paper , we put forward a principled approach to reordering documents by leveraging existing click-models . specifically , we compute the preference probability that a lower-ranked document is preferred to a higher-ranked one from the click-chain-model (ccm) , and propose to swap the two documents if the probability is sufficiently high . because ccm models positional bias and dependencies between clicks , this method readily accounts for many twisted heuristics that have to be manually encoded in sort-based approaches . for this approach to be practical , we further devise two approximation schemes that make online-computation of the preference probability feasible . we carried out a set of experiments based on real-world-data from a major search-engine , and the result clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach .
