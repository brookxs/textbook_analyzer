mining topic-level influence in heterogeneous-networks influence is a complex and subtle force that governs the dynamics of social-networks as well as the behaviors of involved users . understanding influence can benefit various applications such as viral-marketing , recommendation , and information retrieval . however , most existing works on social-influence-analysis have focused on verifying the existence of social-influence . few works systematically investigate how to mine the strength of direct and indirect influence between nodes in heterogeneous-networks . to address the problem , we propose a generative graphical-model which utilizes the heterogeneous link-information and the textual content associated with each node in the network to mine topic-level direct influence . based on the learned direct influence , a topic-level influence-propagation and aggregation algorithm is proposed to derive the indirect influence between nodes . we further study how the discovered topic-level influence can help the prediction of user-behaviors . we validate the approach on three different genres of data-sets : twitter , digg , and citation-networks . qualitatively , our approach can discover interesting influence patterns in heterogeneous-networks . quantitatively , the learned topic-level influence can greatly improve the accuracy of user-behavior prediction .
