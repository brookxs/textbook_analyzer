genre-identification and goal-focused summarization in this paper , we present a novel technique of first performing document genre-identification , then utilizing the genre for producing tailored summaries based on a user 's information-seeking needs - genre oriented goal-focused summarization - such as a plot or opinion summary of a movie review . we create a test-corpus to determine genre-classification accuracy for 16 genres , and examine performance on various amounts of training-data for machine-learning-algorithms - random-forests , svm-light and na ve-bayes . results show that random-forests outperforms svm-light and na ve-bayes . the genre tag is used to inform a downstream summarization engine . we define types of summaries for 7 genres , create a ground-truth corpus and analyze the results of genre oriented goal-focused summarization , showing that this type of user_based summarization requires different algorithms than the leading sentence baseline which is known to perform well in the case of news-articles .
