diversity in blog-feed-retrieval blog-distillation (blog-feed-retrieval) is a task in blog-retrieval where the goal is to rank blogs according to their recurrent relevance to a query topic . one of the main properties of blog-feed-retrieval is that the unit of retrieval is a collection of documents as opposed to a single-document as in other ir tasks . this collection retrieval nature of blog-distillation introduces new challenges and requires new investigations specific to this problem . researchers have addressed this problem by considering a wide range of evidence and information resources . however , previous work has not studied the effect of on-topic diversity of blog posts in blog relevance . by on-topic diversity of blog posts we mean that those posts that are about the query topic need to have high diversity and cover different sub-topics of the query . in this study , we investigate three types of on-topic diversity and their effect on retrieval-performance : topical diversity , temporal-diversity and hybrid diversity . our experiments over different blog collections and different baseline methods show that on-topic diversity can improve the performance of the retrieval-system . among the three types of diversity , hybrid diversity , that considers both topical and temporal diversities , achieves the best performance .
