using path-information for query-processing in object-oriented-database-systems this paper argues that most queries in object-oriented-databases require traversing from one object to another in the aggregation hierarchy . thus , the connections between objects through object identifiers are essential to the efficiency of query-processing and should be represented separately from the database . we introduce the concept of path dictionary and describe how it supports queries of different types . we evaluate the storage overhead , query and update costs of the path dictionary . compared to the path index , the path dictionary has better overall query and update performance and lower storage overhead .
