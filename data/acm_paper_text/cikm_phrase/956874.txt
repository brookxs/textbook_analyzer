visual-structures for image-browsing content-based-image-retrieval (cbir) presents several challenges and has been subject to extensive research from many domains , such as image-processing or database-systems . database researchers are concerned with indexing and querying , whereas image-processing experts worry about extracting appropriate image-descriptors . comparatively little work has been done on designing user-interfaces for cbir systems . this , in turn , has a profound effect on these systems since the concept of image-similarity is strongly influenced by user-perception . this paper describes an initial effort to fill this gap , combining recent research in cbir and information visualization , studied from a human-computer-interface perspective . it presents two visualization-techniques based on spiral and concentric rings implemented in a cbir system to explore query results . the approach is centered on keeping user focus on both the query image , and the most similar retrieved images . experiments conducted so far suggest that the proposed visualization strategies improves system-usability .
