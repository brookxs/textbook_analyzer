tightly coupling visual and linguistic-features for enriching audio-based web-browsing experience people-who-are-blind use screen-readers for browsing web-pages . since screen-readers read out content serially , a naive readout tends to mix irrelevant and relevant content thereby disrupting the coherency of the material being read out and confusing the listener . to address this problem we can partition web-pages into coherent segments and narrate each such piece separately . extant methods to do segmentation use visual and structural cues without taking the semantics into account and consequently create segments containing irrelevant material . in this paper , we describe a new technique for creating coherent segments by tightly coupling visual , structural , and linguistic-features present in the content . a notable aspect of the technique is that it produces segments with little irrelevant content . preliminary experiments indicate that the technique is effective in creating highly coherent segments and the experiences of an early adopter who is blind suggest that it enriches the overall browsing-experience .
