just-in-time contextual-advertising contextual-advertising is a type of web-advertising , which , given the url of a web-page , aims to embed into the page (typically via javascript) the most relevant textual ads available . for static pages that are displayed repeatedly , the matching of ads can be based on prior analysis of their entire content ; however , ads need to be matched also to new or dynamically created pages that can not be processed ahead of time . analyzing the entire body of such pages on-the-fly entails prohibitive communication and latency costs . to solve the three-horned dilemma of either low-relevance or high-latency or high-load , we propose to use text-summarization techniques paired with external-knowledge (exogenous to the page) to craft short page summaries in real-time . empirical-evaluation proves that matching ads on the basis of such summaries does not sacrifice relevance , and is competitive with matching based on the entire page content . specifically , we found that analyzing a carefully selected 5 \ % fraction of the page text sacrifices only 1 \ % -3 \ % in ad relevance . furthermore , our summaries are fully compatible with the standard javascript mechanisms used for ad placement : they can be produced at ad-display time by simple additions to the usual script , and they only add 500-600 bytes to the usual request .
