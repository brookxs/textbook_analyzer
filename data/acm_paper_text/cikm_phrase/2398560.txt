characterizing web-search-queries that match very few or no results despite the continuous efforts to improve the-web search-quality , a non-negligible fraction of user queries end up with very few or even no matching results in leading web-search-engines . in this work , we provide a detailed characterization of such queries based on an analysis of a real-life query-log . our experimental setup allows us to characterize the queries with few/no results and compare the mechanisms employed by the major search-engines in handling them .
