exploring domain-specific term weight in archived question-search community-question-answering services , e.g. , yahoo!-answers , have accumulated large archives of question answer (qa) pairs for information and answer-retrieval . an effective question-retrieval model is essential to increase the accessibility of the qa archives . qa archives are usually organized into categories and question-search can be performed within the whole collection or within a certain category . . in this paper , we explore domain-specific term weight for archived question-search . specifically , we propose a novel light-weighted term-weighting-scheme that exploits multiple aspects of the domain-information . we also introduce a framework to seamlessly integrate domain-specific term weight into the existing retrieval-models . extensive experiments conducted on real archived qa data demonstrate the utility of the proposed techniques .
