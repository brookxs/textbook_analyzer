re-ranking search results using query-logs this work addresses two common problems in search , frequently occurring with underspecified user queries : the top-ranked results for such queries may not contain documents relevant to the user 's search-intent , and fresh and relevant pages may not get high ranks for an underspecified query due to their freshness and to the large number of pages that match the query , despite the fact that a large number-of-users have searched for parts of their content recently . we propose a novel method , q-rank , to effectively refine the ranking of search-results for any given query by constructing the query-context from search-query-logs . evaluation results show that q-rank gains a considerable advantage over the current ranking-system of a large-scale commercial web-search-engine , being able to improve the relevance of search-results for 82 \ % of the queries .
