transferring topical knowledge from auxiliary long texts for short-text clustering with the rapid growth of social-web applications such as twitter and online-advertisements , the task of understanding short-texts is becoming more and more important . most traditional text-mining techniques are designed to handle long text-documents . for short-text messages , many of the existing techniques are not effective due to the sparseness of text-representations . to understand short messages , we observe that it is often possible to find topically related long texts , which can be utilized as the auxiliary-data when mining the target short-texts data . in this article , we present a novel approach to cluster short-text messages via transfer-learning from auxiliary long text-data . we show that while some previous work exists that enhance short-text clustering with related long texts , most of them ignore the semantic and topical inconsistencies between the target and auxiliary-data and hurt the clustering performance . to accommodate the possible inconsistency between source and target data , we propose a novel topic-model - dual latent-dirichlet-allocation (dlda) model , which jointly learns two sets of topics on short and long texts and couples the topic parameters to cope with the potential inconsistency between data sets . we demonstrate through large-scale-clustering experiments on both advertisements and twitter data that we can obtain superior performance over several state-of-art techniques for clustering short-text documents .
