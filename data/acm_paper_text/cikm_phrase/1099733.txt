redundant documents and search-effectiveness the-web contains a great many documents that are content-equivalent , that is , informationally redundant with respect to each other . the presence of such mutually redundant documents in search-results can degrade the user-search-experience . previous attempts to address this issue , most notably the trec novelty track , were characterized by difficulties with accuracy and evaluation . in this paper we explore syntactic techniques -- particularly document fingerprinting -- for detecting content equivalence . using these techniques on the trec gov1 and gov2 corpora revealed a high degree of redundancy ; a user-study confirmed that our metrics were accurately identifying content-equivalence . we show , moreover , that content-equivalent documents have a significant effect on the search experience : we found that 16.6 \ % of all relevant documents in runs submitted to the trec 2004 terabyte track were redundant .
