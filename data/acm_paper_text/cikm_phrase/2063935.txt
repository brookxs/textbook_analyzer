constructing efficient information-extraction pipelines information-extraction (ie) pipelines analyze text through several stages . the pipeline 's algorithms determine both its effectiveness and its run-time-efficiency . in real-world tasks , however , ie pipelines often fail acceptable run-times because they analyze too much task-irrelevant text . this raises two interesting questions : 1) how much `` efficiency potential '' depends on the scheduling of a pipeline 's algorithms ? 2) is it possible to devise a reliable method to construct efficient ie pipelines ? both questions are addressed in this paper . in particular , we show how to optimize the run-time-efficiency of ie pipelines under a given set of algorithms . we evaluate pipelines for three algorithm sets on an industrially relevant task : the extraction of market forecasts from news-articles . using a system-independent measure , we demonstrate that efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude are possible without compromising a pipeline 's original effectiveness .
