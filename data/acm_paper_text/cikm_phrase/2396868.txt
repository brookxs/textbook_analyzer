learning-to-rank by aggregating expert preferences we present a general treatment of the problem of aggregating preferences from several experts into a consensus ranking , in the context where information about a target ranking is available . specifically , we describe how such problems can be converted into a standard learning-to-rank one on which existing learning solutions can be invoked . this transformation allows us to optimize the aggregating function for any target ir metric , such as normalized-discounted-cumulative-gain , or expected reciprocal rank . when applied to crowdsourcing and meta-search benchmarks , our new algorithm improves on state-of-the-art preference-aggregation methods .
