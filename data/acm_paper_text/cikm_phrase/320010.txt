incremental and interactive sequence-mining the discovery of frequent-sequences in temporal-databases is an important data-mining problem . most current work assumes that the database is static , and a database update requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and new database . in this paper , we propose novel techniques for maintaining sequences in the presence of a) database-updates , and b) user-interaction (e.g. modifying mining parameters) . this is a very challenging task , since such updates can invalidate existing sequences or introduce new ones . in both the above scenarios , we avoid re-executing the algorithm on the entire dataset , thereby reducing execution-time . experimental-results confirm that our approach results in execution-time improvements of up to several orders of magnitude in practice .
