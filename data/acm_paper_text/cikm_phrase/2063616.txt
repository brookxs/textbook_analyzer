frequency-aware similarity-measures : why arnold schwarzenegger is always a duplicate measuring the similarity of two records is a challenging problem , but necessary for fundamental tasks , such as duplicate-detection and similarity-search . by exploiting frequencies of attribute values , many similarity-measures can be improved : in a person table with u.s. citizens , arnold schwarzenegger is a very rare name . if we find several arnold schwarzeneggers in it , it is very likely that these are duplicates . we are then less strict when comparing other attribute values , such as birth date or address . we put this intuition to use by partitioning compared record pairs according to frequencies of attribute values . for example , we could create three partitions from our data : partition 1 contains all pairs with rare names , partition 2 all pairs with medium frequent names , and partition 3 all pairs with frequent names . for each partition , we learn a different similarity-measure : we apply machine-learning-techniques to combine a set of base similarity-measures into an overall measure . to determine a good partitioning , we compare different partitioning-strategies . we achieved best results with a novel algorithm inspired by genetic-programming . we evaluate our approach on real-world-data sets from a large credit rating agency and from a bibliography-database . we show that our learning-approach works well for logistic-regression , svm , and decision-trees with significant improvements over (i) learning-models that ignore frequencies and (ii) frequency-enriched models without partitioning .
