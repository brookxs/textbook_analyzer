behavior-driven clustering of queries into topics categorization of web-search queries in semantically coherent topics is a crucial task to understand the interest trends of search-engine users and , therefore , to provide more intelligent personalization services . query-clustering usually relies on lexical and clickthrough-data , while the information originating from the user actions in submitting their queries is currently neglected . in particular , the intent that drives users to submit their requests is an important element for meaningful aggregation of queries . we propose a new intent-centric notion of topical query clusters and we define a query-clustering technique that differs from existing algorithms in both methodology and nature of the resulting clusters . our method extracts topics from the query-log by merging missions , i.e. , activity fragments that express a coherent user-intent , on the basis of their topical affinity . our approach works in a bottom-up way , without any a-priori knowledge of topical-categorization , and produces good quality topics compared to state-of-the-art clustering-techniques . it can also summarize topically-coherent missions that occur far away from each other , thus enabling a more compact user-profiling on a topical basis . furthermore , such a topical user-profiling discriminates the stream of activity of a particular user from the activity of others , with a potential to predict future user search activity .
