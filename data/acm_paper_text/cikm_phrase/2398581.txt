diversifying query results on semi-structured-data queries on the web can easily result in a large number of results . result-diversification , a process by which the query provides the k most diverse set of matches , enables the user to better understand/explore such large results . computing the diverse subset from a large set of results needs a massive number of pair-wise distance computations as well as finding the subset that maximizes the total pair-wise distance , which is np-hard and requires efficient approximate-algorithm . the problem becomes more difficult when querying semi-structured-data , since diversity can occur not only in the document-content but also (and more importantly) in the document-structure ; thus one needs to efficiently measure the structural differences between results . the tree edit-distance is the standard choice but , is too expensive for large result sets . moreover , the generalized tree-edit-distance ignores the context of the query and also the content of the documents resulting in poor diversification . we present a novel algorithm for meaningful diversification that considers both the structural context of the query and the content of the matched results while computing pair-wise distances . our algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than the tree edit-distance with an elegant worst-case guarantee . we also present a novel algorithm that finds the top-k diverse subset of matches in time linear on the size of the result-set . we experimentally demonstrate the utility of our algorithms as a plugin for standard query processors without introducing large error and latency to the output .
