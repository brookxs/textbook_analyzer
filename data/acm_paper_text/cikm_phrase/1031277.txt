serf : integrating human recommendations with search today 's university library has many digitally accessible resources , both indexes to content and considerable original content . using off-the-shelf search-technology provides a single point of access into library-resources , but we have found that such full-text-indexing technology is not entirely satisfactory for library searching . in response to this , we report initial usage results from a prototype of an entirely new type of search-engine - the system for electronic recommendation-filtering (serf) - that we have designed and deployed for the oregon state university (osu) libraries . serf encourages users to enter longer and more informative queries , and collects ratings from users as to whether search-results meet their information-need or not . these ratings are used to make recommendations to later users with similar needs . over time , serf learns from the users what documents are valuable for what information-needs . in this paper , we focus on understanding whether such recommendations can increase other users ' search efficiency-and-effectiveness in library website searching . based on examination of three months of usage as an alternative search-interface available to all users of the oregon state university libraries website (http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/) , we found strong evidence that the recommendations with human-evaluation could increase the efficiency as well as effectiveness of the library website search-process . those users who received recommendations needed to examine fewer results , and recommended documents were rated much higher than documents returned by a traditional search-engine .
