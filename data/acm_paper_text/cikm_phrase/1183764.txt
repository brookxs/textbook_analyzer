probabilistic document-context_based relevance-feedback with limited relevance-judgments this paper presents our novel relevance-feedback (rf) algorithm that uses the probabilistic document-context_based retrieval-model with limited relevance-judgments for document-re-ranking . probabilities of the document-context_based retrieval-model are estimated from the top n (= 20) documents in the initial retrieval . we use document-context based cosine-similarity-measure to find similar data for better probability-estimation in order to reduce the data scarcity problem and the negative weighting problem . our rf algorithm is promising because its mean-average-precision is statistically significantly better than the baseline using trec-6 and trec-7 data-collections .
