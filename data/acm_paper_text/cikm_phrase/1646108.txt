pqc : personalized-query-classification query-classification (qc) is a task that aims to classify web-queries into topical categories . since queries are usually short in length and ambiguous , the same query may need to be classified to different categories according to different people 's perspectives . in this paper , we propose the personalized-query-classification (pqc) task and develop an algorithm based on user-preference learning as a solution . users ' preferences that are hidden in clickthrough logs are quite helpful for search-engines to improve their understandings of users ' queries . we propose to connect query-classification with users ' preference-learning from clickthrough logs for pqc . to tackle the sparseness-problem in clickthrough logs , we propose a collaborative-ranking model to leverage similar users ' information . experiments on a real-world clickthrough-log data show that our proposed pqc algorithm can gain significant improvement compared with general qc as well as natural baselines . our method can be applied to a wide range of applications including personalized-search and online-advertising .
