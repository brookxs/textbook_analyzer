olap with udfs in digital-libraries queries on digital-libraries generally involve the retrieval of specific documents , but most techniques lack the ability to efficiently explore these collections . the integration of olap techniques with digital-libraries allows users to navigate throughout these collections on multiple levels . in order to accomplish this , we propose the creation of olap networks , a complex-data structure that contains summarized representations of the original collection of metadata to enrich traditional retrievals and allow the users to quickly explore the collection . we developed a system that enables olap-based exploration on the metadata of digital-libraries through the use of a combination of efficient udfs and optimized sql queries . in addition , we also incorporated visualization methods into our system to allow fast navigation and exploration .
