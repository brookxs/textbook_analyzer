structural-features in content oriented xml-retrieval the structural-features of xml components are an extra source of information that should be used in a content-oriented retrieval-task on this type of documents . in this paper we explore one of the structural-features from the inex collection [1] that could be used in content-oriented search . we analyse the gain this knowledge could add to the performance of an information-retrieval-system and present a first approach on how this structural-information could be extracted from a relevance-feedback process to be used as priors in a language-modelling framework .
