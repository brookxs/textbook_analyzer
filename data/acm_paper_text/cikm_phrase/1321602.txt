a segment-based-hidden-markov-model for real-setting pinyin-to-chinese conversion hidden-markov-model (hmm) is frequently used for pinyin-to-chinese conversion . but it only captures the dependency with the preceding character . higher-order markov-models can bring higher accuracy , but are computationally unaffordable to average pc settings . we propose a segment-based-hidden-markov-model (shmm) , which has the same magnitude of complexity as first-order hmm , but generates higher decoding accuracy . shmm tells a word from a bigram connecting two words , and assigns a reasonable probability to words as a whole . it is more powerful than hmm to decode words containing over two characters . we conduct a comprehensive pinyin-to-chinese conversion evaluation on lancaster corpus . the experiment shows the perfect sentence accuracy is improved from 34.7 \ % (hmm) to 43.3 \ % (shmm) . the one-error sentence accuracy is increased from 72.7 \ % to 78.3 \ % . furthermore , shmm can seamlessly integrate with pinyin typing-correction , acronym pinyin-input , user-defined words , and self-adaptive learning all of which are a must for a commercial pinyin-to-chinese conversion product in order to improve the efficiency of pinyin-input .
