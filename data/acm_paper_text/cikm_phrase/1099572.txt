finding similar questions in large question-and-answer archives there has recently been a significant increase in the number of community-based question and answer services-on-the-web where people answer other peoples ' questions . these services rapidly build up large archives of questions-and-answers , and these archives are a valuable linguistic-resource . one of the major tasks in a question-and-answer service is to find questions in the archive that a semantically similar to a user 's question . this enables high quality answers from the archive to be retrieved and removes the time lag associated with a community-based system . in this paper , we discuss methods for question-retrieval that are based on using the similarity between answers in the archive to estimate probabilities for a translation-based retrieval-model . we show that with this model it is possible to find semantically similar questions with relatively little word overlap .
