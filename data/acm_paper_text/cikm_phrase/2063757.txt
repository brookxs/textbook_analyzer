citation-count-prediction : learning to estimate future citations for literature in most of the cases , scientists depend on previous literature which is relevant to their research fields for developing new ideas . however , it is not wise , nor possible , to track all existed publications because the volume of literature collection grows extremely fast . therefore , researchers generally follow , or cite merely a small proportion of publications which they are interested in . for such a large-collection , it is rather interesting to forecast which kind of literature is more likely to attract scientists ' response . in this paper , we use the citations as a measurement for the popularity among researchers and study the interesting problem of citation-count-prediction (ccp) to examine the characteristics for popularity . estimation of possible popularity is of great significance and is quite challenging . we have utilized several features of fundamental characteristics for those papers that are highly cited and have predicted the popularity degree of each literature in the-future . we have implemented a system which takes a series of features of a particular publication as input and produces as output the estimated citation counts of that article after a given time period . we consider several regression-models to formulate the learning-process and evaluate their performance based on the coefficient-of-determination (r-square) . experimental-results on a real-large data-set show that the best predictive-model achieves a mean average predictive performance of 0.740 measured in r-square , which significantly outperforms several alternative algorithms .
