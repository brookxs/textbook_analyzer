learning-to-rank search-results for time-sensitive queries retrieval-effectiveness of temporal-queries can be improved by taking into account the time-dimension . existing temporal-ranking models follow one of two main approaches : 1) a mixture-model linearly combining textual-similarity and temporal-similarity , and 2) a probabilistic-model generating a query from the textual and temporal part of document independently . in this paper , we propose a novel time-aware-ranking model based on learning-to-rank techniques . we employ two classes of features for learning a ranking-model , entity-based and temporal-features , which are derived from annotation data . entity-based features are aimed at capturing the semantic similarity between a query and a document , whereas temporal-features measure the temporal-similarity . through extensive experiments we show that our ranking-model significantly improves the retrieval-effectiveness over existing time-aware-ranking models .
