an efficient index for massive iot data in cloud environment the-internet of things (iot) has been widely applied in many fields , while the iot data are always large volume , update frequently and inherently multi-dimensional , these characteristics bring big challenges to the traditional dbmss . the traditional dbmss have rich functionality and can deal with multi-attributes access efficiently , they can not scale good enough to deal with large volume-data and can not support high insert throughput . the cloud-based database-systems have good scalability , but they do n't support multi-dimensional access natively.in order to deal with the large volume of iot data , we propose an update and query efficient index framework (uqe-index) based on key-value-store that can support high insert throughput and provide efficient multi-dimensional query simultaneously . we implemented a prototype based on hbase and did comprehensive experiments to test our solution 's scalability and efficiency .
