utilizing common substructures to speedup tensor-factorization for mining dynamic-graphs in large and complex graphs of social , chemical/biological , or other relations , frequent substructures are commonly shared by different graphs or by graphs evolving through different time periods . tensors are natural representations of these complex time-evolving graph-data . a factorization of a tensor provides a high-quality low-rank compact basis for each dimension of the tensor , which facilitates the interpretation of frequent substructures of the original graphs . however , the high computational cost of tensor-factorization makes it infeasible for conventional tensor-factorization methods to handle large-graphs that evolve frequently with time . to address this problem , in this paper we propose a novel iterative tensor-factorization (itf) method whose time-complexity is linear in the cardinalities of all dimensions of a tensor . this low time-complexity means that when using tensors to represent dynamic-graphs , the computational cost of itf is linear in the size (number of edges/vertices) of graphs and is also linear in the number of time periods over which the graph evolves . more importantly , an error-estimation of itf suggests that its factorization correctness is comparable to that of the standard factorization method . we empirically evaluate our method on publication-networks and chemical compound-graphs , and demonstrate that itf is an order of magnitude faster than the conventional method and at the same time preserves factorization quality . to the best of our knowledge , this research is the first work that uses important frequent substructures to speed up tensor factorizations for mining dynamic-graphs .
