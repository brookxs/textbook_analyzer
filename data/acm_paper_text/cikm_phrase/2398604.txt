a new tool for multi-level-partitioning in teradata this paper introduces a new tool that recommends an optimized partitioning solution called multi-level partitioned primary index (mlppi) for a fact table based on the queries in the workload . the tool implements a new technique using a greedy-algorithm for search-space enumeration . the space is driven by predicates in the queries . this technique fits very well the teradata mlppi scheme , as it is based on a general-framework using general expressions , ranges and case expressions for partition definitions . the cost-model implemented in the tool is based on the teradata optimizer , and it is used to prune the search-space for reaching a final solution . the tool resides completely on the client , and interfaces the database through apis as opposed to previous work that requires optimizer code extension . the apis are used to simplify the workload queries , and to capture fact table predicates and costs necessary to make the recommendation . the predicate-driven method implemented by the tool is general , and it can be applied to any clustering or partitioning scheme based on simple field expressions or complex sql predicates . experimental-results given a particular workload will show that the recommendation from the tool outperforms a human expert . the experiments also show that the solution is scalable both with the workload complexity and the size of the fact table .
