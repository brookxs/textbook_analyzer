a collaborative-filtering-approach to ad-recommendation using the query-ad click-graph search-engine-logs contain a large amount of click-through-data that can be leveraged as soft indicators of relevance . in this paper we address the sponsored-search retrieval problem which is to find and rank relevant ads to a search-query . we propose a new technique to determine the relevance of an ad document for a search-query using click-through-data . the method builds on a collaborative-filtering-approach to discover new ads related to a query using a click-graph . it is implemented on a graph with several million edges and scales to larger sizes easily . the proposed method is compared to three different baselines that are state-of-the-art for a commercial-search-engine . evaluations on editorial data indicate that the model discovers many new ads not retrieved by the baseline methods . the ads from the new approach are on average of better quality than the baselines .
