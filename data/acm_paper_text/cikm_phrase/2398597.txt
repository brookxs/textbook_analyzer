author-conference topic-connection model for academic network-search this paper proposes a novel topic-model , author-conference topic-connection (actc) model for academic network-search . the actc model extends the author-conference-topic (act) model by adding subject of the conference and the latent mapping information between subjects and topics . it simultaneously models topical aspects of papers , authors and conferences with two latent-topic layers : a subject layer corresponding to conference topic , and a topic layer corresponding to the word topic . each author would be associated with a multinomial-distribution over subjects of conference (eg. , km , db , ir for cikm 2012) , the conference (cikm 2012) , and the topics are respectively generated from a sampled subject . then the words are generated from the sampled topics . we conduct experiments on a data-set with 8,523 authors , 22,487 papers and 1,243 conferences from the well-known arnetminer website , and train the model with different number of subjects and topics . for a qualitative-evaluation , we compare actc with three others models lda , author-topic (at) and act in academic search services . experiments show that actc can effectively capture the semantic connection between different types of information in academic network and perform well in expert-searching and conference searching .
