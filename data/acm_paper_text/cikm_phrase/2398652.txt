an evaluation and enhancement of densitometric fragmentation for content-slicing reuse content-slicing addresses the need of adaptive-systems to reuse open-corpus material by converting it into re-composable information objects . however this conversion is highly dependent upon the ability to correctly fragment pages into structurally sound atomic pieces . a recently suggested approach to fragmentation , which relies on densitometric page representation , claims to achieve high accuracy and time performance . although it has been well received within the research-community , a full evaluation of this approach and identification of strengths and weaknesses across a range of characteristics has n't been performed . this paper proposes an independent evaluation of the approach with respect to granularity-control , accuracy , time performance , content diversity and linguistic dependency . moreover , this paper also provides a significant contribution to address important weaknesses discovered during the analysis , in order to improve the suitability and impact of the original algorithm within the context of content-slicing .
