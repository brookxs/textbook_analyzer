information-retrieval and machine-learning for probabilistic schema matching schema-matching is the problem of finding correspondences (mapping-rules , e.g. logical-formulae) between heterogeneous-schemas . this paper presents a probabilistic-framework , called splmap , for automatically learning-schema mapping-rules . similar to lsd , different techniques , mostly from the ir field , are combined.our approach , however , is also able to give a probabilistic interpretation of the prediction weights of the candidates , and to select the rule-set with highest matching probability .
