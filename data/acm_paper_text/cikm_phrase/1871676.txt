mining rules to explain activities in videos we present a novel approach to mining dependency-rules that explain the scenes present during a video-sequence . the approach first characterizes activities based on their most important events . next , an hmm-based-approach finds the mixture components that best describe the clustering dependencies between events and activities in video-data . the dependencies among activities are taken as association-patterns with temporal precedence and analyzed using their co-occurrence relationships in time windows . this technique is meant to understand the multiple actions taken in a video or to predict future occurrences of certain activities .
