index-construction for linear categorisation categorisation is a useful method for organising documents into subcollections that can be browsed or searched to more accurately and quickly meet information-needs . on the web , category-based portals such as yahoo! and dmoz are extremely popular : dmoz is maintained by over 56,000 volunteers , is used as the basis of the popular google directory , and is perhaps used by millions of users each day . support-vector-machines (svm) is a machine-learning algorithm which has been shown to be highly effective for automatic text categorisation . however , a problem with iterative-training techniques such as svm is that during their learning or training-phase , they require the entire training collection to be held in main-memory ; this is infeasible for large-training collections such as dmoz or large news wire feeds . in this paper , we show how inverted-indexes can be used for scalable training in categorisation , and propose novel heuristics for a fast , accurate , and memory efficient approach . our results show that an index can be constructed on a desktop workstation with little effect on categorisation accu-racy compared to a memory-based-approach . we conclude that our techniques permit automatic categorisation using very-large train-ing collections , vocabularies , and numbers of categories .
