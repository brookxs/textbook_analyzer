cross-document cross-lingual coreference retrieval in this work , we address coreference retrieval , which involves identifying aliases that are distinct references to an entity . we begin with a known alias and discover unknown aliases that refer to the same entity . we use entity language-models to capture the contextual language around the known alias , which aids in finding new aliases . we also show that modeling the significant dates of the known aliases improves alias-discovery performance .
