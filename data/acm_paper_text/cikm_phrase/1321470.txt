the t4sql temporal-query-language time characterizes every aspect of our life and its management when storing and querying data is very important . in this paper we propose a new temporal-query-language , called t4sql , supporting multiple temporal dimensions of data . besides the well-known valid and transaction times , it encompasses two additional temporal dimensions , namely , availability and event times . the availability time records when information is known and treated as true by the information-system ; the event times record the occurrence times of both the event that starts the valid-time and the event that ends it . t4sql is capable to deal with different temporal-semantics (atemporal aka non-sequenced , current , sequenced , next) with respect to every temporal-dimension . moreover , t4sql provides a novel temporal-grouping clause and an orthogonal management of temporal-properties when defining the selection condition (s) and the schema for the output relation .
