structured-data in web-search for the first time since the emergence of the-web , structured-data is playing a key role in search-engines and is therefore being collected via a concerted effort . much of this data is being extracted from the-web , which contains vast quantities of structured-data on a variety of domains , such as hobbies , products and reference data . moreover , the-web provides a platform that encourages publishing more data-sets from governments and other public organizations . the-web also supports new data-management opportunities , such as effective crisis-response , data journalism and crowd-sourcing data-sets . i will describe some of the efforts we are conducting at google to collect structured-data , filter the high-quality content , and serve it to our users . these efforts include providing google fusion tables , a service for easily ingesting , visualizing and integrating data , mining the-web for high-quality html tables , and contributing these data assets to google 's other services .
