efficient retrieval of 3d building models using embeddings of attributed subgraphs we present a novel method for retrieval and classification of 3d building models that is tailored to the specific requirements of architects . in contrast to common approaches our algorithm relies on the interior spatial-arrangement of rooms instead of exterior geometric shape . we first represent the internal topological building structure by a room connectivity-graph (rcg) . to enable fast and efficient retrieval and classification with rcgs , we transform the structured graph-representation into a vector-based one by introducing a new concept of subgraph embeddings . we provide comprehensive experiments showing that the introduced subgraph embeddings yield superior performance compared to state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches .
