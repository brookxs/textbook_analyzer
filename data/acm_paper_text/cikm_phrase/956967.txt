estwin : adaptively monitoring the recent-change-of-frequent-itemsets over online data-streams knowledge embedded in a data-stream is likely to be changed as time goes by . consequently , identifying the recent change of the knowledge quickly can provide valuable information for the analysis of the data-stream . however , most of mining algorithms or frequency approximation-algorithms for a data-stream do not able to extract the recent change of information in a data-stream adaptively . this paper proposes a sliding window-based method that finds recently frequent-itemsets over an online data-stream adaptively . the size of a window defines a desired life-time of the information in a newly generated transaction . consequently , only recently generated transactions in the range of the window are considered to find the frequent-itemsets of a data-stream .
