using the past to score the present : extending term-weighting models through revision-history analysis the generative process underlies many information-retrieval-models , notably statistical-language-models . yet these models only examine one (current) version of the document , effectively ignoring the actual document-generation process . we posit that a considerable amount of information is encoded in the document-authoring process , and this information is complementary to the word occurrence statistics upon which most modern retrieval-models are based . we propose a new term-weighting model , revision-history analysis (rha) , which uses the revision-history of a document (e.g. , the edit history of a page in wikipedia) to redefine term-frequency - a key indicator of document topic/relevance for many retrieval-models and text-processing tasks . we then apply rha to document-ranking by extending two state-of-the-art text-retrieval models , namely , bm25 and the generative statistical-language-model (lm) . to the best of our knowledge , our paper is the first attempt to directly incorporate document-authoring history into retrieval-models . empirical-results show that rha provides consistent improvements for state-of-the-art retrieval-models , using standard retrieval tasks and benchmarks .
