poka : identifying pareto-optimal k-anonymous nodes in a domain hierarchy lattice data generalization is widely used to protect identities and prevent inference of sensitive-information during the public release of microdata . the k-anonymity-model has been extensively applied in this context . the model seeks a generalization scheme such that every individual becomes indistinguishable from at least k-1 other individuals and the loss in information while doing so is kept at a minimum . the search is performed on a domain hierarchy lattice where every node is a vector signifying the level of generalization for each attribute . an effort to understand privacy and data-utility trade-offs will require knowing the minimum possible information losses of every possible value of k. however , this can easily lead to an exhaustive evaluation of all nodes in the hierarchy lattice . in this paper , we propose using the concept of pareto-optimality to obtain the desired trade-off information . a pareto-optimal generalization is one in which no other generalization can provide a higher value of k without increasing the information-loss . we introduce the pareto-optimal k-anonymization (poka) algorithm to traverse the hierarchy lattice and show that the number of node evaluations required to find the pareto-optimal generalizations can be significantly reduced . results on a benchmark-data-set show that the algorithm is capable of identifying all pareto-optimal nodes by evaluating only 20 \ % of nodes in the lattice .
