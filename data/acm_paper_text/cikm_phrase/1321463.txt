diva : a variance-based clustering approach for multi-type-relational-data clustering is a common technique used to extract knowledge from a dataset in unsupervised-learning . in contrast to classical propositional approaches that only focus on simple and flat datasets , relational-clustering can handle multi-type interrelated-data objects directly and adopt semantic-information hidden in the linkage structure to improve the clustering result . however , exploring linkage information will greatly reduce the scalability of relational-clustering . moreover , some characteristics of vector-data space utilized to accelerate the propositional clustering-procedure are no longer valid in relational-data space . these two disadvantages restrain the relational-clustering techniques from being applied to very-large datasets or in time-critical tasks , such as online recommender-systems . in this paper we propose a new variance-based clustering-algorithm to address the above difficulties . our algorithm combines the advantages of divisive and agglomerative-clustering paradigms to improve the quality of cluster results . by adopting the idea of representative object , it can be executed with linear-time complexity . experimental-results show our algorithm achieves high accuracy , efficiency and robustness in comparison with some well-known relational-clustering approaches .
