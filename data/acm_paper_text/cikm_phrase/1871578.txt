ontology-emergence from folksonomies the folksonomies built from the large-scale social-annotations made by collaborating users are perfect data sources for bootstrapping semantic-web-applications . in this paper , we develop an ontology-induction approach to harvest the emergent-semantics from the folksonomies . we propose a latent subsumption-hierarchy model to uncover the implicit-structure of tag space and develop our ontology-induction approach on basis of this model . we identify tag subsumptions with a set-theoretical approach and model the tag space as a tag subsumption graph . while turning this graph into a concept-hierarchy , we address the problem of inconsistent subsumptions and propose a random-walk_based tag generality ranking procedure to settle it . we propose an agglomerative-hierarchical-clustering algorithm utilizing the result of tag generality ranking to generate the concept-hierarchy . we conduct experiments on the delicious dataset . the results of both qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach .
