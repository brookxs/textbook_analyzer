density index and proximity-search in large-graphs given a large real-world graph where vertices are associated with labels , how do we quickly find interesting vertex sets according to a given query ? in this paper , we study label-based proximity-search in large-graphs , which finds the top-k query-covering vertex sets with the smallest diameters . each set has to cover all the labels in a query . existing greedy-algorithms only return approximate answers , and do not scale well to large-graphs . we propose a novel framework , called gdensity , which uses density index and likelihood ranking to find vertex sets in an efficient and accurate manner . promising vertices are ordered and examined according to their likelihood to produce answers , and the likelihood calculation is greatly facilitated by density indexing . techniques such as progressive-search and partial-indexing are further proposed . experiments on real-world graphs show the efficiency and scalability of gdensity .
