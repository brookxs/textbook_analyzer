incorporating variability in user-behavior into systems_based evaluation click-logs present a wealth of evidence about how users interact with a search-system . this evidence has been used for many things : learning rankings , personalizing , evaluating effectiveness , and more . but it is almost always distilled into point estimates of feature or parameter-values , ignoring what may be the most salient feature of users -- their variability . no two users interact with a system in exactly the same way , and even a single user may interact with results for the same query differently depending on information-need , mood , time of day , and a host of other factors . we present a bayesian-approach to using logs to compute posterior distributions for probabilistic-models of user-interactions . since they are distributions rather than point estimates , they naturally capture variability in the population . we show how to cluster posterior distributions to discover patterns of user-interactions in logs , and discuss how to use the clusters to evaluate search-engines according to a user-model . because the approach is bayesian , our methods can be applied to very-large logs (such as those possessed by web-search-engines) as well as very small (such as those found in almost any other setting) .
