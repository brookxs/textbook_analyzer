imecho : an associative-memory_based desktop-search system traditional desktop-search engines only support keyword based search that needs exact keyword-matching to find resources . however , users generally have a vague picture of what is stored but forget the exact location and keywords of the resource . according to observations of human associative-memory , people tend to remember things from some memory fragments in their brains and these memory fragments are connected by memory cues of user-activity context . we developed imecho (my memory echo) , an associative-memory_based desktop-search system , which exploits such associations and contexts to enhance traditional desktop-search . desktop-resources are connected with semantic links mined from explicit and implicit user activities according to specific access-patterns . using these semantic links , associations among memory fragments can be built or rebuilt in a user 's brain during a search . moreover , our personalized-ranking scheme uses these links together with a user 's personal-preferences to rank results by both relevance and importance to the user . in addition , the system provides a faceted-search feature and association graph-navigation to help users refine and associate search-results generated by full-text keyword-search . our experiments investigating precision-and-recall quality of imecho prototype show that the association-based search-system is superior to the traditional keyword-search in personal-search engines since it is closer to the way that human associative-memory works .
