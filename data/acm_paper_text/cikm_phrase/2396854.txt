a math-aware search-engine for math question-answering-system we propose a math-aware search-engine that is capable of handling both textual keywords as well as mathematical expressions . our math feature-extraction-and-representation framework captures the semantics of math expressions via a finite-state-machine model . we adapt the passive aggressive online-learning binary-classifier as the ranking-model . we benchmarked our approach against three classical information retrieval (ir) strategies on math documents crawled from math overflow , a well-known online math question-answering-system . experimental-results show that our proposed approach can perform better than other methods by more than 9 % .
