dr. searcher and mr. browser : a unified hyperlink-click graph we introduce a unified graph-representation of the-web , which includes both structural and usage information . we model this graph using a simple union of the-web 's hyperlink and click graphs . the hyperlink graph expresses link-structure among web-pages , while the click-graph is a bipartite-graph of queries and documents denoting users ' searching-behavior extracted from a search-engine 's query-log . our most important motivation is to model in a unified way the two main activities of users on the web : searching and browsing , and at the same time to analyze the effects of random-walks on this new graph . the intuition behind this task is to measure how the combination of link-structure and usage-data provide additional-information to that contained in these structures independently . our experimental-results show that both hyperlink and click graphs have strengths and weaknesses when it comes to using their stationary-distribution scores for ranking web-pages . furthermore , our evaluation indicates that the unified graph always generates consistent and robust scores that follow closely the best result obtained from either individual graph , even when applied to `` noisy '' data . it is our belief that the unified-web graph has several useful properties for improving current web document-ranking , as well as for generating new rankings of its own . in particular stationary-distribution scores derived from the random-walks on the combined graph can be used as an indicator of whether structural or usage-data are more reliable in different situations .
