a novel local patch framework for fixing supervised-learning models in the past decades , machine-learning models , especially supervised-learning algorithms , have been widely used in various real-world-applications . however , no matter how strong a learning-model is , it will suffer from the prediction-errors when it is applied to real-world problems . due to the black-box nature of supervised-learning models , it is a challenging problem to fix the supervised-learning models by further learning from the failure cases it generates . in this paper , we propose a novel local patch framework (lpf) to locally fix supervised-learning models by learning from its predicted failure cases . since the learning-models are generally globally optimized during training-process , our proposed lpf assumes that most of the learning errors are led by local errors in the model . thus we aim to break the black boxes of learning-models by identifying and fixing the local errors of various models automatically . the proposed lpf has two key steps , which are local error region subspace-learning and local patch model-learning . through this way , we aim to fix the errors of learning-models locally and automatically with certain generalization ability on unseen testing-data . experiments on both classification and ranking problems show that the proposed lpf is effective and outperforms the original algorithms and the incremental-learning model .
