rhist : adaptive summarization over continuous-data streams maintaining approximate aggregates and summaries over data-streams is crucial to handle the olap-query workload that arises in applications , such as network-monitoring and telecommunications . furthermore , since the entire data is not available at all times the maintenance task must be done incrementally . we show that r (elaxed) hist (ogram) is an appropriate summarization under data-stream scenario . in order to reduce query-estimation errors , we propose adaptive-approaches which not only capture the data-distribution , but also integrate independent query-patterns . we introduce a workload decay model to efficiently capture global workload information and ensure that the query-patterns from the recent past are weighted more than queries that are further in the past . we verify experimentally that our approach successfully adapts to continuously changing workload as well as data-streams .
