clustering transactions using large items in traditional data-clustering , similarity of a cluster of objects is measured by pairwise similarity of objects in that cluster . we argue that such measures are not appropriate for transactions that are sets of items . we propose the notion of large items , i.e. , items contained in some minimum fraction of transactions in a cluster , to measure the similarity of a cluster of transactions . the intuition of our clustering criterion is that there should be many large items within a cluster and little overlapping of such items across clusters . we discuss the rationale behind our approach and its implication on providing a better solution to the clustering problem . we present a clustering-algorithm based on the new clustering criterion and evaluate its effectiveness .
