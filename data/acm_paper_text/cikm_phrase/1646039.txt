scalable continuous-range monitoring of moving-objects in symbolic-indoor-space indoor-spaces accommodate large populations of individuals . the continuous-range monitoring of such objects can be used as a foundation for a wide variety of applications , e.g. , space-planning , way finding , and security . indoor-space differs from outdoor space in that symbolic locations , e.g. , rooms , rather than euclidean positions or spatial-network locations are important . in addition , positioning based on presence sensing-devices , rather than , e.g. , gps , is assumed . such devices report the objects in their activation ranges . we propose an incremental , query-aware continuous-range query-processing technique for objects moving in this setting . a set of critical devices is determined for each query , and only the observations from those devices are used to continuously maintain the query result . due to the limitations of the positioning devices , queries contain certain and uncertain results . a maximum-speed constraint on object movement is used to refine the latter results . a comprehensive experimental-study with both synthetic and real-data suggests that our proposal is efficient and scalable .
