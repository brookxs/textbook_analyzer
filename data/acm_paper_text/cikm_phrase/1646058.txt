learning-to-rank from bayesian decision inference ranking is a key problem in many information-retrieval (ir) applications , such as document-retrieval and collaborative-filtering . in this paper , we address the issue of learning-to-rank in document-retrieval . learning-based methods , such as ranknet , ranksvm , and rankboost , try to create ranking-functions automatically by using some training-data . recently , several learning-to-rank methods have been proposed to directly optimize the performance of ir applications in terms of various evaluation-measures . they undoubtedly provide statistically significant improvements over conventional methods ; however , from the viewpoint of decision-making , most of them do not minimize the bayes risk of the ir-system . in an attempt to fill this research gap , we propose a novel framework that directly optimizes the bayes risk related to the ranking accuracy in terms of the ir-evaluation measures . the results of experiments on the letor collections demonstrate that the framework outperforms several existing methods in most cases .
