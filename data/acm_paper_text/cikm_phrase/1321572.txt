ix-cubes : iceberg cubes for data-warehousing and olap on xml-data with increasing amount of data being stored in xml-format , olap queries over these data become important . olap queries have been well studied in the relational-database-systems . however , the evaluation of olap queries over xml-data is not a trivial extension of the relational solutions , especially when a schema is not available . in this paper , we introduce the ix-cube (iceberg xml cube) over xml-data to tackle the problem . we extend olap-operations to xml-data . we also develop efficient approaches to ix-cube computation and olap-query evaluation using ix-cubes .
