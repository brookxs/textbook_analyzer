dimensionality-reduction using magnitude and shape approximations high-dimensional-data sets are encountered in many modern database-applications . the usual approach is to construct a summary of the data-set through a lossy-compression technique , and use this lower dimensional synopsis to provide fast , approximate answers to the queries . in this paper , we develop a novel dimensionality-reduction-technique based on partitioning the high-dimensional vector-space into orthogonal subspaces . first , we find a relation between the euclidian-distance of two n-dimensional vectors and the euclidian distances of their projections on the orthogonal subspaces . then , based on this relation we develop a method to approximate the euclidian-distance using novel inner-product approximation . this process allows us to incorporate the shape information of the vectors to this approximation . while the inner-product approximation is symmetric , i.e. , captures only the magnitude information of the data , the proposed method takes both the magnitude and shape information of the original vectors into account through partitioning . in the experiments , we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by comparing it with commonly used methods .
