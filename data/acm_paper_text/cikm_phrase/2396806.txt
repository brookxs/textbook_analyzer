g-sparql : a hybrid engine for querying large attributed-graphs we propose a sparql-like language , g-sparql , for querying attributed-graphs . the language expresses types of queries which of large interest for applications which model their data as large-graphs such as : pattern-matching , reachability and shortest-path queries . each query can combine both of structural predicates and value-based predicates (on the attributes of the graph nodes and edges) . we describe an algebraic compilation mechanism for our proposed query-language which is extended from the relational-algebra and based on the basic construct of building sparql queries , the triple pattern . we describe a hybrid memory/disk representation of large attributed-graphs where only the topology of the graph is maintained in memory while the data of the graph is stored in a relational-database . the execution engine of our proposed query-language splits parts of the query-plan to be pushed inside the relational-database while the execution of other parts of the query-plan are processed using memory-based algorithms , as necessary . experimental-results on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and the scalability of our approach and show that our approach outperforms native graph-databases by several factors .
