kddcs : a load-balanced in-network data-centric-storage scheme for sensor-networks we propose an in-network data-centric-storage (indcs) scheme for answering ad-hoc-queries in sensor-networks . previously proposed in-network-storage (ins) schemes suffered from storage-hot-spots that are formed if either the sensors ' locations are not uniformly distributed over the coverage area , or the distribution of sensor readings is not uniform over the range of possible reading values . our k-d-tree_based data-centric-storage (kddcs) scheme maintains the invariant that the storage of events is distributed reasonably uniformly among the sensors . kddcs is composed of a set of distributed-algorithms whose running-time is within a poly-log factor of the diameter of the network . the number of messages any sensor has to send , as well as the bits in those messages , is poly-logarithmic in the number of sensors . load-balancing in kddcs is based on defining and distributively solving a theoretical problem that we call the weighted split median problem . in addition to analytical bounds on kddcs individual algorithms , we provide experimental-evidence of our scheme 's general efficiency , as well as its ability to avoid the formation of storage-hot-spots of various sizes , unlike all previous indcs schemes .
