document release versus data-access controls : two sides of the same coin ? the database and document worlds have traditionally had different approaches to security . databases provide access-controls on structured-data , while document-security interrogates the outgoing information , based on document markings and actual contents . for the emerging world in which many documents are generated from structured-data (and vice versa) , the separation can cause failure , implementation-dependence , inconsistency , and wasted effort . after comparing approaches and mechanisms in the two areas , we identify issues in security-administration and implementation in military and medical-applications . we then present elements of a unifying model .
