a practical concurrent index for solid-state-drives solid-state-drives are becoming a viable alternative to magnetic-disks in database-systems , but their performance characteristics , particularly those caused by their erase-before-write behavior , make conventional database indexes a poor fit . there have been various proposals of indexes specialized for these devices , but to make such indexes practical , we must address the issue of concurrency-control . good concurrency-control is especially critical to indexes on solid-state-drives , because they typically rely on batch updates , which may take long and block concurrent index accesses . we design , implement , and evaluate an index-structure called fd + tree and an associated concurrency-control scheme called fd+fc . our evaluation confirms significant performance advantages of our approach over less sophisticated ones , and brings ou insights on data-structure-design and oltp performance-tuning on solid-state-drives .
