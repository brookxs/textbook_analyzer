efficient data-access to multi-channel broadcast-programs this paper studies fast access to data that are broadcast on multiple-channels . broadcast is a useful data-dissemination technique because of its scalability , but is lacking when it comes to response-time . increasing the number of available broadcast-channels is a logical way of increasing throughput . little work , however , has considered the access structures necessary for making effective use of the additional channels . we propose various indexing schemes for a multi-channel broadcast-program . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in decreasing response-time and tuning-time via extensive experiments over a wide range of parameters .
