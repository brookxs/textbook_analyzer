a unified environment for fusion of information-retrieval approaches prior work has shown that combining results of various retrieval approaches and query representations can improve search-effectiveness . today , many meta-search-engines exist which combine the results of various search-engines in the hopes of improving overall effectiveness . however , the combination of results from different search-engines masks variations in parsers , and other indexing-techniques (stemming , stop words , etc.) this makes it difficult to assess the utility of the fusion technique . we have implemented the two most prevalent retrieval-strategies : probabilistic and vector-space using the same parser and the same relational-retrieval engine . first , we identified a model that enables the fusion of an arbitrary number of sources . next , we tested various linear-combinations of these two methods as well as various thresholds for identifying retrieved documents . our results show some improvement of effectiveness , but they also provide us for a baseline from which we can continue with other retrieval-strategies and test the effect of fusing these strategies .
