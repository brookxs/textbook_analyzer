multi-resolution-modeling of large-scale scientific-simulation data to provide scientists and engineers with the ability to explore and analyze tera-scale size data-sets we are using a twofold approach . first , we model the data with the objective of creating a compressed yet manageable representation . second , with that compressed representation , we provide the ability to query the resulting approximation in order to obtain approximate yet sufficient answers ; a process called ad-hoc querying . this paper is concerned with a wavelet modeling-technique that seeks to capture the important physical-characteristics of the target scientific-data . our approach is driven by the compression , which is necessary for viable throughput , along with the end-user requirements from the discovery process . our work contrasts existing research which applies wavelets to range querying , change-detection , and clustering problems by working directly with the wavelet-decomposition of the data . the difference in this procedure is due primarily to the nature of the data and the requirements of the scientists and engineers . our approach directly uses the wavelet coefficients of the data to compress as well as query . we describe how the wavelet-decomposition is used to facilitate data-compression and how queries are posed on the resulting compressed model . results of this process will be shown for several problems of interest .
