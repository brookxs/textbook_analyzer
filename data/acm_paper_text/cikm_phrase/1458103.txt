semi-automated logging of contact-center telephone calls modern businesses use contact centers as a communication-channel with users of their products and services . the largest factor in the expense of running a telephone contact-center is the labor cost of its agents . ibm research has built a new system , contact-center agent buddies (cab) , which is designed to help reduce the average handle time (aht) for customer calls , thereby also reducing their cost . in this paper , we focus on the call logging subsystem , which helps agents reduce the time they spend documenting those calls . we built a template cab and a call logging cab , using a pipeline consisting of audio-capture of a telephone conversation , automatic-speech-recognition , text-analysis , and log generation . we developed techniques for asr text cleansing , including normalization of expressions and acronyms , domain terms , capitalization , and boundaries for sentences , paragraphs , and call segments . we found that simple heuristics suffice to generate high-quality logs from the normalized sentences . the pipeline yields a candidate call-log which the agents can edit in less time than it takes them to generate call logs manually . evaluation of the call logging cab in an industrial contact-center environment shows that it reduces the amount of time agents spend logging calls by at least 50 \ % without compromising the quality of the resulting call documentation .
