constructing test-collections by inferring document-relevance via extracted relevant-information the goal of a typical information-retrieval-system is to satisfy a user 's information-need -- e.g. , by providing an answer or information `` nugget '' -- while the actual search-space of a typical information-retrieval-system consists of documents -- i.e. , collections of nuggets . in this paper , we characterize this relationship between nuggets and documents and discuss applications to system-evaluation . in particular , for the problem of test-collection-construction for ir-system evaluation , we demonstrate a highly efficient-algorithm for simultaneously obtaining both relevant documents and relevant-information . our technique exploits the mutually reinforcing relationship between relevant documents and relevant-information , yielding document-based test-collections whose efficiency and efficacy exceed those of typical cranfield-style test-collections , while also generating sets of highly relevant-information .
