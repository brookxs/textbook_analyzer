gscorr : modeling geo-social correlations for new check-ins on location-based-social-networks location-based-social-networks (lbsns) have attracted an increasing number-of-users in recent years . the availability of geographical and social-information of online lbsns provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the human-movement from their socio-spatial behavior , enabling a variety of location-based-services . previous work on lbsns reported limited improvements from using the social-network information for location-prediction ; as users can check-in at new places , traditional work on location-prediction that relies on mining a user 's historical trajectories is not designed for this `` cold-start '' problem of predicting new check-ins . in this paper , we propose to utilize the social-network information for solving the `` cold-start '' location-prediction problem , with a geo-social correlation model to capture social correlations on lbsns considering social-networks and geographical-distance . the experimental-results on a real-world lbsn demonstrate that our approach properly models the social correlations of a user 's new check-ins by considering various correlation strengths and correlation measures .
