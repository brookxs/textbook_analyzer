online-community search using thread-structure online-communities are valuable information-sources where knowledge is accumulated by interactions between people . search-services provided by online-community sites such as forums are often , however , quite poor . to address this , we investigate retrieval techniques that exploit the hierarchical thread structures in community sites . since these structures are sometimes not explicit or accurately annotated , we use structure-discovery techniques . we then make use of thread structures in retrieval experiments . our results show that using thread structures that have been accurately annotated can lead to significant improvements in retrieval-performance compared to strong baselines .
