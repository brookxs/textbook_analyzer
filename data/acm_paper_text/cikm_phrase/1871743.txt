discovery of numerous specific topics via term-co-occurrence analysis we describe efficient techniques for construction of large term-co-occurrence graphs , and investigate an application to the discovery of numerous fine-grained (specific) topics . a topic is a small dense subgraph discovered by a random-walk initiated at a term (node) in the graph . we observe that the discovered topics are highly interpretable , and reveal the different meanings of terms in the corpus . we show the information-theoretic utility of the topics when they are used as features in supervised-learning . such features lead to consistent improvements in classification-accuracy over the standard bag-of-words representation , even at high training proportions . we explain how a layered pyramidal view of the term-distribution helps in understanding the algorithms and in visualizing and interpreting the topics .
