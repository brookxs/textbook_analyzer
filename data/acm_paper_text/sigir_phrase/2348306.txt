summarizing highly structured-documents for effective search interaction as highly structured-documents with rich metadata (such as products , movies , etc.) become increasingly prevalent , searching those documents has become an important ir problem . unfortunately existing work on document-summarization , especially in the context of search , has been mainly focused on unstructured documents , and little attention has been paid to highly structured-documents . due to the different characteristics of structured and unstructured documents , the ideal approaches for document-summarization might be different . in this paper , we study the problem of summarizing highly structured-documents in a search-context . we propose a new summarization-approach based on query-specific facet selection . our approach aims to discover the important facets hidden behind a query using a machine-learning-approach , and summarizes retrieved documents based on those important facets . in addition , we propose to evaluate summarization approaches based on a utility-function that measures how well the summaries assist users in interacting with the search-results . furthermore , we develop a game on mechanical-turk to evaluate different summarization approaches . the experimental-results show that the new summarization-approach significantly outperforms two existing ones .
