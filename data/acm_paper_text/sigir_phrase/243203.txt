the design of a high-performance information-filtering system a high-performance information-filtering system has three main requirements : it must be effective in supplying users with useful information , it must do so in a timely fashion , and it must be able to handle a large throughput of information and a large number of user-profiles efficiently . these three requirements pose a difficult problem , and to our knowledge no existing system is capable of meeting all three . in this paper we describe a system which combines a number of techniques from other information-retrieval-and-filtering systems , and is capable of providing high-performance on a typical workstation platform . we provide estimates of computing resource usage , and show that our system is also scalable .
