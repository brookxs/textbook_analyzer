user-centered story tracking using data collections available on the internet has for many people became the main medium for staying informed about the world . many of these collections are in nature dynamic , evolving as the subjects they describe change . the goal of different research areas is to identify and highlight these changes to better enable readers to track stories . in this work we restrict ourselves to news collections and investigate `` real-life '' effectiveness and usability of temporal-text-mining (ttm) story tracking methods . we propose a new story tracking-method and build a tool to support it . additionally , we investigate the effectiveness and usability of story tracking methods and define a new frameworks for automatic and user-oriented evaluation . we built methods-and-tools which allow for understanding , discovery , and search through user-interaction . although there are many ttm methods developed there is a lack of common evaluation-procedure . therefore , we propose an evaluation-framework for measuring how different ttm methods discover novel `` facts '' . apart from the automatic-evaluation we are interested in how can users interact with pattens and learn about the underlying subjects of the story they track . for this purpose we propose a user-testing environment that measures speed and accuracy in which users can use story tracking methods to discover predefined sets of ground-truth sentences .
