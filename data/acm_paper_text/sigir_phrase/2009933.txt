learning-to-rank for freshness and relevance freshness of results is important in modern web-search . failing to recognize the temporal aspect of a query can negatively affect the user-experience , and make the search-engine appear stale . while freshness and relevance can be closely related for some topics (e.g. , news-queries) , they are more independent in others (e.g. , time insensitive queries) . therefore , optimizing one criterion does not necessarily improve the other , and can even do harm in some cases . we propose a machine-learning framework for simultaneously optimizing freshness and relevance , in which the trade-off is automatically adaptive to query temporal characteristics . we start by illustrating different temporal characteristics of queries , and the features that can be used for capturing these properties . we then introduce our supervised framework that leverages the temporal-profile of queries (inferred from pseudo-feedback documents) along with the other ranking-features to improve both freshness and relevance of search-results . our experiments on a large archival-web corpus demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques .
