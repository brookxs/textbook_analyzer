estimating collection-size with logistic-regression collection-size is an important feature to represent the content summaries of a collection , and plays a vital role in collection-selection for distributed-search . in uncooperative environments , collection-size-estimation algorithms are adopted to estimate the sizes of collections with their search-interfaces . this paper proposes heterogeneous capture (hc) algorithm , in which the capture probabilities of documents are modeled with logistic-regression . with heterogeneous capture probabilities , hc algorithm estimates collection-size through conditional maximum likelihood . experimental-results on real web-data show that our hc algorithm outperforms both multiple capture-recapture and capture history algorithms .
