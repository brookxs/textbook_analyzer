incorporating term-dependency in the dfr framework term-dependency , or co-occurrence , has been studied in language-modelling , for instance by metzler & croft who showed that retrieval-performance could be significantlyenhanced using term-dependency information . in this work , weshow how term-dependency can be modelled within the divergence-from-randomness (dfr) framework . we evaluate our term-dependency model on the two adhoc retrieval tasks using the trec . gov2 terabyte collection . furthermore , we examine the effect of varying the term-dependency window-size on the retrieval-performance of the proposed model . our experiments show that term-dependency can indeed besuccessfully incorporated within the dfr framework .
