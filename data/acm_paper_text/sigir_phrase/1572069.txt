equivalence between nonnegative tensor-factorization and tensorial probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis this paper establishes a connection between nmf and plsa on multi-way-data , called ntf and t-plsa respectively . two types of t-plsa models are proven to be equivalent to non-negative parafac and non-negative tucker3 . this paper also shows that by running ntf and t-plsa alternatively , they can jump out of each other 's local-minima and achieve a better clustering solution .
