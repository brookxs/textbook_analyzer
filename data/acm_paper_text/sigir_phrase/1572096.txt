measuring constraint violations in information-retrieval recently , an inductive approach to modelling term-weighting function correctness has provided a number of axioms (constraints) , to which all good term-weighting functions should adhere . these constraints have been shown to be theoretically and empirically sound in a number of works . it has been shown that when a term-weighting function breaks one or more of the constraints , it typically indicates sub-optimality of that function . this elegant inductive approach may more accurately model the human process of determining the relevance a document . it is intuitive that a person 's notion of relevance changes as terms that are either on or off-topic are encountered in a given document . ultimately , it would be desirable to be able to mathematically determine the performance of term-weighting functions without the need for test-collections . many modern term-weighting functions do not satisfy the constraints in an unconditional manner . however , the degree to which these functions violate the constraints has not been investigated . a comparison between weighting functions from this perspective may shed light on the poor performance of certain functions in certain settings . moreover , if a correlation exists between performance and the number of violations , measuring the degree of violation could help more accurately predict how a certain scheme will perform on a given collection .
