on the collective-classification of email speech acts we consider classification of email-messages as to whether or not they contain certain `` email acts '' , such as a request or a commitment . we show that exploiting the sequential correlation among email-messages in the same thread can improve email-act classification . more specifically , we describe a new text-classification algorithm based on a dependency-network based collective-classification method , in which the local classifiers are maximum-entropy-models based on words and certain relational features . we show that statistically significant improvements over a bag-of-words baseline classifier can be obtained for some , but not all , email-act classes . performance-improvements obtained by collective-classification appears to be consistent across many email acts suggested by prior speech-act theory .
