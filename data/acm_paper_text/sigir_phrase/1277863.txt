revisiting the dependence language-model for information-retrieval in this paper , we revisit the dependence language modelfor information-retrieval proposed in [1] , and show that thismodel is deficient from a theoretical point-of-view . we thenpropose a new model , well founded theoretically , for integratingdependencies between terms in the language model.this new model is simpler , yet more general , than the oneproposed in [1] , and yields similar results in our experiments , on both syntactic and semantic dependencies .
