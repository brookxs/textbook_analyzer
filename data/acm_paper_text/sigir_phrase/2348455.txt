active query selection for learning rankers methods that reduce the amount of labeled-data needed for training have focused more on selecting which documents to label than on which queries should be labeled . one exception to this (long et al. 2010) uses expected-loss-optimization (elo) to estimate which queries should be selected but is limited to rankers that predict absolute graded-relevance . in this work , we demonstrate how to easily adapt elo to work with any ranker and show that estimating expected loss in dcg is more robust than ndcg even when the final performance-measure is ndcg .
