a new rank-correlation coefficient for information-retrieval in the field of information-retrieval , one is often faced with the problem of computing the correlation between two ranked-lists . the most commonly used statistic that quantifies this correlation is kendall 's ? . often times , in the information-retrieval-community , discrepancies among those items having high rankings are more important than those among items having low rankings . the kendall 's ? statistic , however , does not make such distinctions and equally penalizes errors both at high and low rankings . in this paper , we propose a new rank-correlation coefficient , ap correlation (? ap) , that is based on average-precision and has a probabilistic interpretation . we show that the proposed statistic gives more weight to the errors at high rankings and has nice mathematical properties which make it easy to interpret . we further validate the applicability of the statistic using experimental-data .
