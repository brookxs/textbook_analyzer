fractal-summarization : summarization based on fractal-theory in this paper , we introduce the fractal-summarization model based on the fractal-theory . in fractal-summarization , the important information is captured from the source-text by exploring the hierarchical-structure and salient-features of the document . a condensed version of the document that is informatively close to the original is produced iteratively using the contractive transformation in the fractal-theory . user-evaluation has shown that fractal-summarization outperforms traditional summarization .
