risky business : modeling and exploiting uncertainty in information-retrieval most retrieval-models estimate the relevance of each document to a query and rank the documents accordingly . however , such an approach ignores the uncertainty associated with the estimates of relevancy . if a high estimate of relevancy also has a high uncertainty , then the document may be very relevant or not relevant at all . another document may have a slightly lower estimate of relevancy but the corresponding uncertainty may be much less . in such a circumstance , should the retrieval-engine risk ranking the first document highest , or should it choose a more conservative (safer) strategy that gives preference to the second document ? there is no definitive answer to this question , as it depends on the risk preferences of the user and the information-retrieval-system . in this paper we present a general-framework for modeling uncertainty and introduce an asymmetric loss-function with a single-parameter that can model the level of risk the system is willing to accept . by adjusting the risk preference parameter , our approach can effectively adapt to users ' different retrieval-strategies . we apply this asymmetric loss-function to a language-modeling framework and a practical risk-aware document scoring-function is obtained . our experiments on several trec collections show that our `` risk-averse '' approach significantly improves the jelinek-mercer-smoothing language-model , and a combination of our `` risk-averse '' approach and the jelinek-mercer-smoothing method generally outperforms the dirichlet-smoothing method . experimental-results also show that the `` risk-averse '' approach , even without smoothing from the collection statistics , performs as well as three commonly-adopted retrieval-models , namely , the jelinek-mercer and dirichlet-smoothing methods , and bm25 model .
