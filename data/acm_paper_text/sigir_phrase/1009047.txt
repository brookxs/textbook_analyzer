filtering-algorithms for information-retrieval-models with named attributes and proximity operators in the selective-dissemination-of-information (or publish/subscribe) paradigm , clients subscribe to a server with continuous-queries (or profiles) that express their information-needs . clients can also publish documents to servers . whenever a document is published , the continuous-queries satisfying this document are found and notifications are sent to appropriate clients . this paper deals with the filtering problem that needs to be solved effciently by each server : given a database of continuous-queries db and a document d , find all queries q ? db that match d . we present data-structures-and-indexing algorithms that enable us to solve the filtering problem efficiently for large-databases of queries expressed in the model awp which is based on named attributes with values of type text , and word proximity operators .
