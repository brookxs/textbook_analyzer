brek12 : a book recommender for k-12 users ideally , students in k-12 grade levels can turn to book recommenders to locate books that match their interests . existing book recommenders , however , fail to take into account the readability levels of their users , and hence their recommendations may be unsuitable for the users . to address this issue , we introduce brek12 , a recommender that targets k-12 users and prioritizes the reading level of its users in suggesting books of interest . empirical-studies conducted using the bookcrossing dataset show that brek12 outperforms a number of existing recommenders (developed for general users) in identifying books appealing to k-12 users .
