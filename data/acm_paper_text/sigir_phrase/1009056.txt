a search-engine for historical manuscript images many museum and library-archives are digitizing their large-collections of handwritten historical-manuscripts to enable public-access to them . these collections are only available in image formats and require expensive manual-annotation work for access to them . current handwriting recognizers have word-error-rates in excess of 50 \ % and therefore can not be used for such material . we describe two statistical-models for retrieval in large-collections of handwritten-manuscripts given a text query . both use a set of transcribed page images to learn a joint-probability-distribution between features computed from word images and their transcriptions . the models can then be used to retrieve unlabeled images of handwritten-documents given a text query . we show experiments with a training-set of 100 transcribed pages and a test-set of 987 handwritten page images from the george washington collection . experiments show that the precision at 20 documents is about 0.4 to 0.5 depending on the model . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first automatic-retrieval system for historical-manuscripts using text queries , without manual transcription of the original corpus .
