the good , the bad , and the random : an eye-tracking-study of ad quality in web-search we investigate how people interact with web-search-engine result pages using eye-tracking . while previous research has focused on the visual-attention devoted to the 10 organic-search-results , this paper examines other components of contemporary search-engines , such as ads and related searches . we systematically varied the type of task (informational or navigational) , the quality of the ads (relevant or irrelevant to the query) , and the sequence in which ads of different quality were presented . we measured the effects of these variables on the distribution of visual-attention and on task-performance . our results show significant effects of each variable . the amount of visual-attention that people devote to organic results depends on both task-type and ad quality . the amount of visual-attention that people devote to ads depends on their quality , but not the type of task . interestingly , the sequence and predictability of ad quality is also an important-factor in determining how much people attend to ads . when the quality of ads varied randomly from task to task , people paid little attention to the ads , even when they were good . these results further our understanding of how attention devoted to search-results is influenced by other page elements , and how previous search experiences influence how people attend to the current page .
