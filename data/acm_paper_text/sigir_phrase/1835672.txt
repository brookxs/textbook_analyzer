graphical-models for text : a new paradigm for text-representation and processing almost all text applications use the well known vector-space-model for text-representation and analysis . while the vector-space-model has proven itself to be an effective and efficient representation for mining purposes , it does not preserve information about the ordering of the words in the representation . in this paper , we will introduce the concept of distance graph representations of text-data . such representations preserve distance and ordering information between the words , and provide a much richer representation of the underlying text . this approach enables knowledge-discovery from text which is not possible with the use of a pure vector-space representation , because it loses much less information about the ordering of the underlying words . furthermore , this representation does not require the development of new mining and management-techniques . this is because the technique can also be converted into a structural version of the vector-space representation , which allows the use of all existing tools for text . in addition , existing techniques for graph and xml-data can be directly leveraged with this new representation . thus , a much wider spectrum of algorithms is available for processing this representation .
