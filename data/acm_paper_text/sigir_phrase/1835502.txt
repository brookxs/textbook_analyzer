temporally-aware algorithms for document-classification automatic document classification (adc) is still one of the major information-retrieval problems . it usually employs a supervised-learning strategy , where we first build a classification-model using pre-classified documents and then use this model to classify unseen documents . the majority of supervised algorithms consider that all documents provide equally important information . however , in practice , a document may be considered more or less important to build the classification-model according to several factors , such as its timeliness , the venue where it was published in , its authors , among others . in this paper , we are particularly concerned with the impact that temporal-effects may have on adc and how to minimize such impact . in order to deal with these effects , we introduce a temporal weighting-function (twf) and propose a methodology to determine it for document-collections . we applied the proposed methodology to acm-dl and medline and found that the twf of both follows a lognormal . we then extend three adc algorithms (namely knn , rocchio and na ve-bayes) to incorporate the twf . experiments showed that the temporally-aware classifiers achieved significant gains , outperforming (or at least matching) state-of-the-art algorithms .
