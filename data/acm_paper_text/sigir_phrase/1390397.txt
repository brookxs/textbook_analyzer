a lattice-based approach to query-by-example spoken-document-retrieval recent efforts on the task of spoken-document-retrieval (sdr) have made use of speech lattices : speech lattices contain information about alternative speech-transcription hypotheses other than the 1-best transcripts , and this information can improve retrieval-accuracy by overcoming recognition-errors present in the 1-best transcription . in this paper , we look at using lattices for the query-by-example spoken-document-retrieval task - retrieving documents from a speech-corpus , where the queries are themselves in the form of complete spoken documents (query exemplars) . we extend a previously proposed method for sdr with short queries to the query-by-example task . specifically , we use a retrieval-method based on statistical-modeling : we compute expected word counts from document and query lattices , estimate statistical-models from these counts , and compute relevance-scores as divergences between these models . experimental-results on a speech-corpus of conversational english show that the use of statistics from lattices for both documents and query exemplars results in better retrieval-accuracy than using only 1-best transcripts for either documents , or queries , or both . in addition , we investigate the effect of stop word removal which further improves retrieval-accuracy . to our knowledge , our work is the first to have used a lattice-based approach to query-by-example spoken-document-retrieval .
