ousting ivory tower research : towards a web framework for providing experiments as a service with its close ties to the-web , the ir community-is destined to leverage the dissemination and collaboration capabilities that the-web provides today . especially with the advent of the software-as-a-service principle , an ir community-is conceivable that publishes experiments executable by anyone over the-web . a review of recent sigir papers shows that we are far away from this vision of collaboration . the benefits of publishing ir experiments as a service are striking for the community as a whole , and include potential to boost research profiles and reputation . however , the additional work must be kept to a minimum and sensitive-data must be kept private for this paradigm to become an accepted practice . to foster experiments as a service in ir , we present a web framework for experiments that addresses the outlined challenges and possesses a unique set of compelling features in comparison to existing solutions . we also describe how our reference implementation is already used officially as an evaluation-platform for an established international plagiarism-detection competition .
