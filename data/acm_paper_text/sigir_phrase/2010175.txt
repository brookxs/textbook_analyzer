persistence in the ephemeral : utilizing repeat behaviors for multi-session personalized-search as the abundance of information on the internet grows , an increasing burden is placed on the user to specify his or her query precisely in order to avoid extraneous results that may be relevant , but not useful . at the same time , users have a tendency to repeat their search-behaviors , seeking the same url (re-finding) as well as issuing the same query (re-searching) . these repeated actions reveal a form of user-preference that the search-engine can utilize to personalize the results . in our approach , we personalize search-results related to ongoing tasks , allowing for a different degree of strength of interest , and diversity of interest per task . we focus on high valued queries ; queries that are both related to past-queries and will be related to future queries given the ongoing nature of the task .
