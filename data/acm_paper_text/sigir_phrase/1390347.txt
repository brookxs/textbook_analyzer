the good and the bad system : does the test-collection predict users ' effectiveness ? test-collections are extensively used in the evaluation of information-retrieval-systems . crucial to their use is the degree to which results from them predict user-effectiveness . at first , past studies did not substantiate a relationship between system and user-effectiveness ; more recently , however , correlations have begun to emerge . the results of this paper strengthen and extend those findings . we introduce a novel methodology for investigating the relationship , which shows great success in establishing a significant correlation between system and user-effectiveness . it is shown that users behave differently and discern differences between pairs of systems that have a very small absolute-difference in test-collection effectiveness . our results strengthen the use of test-collections in ir-evaluation , confirming that users ' effectiveness can be predicted successfully .
