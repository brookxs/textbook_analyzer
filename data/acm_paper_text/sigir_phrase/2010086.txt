domain expert topic-familiarity and search-behavior users of information-retrieval-systems employ a variety of strategies when searching for information . one factor that can directly influence how searchers go about their information-finding task is the level of familiarity with a search topic . we investigate how the search-behavior of domain-experts changes based on their previous level of familiarity with a search topic , reporting on a user-study of biomedical experts searching for a range of domain-specific material . the results of our study show that topic-familiarity can influence the number of queries that are employed to complete a task , the types of queries that are entered , and the overall number of query terms . our findings suggest that biomedical-search systems should enable searching through a variety of querying modes , to support the different search-strategies that users were found to employ depending on their familiarity with the information that they are searching for .
