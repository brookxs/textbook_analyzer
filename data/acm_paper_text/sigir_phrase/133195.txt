n-poisson document modelling this paper is a report of a study investigating the validity of the multiple poisson (np) model of word-distribution in document-collections . an np distribution is a mixture of n poisson-distributions with different means . we describe a practical algorithm for determining if a certain word is distributed acording to an np distribution and computing the distribution parameters . the algorithm was applied to every word in four different document-collections . it was found that over 70 \ % of frequently occurring words and terms indeed behave according to the np distributions . the results indicate that the proportion of np words depends on the collection-size , document-length and the frequency of the individual words . most of the np words recognised are distributed according to the mixture of relatively few single poisson-distributions (two , three or four) . there is an indication that the number of single poisson components in the mixture of relatively few single poisson-distributions (two , three or four) . there is an indication that the number of single poisson components in the mixture depends on the collection frequency of words .
