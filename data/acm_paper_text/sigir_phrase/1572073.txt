evaluating web-search using task-completion-time we consider experiments to measure the quality of a web-search-algorithm based on how much total time users take to complete assigned search-tasks using that algorithm . we first analyze our data to verify that there is in fact a negative relationship between a user 's total search-time and a user 's satisfaction for the types of tasks under consideration . secondly , we fit a model with the user 's total search-time as the response to compare two different search-algorithms . finally , we propose an alternative experimental-design which we demonstrate to be a substantial improvement over our current design in terms of variance-reduction and efficiency .
