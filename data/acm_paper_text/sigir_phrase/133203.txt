a loosely-coupled integration of a text-retrieval-system and an object-oriented-database system document-management-systems are needed for many business-applications . this type-of-system would combine the functionality of a database-system , (for describing , storing and maintaining documents with complex structure and relationships) with a text-retrieval-system (for effective retrieval based on full text) . the retrieval-model for a document-management-system is complicated by the variety and complexity of the objects that are represented . in this paper , we describe an approach to complex-object-retrieval using a probabilistic-inference net model , and an implementation of this approach using a loose-coupling of an object-oriented-database system (iris) and a text-retrieval-system based on inference nets (inquery) . the resulting system is used to store long , structured-documents and can retrieve document-components (sections , figures , etc.) based on their contents or the contents of related components . the lessons-learnt from the implementation are discussed .
