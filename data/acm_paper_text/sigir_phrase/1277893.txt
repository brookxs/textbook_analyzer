model-averaged latent-semantic-indexing this poster introduces a novel approach to information-retrieval that uses statistical-model averaging to improve latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) . instead of choosing a single dimensionality $ k $ for lsi , we propose using several models of differing dimensionality to inform retrieval . to manage this ensemble we weight each model 's contribution to an extent inversely proportional to its aic (akaike information-criterion) . thus each model contributes proportionally to its expected kullback-leibler-divergence from the distribution that generated the data . we present results on three standard ir test collections , demonstrating significant improvement over both the traditional vector-space-model and single-model lsi .
