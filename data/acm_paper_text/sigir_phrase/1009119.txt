query-related data-extraction of hidden-web documents the larger amount of information on the web is stored in document-databases and is not indexed by general-purpose search-engines (i.e. , google and yahoo) . such information is dynamically generated through querying databases - which are referred to as hidden-web-databases . documents returned in response to a user-query are typically presented using template-generated web-pages . this paper proposes a novel approach that identifies web-page templates by analysing the textual contents and the adjacent tag structures of a document in order to extract query-related data . preliminary results demonstrate that our approach effectively detects templates and retrieves data with high recall and precision .
