gravitation-based-model for information-retrieval this paper proposes gbm (gravitation-based-model) , a physical-model for information-retrieval inspired by newton 's theory-of-gravitation . a mapping is built in this model from concepts of information-retrieval (documents , queries , relevance , etc) to those of physics (mass , distance , radius , attractive force , etc) . this model actually provides a new perspective on ir problems . a family of effective term-weighting functions can be derived from it , including the well-known bm25 formula . this model has some advantages over most existing ones : first , because it is directly based on basic physical laws , the derived formulas and algorithms can have their explicit physical interpretation . second , the ranking formulas derived from this model satisfy more intuitive heuristics than most of existing ones , thus have the potential to behave empirically better and to be used safely on various settings . finally , a new approach for structured-document-retrieval derived from this model is more reasonable and behaves better than existing ones .
