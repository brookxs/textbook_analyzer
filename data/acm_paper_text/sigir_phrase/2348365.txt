a generalized hidden-markov-model with discriminative-training for query-spelling correction query-spelling correction is a crucial component of modern search-engines . existing methods in the literature for search-query spelling-correction have two major drawbacks . first , they are unable to handle certain important types of spelling errors , such as concatenation and splitting . second , they can not efficiently evaluate all the candidate corrections due to the complex form of their scoring-functions , and a heuristic filtering step must be applied to select a working-set of top-k most promising candidates for final scoring , leading to non-optimal predictions . in this paper we address both limitations and propose a novel generalized hidden-markov-model with discriminative-training that can not only handle all the major types of spelling errors , including splitting and concatenation errors , in a single unified-framework , but also efficiently evaluate all the candidate corrections to ensure the finding of a globally optimal correction . experiments on two query-spelling correction datasets demonstrate that the proposed generalized hmm is effective for correcting multiple-types of spelling errors . the results also show that it significantly outperforms the current approach for generating top-k candidate corrections , making it a better first-stage filter to enable any other complex spelling-correction algorithm to have access to a better working-set of candidate corrections as well as to cover splitting and concatenation errors , which no existing method in academic literature can correct .
