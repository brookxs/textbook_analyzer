an automatic-translation of tags for multimedia-contents using folksonomy networks this paper proposes a novel method to translate tags attached to multimedia-contents for cross-language-retrieval . the main issue in this problem is the sense disambiguation of tags given with few textual contexts . in order to solve this problem , the proposed method represents both tags and its translation-candidates as networks of co-occurring tags since a network allows richer expression of contexts than other expressions such as co-occurrence vectors . the method translates a tag by selecting the optimal one from possible candidates based on a network similarity even when neither the textual contexts nor sophisticated language-resources are available . the experiments on the mir flickr-2008 test-set show that the proposed method achieves 90.44 \ % accuracy in translating tags from english into german , which is significantly higher than the baseline methods of a frequency_based translation and a co-occurrence-based translation .
