incorporating query-difference for learning retrieval functions in information-retrieval we discuss information-retrieval-methods that aim at serving a diverse stream of user queries . we propose methods that emphasize the importance of taking into consideration of query-difference in learning effective retrieval functions . we formulate the problem as a multi-task-learning problem using a risk-minimization framework . in particular , we show how to calibrate the empirical risk to incorporate query-difference in terms of introducing nuisance parameters in the statistical-models , and we also propose an alternating-optimization method to simultaneously learn the retrieval-function and the nuisance parameters . we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods using modeling data extracted from a commercial-search-engine .
