on ranking the effectiveness of searches there is a growing interest in estimating the effectiveness of search . two approaches are typically considered : examining the search queries and examining the retrieved document-sets . in this paper , we take the latter approach . we use four measures to characterize the retrieved document-sets and estimate the quality of search . these measures are (i) the clustering tendency as measured by the cox-lewis statistic , (ii) the sensitivity to document perturbation , (iii) the sensitivity to query perturbation and (iv) the local intrinsic dimensionality . we present experimental-results for the task of ranking 200 queries according to the search-effectiveness over the trec (discs 4 and 5) dataset . our ranking of queries is compared with the ranking based on the average-precision using the kendall t statistic . the best individual estimator is the sensitivity to document perturbation and yields kendall t of 0.521 . when combined with the clustering tendency based on the cox-lewis statistic and the query perturbation measure , it results in kendall t of 0.562 which to our knowledge is the highest correlation with the average-precision reported to date .
