time drives interaction : simulating sessions in diverse searching environments real life information-retrieval takes place in sessions , where users search by iterating between various cognitive , perceptual and motor subtasks through an interactive-interface . the sessions may follow diverse strategies , which , together with the interface-characteristics , affect user effort (cost) , experience and session effectiveness . in this paper we propose a pragmatic evaluation-approach based on scenarios with explicit subtask costs . we study the limits of effectiveness of diverse interactive-searching strategies in two searching environments (the scenarios) under overall cost-constraints . this is based on a comprehensive simulation of 20 million sessions in each scenario . we analyze the effectiveness of the session strategies over time , and the properties of the most and the least effective sessions in each case . furthermore , we will also contrast the proposed evaluation-approach with the traditional one , rank_based evaluation , and show how the latter may hide essential factors that affect users ' performance and satisfaction - and gives even counter-intuitive results .
