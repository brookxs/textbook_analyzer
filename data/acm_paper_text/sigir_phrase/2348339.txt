learning hash codes for efficient content-reuse detection content-reuse is extremely common in user-generated mediums . reuse-detection serves as be the basis for many applications . however , along with the explosion of internet and continuously growing uses of user-generated mediums , the task becomes more critical and difficult . in this paper , we present a novel efficient and scalable approach to detect content-reuse . we propose a new signature-generation algorithm , which is based on learned hash-functions for words . in order to deal with tens of billions of documents , we implement the detection-approach on graphical-processing-units (gpus) . the experimental-comparison in this paper involves studies of efficiency-and-effectiveness of the proposed approach in different types of document-collections , including clueweb09 , tweets2011 , and so on . experimental-results show that the proposed approach can achieve the same detection rates with state-of-the-art systems while uses significantly less execution-time than them (from 400x to 1500x speedup) .
