removing the mismatch headache in xml-keyword-search in this demo , we study one category of query-refinement problems in the context of xml-keyword-search , where what users search for do not exist in the data while useless results are returned by the search-engine . it is a hidden but important problem . we refer to it as the mismatch problem . we propose a practical yet efficient way to detect the mismatch problem and generate helpful suggestions to users , namely mismatch detector and suggester . our approach can be viewed as a post-processing job of query-evaluation . an online xml-keyword-search engine embedding the mismatch detector and suggester has been built and is available at [1] .
