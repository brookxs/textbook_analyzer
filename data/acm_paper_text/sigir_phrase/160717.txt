murax : a robust linguistic-approach for question-answering using an on-line-encyclopedia robust linguistic methods are applied to the task of answering closed-class questions using a corpus of natural-language . the methods are illustrated in a broad domain : answering general-knowledge questions using an on-line-encyclopedia . a closed-class question is a question stated in natural-language , which assumes some definite answer typified by a noun-phrase rather than a procedural answer . the methods hypothesize noun-phrases that are likely to be the answer , and present the user with relevant text in which they are marked , focussing the user 's attention appropriately . furthermore , the sentences of matching text that are shown to the user are selected to confirm phrase relations implied by the question , rather than being selected solely on the basis of word-frequency . the corpus is accessed via an information-retrieval (ir) system that supports boolean search with proximity constraints . queries are automatically constructed from the phrasal content of the question , and passed to the ir-system to find relevant text . then the relevant text is itself analyzed ; noun-phrase hypotheses are extracted and new queries are independently made to confirm phrase relations for the various hypotheses . the methods are currently being implemented in a system called murax and although this process is not complete , it is sufficiently advanced for an interim evaluation to be presented .
