ir-nli ii : applying man-machine-interaction and artificial-intelligence conceptsto information-retrieval this paper addresses the problem of building expert interfaces to information-retrieval-systems . in particular , the problem of augmenting the capabilities of such interfaces with user-modeling features is discussed and the main benefits of this approach are outlined . the paper presents a prototype-system called ir-nli ii , devoted to model by means of artificial-intelligence techniques the human intermediary to information-retrieval-systems . the overall organization of the ir-nli ii system is presented , together with a short description of the two main modules implemented so far , namely the information-retrieval expert subsystem and the user-modeling subsystem . an example of interaction with ir-nli ii is described . perspectives and future-research directions are finally outlined .
