integrating word relationships into language-models in this paper , we propose a novel dependency language-modeling-approach for information-retrieval . the approach extends the existing language-modeling-approach by relaxing the independence-assumption . our goal is to build a language-model in which various word relationships can be integrated . in this work , we integrate two types of relationship extracted from wordnet and co-occurrence relationships respectively . the integrated model has been tested on several trec collections . the results show that our model achieves substantial and significant improvements with respect to the models without these relationships . these results clearly show the benefit of integrating word relationships into language-models for ir .
