relevance dimensions in preference-based ir-evaluation evaluation of information-retrieval (ir) systems has recently been exploring the use of preference-judgments over two search result lists . unlike the traditional method of collecting relevance-labels per single result , this method allows to consider the interaction between search-results as part of the judging criteria . for example , one result list may be preferred over another if it has a more diverse set of relevant results , covering a wider range of user-intents . in this paper , we investigate how assessors determine their preference for one list of results over another with the aim to understand the role of various relevance dimensions in preference-based evaluation . we run a series of experiments and collect preference-judgments over different relevance dimensions in side-by-side comparisons of two search result lists , as well as relevance-judgments for the individual documents . our analysis of the collected judgments reveals that preference-judgments combine multiple dimensions of relevance that go beyond the traditional notion of relevance centered on topicality . measuring performance based on single-document judgments and ndcg aligns well with topicality_based preferences , but shows misalignment with judges ' overall preferences , largely due to the diversity dimension . as a judging method , dimensional preference judging is found to lead to improved judgment quality .
