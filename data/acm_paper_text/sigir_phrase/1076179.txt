a retrospective study of probabilistic context-based-retrieval we propose a novel probabilistic-retrieval-model which weights terms according to their contexts in documents . the term-weighting function of our model is similar to the language-model and the binary independence-model . the retrospective experiments (i.e. , relevance information is present) illustrate the potential of our probabilistic context-based-retrieval where the precision at the top 30 documents is about 43 \ % for trec-6 data and 52 \ % for trec-7 data .
