mediator : an integrated-approach to information-retrieval mediator : an integrated-approach to information-retrieval the mediator is a pseudo intelligent software controller which accomplishes two ends . first , it - & - ldquo ; mediates - & - rdquo ; between an information-retrieval-system and its end-user . on the assumption that the user of such a system will have at best a minimal knowledge of the operations of computers , it hides from him the internal complexities of the system , and presents to him a simplified - & - ldquo ; abstract - & - rdquo ; of the operations of the system . the mediator allows the end-user to communicate with any application program in his own terms and to carry out operations of any degree of complexity which can be defined within those terms . secondly , the controller enables a single system to extract unified information from data-banks of both data-base-management and textual environments . the mediator is driven by a combination of hierarchically structured internal and external tables . the external tables contain a vocabulary selected by the user for his personal-communication with the system ; the internal tables contain directives which determine the appropriate path to be followed by the retrieval-system in accomplishing the user 's request .
