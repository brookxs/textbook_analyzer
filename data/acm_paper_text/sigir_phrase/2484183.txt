competition-based networks for expert-finding finding experts in question-answering platforms has important applications , such as question-routing or identification of best-answers . addressing the problem of ranking users with respect to their expertise , we propose competition-based expertise-networks (cben) , a novel community expertise network-structure based on the principle of competition among the answerers of a question . we evaluate our approach on a very-large dataset from yahoo!-answers using a variety of centrality-measures . we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art network-structures and , unlike previous methods , is able to consistly outperform simple metrics like best answer count . we also analyse question-answering forums in yahoo!-answers , and show that they can be characterised by factual or subjective information-seeking-behavior , social discussions and the conducting of polls or surveys . we find that the ability to identify experts greatly depends on the type of forum , which is directly reflected in the structural-properties of the expertise-networks .
