probabilistic factor models for web-site-recommendation due to the prevalence of personalization and information-filtering applications , modeling users ' interests on the web has become increasingly important during the past few years . in this paper , aiming at providing accurate personalized-web site recommendations for web users , we propose a novel probabilistic factor model based on dimensionality-reduction techniques . we also extend the proposed method to collective probabilistic factor modeling , which further improves model-performance by incorporating heterogeneous-data-sources . the proposed method is general , and can be applied to not only web-site recommendations , but also a wide range of web-applications , including behavioral-targeting , sponsored-search , etc. . the experimental-analysis on web-site-recommendation shows that our method outperforms other traditional recommendation approaches . moreover , the complexity-analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very-large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations .
