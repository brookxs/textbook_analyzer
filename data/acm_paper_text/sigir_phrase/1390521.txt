author-topic-evolution analysis using three-way non-negative paratucker analyzing three-way-data has attracted a lot of attention recently due to the intrinsic rich structures in real-world datasets . the paratucker model has been proposed to combine the axis capabilities of the parafac model and the structural generality of the tucker model . however , no algorithms have been developed for fitting the paratucker model . in this paper , we propose tanpt algorithm to solve the paratucker model . we apply the algorithm for temporal-relation co-clustering on author-topic-evolution . experiments on dblp datasets demonstrate its effectiveness .
