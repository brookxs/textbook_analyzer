document-clustering with universum document-clustering is a popular research-topic , which aims to partition documents into groups of similar objects (i.e. , clusters) , and has been widely used in many applications such as automatic topic extraction , document-organization and filtering . as a recently proposed concept , universum is a collection of `` non-examples '' that do not belong to any concept/cluster of interest . this paper proposes a novel document-clustering technique -- document-clustering with universum , which utilizes the universum examples to improve the clustering performance . the intuition is that the universum examples can serve as supervised information and help improve the performance of clustering , since they are known not belonging to any meaningful concepts/clusters in the target-domain . in particular , a maximum-margin-clustering method is proposed to model both target examples and universum examples for clustering . an extensive set of experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm .
