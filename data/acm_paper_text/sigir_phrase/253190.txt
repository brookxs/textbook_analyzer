improved hierarchical bit-vector compression in document-retrieval systems the concordance of an information-retrieval-system can often be stored in form of bit-maps , which are usually very sparse and should be compressed . hierarchical bit-vector compression consists of partitioning a vector v i into equi-sized blocks , constructing a new bit-vector v i +1 which points to the non-zero blocks in v i , dropping the zero-blocks of v i , and repeating the process for v i +1 . we refine the method by pruning some of the tree branches if they ultimately point to very few documents ; these document numbers are then added to an appended list which is compressed by the prefix-omission technique . the new method was thoroughly tested on the bit-maps of the responsa retrieval project , and gave a relative improvement of about 40 \ % over the conventional hierarchical compression-method .
