metrics for assessing sets of subtopics to evaluate the diversity of search-results , test-collections have been developed that identify multiple-intents for each query . intents are the different meanings or facets that should be covered in a search-results list . this means that topic development involves proposing a set of intents for each query . we propose four measurable properties of query-to-intent mappings , allowing for more principled topic development for such test-collections .
