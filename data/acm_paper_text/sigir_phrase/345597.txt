topical locality in the web most web-pages are linked to others with related-content . this idea , combined with another that says that text in , and possibly around , html anchors describe the pages to which they point , is the foundation for a usable world-wide-web . in this paper , we examine to what extent these ideas hold by empirically testing whether topical locality mirrors spatial-locality of pages on the web . in particular , we find that the likelihood of linked pages having similar textual content to be high ; the similarity of sibling pages increases when the links from the parent are close together ; titles , descriptions , and anchor-text represent at least part of the target page ; and that anchor-text may be a useful discriminator among unseen child pages . these results show the foundations necessary for the success of many web-systems , including search-engines , focused-crawlers , linkage analyzers , and intelligent-web-agents .
