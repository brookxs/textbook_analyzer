frame-sliced partitioned parallel signature-files the retrieval capabilities of the signature-file access-method have become very attractive for many data-processing applications dealing with both formatted and unformatted data . however , performance is still a problem , mainly when large files are used and fast response required . in this paper , a high-performance signature-file organization is proposed , integrating the latest developments both in storage-structure and parallel-computing architectures . it combines horizontal and vertical approaches to the signature-file fragmentation . in this way , a new , mixed decomposition scheme , particularly suitable for parallel-implementation , is achieved . the organization , based on this fragmentation scheme , is called fragmented signature-file . performance-analysis shows that this organization provides very good and relatively stable-performance , covering the full range of possible queries . for the same degree of parallelism , it outperforms any other parallel signature-file organization that has been defined so far . the proposed method also has other important advantages concerning processing of dynamic files , adaptability to the number of available processors , load-balancing , and , to some extent , fault-tolerant query-processing .
