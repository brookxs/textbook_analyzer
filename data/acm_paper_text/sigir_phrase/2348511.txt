short-text classification using very few words we propose a simple , scalable , and non-parametric approach for short-text classification . leveraging the well studied and scalable information retrieval (ir) framework , our approach mimics human labeling process for a piece of short-text . it first selects the most representative and topical-indicative words from a given short-text as query words , and then searches for a small set of labeled short-texts best matching the query words . the predicted category-label is the majority-vote of the search-results . evaluated on a collection of more than 12k web-snippets , the proposed approach achieves comparable classification-accuracy with the baseline maximum-entropy-classifier using as few as 3 query words and top-5 best matching search hits . among the four query word-selection schemes proposed and evaluated in our experiments , term-frequency together with clarity gives the best classification-accuracy .
