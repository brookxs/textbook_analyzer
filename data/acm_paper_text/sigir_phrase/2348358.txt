modeling user posting behavior on social-media user-generated-content is the basic element of social-media websites . relatively few studies have systematically analyzed the motivation to create and share content , especially from the perspective of a common user . in this paper , we perform a comprehensive analysis of user posting behavior on a popular social-media website , twitter . specifically , we assume that user-behavior is mainly influenced by three factors : breaking-news , posts from social friends and user 's intrinsic interest , and propose a mixture latent-topic model to combine all these factors . we evaluated our model on a large-scale twitter dataset from three different perspectives : the perplexity of held-out content , the performance of predicting retweets and the quality of generated latent topics . the results were encouraging , our model clearly outperformed its competitors .
