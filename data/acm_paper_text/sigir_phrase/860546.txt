optimizing term vectors for efficient and robust-filtering we describe an efficient , robust method for selecting and optimizing terms for a classification or filtering task . terms are extracted from positive examples in training-data based on several alternative term-selection algorithms , then combined additively after a simple term-score normalization step to produce a merged and ranked master term vector . the score threshold for the master vector is set via beta-gamma regulation over all the available training-data . the process avoids para-meter calibrations and protracted training . it also results in compact profiles for run-time evaluation of test (new) documents . results on trec-2002 filtering-task datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over trec-median results and rival both idealized ir-based results and optimized (and expensive) svm-based classifiers in general effectiveness .
