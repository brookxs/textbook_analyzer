fuzzy translation of cross-lingual-spelling-variants we will present a novel two-step fuzzy translation technique for cross-lingual-spelling-variants . in the first stage , transformation-rules are applied to source words to render them more similar to their target-language equivalents . the rules are generated automatically using translation dictionaries as source data . in the second stage , the intermediate forms obtained in the first stage are translated into a target-language using fuzzy-matching . the effectiveness of the technique was evaluated empirically using five source languages and english as a target-language . the target-word list contained 189 000 english words with the correct equivalents for the source words among them . the source words were translated using the two-step fuzzy translation technique , and the results were compared with those of plain fuzzy-matching_based translation . the combined-technique performed better , sometimes considerably better , than fuzzy-matching alone .
