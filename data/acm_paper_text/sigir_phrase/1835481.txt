analysis of structural-relationships for hierarchical-cluster labeling cluster label quality is crucial for browsing topic-hierarchies obtained via document-clustering . intuitively , the hierarchical-structure should influence the labeling accuracy . however , most labeling algorithms ignore such structural-properties and therefore , the impact of hierarchical-structures on the labeling accuracy is yet unclear . in our work we integrate hierarchical-information , i.e. sibling and parent-child relations , in the cluster-labeling process . we adapt standard labeling approaches , namely maximum term-frequency , jensen-shannon-divergence , chi square test , and information gain , to take use of those relationships and evaluate their impact on 4 different datasets , namely the open-directory-project , wikipedia , trec ohsumed and the clef ip european patent dataset . we show , that hierarchical-relationships can be exploited to increase labeling accuracy especially on high-level nodes .
