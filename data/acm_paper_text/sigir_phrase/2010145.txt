query-term-ranking based on search-results-overlap in this paper , we propose a method to rank and assign weights to query terms according to their impact on the topic of the query . we use search result overlap ratio (sror) to quantify the overlap of the search-results of the full query and a shorten query after removing one term . intuitively , if the overlap is small , it indicates a big topic-shift and the removed term should be discriminative and important . the sror could be used for measuring query-term importance with a search-engine automatically . by this way , learning based models could be trained based on a large number of automatically labeled instances and make predictions for future queries efficiently .
