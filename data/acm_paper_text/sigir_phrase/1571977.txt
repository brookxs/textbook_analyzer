on social-networks and collaborative-recommendation social-network-systems , like last.fm , play a significant role in web-2.0 , containing large amounts of multimedia-enriched data that are enhanced both by explicit user-provided annotations and implicit aggregated feedback describing the personal-preferences of each user . it is also a common tendency for these systems to encourage the creation of virtual-networks among their users by allowing them to establish bonds of friendship and thus provide a novel and direct medium for the exchange of data . we investigate the role of these additional relationships in developing a track recommendation-system . taking into account both the social-annotation and friendships inherent in the social-graph established among users , items and tags , we created a collaborative-recommendation system that effectively adapts to the personal-information needs of each user . we adopt the generic-framework of random-walk-with-restarts in order to provide with a more natural and efficient way to represent social-networks . in this work we collected a representative enough portion of the music social-network last.fm , capturing explicitly expressed bonds of friendship of the user as well as social-tags . we performed a series of comparison experiments between the random-walk-with-restarts model and a user-based-collaborative-filtering method using the pearson-correlation similarity . the results show that the graph-model system benefits from the additional-information embedded in social-knowledge . in addition , the graph-model outperforms the standard collaborative-filtering method .
