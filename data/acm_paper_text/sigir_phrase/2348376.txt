placing images on the world-map : a microblog-based enrichment approach estimating the geographic-location of images is a task which has received increasing attention recently . large numbers of images uploaded to platforms such as flickr do not contain gps-based latitude/longitude coordinates . obtaining such geographic-information is beneficial for a variety of applications including travelogues , visual place descriptions and personalized travel recommendations . while most works in this area only exploit an image 's textual meta-data (tags , title , etc.) to estimate at what geographic-location the image was taken , we consider an additional textual dimension : the image owner 's traces on the social-web . specifically , we hypothesize that information extracted from a person 's microblog stream (s) can be utilized to improve the accuracy with which the geographic-location of the images is estimated . in this paper , we investigate this hypothesis on the example of twitter streams and find it to be confirmed . the median error distance in kilometres decreases by up to 67 % in comparison to existing state-of-the-art . the best results are achieved when tweets that were posted up to two days before and after an image was taken are considered . moreover , we also find another type of additional-information useful : population density data .
