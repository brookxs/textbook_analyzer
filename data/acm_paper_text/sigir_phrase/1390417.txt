predicting information-seeker-satisfaction in community-question-answering question-answering communities such as naver and yahoo!-answers have emerged as popular , and often effective , means of information-seeking on the web . by posting questions for other participants to answer , information seekers can obtain specific answers to their questions . users of popular portals such as yahoo!-answers already have submitted millions of questions and received hundreds of millions of answers from other participants . however , it may also take hours -- and sometime days -- until a satisfactory answer is posted . in this paper we introduce the problem of predicting information-seeker-satisfaction in collaborative-question-answering communities , where we attempt to predict whether a question author will be satisfied with the answers submitted by the community participants . we present a general prediction-model , and develop a variety of content , structure , and community-focused features for this task . our experimental-results , obtained from a largescale evaluation over thousands of real questions and user-ratings , demonstrate the feasibility of modeling and predicting asker satisfaction . we complement our results with a thorough investigation of the interactions and information seeking patterns in question-answering communities that correlate with information-seeker-satisfaction . our models and predictions could be useful for a variety of applications such as user-intent-inference , answer-ranking , interface-design , and query-suggestion and routing .
