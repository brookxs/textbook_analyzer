taily : shard selection using the tail of score distributions search-engines can improve their efficiency by selecting only few promising shards for each query . state-of-the-art shard selection-algorithms first query a central index of sampled documents , and their effectiveness is similar to searching all shards . however , the search in the central index also hurts efficiency . additionally , we show that the effectiveness of these approaches varies substantially with the sampled documents . this paper proposes taily , a novel shard selection-algorithm that models a query 's score-distribution in each shard as a gamma-distribution and selects shards with highly scored documents in the tail of the distribution . taily estimates the parameters of score distributions based on the mean and variance of the score function 's features in the collections and shards . because taily operates on term statistics instead of document-samples , it is efficient and has deterministic effectiveness . experiments on large web collections (gov2 , clueweba and cluewebb) show that taily achieves similar effectiveness to sample-based approaches , and improves upon their efficiency by roughly 20 % in terms of used resources and response-time .
