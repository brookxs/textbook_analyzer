knowledge-representation , connectionism and conceptual retrieval knowledge-representation (kr) systems provide support for artificial-intelligence systems that reason about relationships between objects in their domains of expertise . because of their support for inference , kr systems appear to have potential to enrich the kind of retrievals that ir systems might make . ironically , however , the most useful kr systems are limited to reasoning based on a rigid notion of validity , and thus are awkward to use when relevant but inexact retrievals are desired . we have been exploring the potential of a connectionist model the boltzmann machine to overcome this limitation . we report on a number of experiments in which we use a connectionist simulator to support similarity-based-reasoning in a frame-representation . we draw some tentative , mixed conclusions on the potential for a union of kr , ir , and connectionism .
