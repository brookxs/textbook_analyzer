retrieval-models for question-and-answer archives retrieval in a question-and-answer archive involves finding good answers for a user 's question . in contrast to typical document-retrieval , a retrieval-model for this task can exploit question-similarity as well as ranking the associated answers . in this paper , we propose a retrieval-model that combines a translation-based language-model for the question part with a query likelihood-approach for the answer part . the proposed model incorporates word-to-word-translation probabilities learned through exploiting different sources-of-information . experiments show that the proposed translation_based language-model for the question part outperforms baseline methods significantly . by combining with the query likelihood language-model for the answer part , substantial additional effectiveness improvements are obtained .
