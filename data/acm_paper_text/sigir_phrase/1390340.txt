how do users find things with pubmed ? : towards automatic utility evaluation with user simulations in the context of document-retrieval in the biomedical-domain , this paper explores the complex relationship between the quality of initial query results and the overall utility of an interactive-retrieval system . we demonstrate that a content-similarity browsing tool can compensate for poor retrieval results , and that the relationship between retrieval-performance and overall utility is non-linear . arguments are advanced with user simulations , which characterize the relevance of documents that a user might encounter with different browsing strategies . with broader implications to ir , this work provides a case-study of how user simulations can be exploited as a formative tool for automatic utility evaluation . simulation-based studies provide researchers with an additional evaluation-tool to complement interactive and cranfield-style experiments .
