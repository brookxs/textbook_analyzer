a cascade ranking-model for efficient ranked-retrieval there is a fundamental tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency when designing retrieval-models for large-scale document collections . effectiveness tends to derive from sophisticated ranking-functions , such as those constructed using learning-to-rank , while efficiency gains tend to arise from improvements in query-evaluation and caching-strategies . given their inherently disjoint nature , it is difficult to jointly optimize effectiveness and efficiency in end-to-end systems . to address this problem , we formulate and develop a novel cascade ranking-model , which unlike previous approaches , can simultaneously improve both top k ranked effectiveness and retrieval-efficiency . the model constructs a cascade of increasingly complex ranking-functions that progressively prunes and refines the set of candidate documents to minimize retrieval latency and maximize result-set quality . we present a novel boosting-algorithm for learning such cascades to directly optimize the tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency . experimental-results show that our cascades are faster and return higher quality results than comparable ranking-models .
