do n't have a stemmer ? : be un + concern + ed the choice of indexing terms used to represent documents crucially determines how e ective subsequent retrieval will be . ir systems commonly use rule-based stemmers to normalize surface word forms to combat the problem of not finding documents that contain words related to query terms by inflectional or derivational-morphology . but such stemmers are not available in all languages . in this paper we explore the effectiveness of unsupervised-morphological-segmentation as an alternative to stemming using test-sets in thirteen european languages . we find that unsupervised-segmentation is significantly better than unnormalized words , in several cases by more than 20 \ % . however , rule-based stemming , if available , is better in low-complexity languages . we also compare these methods to the use of character-n-grams , finding that on average n-grams yield the best performance .
