two models of retrieval with probabilistic indexing we describe two retrieval-models for probabilistic indexing . the binary independence indexing (bii) model is a generalized version of the maron & kuhns indexing-model . in this model , the indexing weight of a descriptor in a document is an estimate of the probability of relevance of this document with respect to queries using this descriptor . the retrieval-with-probabilistic-indexing (rpi) model is suited to different kinds of probabilistic indexing . therefore we assume that each indexing-model has its own concept of ` correctness ' to which the probabilities relate . the concept of correctness is not necessarily identical with the concept of relevance , it is only required to depend on relevance . in addition to the probabilistic indexing weights , the rpi model provides the possibility of relevance-weighting of search-terms . both retrieval-models are compared in experiments , showing equally good results .
