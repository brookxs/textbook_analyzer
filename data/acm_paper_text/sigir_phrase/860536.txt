image-classification using hybrid neural networks use of semantic-content is one of the major issues which needs to be addressed for improving image-retrieval effectiveness . we present a new approach to classify images based on the combination of image-processing techniques and hybrid neural networks . multiple-keywords are assigned to an image to represent its main contents , i.e. semantic-content . images are divided into a number of regions and colour and texture-features are extracted . the first classifier , a self-organising-map (som) clusters similar images based on the extracted features . then , regions of the representative-images of these clusters were labeled and used to train the second classifier , composed of several support-vector-machines (svms) . initial experiments on the accuracy of keyword assignment for a small-vocabulary are reported .
