personalized click-shaping through lagrangian duality for online recommendation online-content recommendation aims to identify trendy articles in a continuously changing dynamic-content pool . most of existing works rely on online user feedback , notably clicks , as the objective and maximize it by showing articles with highest click-through-rates . recently , click-shaping was introduced to incorporate multiple-objectives in a constrained-optimization framework . the work showed that significant tradeoff among the competing objectives can be observed and thus it is important to consider multiple-objectives . however , the proposed click-shaping approach is segment-based and can only work with a few non-overlapping user segments . it remains a challenge of how to enable deep-personalization in click-shaping . in this paper , we tackle the challenge by proposing personalized click-shaping . the main idea is to work with the lagrangian duality formulation and explore strong convexity to connect dual and primal solutions . we show that our formulation not only allows efficient conversion from dual to primal for online personalized serving , but also enables us to solve the optimization faster by approximation . we conduct extensive experiments on a large real-data set and our experimental-results show that the personalized click-shaping can significantly outperform the segmented one , while achieving the same ability to balance competing objectives .
