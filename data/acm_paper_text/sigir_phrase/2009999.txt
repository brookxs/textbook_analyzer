ups : efficient privacy-protection in personalized-web-search in recent years , personalized-web-search (pws) has demonstrated effectiveness in improving the quality of search-service on the internet . unfortunately , the need for collecting private-information in pws has become a major barrier for its wide proliferation . we study privacy-protection in pws engines which capture personalities in user-profiles . we propose a pws framework called ups that can generalize profiles in for each query according to user-specified privacy-requirements . two predictive metrics are proposed to evaluate the privacy-breach risk and the query utility for hierarchical-user-profile . we develop two simple but effective generalization algorithms for user-profiles allowing for query-level customization using our proposed metrics . we also provide an online prediction mechanism based on query utility for deciding whether to personalize a query in ups . extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our framework .
