tscan : a novel method for topic summarization and content anatomy a topic is defined as a seminal event or activity along with all directly related events and activities . it is represented as a chronological sequence of documents by different authors published on the internet . in this paper , we define a task called topic anatomy , which summarizes and associates core parts of a topic graphically so that readers can understand the content easily . the proposed topic anatomy model , called tscan , derives the major themes of a topic from the eigenvectors of a temporal block association-matrix . then , the significant events of the themes and their summaries are extracted by examining the constitution of the eigenvectors . finally , the extracted events are associated through their temporal closeness and context-similarity to form the evolution graph of the topic . experiments based on the official tdt4 corpus demonstrate that the generated evolution graphs comprehensibly describe the storylines of topics . moreover , in terms of content-coverage and consistency , the produced summaries are superior to those of other summarization methods based on human composed reference summaries .
