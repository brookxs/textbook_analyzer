addressing cold-start in app recommendation : latent user models constructed from twitter followers as a tremendous number of mobile-applications (apps) are readily available , users have difficulty in identifying apps that are relevant to their interests . recommender-systems that depend on previous user-ratings (i.e. , collaborative-filtering , or cf) can address this problem for apps that have sufficient ratings from past users . but for apps that are newly released , cf does not have any user-ratings to base recommendations on , which leads to the cold-start-problem . in this paper , we describe a method that accounts for nascent information culled from twitter to provide relevant recommendation in such cold-start situations . we use twitter handles to access an app 's twitter account and extract the ids of their twitter-followers . we create pseudo-documents that contain the ids of twitter users interested in an app and then apply latent-dirichlet-allocation to generate latent groups . at test-time , a target user seeking recommendations is mapped to these latent groups . by using the transitive relationship of latent groups to apps , we estimate the probability of the user liking the app . we show that by incorporating information from twitter , our approach overcomes the difficulty of cold-start app recommendation and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art recommendation techniques by up to 33 % .
