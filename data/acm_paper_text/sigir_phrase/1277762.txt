towards automatic-extraction of event and place semantics from flickr tags we describe an approach for extracting semantics of tags , unstructured text-labels assigned to resources on the web , based on each tag 's usage-patterns . in particular , we focus on the problem of extracting place and event-semantics for tags that are assigned to photos on flickr , a popular photo-sharing website that supports time and location (latitude/longitude) metadata . we analyze two methods inspired by well-known burst-analysis techniques and one novel method : scale-structure identification . we evaluate the methods on a subset of flickr data , and show that our scale-structure identification-method outperforms the existing techniques . the approach and methods described in this work can be used in other domains such as geo-annotated web-pages , where text terms can be extracted and associated with usage-patterns .
