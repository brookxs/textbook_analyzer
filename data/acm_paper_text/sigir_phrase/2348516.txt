towards alias-detection without string-similarity : an active-learning_based approach entity aliases commonly exist and accurately detecting these aliases plays a vital role in various applications . in this paper , we use an active-learning-based method to detect aliases without string-similarity . to minimize the cost on pairwise-comparison , a subset-based method restricts the alias selection within a small-scale entity set . within each generated entity set , an active-learning_based logistic-regression classifier is employed to predict whether a candidate is the alias of a given entity . the experimental-results on three datasets clearly demonstrate that our proposed approach can effectively detect this kind of entity aliases .
