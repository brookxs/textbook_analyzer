toponym-resolution in text (abstract only) : which sheffield is it ? named-entity-tagging comprises the sub-tasks of identifying a text span and classifying it , but this view ignores the relationship between the entities and the world . spatial and temporal entities ground events in space-time , and this relationship is vital for applications such as question-answering and event-tracking . there is much recent work regarding the temporal-dimension (setzer and gaizauskas 2002 , mani and wilson 2000) , but no detailed study of the spatial dimension.i propose to investigate how spatial named-entities (which are often referentially ambiguous) can be automatically resolved with respect to an extensional coordinate model (toponym-resolution) . to this end , various information sources including linguistic cue patterns , co-occurrence-information , discourse/positional information , world-knowledge (such as size and population) as well as minimality heuristics (leidner et al. 2003) will be combined in a supervised-machine-learning regime.the major contributions of this research project will be a corpus of text manually annotated for spatial named-entities with their model correlates as a training and evaluation resource , a novel method to spatially ground toponyms in text and a component-based evaluation based on this new reference-corpus .
