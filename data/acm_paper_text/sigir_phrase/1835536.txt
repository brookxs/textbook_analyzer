query-similarity by projecting the query-flow graph defining a measure of similarity between queries is an interesting and difficult problem . a reliable query-similarity measure can be used in a variety of applications such as query-recommendation , query-expansion , and advertising . in this paper , we exploit the information present in query-logs in order to develop a measure of semantic-similarity between queries . our approach relies on the concept of the query-flow graph . the query-flow graph aggregates query-reformulations from many users : nodes in the graph represent queries , and two queries are connected if they are likely to appear as part of the same search-goal . our query-similarity measure is obtained by projecting the graph (or appropriate subgraphs of it) on a low-dimensional euclidean-space . our experiments show that the measure we obtain captures a notion of semantic-similarity between queries and it is useful for diversifying query recommendations .
