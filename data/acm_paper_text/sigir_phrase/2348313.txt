improving searcher models using mouse-cursor activity web-search components such as ranking and query-suggestions analyze the user-data provided in query and click-logs . while this data is easy to collect and provides information about user-behavior , it omits user-interactions with the search-engine that do not hit the server ; these logs omit search data such as users ' cursor-movements . just as clicks provide signals for relevance in search-results , cursor hovering and scrolling can be additional implicit signals . in this work , we demonstrate a technique to extend models-of-the-user 's search result examination state to infer document-relevance . we start by exploring recorded user-interactions with the search-results , both qualitatively and quantitatively . we find that cursor hovering and scrolling are signals telling us which search-results were examined , and we use these interactions to reveal latent-variables in searcher models to more accurately compute document attractiveness and satisfaction . accuracy is evaluated by computing how well our model using these parameters can predict future clicks for a particular query . we are able to improve the click predictions compared to a basic searcher model for higher ranked search-results using the additional log-data .
