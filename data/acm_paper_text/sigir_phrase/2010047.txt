energy-price-driven query-processing in multi-center web-search-engines concurrently processing thousands of web-queries , each with a response-time under a fraction of a second , necessitates maintaining and operating massive-data centers . for large-scale web search-engines , this translates into high energy consumption and a huge electric bill . this work takes the challenge to reduce the electric bill of commercial web-search-engines operating on data-centers that are geographically far apart . based on the observation that energy prices and query workloads show high spatio-temporal-variation , we propose a technique that dynamically shifts the query workload of a search-engine between its data-centers to reduce the electric bill . experiments on real-life query workloads obtained from a commercial-search-engine show that significant financial savings can be achieved by this technique .
