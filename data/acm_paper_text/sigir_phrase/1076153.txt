live visual-relevance feedback for query-formulation users browsing the-internet seem relatively satisfied with the performance of search-engines . an optimistic explanation would be the high quality of search-engines . a more pessimistic one would be that people just adapt easily to any new-technology . a third explanation is people 's ignorance about recall : as they simply do n't know what relevant documents are missed , they can hardly be expected to worry about them . and so they easily conceive the result as the best they can get . to allow the user to better assess the quality of the search-results , an algorithm was developed that computes a visual-representation of the document space in the neighborhood of the user 's query.the paper (1) outlines the algorithm , (2) shows how users can explore the neighborhood of a query , and (3) demonstrates how users can guess more judiciously whether they need to further elaborate their query to improve retrieval results .
