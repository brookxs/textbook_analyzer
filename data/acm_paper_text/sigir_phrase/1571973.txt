a classification-based approach to question-answering in discussion-boards discussion-boards and online-forums are important platforms for people to share information . users post questions or problems onto discussion-boards and rely on others to provide possible solutions and such question-related content sometimes even dominates the whole discussion-board . however , to retrieve this kind of information automatically and effectively is still a non-trivial task . in addition , the existence of other types of information (e.g. , announcements , plans , elaborations , etc.) makes it difficult to assume that every thread in a discussion-board is about a question . we consider the problems of identifying question-related threads and their potential answers as classification-tasks . experimental-results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance in both question-detection and answer-finding subtasks . we also do a careful comparison of how different types of features contribute to the final result and show that non-content features play a key role in improving overall performance . finally , we show that a ranking-scheme based on our classification-approach can yield much better performance than prior published methods .
