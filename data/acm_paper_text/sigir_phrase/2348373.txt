exploring social-influence for recommendation : a generative-model approach social friendship has been shown beneficial for item-recommendation for years . however , existing approaches mostly incorporate social friendship into recommender-systems by heuristics . in this paper , we argue that social-influence between friends can be captured quantitatively and propose a probabilistic-generative-model , called social influenced selection (sis) , to model the decision-making of item selection (e.g. , what book to buy or where to dine) . based on sis , we mine the social-influence between linked friends and the personal-preferences of users through statistical-inference . to address the challenges arising from multiple-layers of hidden factors in sis , we develop a new parameter-learning algorithm based on expectation-maximization (em) . moreover , we show that the mined social-influence and user-preferences are valuable for group-recommendation and viral-marketing . finally , we conduct a comprehensive performance-evaluation using real datasets crawled from last.fm and whrrl.com to validate our proposal . experimental-results show that social-influence captured based on our sis model is effective for enhancing both item-recommendation and group-recommendation , essential for viral-marketing , and useful for various user-analysis .
