text-classification and named-entities for new-event-detection new-event-detection is a challenging task that still offers scope for great improvement after years of effort . in this paper we show how performance on new-event-detection (ned) can be improved by the use of text-classification-techniques as well as by using named-entities in a new way . we explore modifications to the document representation in a vector space-based ned system . we also show that addressing named-entities preferentially is useful only in certain situations . a combination of all the above results in a multi-stage ned system that performs much better than baseline single-stage ned systems .
