document features predicting assessor disagreement the notion of relevance differs between assessors , thus giving rise to assessor disagreement . although assessor disagreement has been frequently observed , the factors leading to disagreement are still an open problem . in this paper we study the relationship between assessor disagreement and various topic independent factors such as readability and cohesiveness . we build a logistic-model using reading-level and other simple document features to predict assessor disagreement and rank documents by decreasing probability of disagreement . we compare the predictive-power of these document-level features with that of a meta-search feature that aggregates a document 's ranking across multiple retrieval runs . our features are shown to be on a par with the meta-search feature , without requiring a large and diverse set of retrieval runs to calculate . surprisingly , however , we find that the reading level features are negatively correlated with disagreement , suggesting that they are detecting some other aspect of document-content .
