personalized tag recommendation using graph-based-ranking on multi-type interrelated objects social-tagging is becoming increasingly popular in many web-2.0-applications where users can annotate resources (e.g. web-pages) with arbitrary keywords (i.e. tags) . a tag-recommendation module can assist users in tagging-process by suggesting relevant tags to them . it can also be directly used to expand the set of tags annotating a resource . the benefits are twofold : improving user-experience and enriching the index of resources . however , the former one is not emphasized in previous studies , though a lot of work has reported that different users may describe the same concept in different ways . we address the problem of personalized tag recommendation for text-documents . in particular , we model personalized tag recommendation as a `` query and ranking '' problem and propose a novel graph-based-ranking algorithm for interrelated multi-type objects . when a user-issues a tagging request , both the document and the user are treated as a part of the query . tags are then ranked by our graph-based-ranking algorithm which takes into consideration both relevance to the document and preference of the user . finally , the top ranked tags are presented to the user as suggestions . experiments on a large-scale tagging data-set collected from del.icio.us have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms algorithms which fail to consider the diversity of different users ' interests .
