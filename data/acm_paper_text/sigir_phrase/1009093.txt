topic-prediction based on comparative retrieval rankings a new measure , anchormap , is introduced to evaluate how close two document-retrieval rankings are to each other . it is shown that anchormap scores , when run on a set of initial ranked document lists from 8 different systems , are very highly correlated with categorization of topics as easy or hard , and separately , are highly correlated with those topics on which blind-feedback works . in another experiment , anchormap is used to compare the initial ranked document list from a single system against the ranked document list from that system after blind-feedback . again , high anchormap values are highly correlated with both topic difficulty and successful application of blind-feedback . both experiments are examples of using properties of a topic which are independent of relevance information to predict the actual performance of ir systems on the topic . initial experiments to attempt to improve retrieval-performance based upon anchormap failed ; the causes for failure are discussed .
