the use of anaphoric-resolution for document description in information-retrieval this study investigated two hypotheses concerning the use of anaphors in information-retrieval . the first hypothesis , that anaphors tend to refer to integral concepts rather than to peripheral concepts , was well supported . two samples of documents , one in psychology and the other in computer-science , were examined by subject experts who judged the centrality of phrases which were referred to anaphorically . the second hypothesis , that various term-weighting-schemes are affected differently by anaphoric-resolution , was also well supported . it was found that schemes which incorporate document-length into the calculations produce much smaller increases in term-weights for terms occurring in anaphoric resolutions than do those which do not consider document-length . it is concluded that although anaphoric-resolution has potential for better representing the aboutness of a document , care must be taken in choosing both the anaphoric classes to be resolved and the term-weighting-schemes to be used in measuring a document 's topicality .
