optimum probability-estimation based on expectations probability-estimation is important for the application of probabilistic-models as well as for any evaluation in ir . we discuss the interdependencies between parameter-estimation and other properties of probabilistic-models . then we define an optimum estimate which can be applied to various typical estimation problems in ir . a method for the computation of this estimate is described which uses expectations from empirical distributions . some experiments show the applicability of our method , whereas comparable approaches are partially based on false assumptions or yield estimates with systematic errors .
