geometric-representations for multiple-documents combining multiple documents to represent an information-object is well-known as an effective approach for many information-retrieval-tasks . for example , passages can be combined to represent a document for retrieval , document clusters are represented using combinations of the documents they contain , and feedback documents can be combined to represent a query-model . various techniques for combination have been introduced , and among them , representation-techniques based on concatenation and the arithmetic-mean are frequently used . some recent work has shown the potential of a new representation-technique using the geometric-mean . however , these studies lack a theoretical foundation explaining why the geometric-mean should have advantages for representing multiple-documents . in this paper , we show that the arithmetic-mean and the geometric-mean are approximations to the center of mass in certain geometries , and show empirically that the geometric-mean is closer to the center . through experiments with two ir tasks , we show the potential benefits for geometric-representations , including a geometry-based pseudo-relevance-feedback method that outperforms state-of-the-art techniques .
