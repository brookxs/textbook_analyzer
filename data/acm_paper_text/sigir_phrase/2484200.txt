x-ens : semantic-enrichment of web-search-results at real-time while more and more semantic data are published on the web , an important question is how typical web users can access and exploit this body-of-knowledge . although , existing interaction-paradigms in semantic-search hide the complexity behind an easy-to-use interface , they have not managed to cover common search needs . in this paper , we present x-ens (explore entities in search) , a web-search application that enhances the classical , keyword-based , web-searching with semantic-information , as a means to combine the pros of both semantic-web-standards and common web-searching . x-ens identifies entities of interest in the snippets of the top search-results which can be further exploited in a faceted interaction scheme , and thereby can help the user to limit the - often very-large - search-space to those hits that contain a particular piece of information . moreover , x-ens permits the exploration of the identified entities by exploiting semantic repositories .
