dom_based content-extraction via text-density in addition to the main-content , most web-pages also contain navigation panels , advertisements and copyright and disclaimer notices . this additional-content , which is also known as noise , is typically not related to the main subject and may hamper the performance of web-data-mining , and hence needs to be removed properly . in this paper , we present content-extraction via text-density (cetd) a fast , accurate and general method for extracting content from diverse web-pages , and using dom (document-object-model) node text-density to preserve the original structure . for this purpose , we introduce two concepts to measure the importance of nodes : text-density and composite-text-density . in order to extract content intact , we propose a technique called densitysum to replace data smoothing . the approach was evaluated with the cleaneval benchmark and with randomly selected pages from well-known websites , where various web domains and styles are tested . the average f1-scores with our method were 8.79 \ % higher than the best scores among several alternative methods .
