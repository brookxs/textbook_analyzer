blog-distillation using random-walks this paper addresses the blog-distillation problem . that is , given a user-query find the blogs most related to the query topic . we model the blogosphere as a single graph that includes extra information besides the content of the posts . by performing a random-walk on this graph we extract most relevant blogs for each query . our experiments on the trec '07 data-set show 15 \ % improvement in map and 8 \ % improvement in precision@10 over the language-modeling baseline .
