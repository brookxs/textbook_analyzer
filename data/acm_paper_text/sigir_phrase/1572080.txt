a graph-based-approach to mining multilingual word associations from wikipedia in this paper , we propose a graph-based-approach to constructing a multilingual association-dictionary from wikipedia , in which we exploit two kinds of links in wikipedia articles to associate multilingual words and concepts together in a graph . the mined association-dictionary is applied in cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) to verify its quality . we evaluate our approach on four clir data-sets and the experimental-results show that it is possible to mine a good multilingual association-dictionary from wikipedia articles .
