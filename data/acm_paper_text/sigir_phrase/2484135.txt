shame to be sham : addressing content-based grey hat search-engine-optimization we present an initial study identifying a form of content-based grey hat search-engine-optimization , in which a web-page contains both potentially relevant content and manipulated content : we call such pages sham documents , because they lie in the grey area between ` ham ' (clearly normal) and ` spam ' (clearly fake) . sham documents are often ranked artificially high in response to certain queries , but also may contain some useful information and can not be considered as absolute spam . we report a novel annotation-effort performed with the clueweb09 benchmark where pages were labeled as being spam , sham , or legitimate content . significant inter-annotator-agreement rates support the claim that there are sham documents that are highly ranked by a very effective retrieval approach , yet are not spam . we also present an initial study of predictors that may indicate whether a query is the target of shamming .
