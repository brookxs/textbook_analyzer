evaluation of access-methods to text-documents in office-systems this paper compares two different approaches for indexing archived text-documents . the first approach is based on inversion of words in the text , the second on the generation of a signature-file representing the text-content . a system reflecting the word inversion approach is compared against two systems reflecting the signature scanning approach and using , alternatively , superimposed coding and the concatenation of word signatures . performances are estimated using analytical-models of these systems . characteristics are evaluated in function of office-environment requirements . the evaluations derive from a model for estimating the statistical parameters of text archives.this work has been partially developed as part of the eec esprit project on `` mixed-mode message filing-system '' in the office-systems area .
