experimental result analysis for a generative probabilistic image-retrieval model the main conclusion from the metrics-based-evaluation of video-retrieval systems at trec 's video track is that non-interactive image-retrieval from general collections using visual-information only is not yet feasible . we show how a detailed analysis of retrieval results -- looking beyond mean-average-precision (map) scores on topical-relevance -- gives significant insight in the main problems with the visual part of the retrieval-model under study . such an analytical approach proves an important addition to standard evaluation-measures .
