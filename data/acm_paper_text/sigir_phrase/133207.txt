design of an opac database to permit different subject-searching accesses in a multi-disciplines universities library-catalogue database this paper presents searching approaches and user-interface capabilities of duo , an online public access catalogue (opac) designed to permit the users of three universities of the northeast of italy different subject-searching accesses to the co-operative multi-disciplines library-catalogue database . the co-operative catalogue database is managed by one of the software-systems developed under the italian national project for library-automation : the sbn project . since the sbn database has not been designed to be efficiently accessed for end-user searches , the duo database has been designed to avoid duplication of the sbn database data and to be usable for making efficient subjects accesses to the catalogue documents . the duo design choices are presented , in particular the main choice of designing a virtual-document that corresponds to each sbn document and that has unstructured-data usable for subject search purposes . the paper presents a new kind of user-opac dialogue that makes available to the user different search approaches and on-line dictionaries . in particular the user during the interaction with the search-tool can represent his information-needs with the support of interface capabilities that are based on retrieval path history , and words and codes on-line dictionaries . duo is the first italian opac that has been made openly available to users of universities and research institutions . for this reason , it is also the first time that opac log-data is going to be collected in italy . this work mainly intends to make a modern opac available to the users of a sbn catalogue database , but it is going to permit also to build up a knowledge on opac usage in italy .
