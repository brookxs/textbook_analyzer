spoken information-retrieval for turkish broadcast-news-speech retrieval-systems utilize automatic-speech-recognition (asr) to generate textual data for indexing . however , automatic transcriptions include errors , either because of out-of-vocabulary (oov) words or due to asr inaccuracy . in this work , we address spoken information-retrieval in turkish , a morphologically rich language where oov rates are high . we apply several techniques , such as using subword units and indexing alternative hypotheses , to cope with the oov-problem and asr inaccuracy . experiments are performed on our turkish broadcast-news (bn) corpus which also incorporates a spoken ir collection . results indicate that word-segmentation is quite useful but the efficiency of indexing alternative hypotheses depends on retrieval type .
