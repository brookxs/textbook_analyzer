on iterative intelligent medical search searching for medical-information on the web has become highly popular , but it remains a challenging task because searchers are often uncertain about their exact medical situations and unfamiliar with medical-terminology . to address this challenge , we have built an intelligent-medical-web-search-engine called imed , which uses medical-knowledge and an interactive-questionnaire to help searchers form queries . this paper focuses on imed 's iterative-search advisor , which integrates medical and linguistic-knowledge to help searchers improve search-results iteratively . such an iterative-process is common for general web-search , and especially crucial for medical-web-search , because searchers often miss desired search-results due to their limited medical-knowledge and the task 's inherent difficulty . imed 's iterative-search advisor helps the searcher in several ways . first , relevant symptoms and signs are automatically suggested based on the searcher 's description of his situation . second , instead of taking for granted the searcher 's answers to the questions , imed ranks and recommends alternative answers according to their likelihoods of being the correct answers . third , related mesh medical phrases are suggested to help the searcher refine his situation description . we demonstrate the effectiveness of imed 's iterative-search advisor by evaluating it using real medical case records and usmle medical exam-questions .
