a method of rating the credibility of news-documents on the web we propose a method to rate the credibility of news-articles using three clues : (1) commonality of the contents of articles among different news publishers ; (2) numerical agreement versus contradiction of numerical values reported in the articles ; and (3) objectivity based on subjective speculative phrases and news sources . we tested this method on news stories taken from seven different news sites on the web . the average agreement between the system-produced `` credibility '' and the manual judgments of three human assessors on the 52 sample articles was 69.1 \ % . the limitations of the current approach and future-directions are discussed .
