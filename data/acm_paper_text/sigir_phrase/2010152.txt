orientsts : spatio-temporal sequence searching in flickr nowadays , due to the increasing user-requirements of efficient and personalized-services , a perfect travel-plan is urgently needed . however , at present it is hard for people to make a personalized traveling plan . most of them follow other people 's general travel trajectory . so only after finishing their travel , do they know which scene is their favorite , which is not , and what is the perfect order of visits . in this research we propose a novel spatio-temporal sequence (sts) searching , which mainly includes two steps . firstly , we propose a novel method to detect tourist features of every scene , and its difference in different seasons . secondly , combined with personal profile and scene features , a set of interesting scenes will be chosen and each scene has a specific weight for each user . the goal of our research is to provide the traveler with the sts , which passes through as many chosen scenes as possible with the maximum-weight and the minimum distance within his travel-time . we propose a method based on topic-model to detect scene features , and provide two approximate-algorithms to mine sts : a local-optimization algorithm and a global-optimization algorithm . system evaluations have been conducted and the performance-results show the efficiency .
