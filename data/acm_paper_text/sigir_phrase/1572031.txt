where to stop reading a ranked list ? : threshold-optimization using truncated score distributions ranked-retrieval has a particular disadvantage in comparison with traditional boolean-retrieval : there is no clear cut-off-point where to stop consulting results . this is a serious problem in some setups . we investigate and further develop methods to select the rank cut-off value which optimizes a given effectiveness measure . assuming no other input than a system 's output for a query -- document scores and their distribution -- the task is essentially a score-distributional threshold-optimization problem . the recent trend in modeling-score-distributions is to use a normal-exponential mixture : normal for relevant , and exponential for non-relevant document scores . we discuss the two main theoretical problems with the current model , support incompatibility and non-convexity , and develop new models that address them . the main contributions of the paper are two truncated normal-exponential models , varying in the way the out-truncated score ranges are handled . we conduct a range of experiments using the trec 2007 and 2008 legal track data , and show that the truncated models lead to significantly better results .
