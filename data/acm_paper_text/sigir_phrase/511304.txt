elements of the randomized combinatorial-file structure a file-structure designed to provide rapid , random-access with minimum storage overhead is presented . storage-and-retrieval are achieved by direct attribute-combination-to-address-transformation thereby negating the necessity for large file dictionaries or list-pointer structures . the attribute-combination-to-address-transformation is conceptually similar to key-to-address-transformation techniques , but the transformation is not limited to operations on a single key but operates on the combination of several independent keys (or any subset of the combination) describing an item or request.a storage-and-retrieval-system utilizing the combinatorial-file structure is developed . storage-and-retrieval results derived from a simulated document library of 4000 items are presented . the new file-organization is shown to have marked value with respect to minimum storage overhead and high retrieval speed .
