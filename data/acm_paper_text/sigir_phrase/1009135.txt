evaluating content-based filters for image-and-video-retrieval this paper investigates the level of metadata accuracy required for image filters to be valuable to users . access to large digital-image and video collections is hampered by ambiguous and incomplete metadata attributed to imagery . though improvements are constantly made in the automatic-derivation of semantic-feature concepts such as indoor , outdoor , face , and cityscape , it is unclear how good these improvements should be and under what circumstances they are effective . this paper explores the relationship between metadata accuracy and effectiveness of retrieval using an amateur photo-collection , documentary video , and news-video . the accuracy of the feature-classification is varied from performance typical of automated classifications today to ideal performance taken from manually generated truth data . results establish an accuracy-threshold at which semantic-features can be useful , and empirically quantify the collection-size when filtering first shows its effectiveness .
