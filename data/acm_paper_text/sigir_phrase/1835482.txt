on the existence of obstinate results in vector-space-models the vector-space-model (vsm) is a popular and widely applied model in information-retrieval (ir) . vsm creates vector-spaces whose dimensionality is usually high (e.g. , tens of thousands of terms) . this may cause various problems , such as susceptibility to noise and difficulty in capturing the underlying semantic-structure , which are commonly recognized as different aspects of the `` curse-of-dimensionality . '' in this paper , we investigate a novel aspect of the dimensionality-curse , which is referred to as hubness and manifested by the tendency of some documents (called hubs) to be included in unexpectedly many search result lists . hubness may impact vsm considerably since hubs can become obstinate results , irrelevant to a large number of queries , thus harming the performance of an ir-system and the experience of its users . we analyze the origins of hubness , showing it is primarily a consequence of high (intrinsic) dimensionality of data , and not a result of other factors such as sparsity and skewness of the distribution of term frequencies . we describe the mechanisms through which hubness emerges by exploring the behavior of similarity-measures in high-dimensional vector-spaces . our consideration begins with the classical vsm (tf-idf term-weighting and cosine-similarity) , but the conclusions generalize to more advanced variations , such as okapi-bm25 . moreover , we explain why hubness may not be easily mitigated by dimensionality-reduction , and propose a similarity adjustment scheme that takes into account the existence of hubs . experimental-results over real-data indicate that significant improvement can be obtained through consideration of hubness .
