transductive-learning over automatically detected themes for multi-document-summarization we propose a new method for query-biased multi-document-summarization , based on sentence-extraction . the summary of multiple-documents is created in two steps . sentences are first clustered ; where each cluster corresponds to one of the main themes present in the collection . inside each theme , sentences are then ranked using a transductive learning-to-rank algorithm based on ranknet , in order to better identify those which are relevant to the query . the final summary contains the top-ranked sentences of each theme . our approach is validated on duc 2006 and duc 2007 datasets .
