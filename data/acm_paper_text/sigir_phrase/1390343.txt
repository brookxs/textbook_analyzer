an unsupervised framework for extracting and normalizing product-attributes from multiple web-sites we have developed an unsupervised framework for simultaneously extracting and normalizing attributes of products from multiple web-pages originated from different sites . our framework is designed based on a probabilistic-graphical-model that can model the page-independent content information and the page-dependent layout information of the text fragments in web-pages . one characteristic of our framework is that previously unseen attributes can be discovered from the clue contained in the layout format of the text fragments . our framework tackles both extraction and normalization tasks by jointly considering the relationship between the content and layout information . dirichlet-process prior is employed leading to another advantage that the number of discovered product-attributes is unlimited . an unsupervised inference-algorithm based on variational method is presented . the semantics of the normalized attributes can be visualized by examining the term-weights in the model . our framework can be applied to a wide range of web-mining-applications such as product matching and retrieval . we have conducted extensive experiments from four different domains consisting of over 300 web-pages from over 150 different web-sites , demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our framework .
