fuzzy temporal and spatial reasoning for intelligent-information-retrieval temporal and spatial information in text-documents is often expressed in a qualitative way . moreover , both are frequently affected by vagueness , calling for appropriate extensions of traditional frameworks for qualitative-reasoning about time and space . our research aims at defining such extensions based on fuzzy-set-theory , and applying the resulting frameworks to two important kinds of intelligent-information-retrieval , viz . temporal-question-answering and geographic-information-retrieval .
