early-precision measures : implications from the downside of blind-feedback we report the statistically significant mean impacts of blind-feedback , as implemented by 7 participants for the 2003 reliable information-access (ria) workshop , on 30 retrieval measures , including several primary recall measures not originally reported . we find that blind-feedback was detrimental to measures focused on the first relevant item even when it boosted `` early-precision '' measures such as mean precision@10, implying that the conventional reporting of ad-hoc precision needs enhancement .
