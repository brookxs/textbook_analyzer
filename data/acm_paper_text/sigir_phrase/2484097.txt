extracting query facets from search-results web-search-queries are often ambiguous or multi-faceted , which makes a simple ranked list of results inadequate . to assist information-finding for such faceted queries , we explore a technique that explicitly represents interesting facets of a query using groups of semantically related terms extracted from search-results . as an example , for the query `` baggage allowance '' , these groups might be different airlines , different flight types (domestic , international) , or different travel classes (first , business , economy) . we name these groups query facets and the terms in these groups facet terms . we develop a supervised approach based on a graphical-model to recognize query facets from the noisy candidates found . the graphical-model learns how likely a candidate-term is to be a facet term as well as how likely two terms are to be grouped together in a query-facet , and captures the dependencies between the two factors . we propose two algorithms for approximate-inference on the graphical-model since exact-inference is intractable . our evaluation combines recall and precision of the facet terms with the grouping quality . experimental-results on a sample of web-queries show that the supervised-method significantly outperforms existing approaches , which are mostly unsupervised , suggesting that query-facet extraction can be effectively learned .
