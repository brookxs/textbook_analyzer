a music-recommender based on audio-features many collaborative-music recommender-systems (cmrs) have succeeded in capturing the similarity among users or items based on ratings , however they have rarely considered about the available information from the multimedia such as genres , let alone audio-features from the media stream . such information is valuable and can be used to solve several problems in rs . in this paper , we design a cmrs based on audio-features of the multimedia-stream . in the cmrs , we provide recommendation-service by our proposed method where a clustering-technique is used to integrate the audio-features of music into the collaborative-filtering (cf) framework in hopes of achieving better performance . experiments are carried out to demonstrate that our approach is feasible .
