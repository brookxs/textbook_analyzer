a failure-analysis of the limitation of suffixing in an online-environment the interaction of suffixing algorithms and ranking-techniques in retrieval-performance , particularly in an online-environment , was investigated . three general purpose suffixing algorithms were used for retrieval on the cranfield 1400 , medlars , and cacm collections , and the results analysed with several standard evaluation-measures . an examination of the retrieval-performance using suffixing suggested two modifications to ranking-techniques : variable weighting of word variants and selective stemming depending on query-length . the experimental-data is presented , and the limitations of suffixing in an online-environment is discussed .
