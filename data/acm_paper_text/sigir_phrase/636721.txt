on the architecture of a system integrating data-base-management and information retrieval the data-model , i.e. data-structures and operations needed for a system integrating the management of formated textual data (dbmirs) are discussed . it is investigated how this data-model fits into the ansi-sparc three schema architecture for data-base-management-systems . the conclusion is that the dbmirs should be regarded to be a new external data-model . this would require only small changes to the concepts discussed so far for the conceptual and internal level . the advantages of this approach are : - the dichotomy between irs and dbms does not further exist . - the main part of the software can be used for ir systems as well as db systems . - ir research can concentrate on the problems inherent in the retrieval of texts , e.g. automatic-indexing , relevance-feedback techniques .
