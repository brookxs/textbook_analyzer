word-sense-disambiguation in information-retrieval revisited word-sense-ambiguity is recognized as having a detrimental effect on the precision of information-retrieval-systems in general and web-search systems in particular , due to the sparse nature of the queries involved . despite continued research into the application of automated word-sense-disambiguation , the question remains as to whether less than 90 \ % accurate automated word-sense-disambiguation can lead to improvements in retrieval-effectiveness . in this study we explore the development and subsequent evaluation of a statistical word-sense-disambiguation system which demonstrates increased precision from a sense_based vector-space-retrieval model over traditional tf * idf techniques .
