time-aware point-of-interest recommendation the availability of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growing location-based-social-networks (lbsns) enables many important location-aware-services to users . point-of-interest (poi) recommendation is one of such services , which is to recommend places where users have not visited before . several techniques have been recently proposed for the recommendation-service . however , no existing work has considered the temporal-information for poi recommendations in lbsns . we believe that time plays an important role in poi recommendations because most users tend to visit different places at different time in a day , eg visiting a restaurant at noon and visiting a bar at night . in this paper , we define a new problem , namely , the time-aware poi recommendation , to recommend pois for a given user at a specified time in a day . to solve the problem , we develop a collaborative-recommendation model that is able to incorporate temporal-information . moreover , based on the observation that users tend to visit nearby pois , we further enhance the recommendation-model by considering geographical-information . our experimental-results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art poi recommendation-methods substantially .
