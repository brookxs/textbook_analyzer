generating diverse katakana-variants based on phonemic mapping in japanese , it is quite common for the same word to be written in several different ways . this is especially true for katakana words which are typically used for transliterating foreign languages . this ambiguity becomes critical for automatic-processing such as information-retrieval (ir) . to tackle this problem , we propose a simple but effective approach to generating katakana-variants by considering phonemic-representation of the original language for a given word . the proposed approach is evaluated through an assessment of the variants it generates . also , the impact of the generated variants on ir is studied in comparison to an existing approach using katakana rewriting-rules .
