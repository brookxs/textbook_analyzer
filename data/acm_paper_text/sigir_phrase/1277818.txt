a music-search-engine built upon audio-based and web-based similarity-measures an approach is presented to automatically build a search-engine for large-scale music collections that can be queried through natural-language . while existing approaches depend on explicit manual annotations and meta-data assigned to the individual audio pieces , we automatically derive descriptions by making use of methods from web-retrieval and music-information-retrieval . based on the id3 tags of a collection of mp3-files , we retrieve relevant-web pages via google queries and use the contents of these pages to characterize the music pieces and represent them by term vectors . by incorporating complementary information about acous tic similarity we are able to both reduce the dimensionality of the vector-space and improve the performance of retrieval , i.e. the quality of the results . furthermore , the usage of audio-similarity allows us to also characterize audio pieces when there is no associated information found on the web .
