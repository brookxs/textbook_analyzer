tossing coins to trim long-queries verbose web-queries are often descriptive in nature where a term_based search-engine is unable to distinguish between the essential and noisy words , which can result in a drift from the user-intent . we present a randomized query-reduction technique that builds on an earlier learning-to-rank_based approach . the proposed technique randomly picks only a small set of samples , instead of the exponentially many sub-queries , thus being fast enough to be useful for web-search-engines , while still covering wide sub-query space .
