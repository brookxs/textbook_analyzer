an experimental-comparison of naive-bayesian and keyword-based anti-spam-filtering with personal e-mail messages the growing problem of unsolicited bulk e-mail , also known as spam , has generated a need for reliable anti-spam e-mail filters . filters of this type have so far been based mostly on manually constructed keyword patterns . an alternative approach has recently been proposed , whereby a naive-bayesian-classifier is trained automatically to detect spam messages . we test this approach on a large-collection of personal e-mail messages , which we make publicly available in encrypted form contributing towards standard-benchmarks . we introduce appropriate cost-sensitive measures , investigating at the same time the effect of attribute-set size , training-corpus size , lemmatization , and stop lists , issues that have not been explored in previous experiments . finally , the naive-bayesian filter is compared , in terms of performance , to a filter that uses keyword patterns , and which is part of a widely used e-mail reader .
