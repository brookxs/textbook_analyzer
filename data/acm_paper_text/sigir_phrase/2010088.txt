evaluating medical-information-retrieval this paper presents a framework for evaluating information-retrieval of medical-records . we use the blulab corpus , a large-collection of real-world de-identified medical-records . the collection has been hand coded by clinical terminologists using the icd-9 medical classification-system . the icd codes are used to devise queries and relevance-judgements for this collection . results of initial test runs using a baseline ir-system show that there is room for improvement in medical-information-retrieval . queries and relevance-judgements are made available at http://aehrc.com/med_eval
