rating-prediction using feature words extracted from customer-reviews we developed a simple method of improving the accuracy of rating-prediction using feature words extracted from customer-reviews . many rating predictors work well for a small and dense dataset of customer-reviews . however , a practical dataset tends to be large and sparse , because it often includes too many products for each customer to buy and evaluate . data-sparseness reduces prediction-accuracy . to improve accuracy , we reduced the dimension of the feature-vector using feature words extracted by analyzing the relationship between ratings and accompanying review comments instead of using ratings . we applied our method to the pranking algorithm and evaluated it on a corpus of golf course reviews supplied by a japanese e-commerce company . we found that by successfully reducing data-sparseness , our method improves prediction-accuracy as measured using rankloss .
