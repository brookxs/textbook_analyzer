a maximum-coherence-model for dictionary-based cross-language-information-retrieval one key to cross-language-information-retrieval is how to efficiently resolve the translation-ambiguity of queries given their short length . this problem is even more challenging when only bilingual-dictionaries are available , which is the focus of this paper . in the previous research of cross-language-information-retrieval using bilingual-dictionaries , the word-co-occurrence statistics is used to determine the most likely translations of queries . in this paper , we propose a novel statistical-model , named `` maximum-coherence-model '' , which estimates the translation-probabilities of query words that are consistent with the word-co-occurrence statistics . unlike the previous work , where a binary-decision is made for the selection of translations , the new model maintains the uncertainty in translating query words when their sense-ambiguity is difficult to resolve . furthermore , this new model is able to estimate translations of multiple query words simultaneously . this is in contrast to many previous approaches where translations of individual query words are determined independently . empirical-studies with trec datasets have shown that the maximum-coherence-model achieves a relative 10 \ % - 40 \ % improvement in cross-language-information-retrieval , comparing to other approaches that also use word-co-occurrence statistics for sense-disambiguation .
