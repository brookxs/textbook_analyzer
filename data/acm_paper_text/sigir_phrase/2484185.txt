studying page life patterns in dynamical web with the ever-increasing speed of content turnover on the web , it is particularly important to understand the patterns that pages ' popularity follows . this paper focuses on the dynamical part of the-web , i.e. pages that have a limited lifespan and experience a short popularity outburst within it . we classify these pages into five patterns based on how quickly they gain popularity and how quickly they lose it . we study the properties of pages that belong to each pattern and determine content topics that contain disproportionately high fractions of particular patterns . these developments are utilized to create an algorithm that approximates with reasonable accuracy the expected popularity pattern of a web-page based on its url and , if available , prior-knowledge about its domain 's topics .
