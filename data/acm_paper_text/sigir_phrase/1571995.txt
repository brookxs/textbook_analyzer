a bayesian-learning approach to promoting-diversity in ranking for biomedical-information-retrieval in this paper , we propose a bayesian-learning approach to promoting-diversity for information-retrieval in biomedicine and a re-ranking model to improve retrieval-performance in the biomedical-domain . first , the re-ranking model computes the maximum posterior-probability of the hidden property corresponding to each retrieved passage . then it iteratively groups the passages into subsets according to their properties . finally , these passages are re-ranked from the subsets as our output . there is no need for our proposed method to use any external biomedical-resource . we evaluate our bayesian-learning approach by conducting extensive experiments on the trec 2004-2007 genomics data sets . the experimental-results show the effectiveness of the proposed bayesian-learning approach for promoting-diversity in ranking for biomedical-information-retrieval on four years trec-data sets .
