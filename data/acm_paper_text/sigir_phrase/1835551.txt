pres : a score metric for evaluating recall-oriented-information-retrieval applications information-retrieval (ir) evaluation scores are generally designed to measure the effectiveness with which relevant documents are identified and retrieved . many scores have been proposed for this purpose over the years . these have primarily focused on aspects of precision-and-recall , and while these are often discussed with equal importance , in practice most attention has been given to precision focused metrics . even for recall-oriented ir tasks of growing importance , such as patent-retrieval , these precision_based scores remain the primary evaluation-measures . our study examines different evaluation-measures for a recall-oriented patent-retrieval task and demonstrates the limitations of the current scores in comparing different ir systems for this task . we introduce pres , a novel evaluation-metric for this type of application taking account of recall and the user 's search effort . the behaviour of pres is demonstrated on 48 runs from the clef-ip 2009 patent-retrieval track . a full analysis of the performance of pres shows its suitability for measuring the retrieval-effectiveness of systems from a recall focused perspective-taking into account the user 's expected search effort .
