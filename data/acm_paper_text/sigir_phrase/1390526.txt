fixed-threshold-smo for joint-constraint-learning-algorithm of structural-svm in this paper , we describe a fixed-threshold sequential minimal optimization (fsmo) for a joint-constraint-learning-algorithm of structural classification svm problems . because fsmo uses the fact that the joint-constraint formulation of structural-svm has b = 0 , fsmo breaks down the quadratic-programming (qp) problems of structural-svm into a series of smallest qp problems , each involving only one variable . by using only one variable , fsmo is advantageous in that each qp sub-problem does not need subset-selection .
