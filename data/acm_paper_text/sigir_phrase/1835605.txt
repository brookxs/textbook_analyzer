using search-session context for named-entity-recognition in query recently , the problem of named-entity-recognition in query (nerq) is attracting increasingly attention in the field of information-retrieval . however , the lack of context-information in short queries makes some classical named-entity-recognition (ner) algorithms fail . in this paper , we propose to utilize the search-session information before a query as its context to address this limitation . we propose to improve two classical ner solutions by utilizing the search-session context , which are known as conditional-random-field (crf) based solution and topic-model_based solution respectively . in both approaches , the relationship between current focused query and previous queries in the same session are used to extract novel context-aware features . experimental-results on real user-search-session data show that the nerq algorithms using search-session context performs significantly better than the algorithms using only information of the short queries .
