the wild-thing goes local suppose you are on a mobile-device with no keyboard (e.g. , a cell-phone) and you want to perform a `` near-me '' search . where is the nearest pizza ? how do you enter queries quickly ? t9 ? the wild-thing encourages users to enter patterns with implicit and explicit wild cards (regular-expressions) . the search-engine uses microsoft local live logs to find the most likely queries for a particular location . for example , 7 # 6 is short-hand for the regular-expression : / ^ [pqrs] . * [-rsb- [mno] . * / , which matches `` post office '' in many places (but `` space needle '' in seattle) . some queries are more local than others . pizza is likely everywhere , whereas `` boeing company , '' is very likely in seattle and chicago , moderately likely nearby , and somewhat likely elsewhere . smoothing is important . not every query is observed everywhere .
