modeling search-engine effectiveness for federated-search federated-search links multiple search-engines into a single , virtual search-system . most prior research of federated-search focused on selecting search-engines that have the most relevant contents , but ignored the retrieval-effectiveness of individual search-engines . this omission can cause serious problems when federating search-engines of different qualities.this paper proposes a federated-search technique that uses utility-maximization to model the retrieval-effectiveness of each search-engine in a federated-search environment . the new algorithm ranks the available resources by explicitly estimating the amount of relevant material that each resource can return , instead of the amount of relevant material that each resource contains . an extensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the new algorithm .
