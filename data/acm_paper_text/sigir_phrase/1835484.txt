social-media recommendation based on people and tags we study personalized item-recommendation within an enterprise social media application suite that includes blogs , bookmarks , communities , wikis , and shared files . recommendations are based on two of the core elements of social-media - people and tags . relationship-information among people , tags , and items , is collected and aggregated across different sources within the enterprise . based on these aggregated relationships , the system recommends items related to people and tags that are related to the user . each recommended item is accompanied by an explanation that includes the people and tags that led to its recommendation , as well as their relationships with the user and the item . we evaluated our recommender-system through an extensive user-study . results show a significantly better interest ratio for the tag-based recommender than for the people-based recommender , and an even better performance for a combined recommender . tags applied on the user by other people are found to be highly effective in representing that user 's topics of interest .
