effect of different docid orderings on dynamic-pruning retrieval-strategies document-at-a-time (daat) dynamic-pruning strategies for information-retrieval-systems such as maxscore and wand can increase querying efficiency without decreasing effectiveness . both work on posting lists sorted by ascending document identifier (docid) . the order in which docids are assigned -- and hence the order of postings in the posting lists -- is known to have a noticeable impact on posting list compression . however , the resulting impact on dynamic-pruning strategies is not well understood . in this poster , we examine the impact on the efficiency of these strategies across different docid orderings , by experimenting using the trec clueweb09 corpus . we find that while the number of postings scored by dynamic-pruning strategies do not markedly vary for different docid orderings , the ordering still has a marked impact on mean query response-time . moreover , when docids are assigned by lexicographical url ordering , the benefit to response-time for is more pronounced for wand than for maxscore .
