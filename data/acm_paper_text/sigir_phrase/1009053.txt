a nonparametric hierarchical bayesian framework for information-filtering information-filtering has made considerable progress in recent years . the predominant approaches are content-based methods and collaborative methods . researchers have largely concentrated on either of the two approaches since a principled unifying framework is still lacking . this paper suggests that both approaches can be combined under a hierarchical bayesian framework . individual content-based user profiles are generated and collaboration between various user-models is achieved via a common learned prior-distribution . however , it turns out that a parametric distribution (e.g. gaussian) is too restrictive to describe such a common learned prior-distribution . we thus introduce a nonparametric common-prior , which is a sample generated from a dirichlet-process which assumes the role of a hyper prior . we describe effective means to learn this nonparametric distribution , and apply it to learn users ' information-needs . the resultant algorithm is simple and understandable , and offers a principled solution to combine content-based-filtering and collaborative-filtering . within our framework , we are now able to interpret various existing techniques from a unifying point-of-view . finally we demonstrate the empirical success of the proposed information-filtering methods .
