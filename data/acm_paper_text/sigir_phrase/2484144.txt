what can pictures tell us about web-pages ? : improving document-search using images traditional web-search-engines do not use the images in the html pages to find relevant documents for a given query . instead , they typically operate by computing a measure of agreement between the keywords provided by the user and only the text portion of each page . in this paper we study whether the content of the pictures appearing in a web-page can be used to enrich the semantic description of an html-document and consequently boost the performance of a keyword-based-search engine . we present a web-scalable system that exploits a pure text-based-search engine to find an initial set of candidate documents for a given query . then , the candidate-set is reranked using semantic-information extracted from the images contained in the pages . the resulting system retains the computational-efficiency of traditional text-based-search engines with only a small additional storage-cost needed to encode the visual-information . we test our approach on the trec 2009 million-query-track , where we show that our use of visual-content yields improvement in accuracies for two distinct text-based-search engines , including the system with the best reported performance on this benchmark .
