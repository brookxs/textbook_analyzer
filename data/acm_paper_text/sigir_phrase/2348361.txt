cognos : crowdsourcing search for topic experts in microblogs finding topic experts on microblogging sites with millions of users , such as twitter , is a hard and challenging problem . in this paper , we propose and investigate a new methodology for discovering topic experts in the popular twitter social-network . our methodology relies on the wisdom of the twitter crowds -- it leverages twitter lists , which are often carefully curated by individual users to include experts on topics that interest them and whose meta-data (list names and descriptions) provides valuable semantic cues to the experts ' domain of expertise . we mined list information to build cognos , a system for finding topic experts in twitter . detailed experimental-evaluation based on a real-world-deployment shows that : (a) cognos infers a user 's expertise more accurately and comprehensively than state-of-the-art systems that rely on the user 's bio or tweet content , (b) cognos scales well due to built-in mechanisms to efficiently update its experts ' database with new-users , and (c) despite relying only on a single feature , namely crowdsourced lists , cognos yields results comparable to , if not better than , those given by the official twitter experts search-engine for a wide range of queries in user-tests . our study highlights lists as a potentially valuable source of information for future content or expert-search systems in twitter .
