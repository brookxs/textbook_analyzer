a repetition_based measure for verification of text-collections and for text-categorization we suggest a way for locating duplicates and plagiarisms in a text-collection using an r-measure , which is the normalized-sum of the lengths of all suffixes of the text repeated in other documents of the collection . the r-measure can be effectively computed using the suffix-array data-structure . additionally , the computation procedure can be improved to locate the sets of duplicate or plagiarised documents . we applied the technique to several standard text-collections and found that they contained a significant number of duplicate and plagiarised documents . another reformulation of the method leads to an algorithm that can be applied to supervised multi-class categorization . we illustrate the approach using the recently available reuters-corpus volume 1 (rcv1) . the results show that the method outperforms svm at multi-class-categorization , and interestingly , that results correlate strongly with compression-based methods .
