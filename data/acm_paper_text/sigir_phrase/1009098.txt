answer models for question-answering passage-retrieval answer patterns have been shown to improve the perfor-mance of open-domain factoid qa-systems . their use , however , requires either constructing the patterns manually or developing algorithms for learning them automatically . we present here a simpler approach that extends the techniques of language-modeling to create answer models . these are language-models trained on the correct answers to training questions . we show how they fit naturally into a probabilis-tic model for answer-passage-retrieval and demonstrate their effectiveness on the trec 2002 qa corpus .
