adaptive near-duplicate-detection via similarity-learning in this paper , we present a novel near-duplicate-document-detection method that can easily be tuned for a particular domain . our method represents each document as a real-valued sparse k - gram vector , where the weights are learned to optimize for a specified similarity-function , such as the cosine-similarity or the jaccard-coefficient . near-duplicate-documents can be reliably detected through this improved similarity-measure . in addition , these vectors can be mapped to a small number of hash-values as document-signatures through the locality-sensitive-hashing scheme for efficient similarity-computation . we demonstrate our approach in two target domains : web-news-articles and email-messages . our method is not only more accurate than the commonly used methods such as shingles and i-match , but also shows consistent improvement across the domains , which is a desired property lacked by existing methods .
