building an information-retrieval test-collection for spontaneous-conversational-speech test-collections model use-cases in ways that facilitate evaluation of information-retrieval-systems . this paper describes the use of search-guided-relevance assessment to create a test-collection for retrieval of spontaneous-conversational-speech . approximately 10,000 thematically coherent segments were manually identified in 625 hours of oral-history interviews with 246 individuals . automatic-speech-recognition results , manually prepared summaries , controlled-vocabulary-indexing , and name-authority-control are available for every segment . those features were leveraged by a team of four relevance assessors to identify topically relevant segments for 28 topics developed from actual user requests . search-guided assessment yielded sufficient inter-annotator-agreement to support formative-evaluation during system-development . baseline results for ranked-retrieval are presented to illustrate use of the collection .
