a study of the dirichlet-priors for term-frequency-normalisation in information-retrieval (ir) , the dirichlet-priors have been applied to the smoothing-technique of the language-modeling-approach . in this paper , we apply the dirichlet-priors to the term-frequency-normalisation of the classical bm25 probabilistic-model and the divergence-from-randomness pl2 model . the contributions of this paper are twofold . first , through extensive experiments on four trec collections , we show that the newly generated models , to which the dirichlet-priors normalisation is applied , provide robust and effective performance . second , we propose a novel theoretically-driven approach to the automatic-parameter-tuning of the dirichlet-priors normalisation . experiments show that this tuning approach optimises the retrieval-performance of the newly generated dirichlet priors-based weighting models .
