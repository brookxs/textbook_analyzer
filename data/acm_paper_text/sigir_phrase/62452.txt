linear-structure in information-retrieval based on the concept of user-preference , we investigate the linear-structure in information-retrieval . we also discuss a practical procedure to determine the linear decision function and present an analysis of term-weighting . our experimental-results seem to demonstrate that our model provides a useful framework for the design of an adaptive-system .
