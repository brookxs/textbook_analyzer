want a coffee ? : predicting users ' trails twitter and foursquare are two well-connected platforms for sharing information where growing numbers of users post location-related messages . in contrast to the longitude-latitude geotags commonly used online , e.g. , on photos and tweets , new place-tags containing category-information show more human-readable high-level information rather than a pair of coordinates . this grants an opportunity for better understanding users ' physical locations which can be used as context to facilitate other applications , e.g. , location context-aware advertisement . in this paper , we verify the assumption that users ' current trails contain cues of their future routes . the results from the preliminary experiments show promising performance of a basic markov chain-based model .
