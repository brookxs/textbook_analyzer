recsys for distributed-events : investigating the influence of recommendations on visitor plans distributed-events are collections of events taking place within a small-area over the same time period and relating to a single topic . there are often a large number of events on offer and the times in which they can be visited are heavily constrained , therefore the task of choosing events to visit and in which order can be very difficult . in this work we investigate how visitors can be assisted by means of a recommender-system via 2 large-scale naturalistic-studies (n = 860 and n = 1047) . we show that a recommender-system can influence users to select events that result in tighter and more compact routes , thus allowing users to spend less time travelling and more time visiting events .
