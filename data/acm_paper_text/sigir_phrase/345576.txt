bridging the lexical chasm : statistical-approaches to answer-finding this paper investigates whether a machine can automatically learn the task of finding , within a large-collection of candidate responses , the answers to questions . the learning-process consists of inspecting a collection of answered questions and characterizing the relation between question-and-answer with a statistical model . for the purpose of learning this relation , we propose two sources of data : usenet faq documents and customer-service call-center dialogues from a large retail company . we will show that the task of answer-finding differs from both document-retrieval and tradition question-answering , presenting challenges different from those found in these problems . the central aim of this work is to discover , through theoretical and empirical investigation , those statistical-techniques best suited to the answer-finding problem .
