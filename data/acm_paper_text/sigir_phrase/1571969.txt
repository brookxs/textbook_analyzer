compressing term positions in web indexes large search-engines process thousands of queries per second on billions of pages , making query-processing a major factor in their operating costs . this has led to a lot of research on how to improve query throughput , using techniques such as massive-parallelism , caching , early-termination , and inverted-index-compression . we focus on techniques for compressing term positions in web-search-engine indexes . most previous work has focused on compressing docid and frequency data , or position information in other types of text-collections . compression of term positions in web-pages is complicated by the fact that term occurrences tend to cluster within documents but not across document boundaries , making it harder to exploit clustering effects . also , typical access-patterns for position data are different from those for docid and frequency data . we perform a detailed study of a number of existing and new techniques for compressing position data in web indexes . we also study how to efficiently access position data for ranking-functions that take proximity features into account .
