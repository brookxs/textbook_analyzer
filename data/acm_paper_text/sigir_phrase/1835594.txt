query-quality : user-ratings and system predictions numerous studies have examined the ability of query-performance-prediction methods to estimate a query 's quality for system effectiveness-measures (such as average-precision) . however , little work has explored the relationship between these methods and user-ratings of query-quality . in this poster , we report the findings from an empirical-study conducted on the trec clueweb09 corpus , where we compared and contrasted user-ratings of query-quality against a range of query-performance-prediction methods . given a set of queries , it is shown that user-ratings of query-quality correlate to both system effectiveness-measures and a number of pre-retrieval predictors .
