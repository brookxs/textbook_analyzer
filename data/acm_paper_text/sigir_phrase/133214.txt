scatter/gather : a cluster-based approach to browsing large document collections document-clustering has not been well received as an information-retrieval tool . objections to its use fall into two main categories : first , that clustering is too slow for large-corpora (with running-time often quadratic in the number of documents) ; and second , that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval . we argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search-techniques . however , looking at clustering as an information-access tool in its own right obviates these objections , and provides a powerful new access paradigm . we present a document-browsing technique that employs document-clustering as its primary-operation . we also present fast (linear-time) clustering-algorithms which support this interactive-browsing paradigm .
