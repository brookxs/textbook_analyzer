detecting quilted web-pages at scale web-based advertising and electronic-commerce , combined with the key role of search-engines in driving visitors to ad-monetized and e-commerce web-sites , has given rise to the phenomenon of web-spam : web-pages that are of little value to visitors , but that are created mainly to mislead search-engines into driving traffic to target web-sites . a large fraction of spam web-pages is automatically generated , and some portion of these pages is generated by stitching together parts (sentences or paragraphs) of other web-pages . this paper presents a scalable-algorithm for detecting such `` quilted '' web-pages . previous work by the author and his collaborators introduced a sampling-based algorithm that was capable of detecting some , but by far not all quilted web-pages in a collection . by contrast , the algorithm presented in this work identifies all quilted web-pages , and it is scalable to very-large-corpora . we tested the algorithm on the half-billion page english-language subset of the clueweb09 collection , and evaluated its effectiveness in detecting web-spam by manually inspecting small samples of the detected quilted pages . this manual inspection guided us in iteratively refining the algorithm to be more efficient in detecting real-world spam .
