improved query-performance-prediction using standard-deviation query-performance-prediction (qpp) is an important task in information-retrieval (ir) . in this paper , we (1) develop a new predictor based on the standard-deviation of scores in a variable-length ranked list , and (2) we show that this new predictor outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without the need for tuning .
