babel : a base for an experimental library this report discusses the implementation of a knowledge-base for a library information system . it is done using a typed logic-programming-language login where type-inheritance is built in . the knowledge-base is structured in a hierarchical-taxonomy of library object-classes where each class is represented in a frame style knowledge-structure and inherits the properties of its parents , and where infrastructural inference-rules have been established through typed horn-clauses . also in this document , some programming-techniques aimed at using the power of inheritance as taxonomic inference are discussed .
