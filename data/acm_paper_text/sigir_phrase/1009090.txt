learning patterns to answer open-domain questions on the web while being successful in providing keyword based access to web-pages , commercial search portals still lack the ability to answer questions expressed in a natural-language . we present a probabilistic-approach to automated-question-answering on the web , based on trainable patterns , answer triangulation and semantic-filtering . in contrast to the other `` shallow '' approaches , our approach is entirely self-learning . it does not require any manually created scoring and filtering-rules while still performing comparably . it also performs better than other fully trainable approaches .
