extraction of open-domain class-attributes from text : building-blocks for faceted-search knowledge automatically extracted from text captures instances , classes of instances and relations among them . in particular , the acquisition of class-attributes (e.g. , `` top speed '' , `` body style '' and `` number of cylinders '' for the class of `` sports cars '') from text is a particularly appealing task and has received much attention recently , given its natural fit as a building-block towards the far-reaching goal of constructing knowledge-bases from text . this tutorial provides an overview of extraction methods developed in the area of web-based information extraction , with the purpose of acquiring attributes of open-domain classes . the attributes are extracted for classes organized either as a flat set or hierarchically . the extraction methods operate over unstructured or semi-structured text available within collections of web-documents , or over relatively more intriguing data sources consisting of anonymized search queries . the methods take advantage of weak-supervision provided in the form of seed examples or small amounts of annotated data , or draw upon knowledge already encoded within human-compiled resources (e.g. , wikipedia) . the more ambitious methods , aiming at acquiring as many accurate attributes from text as possible for hundreds or thousands of classes covering a wide range of domains of interest , need to be designed to scale to web collections . this restriction has significant consequences on the overall complexity and choice of underlying tools , in order for the extracted attributes to ultimately aid information-retrieval in general and web-search in particular , by producing relevant attributes for open-domain classes , along with other types of relations among instances or among classes .
