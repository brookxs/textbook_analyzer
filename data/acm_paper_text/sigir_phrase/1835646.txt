query-log-analysis in the context of information-retrieval for children in this paper we analyze queries and sessions intended to satisfy children 's information-needs using a large-scale query-log . the aim of this analysis is twofold : i) to identify differences between such queries and sessions , and general queries and sessions ; ii) to enhance the query-log by including annotations of queries , sessions , and actions for future-research on information-retrieval for children . we found statistically significant differences between the set of general purpose and queries seeking for content intended for children . we show that our findings are consistent with previous studies on the physical behavior of children using web-search-engines .
