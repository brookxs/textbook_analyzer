the dynamic homefinder : evaluating dynamic-queries in a real-estate information-exploration system we designed , implemented , and evaluated a new concept for visualizing and searching databases utilizing direct-manipulation called dynamic-queries . dynamic-queries allow users to formulate queries by adjusting graphical widgets , such as sliders , and see the results immediately . by providing a graphical-visualization of the database and search-results , users can find trends and exceptions easily . user-testing was done with eighteen undergraduate-students who performed significantly faster using a dynamic-queries interface compared to both a natural-language-system and paper printouts . the interfaces were used to explore a real-estate database and find homes meeting specific search criteria .
