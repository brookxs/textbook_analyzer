load-balancing for term-distributed parallel retrieval large-scale web and text-retrieval-systems deal with amounts of data that greatly exceed the capacity of any single-machine . to handle the necessary data volumes and query throughput rates , parallel-systems are used , in which the document and index data are split across tightly-clustered distributed-computing-systems . the index data can be distributed either by document or by term . in this paper we examine methods for load-balancing in term-distributed parallel-architectures , and propose a suite of techniques for reducing net querying costs . in combination , the techniques we describe allow a 30 \ % improvement in query throughput when tested on an eight-node parallel-computer system .
