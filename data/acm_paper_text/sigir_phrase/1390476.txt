to tag or not to tag - : harvesting adjacent metadata in large-scale tagging-systems we present hamlet , a suite of principles , scoring models and algorithms to automatically propagate metadata along edges in a document neighborhood . as a showcase scenario we consider tag-prediction in community-based web 2.0 tagging applications . experiments using real-world-data demonstrate the viability of our approach in large-scale environments where tags are scarce . to the best of our knowledge , hamlet is the first system to promote an efficient and precise reuse of shared metadata in highly dynamic , large-scale web 2.0 tagging-systems .
