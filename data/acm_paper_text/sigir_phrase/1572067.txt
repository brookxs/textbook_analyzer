developing energy-efficient filtering systems processing large volumes of information generally requires massive amounts of computational-power , which consumes a significant amount of energy . an emerging challenge is the development of `` environmentally friendly '' systems that are not only efficient in terms of time , but also energy-efficient . in this poster , we outline our initial efforts at developing greener filtering systems by employing field-programmable-gate-arrays (fpga) to perform the core information-processing task . fpgas enable code to be executed in parallel at a chip level , while consuming only a fraction of the power of a standard (von neuman style) processor . on a number of test-collections , we demonstrate that the fpga filtering system performs 10-20 times faster than the itanium_based implementation , resulting in considerable energy-savings .
