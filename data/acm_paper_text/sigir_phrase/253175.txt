using structural-representation of anomalous states of knowledge for choosing document-retrieval strategies we report on a project which attempts to classify representations of the anomalous states of knowledge (asks) of users of document-retrieval systems on the basis of structural-characteristics of the representations , and which specifies different retrieval-strategies and ranking-mechanisms for each ask class . the classification and retrieval-strategy specification is based on 53 real problem statements , 35 of which have a total of 250 evaluated documents . four facets of the ask structures have been tentatively identified , whose combinations determine the method and order-of-application of five basic ranking strategies . this work is still in progress , so results presented here are incomplete .
