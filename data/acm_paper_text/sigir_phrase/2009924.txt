seeding simulated queries with user-study data forpersonal search-evaluation in this paper we perform a lab-based user-study (n = 21) of email-re-finding behaviour , examining how the characteristics of submitted queries change in different situations . a number of logistic-regression models are developed on the query data to explore the relationship between user - and contextual - variables and query characteristics including length , field submitted to and use of named-entities . we reveal several interesting trends and use the findings to seed a simulated evaluation of various retrieval-models . not only is this an enhancement of existing evaluation-methods for personal-search , but the results show that different models are more effective in different situations , which has implications both for the design of email-search tools and for the way algorithms for personal-search are evaluated .
