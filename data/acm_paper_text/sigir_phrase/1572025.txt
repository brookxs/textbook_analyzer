placing flickr photos on a map in this paper we investigate generic methods for placing photos uploaded to flickr on the world-map . as primary input for our methods we use the textual annotations provided by the users to predict the single most probable location where the image was taken . central to our approach is a language-model based entirely on the annotations provided by users . we define extensions to improve over the language-model using tag-based smoothing and cell-based smoothing , and leveraging spatial ambiguity . further we demonstrate how to incorporate geonames \ footnote {http://www.geonames.org visited may 2009} , a large external database of locations . for varying levels of granularity , we are able to place images on a map with at least twice the precision of the state-of-the-art reported in the literature .
