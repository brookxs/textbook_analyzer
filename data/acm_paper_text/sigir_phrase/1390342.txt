towards breaking the quality curse. : a web-querying approach to web-people-search . searching for people on the web is one of the most common query-types to the-web search-engines today . however , when a person-name is queried , the returned webpages often contain documents related to several distinct namesakes who have the queried name . the task of disambiguating and finding the webpages related to the specific person of interest is left to the user . many web-people-search (weps) approaches have been developed recently that attempt to automate this disambiguation-process . nevertheless , the disambiguation quality of these techniques leaves a major room for improvement . this paper presents a new server-side weps approach . it is based on collecting co-occurrence-information from theweb and thus it uses theweb as an external data source . a skyline-based classification-technique is developed for classifying the collected co-occurrence-information in order to make clustering decisions . the clustering technique is specifically designed to (a) handle the dominance that exists in data and (b) to adapt to a given clustering-quality measure . these properties allow the framework to get a major advantage in terms of result quality over all the latest weps techniques we are aware of , including all the 18 methods covered in the recent weps competition [2] .
