learning to estimate query-difficulty : including applications to missing content detection and distributed-information-retrieval in this article we present novel learning-methods for estimating the quality of results returned by a search-engine in response to a query . estimation is based on the agreement between the top results of the full query and the top results of its sub-queries . we demonstrate the usefulness of quality estimation for several applications , among them improvement of retrieval , detecting queries for which no relevant content exists in the document-collection , and distributed-information-retrieval . experiments on trec-data demonstrate the robustness and the effectiveness of our learning-algorithms .
