eigenrank : a ranking-oriented approach to collaborative-filtering a recommender-system must be able to suggest items that are likely to be preferred by the user . in most systems , the degree of preference is represented by a rating score . given a database of users ' past ratings on a set of items , traditional collaborative-filtering algorithms are based on predicting the potential ratings that a user would assign to the unrated items so that they can be ranked by the predicted ratings to produce a list of recommended items . in this paper , we propose a collaborative-filtering-approach that addresses the item ranking problem directly by modeling-user-preferences derived from the ratings . we measure the similarity between users based on the correlation between their rankings of the items rather than the rating values and propose new collaborative-filtering algorithms for ranking items based on the preferences of similar users . experimental-results on real-world movie rating data-sets show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional collaborative-filtering algorithms significantly on the ndcg measure for evaluating ranked results .
