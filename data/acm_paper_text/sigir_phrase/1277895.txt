improving retrieval-accuracy by weighting document types with clickthrough-data for enterprise-search , there exists a relationship between work-task and document-type that can be used to refine search-results . in this poster , we adapt the popular okapi-bm25 scoring-function to weight term-frequency based on the relevance of a document-type to a work-task . also , we use click-frequency for each task-type pair to estimate a realistic weight . using the w3c collection from the trec enterprise track for evaluations , our approach leads to significant improvements on search precision .
