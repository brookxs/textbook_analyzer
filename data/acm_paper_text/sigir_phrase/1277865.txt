combining error-correcting-output-codes and model-refinement for text-categorization in this work , we explore the use of error-correcting-output-codes (ecoc) to enhance the performance of centroid text-classifier . the framework is to decompose one multi-class problem into multiple binary-problems and then learn the individual binary-classification problems by centroid classifier . however , this kind of decomposition incurs considerable bias for centroid classifier , which results in noticeable degradation of performance . to address this issue , we use model-refinement to adjust this so-called bias .
