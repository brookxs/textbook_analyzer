agreement among statistical-significance tests for information-retrieval-evaluation at varying sample sizes research has shown that little practical difference exists between the randomization , student 's paired t , and bootstrap tests of statistical-significance for trec-ad-hoc retrieval experiments with 50 topics . we compared these three tests on runs with topic sizes down to 10 topics . we found that these tests show increasing disagreement as the number of topics decreases . at smaller numbers of topics , the randomization-test tended to produce smaller p-values than the t-test for p-values less than 0.1 . the bootstrap exhibited a systematic bias towards p-values strictly less than the t-test with this bias increasing as the number of topics decreased . we recommend the use of the randomization-test although the t-test appears to be suitable even when the number of topics is small .
