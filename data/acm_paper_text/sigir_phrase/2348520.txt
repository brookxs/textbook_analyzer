user-aware caching-and-prefetching query results in web-search-engines query results caching is an efficient technique for web-search-engines . in this paper we present user-aware cache , a novel approach tailored for query results caching , that is based on user-characteristics . we then use a trace of around 30 million queries to evaluate user-aware cache , as well as traditional methods and theoretical upper-bounds . experimental-results show that this approach can achieve hit ratios better than state-of-the-art methods .
