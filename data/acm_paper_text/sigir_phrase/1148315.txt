action-modeling : language-models that predict query behavior we present a novel language-modeling-approach to capturing the query-reformulation behavior of web-search users . based on a framework that categorizes eight different types of `` user moves '' (adding/removing query terms , etc.) , we treat search-sessions as sequence-data and build n-gram language models to capture user-behavior . we evaluated our models in a prediction-task . the results suggest that useful-patterns of activity can be extracted from user histories . furthermore , by examining prediction-performance under different order n-gram-models , we gained insight into the amount of history/context that is associated with different types of user actions . our work serves as the basis for more refined user-models .
