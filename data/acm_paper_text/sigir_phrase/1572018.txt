score adjustment for correction of pooling bias information-retrieval-systems are evaluated against test-collections of topics , documents , and assessments of which documents are relevant to which topics . documents are chosen for relevance-assessment by pooling runs from a set of existing systems . new systems can return unassessed documents , leading to an evaluation-bias against them . in this paper , we propose to estimate the degree of bias against an unpooled system , and to adjust the system 's score accordingly . bias estimation can be done via leave-one-out experiments on the existing , pooled systems , but this requires the problematic assumption that the new system is similar to the existing ones . instead , we propose that all systems , new and pooled , be fully assessed against a common set of topics , and the bias observed against the new system on the common topics be used to adjust scores on the existing topics . we demonstrate using resampling experiments on trec test-sets that our method leads to a marked reduction in error , even with only a relatively small number of common topics , and that the error decreases as the number of topics increases .
