an investigation of decompounding for cross-language patent-search decompounding has been found to improve information-retrieval (ir) effectiveness in general domains for languages such as german or dutch . we investigate if cross-language patent-retrieval can profit from decompounding . this poses two challenges : i) there may be few resources such as parallel-corpora available for training an machine-translation-system for a compounding language . ii) patents have a specific writing style and vocabulary (`` patentese '') , which may affect the performance of decompounding and translation methods . experiments on data from the clef-ip 2010 task show that decompounding patents for translation can overcome out-of-vocabulary problems (oov) and that decompounding improves ir performance significantly for small-training-corpora .
