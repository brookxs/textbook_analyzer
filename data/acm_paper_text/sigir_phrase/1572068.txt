enhancing topical-ranking with preferences from click-through-data to overcome the training-data insufficiency problem for dedicated model in topical-ranking , this paper proposes to utilize click-through-data to improve learning . the efficacy of click-through-data is explored under the framework of preference-learning . the empirical-experiment on a commercial-search-engine shows that , the model trained with the dedicated labeled-data combined with skip-next preferences could beat the baseline-model and the generic-model in ndcg5 for 4.9 \ % and 2.4 \ % respectively .
