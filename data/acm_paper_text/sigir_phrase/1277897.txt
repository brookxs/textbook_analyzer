applying ranking-svm in query-relaxation we propose an approach qrrs (query relaxative ranking-svm) that divides a ranking-function into different relaxation steps , so that only cheap features are used in ranking-svm of early steps for query-efficiency . we show search-quality in the approach is improved compared to conventional ranking-svm .
