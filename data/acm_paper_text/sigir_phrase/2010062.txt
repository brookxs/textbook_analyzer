time-based relevance-models this paper addresses blog-feed-retrieval where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant blog feeds for a given user-query . since the retrieval-unit is a blog , as a collection of posts , performing relevance-feedback techniques and selecting the most appropriate documents for query-expansion becomes challenging . by assuming time as an effective parameter on the blog posts content , we propose a time-based query-expansion method . in this method , we select terms for expansion using most relevant days for the query , as opposed to most relevant documents . this provide us with more trustable terms for expansion . our preliminary experiments on blog08 collection shows that this method can outperform state-of-the-art relevance-feedback methods in blog-retrieval .
