enhancing relevance-scoring with chronological-term-rank we introduce a new relevance-scoring technique that enhances existing relevance-scoring schemes with term-position information . this technique uses chronological-term-rank (ctr) which captures the positions of terms as they occur in the sequence of words in a document . ctr is both conceptually and computationally simple when compared to other approaches that use document-structure information , such as term-proximity , term-order and document features . ctr works well when paired with okapi-bm25 . we evaluate the performance of various combinations of ctr with okapi-bm25 in order to identify the most effective formula . we then compare the performance of the selected approach against the performance of existing methods such as okapi-bm25 , pivoted length-normalization and language-models . significant improvements are seen consistently across a variety of trec-data and topic sets , measured by the major retrieval-performance metrics . this seems to be the first use of this statistic for relevance-scoring . there is likely to be greater retrieval improvements possible using chronological-term-rank enhanced methods in future work .
