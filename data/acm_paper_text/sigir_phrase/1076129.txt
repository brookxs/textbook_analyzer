a database centric view of semantic-image-annotation and retrieval we introduce a new model for semantic-annotation and retrieval from image-databases . the new model is based on a probabilistic-formulation that poses annotation and retrieval as classification problems , and produces solutions that are optimal in the minimum probability of error sense . it is also database centric , by establishing a one-to-one-mapping between semantic-classes and the groups of database images that share the associated semantic labels . in this work we show that , under the database centric probabilistic-model , optimal annotation and retrieval can be implemented with algorithms that are conceptually simple , computationally efficient , and do not require prior semantic-segmentation of training-images . due to its simplicity , the annotation and retrieval architecture is also amenable to sophisticated parameter-tuning , a property that is exploited to investigate the role of feature-selection in the design of optimal annotation and retrieval-systems . finally , we demonstrate the benefits of simply establishing a one-to-one-mapping between keywords and the states of the semantic classification-problem over the more complex , and currently popular , joint-modeling of keyword and visual-feature distributions . the database centric probabilistic-retrieval-model is compared to existing semantic labeling and retrieval-methods , and shown to achieve higher accuracy than the previously best published results , at a fraction of their computational cost .
