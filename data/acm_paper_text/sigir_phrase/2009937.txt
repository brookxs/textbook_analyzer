scene : a scalable two-stage personalized news-recommendation-system recommending news-articles has become a promising research direction as the-internet provides fast access to real-time-information from multiple sources around the world . traditional news-recommendation systems strive to adapt their services to individual users by virtue of both user and news content information . however , the latent relationships among different news-items , and the special properties of new articles , such as short shelf lives and value of immediacy , render the previous approaches inefficient . in this paper , we propose a scalable two-stage personalized news-recommendation approach with a two-level representation , which considers the exclusive characteristics (e.g. , news content , access-patterns , named-entities , popularity and recency) of news-items when performing recommendation . also , a principled framework for news selection based on the intrinsic property of user-interest is presented , with a good balance between the novelty and diversity of the recommended result . extensive empirical experiments on a collection of news-articles obtained from various news websites demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach .
