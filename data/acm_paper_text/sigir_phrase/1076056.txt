scalable-collaborative-filtering using cluster-based smoothing memory-based approaches for collaborative-filtering identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items . in the past , the memory-based-approach has been shown to suffer from two fundamental problems : data-sparsity and difficulty in scalability . alternatively , the model-based-approach has been proposed to alleviate these problems , but this approach tends to limit the range of users . in this paper , we present a novel approach that combines the advantages of these two approaches by introducing a smoothing-based method . in our approach , clusters generated from the training-data provide the basis for data smoothing and neighborhood selection . as a result , we provide higher accuracy as well as increased efficiency in recommendations . empirical-studies on two datasets (eachmovie and movielens) show that our new proposed approach consistently outperforms other state-of-art collaborative-filtering algorithms .
