collaborative competitive filtering : learning recommender using context of user choice while a user 's preference is directly reflected in the interactive choice process between her and the recommender , this wealth of information was not fully exploited for learning recommender models . in particular , existing collaborative-filtering (cf) approaches take into account only the binary events of user actions but totally disregard the contexts in which users ' decisions are made . in this paper , we propose collaborative competitive filtering (ccf) , a framework for learning-user-preferences by modeling the choice process in recommender-systems . ccf employs a multiplicative latent-factor-model to characterize the dyadic utility-function . but unlike cf , ccf models the user-behavior of choices by encoding a local competition effect . in this way , ccf allows us to leverage dyadic-data that was previously lumped together with missing-data in existing cf models . we present two formulations and an efficient large-scale-optimization algorithm . experiments on three real-world recommendation data-sets demonstrate that ccf significantly outperforms standard cf approaches in both offline and online evaluations .
