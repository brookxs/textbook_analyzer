partitioned posting files : a parallel inverted-file structure for information-retrieval this paper describes algorithms-and-data-structures for applying a parallel-computer to information-retrieval . previous work has described an implementation based on overlap encoded signatures . that system was limited by 1) the necessity of keeping the signatures in primary-memory , and 2) the difficulties involved in implementing document-term weighting . overcoming these limitations requires adapting the inverted-index techniques used on serial machines . the most obvious adaptation , also previously described , suffers from the fact that data must be sent between processors at query-time . since interprocessor-communication is generally slower than local-computation , this suggests that an algorithm which does not perform such communication might be faster . this paper presents a data-structure , called a partitioned posting file , in which the interprocessor-communication takes place at database-construction time , so that no data-movement is needed at query-time . algorithms for constructing the data-structure are also described . performance characteristics and storage overhead are established by benchmarking against a synthetic database .
