looking inside the box : context-sensitive translation for cross-language-information-retrieval cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) today is dominated by techniques that use token-to-token mappings from bilingual-dictionaries . yet , state-of-the-art statistical-translation models (e.g. , using synchronous-context-free-grammars) are far richer , capturing multi-term phrases , term dependencies , and contextual constraints on translation choice . we present a novel clir-framework that is able to reach inside the translation `` black-box '' and exploit these sources of evidence . experiments on the trec-5 / 6 english-chinese test-collection show this approach to be promising .
