the using of inference mechanisms to improve the retrieval facilities from large relational databases this paper describes the development of intelligent-tools aimed at improving the retrieval facilities from large relational databases . when a natural-language-query does not correspond directly to the data contained in the base , a class of inferential processes called transformations is applied . the original query is thus automatically converted into one or more semantically close ones . semantically close means that the data possibly obtained with the new query will give useful information about the data originally searched for .
