detecting phrase-level duplication on the world-wide-web two years ago , we conducted a study on the evolution of web-pages over time . in the course of that study , we discovered a large number of machine-generated `` spam '' web-pages emanating from a handful of web-servers in germany . these spam web-pages were dynamically assembled by stitching together grammatically well-formed german sentences drawn from a large-collection of sentences . this discovery motivated us to develop techniques for finding other instances of such `` slice and dice '' generation of web pages , where pages are automatically generated by stitching together phrases drawn from a limited corpus . we applied these techniques to two data-sets , a set of 151 million web-pages collected in december 2002 and a set of 96 million web-pages collected in june 2004 . we found a number of other instances of large-scale phrase-level replication within the two data-sets . this paper describes the algorithms we used to discover this type of replication , and highlights the results of our data-mining .
