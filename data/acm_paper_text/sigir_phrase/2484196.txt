kernel-based-learning to rank with syntactic and semantic structures kernel-methods (kms) are powerful machine-learning-techniques that can alleviate the data-representation problem as they substitute scalar-product between feature-vectors with similarity-functions (kernels) directly defined between data instances , e.g. , syntactic-trees , (thus features are not needed any longer) . this tutorial aims at introducing essential and simplified theory of support-vector-machines and kms for the design of practical applications . it will describe effective kernels for easily engineering automatic classifiers and learning-to-rank algorithms using structured-data and semantic-processing . some examples will be drawn from question-answering , passage re-ranking , short and long text-categorization , relation-extraction , named-entity-recognition , co-reference-resolution . moreover , some practical demonstrations will be given using the svm-light-tk (tree-kernel) toolkit .
