a comparative-evaluation of different link-types on enhancing document-clustering with a growing number of works utilizing link-information in enhancing document-clustering , it becomes necessary to make a comparative-evaluation of the impacts of different link-types on document-clustering . various types of links between text-documents , including explicit-links such as citation links and hyperlinks , implicit-links such as co-authorship links , and pseudo links such as content-similarity links , convey topic similarity or topic transferring patterns , which is very useful for document-clustering . in this study , we adopt a relaxation-labeling (rl) - based clustering-algorithm , which employs both content and linkage information , to evaluate the effectiveness of the aforementioned types of links for document-clustering on eight datasets . the experimental-results show that linkage is quite effective in improving content-based document-clustering . furthermore , a series of interesting findings regarding the impacts of different link-types on document-clustering are discovered through our experiments .
