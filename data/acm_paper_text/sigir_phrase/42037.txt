an approach to image-retrieval from large-image-databases in this paper we address the problem of retrieving images from large-image-databases , giving a partial description of the image-content . this approach allows a limited automatic-analysis for image belonging to a domain described in advance to the system using a formalism based on fuzzy-sets . the image-query-processing is based on special access structures generated from the image-analysis process .
