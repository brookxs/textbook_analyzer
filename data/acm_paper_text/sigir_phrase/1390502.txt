a reranking model for genomics aspect-search in this paper , we propose a reranking model to improve the aspect-level performance in the biomedical-domain . this model iteratively computes the maximum hidden aspect for every retrieved passage and then reranks these passages from aspect subsets . the experimental-results show the improvements of the aspect-level performance up to 27.14 \ % for 2006 genomics topics and 27.09 \ % for 2007 genomics topics .
