tackling class-imbalance and data scarcity in literature-based gene-function-annotation in recent years , a number of machine-learning-approaches to literature-based gene-function-annotation have been proposed . however , due to issues such as lack of labeled-data , class-imbalance and computational cost , they have usually been unable to surpass simpler approaches based on string-matching . in this paper , we propose a principled machine-learning-approach based on kernel classifiers . we show that kernels can address the task 's inherent data scarcity by embedding additional knowledge and we propose a simple yet effective solution to deal with class-imbalance . from experiments on the trec-genomics track data , our approach achieves better f1-score than two state-of-the-art approaches based on string-matching and cross-species information .
