learning-to-rank at query-time using association-rules some applications have to present their results in the form of ranked-lists . this is the case of many information-retrieval applications , in which documents must be sorted according to their relevance to a given query . this has led the interest of the information-retrieval-community in methods that automatically learn effective ranking-functions . in this paper we propose a novel method which uncovers patterns (or rules) in the training-data associating features of the document with its relevance to the query , and then uses the discovered rules to rank documents . to address typical problems that are inherent to the utilization of association-rules (such as missing rules and rule explosion) , the proposed method generates rules on a demand-driven basis , at query-time . the result is an extremely fast and effective ranking-method . we conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using the letor benchmark collections . we show that generating rules on a demand-driven basis can boost ranking-performance , providing gains ranging from 12 \ % to 123 \ % , outperforming the state-of-the-art methods that learn-to-rank , with no need of time-consuming and laborious pre-processing . as a highlight , we also show that additional-information , such as query terms , can make the generated rules more discriminative , further improving ranking-performance .
