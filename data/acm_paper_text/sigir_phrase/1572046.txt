telling experts from spammers : expertise ranking in folksonomies with a suitable algorithm for ranking the expertise of a user in a collaborative-tagging-system , we will be able to identify experts and discover useful and relevant resources through them . we propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors . firstly , an expert should possess a high quality collection of resources , while the quality of a web-resource depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it . secondly , an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users do . we propose a graph-based-algorithm , spear (spamming-resistant expertise analysis and ranking) , which implements these ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy . we evaluate our method with experiments on data-sets collected from delicious.com comprising over 71,000 web-documents , 0.5 million users and 2 million shared bookmarks . we also show that the algorithm is more resistant to spammers than other methods such as the original hits-algorithm and simple statistical measures .
