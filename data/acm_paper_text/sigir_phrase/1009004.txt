a formal study-of-information retrieval-heuristics empirical-studies of information-retrieval-methods show that good retrieval-performance is closely related to the use of various retrieval-heuristics , such as tf-idf-weighting . one basic-research question is thus what exactly are these `` necessary '' heuristics that seem to cause good retrieval-performance . in this paper , we present a formal study of retrieval-heuristics . we formally define a set of basic desirable constraints that any reasonable retrieval-function should satisfy , and check these constraints on a variety of representative retrieval functions . we find that none of these retrieval functions satisfies all the constraints unconditionally . empirical-results show that when a constraint is not satisfied , it often indicates non-optimality of the method , and when a constraint is satisfied only for a certain range of parameter-values , its performance tends to be poor when the parameter is out of the range . in general , we find that the empirical performance of a retrieval formula is tightly related to how well it satisfies these constraints . thus the proposed constraints provide a good explanation of many empirical-observations and make it possible to evaluate any existing or new retrieval formula analytically .
