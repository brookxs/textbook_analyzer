beliefs and biases in web-search people 's beliefs , and unconscious biases that arise from those beliefs , influence their judgment , decision-making , and actions , as is commonly accepted among psychologists . biases can be observed in information-retrieval in situations where searchers seek or are presented with information that significantly deviates from the truth . there is little understanding of the impact of such biases in search . in this paper we study search-related biases via multiple probes : an exploratory retrospective survey , human labeling of the captions and results returned by a web-search-engine , and a large-scale log-analysis of search-behavior on that engine . targeting yes-no questions in the critical domain of health-search , we show that web searchers exhibit their own biases and are also subject to bias from the search-engine . we clearly observe searchers favoring positive information over negative and more than expected given base rates based on consensus-answers from physicians . we also show that search-engines strongly favor a particular , usually positive , perspective , irrespective of the truth . importantly , we show that these biases can be counterproductive and affect search outcomes ; in our study , around half of the answers that searchers settled on were actually incorrect . our findings have implications for search-engine design , including the development of ranking-algorithms that con-sider the desire to satisfy searchers (by validating their beliefs) and providing accurate answers and properly considering base rates . incorporating likelihood information into search is particularly important for consequential tasks , such as those with a medical focus .
