on scaling latent-semantic-indexing for large peer-to-peer-systems the exponential growth of data demands scalable infrastructures capable of indexing and searching rich-content such as text , music , and images . a promising direction is to combine information re-trieval with peer-to-peer-technology for scalability , fault-tolerance , and low administration cost . one pioneering work along this di-rection is psearch [32 , 33] . psearch places documents onto a peer-to - peer overlay-network according to semantic vectors produced using latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) . the search-cost for a query is reduced since documents related to the query are likely to be co-located on a small number of nodes . unfortunately , because of its reliance on lsi , psearch also inherits the limitations of lsi . (1) when the corpus is large and heterogeneous , lsi 's retrieval quality is inferior to methods such as okapi . (2) the singular-value-decomposition (svd) used in lsi is unscalable in terms of both memory-consumption and computation time.this paper addresses the above limitations of lsi and makes the following contributions . (1) to reduce the cost of svd , we reduce the size of its input matrix through document-clustering and term-selection . our method retains the retrieval quality of lsi but is several orders of magnitude more efficient . (2) through extensive experimentation , we found that proper normalization of semantic vectors for terms and documents improves recall by 76 \ % . (3) to further improve retrieval quality , we use low-dimensional subvectors of semantic vectors to cluster documents in the overlay and then use okapi to guide the search and document-selection .
