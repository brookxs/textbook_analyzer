mining query-subtopics from search-log data most queries in web-search are ambiguous and multifaceted . identifying the major senses and facets of queries from search-log data , referred to as query subtopic mining in this paper , is a very important issue in web-search . through search-log-analysis , we show that there are two interesting phenomena of user-behavior that can be leveraged to identify query-subtopics , referred to as ` one subtopic per search ' and ` subtopic clarification by keyword ' . one subtopic per search means that if a user-clicks multiple urls in one query , then the clicked urls tend to represent the same sense or facet . subtopic clarification by keyword means that users often add an additional keyword or keywords to expand the query in order to clarify their search-intent . thus , the keywords tend to be indicative of the sense or facet . we propose a clustering-algorithm that can effectively leverage the two phenomena to automatically mine the major subtopics of queries , where each subtopic is represented by a cluster containing a number of urls and keywords . the mined subtopics of queries can be used in multiple-tasks in web-search and we evaluate them in aspects of the search-result-presentation such as clustering and re-ranking . we demonstrate that our clustering-algorithm can effectively mine query-subtopics with an f1 measure in the range of 0.896-0 .956 . our experimental-results show that the use of the subtopics mined by our approach can significantly improve the state-of-the-art methods used for search-result-clustering . experimental-results based on click-data also show that the re-ranking of search result based on our method can significantly improve the efficiency of users ' ability to find information .
