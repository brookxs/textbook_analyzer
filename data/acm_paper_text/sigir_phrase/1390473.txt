ranking opinionated blog posts using opinionfinder the aim of an opinion-finding system is not just to retrieve relevant documents , but to also retrieve documents that express an opinion towards the query target entity . in this work , we propose a way to use and integrate an opinion-identification toolkit , opinionfinder , into the retrieval-process of an information-retrieval (ir) system , such that opinionated , relevant documents are retrieved in response to a query . in our experiments , we vary the number of top-ranked documents that must be parsed in response to a query , and investigate the effect on opinion-retrieval performance and required parsing time . we find that opinion-finding retrieval-performance is improved by integrating opinionfinder into the retrieval-system , and that retrieval-performance grows as more posts are parsed by opinionfinder . however , the benefit eventually tails off at a deep rank , suggesting that an optimal setting for the system has been achieved .
