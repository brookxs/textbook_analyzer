picasso - to sing , you must close your eyes and draw we study the problem of automatically assigning appropriate music pieces to a picture or , in general , series of pictures . this task , commonly referred to as soundtrack suggestion , is non-trivial as it requires a lot of human-attention and a good deal of experience , with master pieces distinguished , e.g. , with the academy award for best original score . we put forward picasso to solve this task in a fully automated way . picasso makes use of genuine samples obtained from first-class contemporary movies . hence , the training-set can be arbitrarily large and is also inexpensive to obtain but still provides an excellent source of information . at query time , picasso employs a three-level algorithm . first , it selects for a given query image a ranking of the most similar screenshots taken , and subsequently , selects for each screenshot the most similar songs to the music played in the movie when the screenshot was taken . last , it issues a top-k aggregation algorithm to find the overall best suitable songs available . we have created a large-training set consisting of over 40,000 image/soundtrack samples obtained from 28 movies and evaluated the suitability of picasso by means of a user-study .
