a novel topic-model for automatic-term-extraction automatic-term-extraction (ate) aims at extracting domain-specific terms from a corpus of a certain domain . termhood is one essential measure for judging whether a phrase is a term . previous researches on termhood mainly depend on the word-frequency information . in this paper , we propose to compute termhood based on semantic-representation of words . a novel topic-model , namely i-swb , is developed to map the domain-corpus into a latent-semantic-space , which is composed of some general topics , a background topic and a documents-specific topic . experiments on four domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ate approaches .
