diffusionrank : a possible penicillin for web spamming while the pagerank-algorithm has proven to be very effective for ranking web-pages , the rank scores of web-pages can be manipulated . to handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the web-structure , we propose a ranking-algorithm called diffusionrank . diffusionrank is motivated by the heat-diffusion phenomena , which can be connected to web-ranking because the activities flow on the-web can be imagined as heat flow , the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner , and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying web-graph . theoretically we show that diffusionrank can serve as a generalization of pagerank when the heat-diffusion co-efficient ? tends to infinity . in such a case 1 = ? = 0 , diffusionrank (pagerank) has low ability of anti-manipulation . when ? = 0 , diffusionrank obtains the highest ability of anti-manipulation , but in such a case , the-web structure is completely ignored . consequently , ? is an interesting factor that can control the balance between the ability of preserving the original web and the ability of reducing the effect of manipulation . it is found empirically that , when ? = 1 , diffusionrank has a penicillin-like effect on the link manipulation . moreover , diffusionrank can be employed to find group-to-group relations on the web , to divide the-web graph into several parts , and to find link communities . experimental-results show that the diffusionrank algorithm achieves the above mentioned advantages as expected .
