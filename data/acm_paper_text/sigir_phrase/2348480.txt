genre-classification for million song dataset using confidence-based classifiers combination we proposed a method to classify songs in the million song dataset according to song genre . since songs have several data-types , we trained sub-classifiers by different types of data . these sub-classifiers are combined using both classifier authority and classification confidence for a particular instance . in the experiments , the combined-classifier surpasses all of these sub-classifiers and the svm-classifier using concatenated vectors from all data-types . finally , the genre labels for the million song dataset are provided .
