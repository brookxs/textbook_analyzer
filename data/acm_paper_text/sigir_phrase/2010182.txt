using k-top retrieved web-snippets to date temporalimplicit queries based on web-content-analysis the world-wide-web (www) is a huge information-network from which retrieving and organizing quality relevant content remains an open-question for mostly all ambiguous-queries . as an example , many queries have temporal implicit intents associated with them but they are not inferred by search-engines . inferring the user-intentions and the period he has in mind , may therefore play an extremely important role in the improvement of the results . our work goes in this direction . we aim to introduce a temporal-analysis framework for analyzing documents in a temporal-dimension in order to identify and understand the temporal nature of any given query , namely implicit ones . our analysis is not based on metadata , but on the exploitation of temporal-information from the content itself , particularly within web-snippets , which are interesting pieces of concentrated information , where time clues , especially years , often appear . our intention is to develop a language-independent solution and to model the degree of relationship between the terms and dates identified . this is the core part of the framework and the basis for both temporal-query understanding and search-results-exploration , such as temporal-clustering . we believe that inferring this knowledge is a very important step in the process of adding a temporal-dimension to ir systems , thus disambiguating a large class of queries for which search-engines continue to fail .
