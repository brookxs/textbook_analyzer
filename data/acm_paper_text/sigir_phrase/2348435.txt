pagefetch : a retrieval game for children (and adults) children often struggle with information-retrieval-tasks as searching for information often requires a developed vocabulary and strong categorisation skills ; neither of which are particularly developed in children under the age of 12 . in a study conducted by druin et al , it was found that in an experimental-setting many children are often uninterested in searching for information online or are only interested in searching for information that is relevant to their personal interests . consequently , children who were unmotivated were the least successful in completing information-retrieval-tasks in their study . it was suggested that a more effective means of engaging child-participants in search studies must be developed in order to gain further insights into the searching behaviours of children . to this end we have developed a game called pagefetch which aims to engage children (aged 8 to 80) in completing search-tasks through a fun and interactive search-like interface .
