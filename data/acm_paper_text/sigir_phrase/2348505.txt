queries without clicks : evaluating retrieval-effectiveness based on user-feedback until recently , the lack of user-activity on search-results was perceived as a sign of user dissatisfaction from retrieval-performance . however , recent studies have reported that some queries might not be followed by clicks to the content of the retrieved results , because the search-task can be satisfied in the list of retrieved results the user-views without the need to click-through them . in this paper , we propose a method for evaluating user-satisfaction from the results of searches that are not followed by clickthrough activity to the retrieved results . we found that there is a strong association between some implicit-measures of user-activity and user 's explicit satisfaction judgments . moreover , we developed a predictive-model of user-satisfaction based on implicit-measures , achieving accuracy up to 86 % .
