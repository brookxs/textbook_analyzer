using web-graph distance for relevance-feedback in web-search we study the effect of user supplied relevance-feedback in improving web-search-results . rather than using query-refinement or document-similarity measures to rerank results , we show that the web-graph distance between two documents is a robust measure of their relative relevancy . we demonstrate how the use of this metric can improve the rankings of result urls , even when the user only rates one document in the dataset . our research suggests that such interactive-systems can significantly improve search-results .
