enhancing web-search by mining search and browse logs huge amounts of search-log data have been accumulated in various search-engines . currently , a commercial-search-engine receives billions of queries and collects tera-bytes of log-data on any single day . other than search-log data , browse logs can be collected by client-side browser plug-ins , which record the browse information if users ' permissions are granted . such massive amounts of search/browse log-data , on the one hand , provide great opportunities to mine the wisdom-of-crowds and improve web-search-results . on the other hand , designing effective and efficient methods to clean , model , and process large-scale log-data also presents great challenges . in this tutorial , we will focus on mining search and browse log-data for search-engines . we will start with an introduction of search and browse log-data and an overview of frequently-used data-summarization in log-mining . we will then elaborate how log-mining applications enhance the five major components of a search-engine , namely , query understanding , document-understanding , query-document-matching , user-understanding , and monitoring and feedbacks . for each aspect , we will survey the major tasks , fundamental principles , and state-of-the-art methods . finally , we will discuss the challenges and future trends of log-data-mining . the goal of this tutorial is to provide a systematic survey on large-scale search/browse log-mining to the ir community . it may help ir researchers to get familiar with the core challenges and promising directions in log-mining . at the same time , this tutorial may also serve the developers of web-information-retrieval systems as a comprehensive and in-depth reference to the advanced log-mining techniques .
