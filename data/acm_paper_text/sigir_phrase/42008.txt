some considerations for using approximate optimal queries an optimal query has been defined as one which will recover all the known relevant documents of a query in their best probability-of-relevance ranking . we have slightly modified the definition so that it also allows one to trace its evolution from the original to the optimal via the various feedback stages . such a query can be constructed by modifying the original query with terms from the known relevant documents . it is pointed out that such a term addition strategy differs materially from other approaches that add terms based on term association with all query terms , and calculated from the whole document-collection . the effect of viewing a document as constituted of components , and hence affecting the weighting and retreival results of of the optimal query , is also discussed .
