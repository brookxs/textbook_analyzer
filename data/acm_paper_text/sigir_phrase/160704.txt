cluster-analysis for hypertext-systems identifying nodes of information that are highly related has many applications in any information-systems , and in particular in hypertext-systems . in this paper we present a technique to identify natural clusters in a hypertext . a natural cluster is a cluster that is not arbitrary , but depends only on intrinsic properties of the hypertext . in our case , the property we will use to identify the clusters is the number of independent paths between nodes . using the graph theoretic definition of k - edge-components we present an aggregation technique to cluster the nodes . we then use this techniques to cluster three medium sized hypertexts that were developed by different authors for different users , using different methodologies . we also show how to use clustering to improve data-display , browsing and retrieval .
