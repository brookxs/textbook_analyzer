beyond session-segmentation : predicting changes in search-intent with client-side user-interactions effective search-session segmentation `` grouping queries according to common task or intent '' can be useful for improving relevance , search-evaluation , and query-suggestion . previous work has largely attempted to segment search-sessions off-line , after the fact . in contrast , we present preliminary investigation of predicting , in real-time , whether a user is about to switch interest - that is , whether the user is about to finish the current search and switch to another search-task (or stop searching altogether) . we explore an approach for this task using client-side user-behavior such as clicks , scrolls , and mouse-movements , contextualized by the content of the search result pages and previous searches . our experiments over thousands of real searches show that we can identify context and user behavior-patterns that indicate that a user is about to switch to a new search task . these preliminary results can be helpful for more effective query-suggestion and personalization .
