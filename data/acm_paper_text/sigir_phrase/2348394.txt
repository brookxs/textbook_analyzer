reactive index-replication for distributed-search-engines distributed-search-engines comprise multiple sites deployed across geographically distant regions , each site being specialized to serve the queries of local users . when a search site can not accurately compute the results of a query , it must forward the query to other sites . this paper considers the problem of selecting the documents indexed by each site focusing on replication to increase the fraction of queries processed locally . we propose rip , an algorithm for replicating documents and posting lists that is practical and has two important features . rip evaluates user-interests in an online fashion and uses only local data of a site . being an online approach simplifies the operational complexity , while locality enables higher performance when processing queries and documents . the decision-procedure , on top of being online and local , incorporates document popularity and user queries , which is critical when assuming a replication budget for each site . having a replication budget reflects the hardware constraints of any given site . we evaluate rip against the approach of replicating popular documents statically , and show that we achieve significant gains , while having the additional benefit of supporting incremental indexes .
