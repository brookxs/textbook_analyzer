a common architecture for different text-processing techniques in an information-retrieval environment the following paper gives an overview on a text-processing software called realist (retrieval aids by linguistics and statistics) which integrates different text-processing techniques into a common surface . it supports the user by offering the environment of a given term , using morphological , syntactic and statistic means . the user can call up the processing results , use it for indexing , classification or retrieval purposes and combine them as he wishes e.g. to set up a search logic . the text-processing is done on a main frame computer , the results are transferred to a minicomputer where the evaluation is performed . realist is a stand alone package , fitting any existing search systems . in the retrieval context , this technique reduces connecting time and improves the search-results . realist is able to run on english and german texts . each realist component has been separately tested with good success . an integrated version is currently under test at the us patent ad trademark office using 150000 english patent abstracts , and a german version is being tested with 12000 legal-texts of the european community .
