multi-objective-optimization in learning-to-rank supervised-learning-to-rank algorithms typically optimize for high relevance and ignore other facets of search-quality , such as freshness and diversity . prior work on multi-objective-ranking trained rankers focused on using hybrid labels that combine overall quality of documents , and implicitly incorporate multiple criteria into quantifying ranking risks . however , these hybrid scores are usually generated based on heuristics without considering potential correlations between individual facets (e.g. , freshness versus relevance) . in this poster , we empirically demonstrate that the correlation between objective facets in multi-criteria ranking optimization may significantly influence the effectiveness of trained rankers with respect to each objective .
