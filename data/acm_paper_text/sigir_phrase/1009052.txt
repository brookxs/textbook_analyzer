using bayesian priors to combine classifiers for adaptive-filtering an adaptive information filtering system monitors a document-stream to identify the documents that match information-needs specified by user-profiles . as the system filters , it also refines its knowledge about the user 's information-needs based on long-term observations of the document stream and periodic feedback (training-data) from the user . low variance profile-learning algorithms , such as rocchio , work well at the early stage of filtering when the system has very few training-data . low bias profile-learning algorithms , such as logistic-regression , work well at the later stage of filtering when the system has accumulated enough training data.however , an empirical system needs to works well consistently at all stages of filtering process . this paper addresses this problem by proposing a new technique to combine different text-classification algorithms via a constrained maximum-likelihood bayesian prior . this technique provides a trade-off between bias and variance , and the combined-classifier may achieve a consistent good performance at different stages of filtering . we implemented the proposed technique to combine two complementary classification algorithms : rocchio and logistic-regression . the new algorithm is shown to compare favorably with rocchio , logistic-regression , and the best methods in the trec-9 and trec-11 adaptive-filtering tracks .
