content-based-video-retrieval : does video 's semantic visual-feature matter ? a new shot level video-browsing method based on semantic visual-features (e.g. , car , mountain , and fire) is proposed to facilitate content-based-retrieval . the video 's binary semantic feature-vector is utilized to calculate the score of similarity between two shot keyframes . the score is then used to browse the `` similar '' keyframes in terms of semantic visual-features . a pilot user-study was conducted to better understand users ' behaviors in video-retrieval context . three video-retrieval and browsing systems are compared : temporal neighbor , semantic visual-feature , and fused browsing system . the initial results indicated that the semantic visual-feature browsing was effective and efficient for visual centric tasks , but not for non-visual centric tasks .
