a utility-theoretic ranking-method for semi-automated text-classification in semi-automated text-classification (satc) an automatic classifier f labels a set of unlabelled documents d , following which a human-annotator inspects (and corrects when appropriate) the labels attributed by f to a subset d' of d , with the aim of improving the overall quality of the labelling . an automated system can support this process by ranking the automatically labelled documents in a way that maximizes the expected increase in effectiveness that derives from inspecting d . an obvious strategy is to rank d so that the documents that f has classified with the lowest confidence are top-ranked . in this work we show that this strategy is suboptimal . we develop a new utility-theoretic ranking-method based on the notion of inspection gain , defined as the improvement in classification effectiveness that would derive by inspecting and correcting a given automatically labelled document . we also propose a new effectiveness measure for satc-oriented ranking methods , based on the expected reduction in classification-error brought about by partially inspecting a list generated by a given ranking-method . we report the results of experiments showing that , with respect to the baseline method above , and according to the proposed measure , our ranking-method can achieve substantially higher expected reductions in classification-error .
