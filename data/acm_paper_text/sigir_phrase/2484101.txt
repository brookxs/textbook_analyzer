improve collaborative-filtering through bordered block diagonal form matrices collaborative filtering-based recommendation-algorithms have achieved widespread success on the web , but little work has been performed to investigate appropriate user-item relationship structures of rating matrices . this paper presents a novel and general collaborative-filtering framework based on (approximate) bordered block diagonal form structure of user-item rating matrices . we show formally that matrices in (a) bbdf structures correspond to community-detection on the corresponding bipartite-graphs , and they reveal relationships among users and items intuitionally in recommendation tasks . by this framework , general and special interests of a user are distinguished , which helps to improve prediction-accuracy in collaborative-filtering tasks . experimental-results on four real-world datasets , including the yahoo!-music dataset , which is currently the largest , show that the proposed framework helps many traditional collaborative-filtering algorithms , such as user-based , item-based , svd and nmf approaches , to make more accurate rating predictions . moreover , by leveraging smaller and denser submatrices to make predictions , this framework contributes to the scalability of recommender-systems .
