a comparative-study on content-based music genre-classification content-based music genre-classification is a fundamental component of music-information-retrieval systems and has been gaining importance and enjoying a growing amount of attention with the emergence of digital-music on the internet . currently little work has been done on automatic music genre-classification , and in addition , the reported classification accuracies are relatively low . this paper proposes a new feature-extraction method for music-genre-classification , dwchs . dwchs stands for daubechies-wavelet coefficient histograms . dwchs capture the local and global information of music signals simultaneously by computing histograms on their daubechies-wavelet coefficients . effectiveness of this new feature and of previously studied features are compared using various machine-learning-classification algorithms , including support-vector-machines and linear-discriminant-analysis . it is demonstrated that the use of dwchs significantly improves the accuracy of music-genre-classification .
