examination and enhancement of a ring-structured graphical-search-interface based on usability-testing we evaluated the interactive-retrieval functionality of the concentric-ring-view according to a series of usability-studies . this is a ring structure-based graphical-user-interface , like a planisphere , for image-retrieval with multi-faceted metadata . attribute values for each facet are arranged on a ring , and retrieved images are displayed inside using search keys derived from the attribute values on the bottom part of the rings . by rotating the rings , users can browse retrieved images while adjusting search keys . the first usability-test conducted with thirty six participants confirmed that : (i) novice-users , even junior high school students , could use this interface ; (ii) users could find images better than anticipated ; and (iii) the interface was good at choosing the first relevant image , but users could not refine retrieval because they were unable to reuse retrieved results . to solve this problem , we added two functionalities , personal-history for reuse and relevance-feedback . with these improvements , we named the new version of the interface concentric-ring-view f + . a second usability-test with seven participants confirmed the effectiveness of this newer interface .
