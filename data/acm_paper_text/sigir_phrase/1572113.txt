a ranking approach to keyphrase-extraction this paper addresses the issue of automatically extracting keyphrases from a document . previously , this problem was formalized as classification and learning-methods for classification were utilized . this paper points out that it is more essential to cast the problem as ranking and employ a learning-to-rank method to perform the task . specifically , it employs ranking-svm , a state-of-art method of learning-to-rank , in keyphrase-extraction . experimental-results on three datasets show that ranking-svm significantly outperforms the baseline methods of svm and naive-bayes , indicating that it is better to exploit learning-to-rank techniques in keyphrase-extraction .
