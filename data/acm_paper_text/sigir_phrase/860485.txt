document-clustering based on non-negative-matrix-factorization in this paper , we propose a novel document-clustering method based on the non-negative factorization of the term-document-matrix of the given document-corpus . in the latent-semantic-space derived by the non-negative-matrix-factorization (nmf) , each axis captures the base topic of a particular document-cluster , and each document is represented as an additive combination of the base topics . the cluster membership of each document can be easily determined by finding the base topic (the axis) with which the document has the largest projection value . our experimental evaluations show that the proposed document-clustering method surpasses the latent-semantic-indexing and the spectral-clustering methods not only in the easy and reliable derivation of document-clustering results , but also in document-clustering accuracies .
