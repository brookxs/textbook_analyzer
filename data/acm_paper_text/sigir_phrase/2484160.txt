on contextual photo tag-recommendation image-tagging is a growing application on social-media websites , however , the performance of many auto-tagging methods are often poor . recent work has exploited an image 's context (e.g. time and location) in the tag-recommendation process , where tags which co-occur highly within a given time-interval or geographical area are promoted . these models , however , fail to address how and when different image contexts can be combined . in this paper , we propose a weighted tag-recommendation model , building on an existing state-of-the-art , which varies the importance of time and location in the recommendation process , based on a given set of input tags . by retrieving more temporally and geographically relevant tags , we achieve statistically significant improvements to recommendation-accuracy when testing on 519k images collected from flickr . the result of this paper is an important step towards more effective image-annotation and retrieval-systems .
