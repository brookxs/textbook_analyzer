large-scale cluster-based-retrieval experiments on turkish texts we present cluster-based-retrieval (cbr) experiments on the largest available turkish document-collection . our experiments evaluate retrieval-effectiveness and efficiency on both an automatically generated clustering structure and a manual-classification of documents . in particular , we compare cbr effectiveness with full-text-search (fs) and evaluate several implementation alternatives for cbr . our findings reveal that cbr yields comparable effectiveness figures with fs . furthermore , by using a specifically tailored cluster-skipping inverted-index we significantly improve in-memory-query-processing efficiency of cbr in comparison to other traditional cbr techniques and even fs .
