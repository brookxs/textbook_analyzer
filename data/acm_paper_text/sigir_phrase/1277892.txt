validity and power of t-test for comparing map and gmap we examine the validity and power of the t-test , wilcoxon-test , and sign test in determining whether or not the difference in performance between two ir systems is significant . empirical-tests conducted on subsets of the trec2004 robust-retrieval collection indicate that the p-values computed by these tests for the difference-in-mean average-precision (map) between two systems are very accurate fora wide range of sample sizes and significance estimates . similarly , these tests have good power , with the t-test proving superior overall . the t-test is also valid for comparing geometric-mean average-precision (gmap) , exhibiting slightly superior accuracy and slightly inferior power than for mapcomparison .
