flickr-group recommendation based on tensor-decomposition over the last few years , flickr has gained massive popularity and groups in flickr are one of the main ways for photo diffusion . however , the huge volume of groups brings troubles for users to decide which group to choose . in this paper , we propose a tensor decomposition-based group-recommendation model to suggest groups to users which can help tackle this problem . the proposed model measures the latent associations between users and groups by considering both semantic-tags and social-relations . experimental-results show the usefulness of the proposed model .
