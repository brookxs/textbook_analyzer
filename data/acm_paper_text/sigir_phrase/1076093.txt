web-based acquisition of japanese katakana-variants this paper describes a method of detecting japanese katakana-variants from a large-corpus . katakana words , which are mainly used as loanwords , cause problems with information-retrieval and so on , because transliteration creates several variations in spelling and all of these can be orthographic . previous works manually defined katakana rewrite-rules such as \ % y (be) and \ % t \ % ' (ve) being replaceable with each other , for generating variants and also defined the weight of each operation to edit one string into another to detect these variants . however , these previous researches have not been able to keep up with the ever-increasing number of loanwords and their variants . with our method proposed in this paper , the weight of each edit operation is mechanically assigned based on web-data . in experiments , it performed almost as well as one with manually determined weights . thus , the advantages of our method are : 1) need no expertise in linguistics to determine weight of each operation , and 2) able to keep up with new katakana loanwords only by collecting text-data from web and acquiring new weights of edit operations automatically . it also achieved 98.6 \ % recall and 86.3 \ % precision in the task of extracting katakana variant pairs from 38 year 's worth of corpora of japanese newspaper articles .
