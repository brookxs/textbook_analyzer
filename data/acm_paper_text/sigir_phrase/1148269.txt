a compositional context-sensitive multi-document summarizer : exploring the factors that influence summarization the usual approach for automatic-summarization is sentence-extraction , where key sentences from the input documents are selected based on a suite of features . while word-frequency often is used as a feature in summarization , its impact on system-performance has not been isolated . in this paper , we study the contribution to summarization of three factors related to frequency : content word-frequency , composition functions for estimating sentence-importance from word-frequency , and adjustment of frequency weights based on context . we carry out our analysis using datasets from the-document-understanding conferences , studying not only the impact of these features on automatic summarizers , but also their role in human-summarization . our research shows that a frequency_based summarizer can achieve performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art systems , but only with a good composition function ; context-sensitivity improves performance and significantly reduces repetition .
