tf-idf uncovered : a study of theories and probabilities interpretations of tf-idf are based on binary independence retrieval , poisson , information-theory , and language-modelling . this paper contributes a review of existing interpretations , and then , tf-idf is systematically related to the probabilities p (q | d) and p (d | q) . two approaches are explored : a space of independent , and a space of disjoint terms . for independent terms , an `` extreme '' query/non-query term assumption uncovers tf-idf , and an analogy of p (d | q) and the probabilistic odds o (r | d , q) mirrors relevance-feedback . for disjoint terms , a relationship between probability-theory and tf-idf is established through the integral + 1 / x d x = log x . this study uncovers components such as divergence-from-randomness and pivoted document-length to be inherent parts of a document-query independence (dqi) measure , and interestingly , an integral of the dqi over the term occurrence-probability leads to tf-idf .
