a browser for bibliographic-information-retrieval , based on an application of lattice-theory an application of mathematical lattice-theory , called relationship lattices , is utilized to attack problems of operational bibliographic-information-retrieval . the proposed solution offers an-interface to the information searcher enabling operation in a world of concepts , authors , and document records and their relationships . this hides the complexities of query-language and database structures , and it allows to use a personally preferred terminology and to browse , query and download document records in a convenient way . the main component of the proposed solution is a personal thesaurus built up as a relationship lattice .
