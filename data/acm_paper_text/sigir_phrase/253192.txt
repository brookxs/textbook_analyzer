text-compression using prediction in the compression of the text files , the dependencies between the successive characters should be exploited to as great an extent as possible . there are two obvious possibilities : either to detect and encode often occurring character strings , or to encode successors of character blocks . this paper presents two methods based on the latter approach . in the first method we encode only the most probable successors of blocks , whereas in the second we encode them all , using the knowledge of their distribution . the second method uses recursion to store effectively the dependencies between the characters and this results in good compression gains in practical cases .
