why do some people have more difficulty learning to use an information-retrieval-system than others ? the population using information-retrieval-systems is becoming increasingly diverse . we find a wide range of skills in ability to use these systems ; this diverse population must be accommodated by the next generation of systems . this paper reports on a study to identify variables related to information-retrieval aptitude , based on results from earlier studies of searchers and programmers . a sample of undergraduate subjects from english , psychology , and engineering majors was given a series of psychometric tests and compared to known populations . we find that engineering majors exhibit academic background and personality-characteristics most like those of skilled searchers and programmers , with contrasting patterns or no discernible patterns in english and psychology majors . the strength of most associations increases when restricted to subjects who have either stayed in one major or who have changed major only within one disciplinary area . about half the variance in choice of major can be explained by scores on the tests administered , and a comparable amount of variance in test scores can be explained by the academic background variables .
