searching xml-documents via xml-fragments most of the work on xml-query and search has stemmed from the publishing and database communities , mostly for the needs of business-applications . recently , the information-retrieval-community began investigating the xml-search issue to answer information-discovery needs . following this trend , we present here an approach where information-needs can be expressed in an approximate manner as pieces of xml-documents or `` xml-fragments '' of the same nature as the documents that are being searched . we present an extension of the vector-space-model for searching xml collections via xml-fragments and ranking results by relevance . we describe how we have extended a full-text-search engine to comply with this model . the value of the proposed method is demonstrated by the relative high precision of our system , which was among the top performers in the recent inex workshop . our results indicate that certain queries are more appropriate than others for the extended vector-space-model . specifically , queries with relatively specific contexts but vague information-needs are best situated to reap the benefit of this model . finally our results show that one method may not fit all types of queries and that it could be worthwhile to use different solutions for different applications .
