fast exact maximum-likelihood-estimation for mixture of language-models a common language modeling approach assumes the data d is generated from a mixture of several language-models . em-algorithm is usually used to find the maximum-likelihood-estimation of one unknown mixture component , given the mixture weights and the other language-models . in this paper , we provide an efficient-algorithm of o (k) complexity to find the exact solution , where k is the number of words occurred at least once in d . another merit is that the probabilities of many words are exactly zeros , which means that the mixture language model also serves as a feature-selection technique .
