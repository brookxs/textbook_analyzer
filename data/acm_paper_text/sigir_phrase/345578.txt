document-clustering using word clusters via the information-bottleneck method we present a novel implementation of the recently introduced information-bottleneck method for unsupervised document clustering . given a joint empirical distribution of words and documents , p (x , y) , we first cluster the words , y , so that the obtained word clusters , ytilde ; , maximally preserve the information on the documents . the resulting joint-distribution . p (x , ytilde ;) , contains most of the original information about the documents , i (x ; ytilde ;) & ap ; i (x ; y) , but it is much less sparse and noisy . using the same procedure we then cluster the documents , x , so that the information about the word-clusters is preserved . thus , we first find word-clusters that capture most of the mutual-information about to set of documents , and then find document clusters , that preserve the information about the word clusters . we tested this procedure over several document-collections based on subsets taken from the standard 20 newsgroups corpus . the results were assessed by calculating the correlation between the document clusters and the correct labels for these documents . finding from our experiments show that this double clustering-procedure , which uses the information-bottleneck method , yields significantly superior performance compared to other common document distributional-clustering algorithms . moreover , the double clustering-procedure improves all the distributional-clustering methods examined here .
