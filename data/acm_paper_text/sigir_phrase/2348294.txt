boosting multi-kernel locality-sensitive-hashing for scalable image-retrieval similarity-search is a key challenge for multimedia-retrieval applications where data are usually represented in high-dimensional-space . among various algorithms proposed for similarity-search in high-dimensional-space , locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) is the most popular one , which recently has been extended to kernelized locality-sensitive-hashing (klsh) by exploiting kernel similarity for better retrieval efficacy . typically , klsh works only with a single kernel , which is often limited in real-world multimedia-applications , where data may originate from multiple-resources or can be represented in several different forms . for example , in content-based-multimedia-retrieval , a variety of features can be extracted to represent contents of an image . to overcome the limitation of regular klsh , we propose a novel boosting multi-kernel locality-sensitive-hashing (bmklsh) scheme that significantly boosts the retrieval-performance of klsh by making use of multiple kernels . we conduct extensive experiments for large-scale content-based-image-retrieval , in which encouraging results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques .
