a wireless natural-language search-engine web-search using stationary (desktop) computers has become a pervasive activity . the mobile-user in need of information , however , faces several problems in his or her quest to satisfy an information-need . mobile-devices have small-displays , and mobile user-interfaces are often less then usable , because they impose the desktop web-search paradigm on the mobile-user . we present a wireless-search-engine based on natural-language queries transmitted via popular small message service (sms) text-messages . besides traditional keyword_based queries , the system can accept questions or phrases and returns responses that contain likely answers (figure 1) instead of traditional lists of hyperlinks . the additional precision gained from performing a linguistic-analysis of the query helps extracting answers from web-pages directly , which requires no navigation . the system is implemented using a nlir system residing on a server , which can translate questions or phrases into search-engine-queries or queries to soap web services , where a gateway mediates between the mobile-network and the-internet (figure 2) . whereas on the desktop keyboard-based search still prevails , we find that in a mobile-context question-answering techniques can help overcome the output constraints .
