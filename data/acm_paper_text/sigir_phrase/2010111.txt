on the suitability of diversity-metrics for learning-to-rank for diversity an optimally diverse ranking should achieve the maximum-coverage of the aspects underlying an ambiguous or underspecified query , with minimum redundancy with respect to the covered aspects . although evaluation-metrics that reward coverage and penalise redundancy provide intuitive objective-functions for learning a diverse ranking , it is unclear whether they are the most effective . in this paper , we contrast the suitability of relevance and diversity-metrics as objective-functions for learning a diverse ranking . our results in the context of the diversity task of the trec 2009 and 2010 web tracks show that diversity-metrics are not necessarily better suited for guiding a learning-approach . moreover , the suitability of these metrics is compromised as they try to penalise redundancy during the learning-process .
