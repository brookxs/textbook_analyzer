learning to efficiently rank it has been shown that learning-to-rank approaches are capable of learning highly effective ranking-functions . however , these approaches have mostly ignored the important issue of efficiency . given that both efficiency-and-effectiveness are important for real search-engines , models that are optimized for effectiveness may not meet the strict efficiency-requirements necessary to deploy in a production-environment . in this work , we present a unified-framework for jointly optimizing effectiveness and efficiency . we propose new metrics that capture the tradeoff between these two competing forces and devise a strategy for automatically learning-models that directly optimize the tradeoff metrics . experiments indicate that models learned in this way provide a good balance between retrieval-effectiveness and efficiency . with specific loss-functions , learned models converge to familiar existing ones , which demonstrates the generality of our framework . finally , we show that our approach naturally leads to a reduction in the variance of query-execution times , which is important for query load-balancing and user-satisfaction .
