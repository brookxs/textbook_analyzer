mining touch-interaction data on mobile-devices to predict web-search result relevance fine-grained search interactions in the desktop setting , such as mouse-cursor movements and scrolling , have been shown valuable for understanding user-intent , attention , and their preferences for web-search-results . as web-search on smart-phones and tablets becomes increasingly popular , previously validated desktop interaction-models have to be adapted for the available touch interactions such as pinching and swiping , and for the different device form-factors . in this paper , we present , to our knowledge , the first in-depth study of modeling interactions on touch-enabled device for improving web-search-ranking . in particular , we evaluate a variety of touch interactions on a smart-phone as implicit-relevance-feedback , and compare them with the corresponding fine-grained interactions on a desktop computer with mouse and keyboard as the primary input-devices . our experiments are based on a dataset collected from two user-studies with 56 users in total , using a specially instrumented version of a popular mobile-browser to capture the interaction data . we report a detailed analysis of the similarities and differences of fine-grained search interactions between the desktop and the smart-phone modalities , and identify novel patterns of touch interactions indicative of result relevance . finally , we demonstrate significant improvements to search-ranking quality by mining touch-interaction data .
