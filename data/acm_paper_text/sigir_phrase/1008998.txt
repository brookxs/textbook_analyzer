using temporal-profiles of queries for precision-prediction a key missing component in information-retrieval-systems is self-diagnostic tests to establish whether the system can provide reasonable results for a given query on a document-collection . if we can measure properties of a retrieved set of documents which allow us to predict average-precision , we can automate the decision of whether to elicit relevance-feedback , or modify the retrieval-system in other ways . we use meta-data attached to documents in the form of time stamps to measure the distribution of documents retrieved in response to a query , over the time-domain , to create a temporal-profile for a query . we define some useful features over this temporal-profile . we find that using these temporal-features , together with the content of the documents retrieved , we can improve the prediction of average-precision for a query .
