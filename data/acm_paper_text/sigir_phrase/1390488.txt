guide focused-crawler efficiently and effectively using on-line topical importance-estimation focused-crawling is a critical technique for topical resource-discovery on the web . we propose a new frontier prioritizing algorithm , namely , the otie (on-line topical importance-estimation) algorithm , which efficiently and effectively combines link-based and content-based-analysis to evaluate the priority of an uncrawled url in the frontier . we then demonstrate otie 's advantages over traditional prioritizing algorithms by real crawling experiments .
