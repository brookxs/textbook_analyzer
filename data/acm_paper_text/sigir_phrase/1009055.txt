automatic-image-annotation by using concept-sensitive salient-objects for image-content representation multi-level annotation of images is a promising solution to enable more effective semantic-image-retrieval by using various keywords at different semantic levels . in this paper , we propose a multi-level approach to annotate the semantics of natural-scenes by using both the dominant-image components and the relevant semantic-concepts . in contrast to the well-known image-based and region-based approaches , we use the salient-objects as the dominant-image components to achieve automatic-image-annotation at the content level . by using the salient-objects for image-content representation , a novel image-classification technique is developed to achieve automatic-image-annotation at the concept level . to detect the salient-objects automatically , a set of detection functions are learned from the labeled image regions by using support-vector-machine (svm) classifiers with an automatic scheme for searching the optimal model-parameters . to generate the semantic concepts , finite-mixture-models are used to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient-objects . an adaptive-em-algorithm has been proposed to determine the optimal model-structure and model-parameters simultaneously . we have also demonstrated that our algorithms are very effective to enable multi-level annotation of natural-scenes in a large-scale dataset .
