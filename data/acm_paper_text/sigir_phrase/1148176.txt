user-performance versus precision measures for simple search-tasks several recent studies have demonstrated that the type of improvements in information-retrieval-system effectiveness reported in forums such as sigir and trec do not translate into a benefit for users . two of the studies used an instance recall task , and a third used a question-answering-task , so perhaps it is unsurprising that the precision_based measures of ir-system effectiveness on one-shot query-evaluation do not correlate with user-performance on these tasks . in this study , we evaluate two different information-retrieval-tasks on trec web-track data : a precision-based user task , measured by the length of time that users need to find a single-document that is relevant to a trec topic ; and , a simple recall-based task , represented by the total number of relevant documents that users can identify within five minutes . users employ search-engines with controlled mean-average-precision (map) of between 55 \ % and 95 \ % . our results show that there is no significant-relationship between system effectiveness measured by map and the precision-based task . a significant , but weak relationship is present for the precision at one document returned metric . a weak relationship is present between map and the simple recall-based task .
