attack resistant collaborative-filtering the widespread deployment of recommender-systems has lead to user-feedback of varying quality . while some users faithfully express their true opinion , many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations . the presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction . even worse , malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender-system to their benefit . while previous research has attempted to study the robustness of various existing collaborative-filtering (cf) approaches , this remains an unsolved problem . approaches such as neighbor-selection algorithms , association-rules and robust matrix-factorization have produced unsatisfactory results . this work describes a new collaborative algorithm based on svd which is accurate as well as highly stable to shilling . this algorithm exploits previously established svd based shilling detection-algorithms , and combines it with svd based-cf . experimental-results show a much diminished effect of all kinds of shilling-attacks . this work also offers significant improvement over previous robust collaborative-filtering frameworks .
