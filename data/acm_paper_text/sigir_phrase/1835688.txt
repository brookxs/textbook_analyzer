user-interface-designs to support the social transfer of web-search expertise while there are many ways to develop search-expertise , i maintain that most members of the general public do so in an inefficient manner . one reason is that , with current tools , is difficult to observe experts as a means of acquiring search-expertise in a scalable fashion . this calls for a redesign of computer-mediated-communication tools to make individual search-strategies visible to other users . i present a research-agenda to investigate this claim , which draws upon theories of social-learning . i use design-based-research to build novel systems that enable imitation-based learning of search-expertise .
