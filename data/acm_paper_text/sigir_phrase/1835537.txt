the demographics of web-search how does the-web search-behavior of `` rich '' and `` poor '' people differ ? do men and women tend to click on difffferent results for the same query ? what are some queries almost exclusively issued by african americans ? these are some of the questions we address in this study . our research combines three data sources : the query-log of a major us-based web-search-engine , profile-information provided by 28 million of its users (birth year , gender and zip code) , and us-census information including detailed demographic information aggregated at the level of zip code . through this combination we can annotate each query with , e.g. the average per-capita income in the zip code it originated from . though conceptually simple , this combination immediately creates a powerful user-modeling tool . the main contributions of this work are the following . first , we provide a demographic description of a large sample of search-engine users in the us and show that it agrees well with the distribution of the us population . second , we describe how different segments of the population differ in their search-behavior , e.g. with respect to the queries they formulate or the urls they click . third , we explore applications of our methodology to improve web-search-relevance and to provide better query-suggestions . these results enable a wide range of applications including improving web-search and advertising where , for instance , targeted advertisements for `` family vacations '' could be adapted to the (expected) income .
