accurate and robust text detection : a step-in for text-retrieval in natural scene images we propose and implement a robust text detection system , which is a prominent step-in for text-retrieval in natural scene images or videos . our system includes several key components : (1) a fast and effective pruning algorithm is designed to extract maximally stable extremal regions as character candidates using the strategy of minimizing regularized variations . (2) character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link-clustering algorithm , where distance weights and threshold of clustering are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance-metric-learning algorithm . (3) the posterior probabilities of text candidates corresponding to non-text are estimated with an character classifier ; text candidates with high probabilities are then eliminated and finally texts are identified with a text-classifier . the proposed system is evaluated on the icdar 2011 robust reading competition dataset and a publicly available multilingual dataset ; the f measures are over 76 % and 74 % which are significantly better than the state-of-the-art performances of 71 % and 65 % , respectively .
