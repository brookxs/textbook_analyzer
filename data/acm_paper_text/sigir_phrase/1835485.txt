a network-based model for high-dimensional information-filtering the vector-space-model has been and to a great extent still is the de facto choice for profile representation in content-based-information-filtering . however , user-profiles represented as weighted keyword vectors have inherent dimensionality problems . as the number of profile keywords increases , the vector-representation becomes ambiguous , due to the exponential increase in the volume of the vector-space and in the number of possible keyword combinations . we argue that the complexity and dynamics of information-filtering require user-profile representations which are resilient and resistant to this `` curse-of-dimensionality '' . a user-profile has to be able to incorporate many features and to adapt to a variety of interest changes . we propose an alternative , network-based profile representation that meets these challenging requirements . experiments show that the network profile representation can more effectively capture additional-information about a user 's interests and thus achieve significant performance-improvements over a vector-based representation comprising the same weighted keywords .
