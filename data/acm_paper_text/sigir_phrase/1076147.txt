top subset retrieval on large-collections using sorted indices in this poster we describe alternative inverted-index structures that reduce the time required to process queries , produce a higher query throughput and still return high quality results to the end-user . we give results based upon the trec terabyte dataset showing improvements that these indices give in terms of effectiveness and efficiency .
