temporal-diversity in recommender-systems collaborative-filtering (cf) algorithms , used to build web-based recommender-systems , are often evaluated in terms of how accurately they predict user-ratings . however , current evaluation-techniques disregard the fact that users continue to rate items over time : the temporal characteristics of the system 's top - n recommendations are not investigated . in particular , there is no means of measuring the extent that the same items are being recommended to users over and over again . in this work , we show that temporal-diversity is an important facet of recommender-systems , by showing how cf data changes over time and performing a user-survey . we then evaluate three cf algorithms from the point-of-view of the diversity in the sequence of recommendation lists they produce over time . we examine how a number of characteristics of user rating patterns (including profile size and time between rating) affect diversity . we then propose and evaluate set methods that maximise temporal-recommendation diversity without extensively penalising accuracy .
