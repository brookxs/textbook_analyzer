probability-ranking-principle via optimal expected rank this paper presents a new perspective of the-probability-ranking-principle (prp) by defining retrieval-effectiveness in terms of our novel expected rank measure of a set of documents for a particular query . this perspective is based on preserving decision preferences , and it imposes weaker conditions on prp than the utility-theoretic perspective of prp .
