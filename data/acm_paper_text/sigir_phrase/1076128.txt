exploiting ontologies for automatic-image-annotation automatic-image-annotation is the task of automatically assigning words to an image that describe the content of the image . machine-learning-approaches have been explored to model the association between words and images from an annotated set of images and generate annotations for a test image . the paper proposes methods to use a hierarchy defined on the annotation words derived from a text ontology to improve automatic-image-annotation and retrieval . specifically , the hierarchy is used in the context of generating a visual-vocabulary for representing images and as a framework for the proposed hierarchical-classification approach for automatic-image-annotation . the effect of using the hierarchy in generating the visual-vocabulary is demonstrated by improvements in the annotation performance of translation-models . in addition to performance-improvements , hierarchical-classification approaches yield well to constructing multimedia-ontologies .
