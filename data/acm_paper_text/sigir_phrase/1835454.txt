person-name-disambiguation by bootstrapping in this paper , we report our system that disambiguates person-names in web-search-results . the system uses named-entities , compound key-words , and urls as features for document-similarity calculation , which typically show high precision but low recall clustering results . we propose to use a two-stage-clustering algorithm by bootstrapping to improve the low recall values , in which clustering results of the first stage are used to extract features used in the second stage clustering . experimental-results revealed that our algorithm yields better score than the best systems at the latest weps workshop .
