protein-identification as an information-retrieval problem we present the first interdisciplinary-work on transforming a popular problem in proteomics , i.e. protein-identification from tandem-mass-spectra , to an information-retrieval (ir) problem . we present an empirical-comparison of popular ir approaches , such as those available from indri and lemur toolkits on benchmark datasets , to representative popular baselines in the proteomics literature . our experiments demonstrate statistically significant evidence that popular ir approaches outperform representative baseline approaches in proteomics .
