corpus-structure , language-models , and ad-hoc-information-retrieval most previous work on the recently developed language-modeling approach to information-retrieval focuses on document-specific characteristics , and therefore does not take into account the structure of the surrounding corpus . we propose a novel algorithmic-framework in which information provided by document-based language-models is enhanced by the incorporation of information drawn from clusters of similar documents . using this framework , we develop a suite of new algorithms . even the simplest typically outperforms the standard language-modeling approach in precision-and-recall , and our new interpolation-algorithm posts statistically significant improvements for both metrics over all three corpora tested .
