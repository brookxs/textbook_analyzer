surrogate scoring for improved metasearch precision we describe a method for improving the precision of metasearch results based upon scoring the visual-features of documents ' surrogate representations . these surrogate scores are used during fusion in place of the original scores or ranks provided by the underlying search-engines . visual-features are extracted from typical search result surrogate information , such as title , snippet , url , and rank . this approach specifically avoids the use of search engine-specific scores and collection statistics that are required by most traditional fusion strategies . this restriction correctly reflects the use of metasearch in practice , in which knowledge of the underlying search-engines ' strategies can not be assumed . we evaluate our approach using a precision-oriented test-collection of manually-constructed binary relevance-judgments for the top ten results from ten web-search-engines over 896 queries . we show that our visual fusion approach significantly outperforms the rcombmnz fusion-algorithm by 5.71 \ % , with 99 \ % confidence , and the best individual web-search-engine by 10.9 \ % , with 99 \ % confidence .
