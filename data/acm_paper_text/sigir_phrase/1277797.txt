a study of poisson query-generation model for information-retrieval many variants of language-models have been proposed for information-retrieval . most existing models are based on multinomial-distribution and would score documents based on query likelihood computed based on a query-generation probabilistic-model . in this paper , we propose and study a new family of query-generation models based on poisson-distribution . we show that while in their simplest forms , the new family of models and the existing multinomial models are equivalent . however , based on different smoothing-methods , the two families of models behave differently . we show that the poisson model has several advantages , including naturally accommodating per-term smoothing and modeling accurate background more efficiently . we present several variants of the new model corresponding to different smoothing-methods , and evaluate them on four representative trec test-collections . the results show that while their basic models perform comparably , the poisson model can out perform multinomial-model with per-term smoothing . the performance can be further improved with two-stage-smoothing .
