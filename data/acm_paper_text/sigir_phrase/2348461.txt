creating temporally dynamic-web search snippets content on the internet is always changing . we explore the value of biasing search result snippets towards new webpage content . we present results from a user-study comparing traditional query-focused snippets with snippets that emphasize new page content for two query-types : general and trending . our results indicate that searchers prefer the inclusion of temporal-information for trending queries but not for general queries , and that this is particularly valuable for pages that have not been recently crawled .
