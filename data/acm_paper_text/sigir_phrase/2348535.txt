ir-models : foundations and relationships in ir research it is essential to know ir-models . research over the past years has consolidated the foundations of ir-models . moreover , relationships have been reported that help to use and position ir-models . knowing about the foundations and relationships of ir-models can significantly improve building information management-systems . the first part of this tutorial presents an in-depth consolidation of the foundations of the main ir-models (tf-idf , bm25 , lm) . particular attention will be given to notation and probabilistic roots . the second part crystallises the relationships between models . does lm embody idf ? how `` heuristic '' is tf-idf ? what are the probabilistic roots ? how are lm and the probability of relevance related ? what are the components shared by the main ir-models ? after the tutorial , attendees will be familiar with a consolidated view on ir-models . the tutorial will be illustrative and interactive , providing opportunities to exchange controversial issues and research-challenges .
