exploiting the hierarchical-structure for link-analysis link-analysis-algorithms have been extensively used in web-information-retrieval . however , current link-analysis-algorithms generally work on a flat link-graph , ignoring the hierarchal structure of the web-graph . they often suffer from two problems : the sparsity of link-graph and biased ranking of newly-emerging pages . in this paper , we propose a novel ranking-algorithm called hierarchical rank as a solution to these two problems , which considers both the hierarchical-structure and the link-structure of the-web . in this algorithm , web-pages are first aggregated based on their hierarchical-structure at directory , host or domain level and link-analysis is performed on the aggregated graph . then , the importance of each node on the aggregated graph is distributed to individual pages belong to the node based on the hierarchical-structure . this algorithm allows the importance of linked web-pages to be distributed in the web-page space even when the space is sparse and contains new pages . experimental-results on the . gov collection of trec 2003 and 2004 show that hierarchical ranking-algorithm consistently outperforms other well-known ranking-algorithms , including the pagerank , blockrank and layerrank . in addition , experimental-results show that link-aggregation at the host level is much better than link-aggregation at either the domain or directory levels .
