from research to application : the cite natural-language-information-retrieval-system large operational information-retrieval-systems typically employ inverted-file structures and boolean-logic operators for efficient text-retrieval . these systems require considerable user-training for effective use . as a consequence , searching is commonly performed by professional intermediaries on behalf of end users.by contrast , many small scale experimental retrieval-systems incorporate desirable user-interface features , such as natural (english) language querying , ranked output and relevance feedback.the author describes the design and implementation of a natural-language search-interface to medline , the national library of medicines largest and most heavily used data-base . the cite (current information-transfer in english) prototype-system is a large-scale , weighted logic information retrieval-system with natural-language-query input , ranked search output , dynamic user feedback and automatic associative vocabulary mapping capahilities .
