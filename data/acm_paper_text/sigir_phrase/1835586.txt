the impact of collection-size on relevance and diversity it has been observed that precision increases with collection-size . one explanation could be that the redundancy of information increases , making it easier to find multiple-documents conveying the same information . arguably , a user has no interest in reading the same information over and over , but would prefer a set of diverse search-results covering multiple aspects of the search topic . in this paper , we look at the impact of the collection-size on the relevance and diversity of retrieval results by down-sampling the collection . our main finding is that we can we can improve diversity by randomly removing the majority of the results -- this will significantly reduce the redundancy and only marginally affect the subtopic coverage .
