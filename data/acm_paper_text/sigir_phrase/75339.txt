design of a browsing interface for information-retrieval in conventional boolean-retrieval systems , users have difficulty controlling the amount of output obtained from a given query . this paper describes the design of a user-interface which permits gradual enlargement or refinement of the user 's query by browsing through a graph of term and document subsets . this graph is obtained from a lattice automatically generated from the usual document-term relation . the major design-features of the proposed interface are the integration of menu , fill-in the blank and direct-manipulation modes of interaction within the fisheye-view [furnas , 1986] paradigm . a prototype user-interface incorporating some of these ideas has been implemented on a microcomputer . the resulting interface is well adapted to various kinds of users and needs . more experienced users with a particular subject in mind can directly specify a query which results into a jump to a particular vertex in the graph . from there , the user can refine his initial query by browsing through the graph from that point on . on the other hand , casual users without any prior-knowledge of the contents of the system or users without any particular subject in mind can freely navigate through the graph without ever specifying any query .
