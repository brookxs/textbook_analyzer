using historical-data to enhance rank-aggregation rank-aggregation is a pervading operation in ir technology . we hypothesize that the performance of score-based aggregation may be affected by artificial , usually meaningless deviations consistently occurring in the input score distributions , which distort the combined result when the individual biases differ from each other . we propose a score-based rank-aggregation model where the source scores are normalized to a common distribution before being combined . early experiments on available data from several trec collections are shown to support our proposal .
