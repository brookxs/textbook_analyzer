coefficients of combining concept classes in a collection this report considers combining information to improve retrieval . the vector-space-model has been extended so different classes of data are associated with distinct concept types and their respective subvectors . two collections with multiple concept types are described , isi-1460 and cacm-3204 . experiments indicate that regression methods can help predict relevance , given query-document similarity values for each concept type . after sampling and transformation of data , the coefficient-of-determination for the best model was .48 (.66) for isi (cacm) . average-precision for the two collections was 11 \ % (31 \ %) better for probabilistic feedback with all types versus with terms only . these findings may be of particular interest to designers of document-retrieval or hypertext-systems since the role of links is shown to be especially beneficial .
