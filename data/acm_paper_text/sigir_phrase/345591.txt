partial collection replication versus caching for information-retrieval-systems the explosion of content in distributed-information-retrieval (ir) systems requires new mechanisms to attain timely and accurate-retrieval of unstructured-text . in this paper , we compare two mechanisms to improve ir-system performance : partial collection replication-and-caching . when queries have locality , both mechanisms return results more quickly than sending queries to the original collection (s) . caches return results when queries exactly match a previous one . partial replicas are a form of caching that return results when the ir technology determines the query is a good match . caches are simpler and faster , but replicas can increase locality by detecting similarity between queries that are not exactly the same . we use real-traces from thomas and excite to measure query locality and similarity . with a very restrictive definition of query-similarity , similarity improves query locality up to 15 \ % over exact-match . we use a validated simulator to compare their performance , and find that even if the partial-replica hit-rate increases only 3 to 6 \ % , it will outperform simple caching under a variety of configurations . a combined approach will probably yield the best performance .
