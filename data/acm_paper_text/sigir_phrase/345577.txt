building a question-answering test-collection the trec-8 question-answering (qa) track was the first large-scale evaluation of domain-independent-question-answering systems . in addition to fostering research on the qa task , the track was used to investigate whether the evaluation-methodology used for document-retrieval is appropriate for a different natural-language-processing task . as with document-relevance judging , assessors had legitimate differences of opinions as to whether a response actually answers a question , but comparative-evaluation of qa-systems was stable despite these differences . creating a reusable qa test-collection is fundamentally more difficult than creating a document-retrieval test-collection since the qa task has no equivalent to document identifiers .
