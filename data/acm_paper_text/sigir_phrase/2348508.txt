scheduling queries across replicas for increased efficiency , an information-retrieval-system can split its index into multiple shards , and then replicate these shards across many query servers . for each new query , an appropriate replica for each shard must be selected , such that the query is answered as quickly as possible . typically , the replica with the lowest number of queued queries is selected . however , not every query takes the same time to execute , particularly if a dynamic-pruning strategy is applied by each query server . hence , the replica 's queue-length is an inaccurate indicator of the workload of a replica , and can result in inefficient usage of the replicas . in this work , we propose that improved replica-selection can be obtained by using query-efficiency prediction to measure the expected workload of a replica . experiments are conducted using 2.2 k queries , over various numbers of shards and replicas for the large gov2 collection . our results show that query waiting and completion times can be markedly reduced , showing that accurate response-time predictions can improve scheduling accuracy and attesting the benefit of the proposed scheduling-algorithm .
