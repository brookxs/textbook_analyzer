dirichlet pagerank pagerank has been known to be a successful algorithm in ranking web sources . in order to avoid the rank sink problem , pagerank assumes that a surfer , being in a page , jumps to a random page with a certain probability . in the standard pagerank-algorithm , the jumping probabilities are assumed to be the same for all the pages , regardless of the page properties . this is not the case in the real-world , since presumably a surfer would more likely follow the out-links of a high-quality hub page than follow the links of a low-quality one . in this poster , we propose a novel algorithm `` dirichlet pagerank '' to address this problem by adapting exible jumping probabilities based on the number of out-links in a page . empirical-results on trec-data show that our method outperforms the standard pagerank-algorithm .
