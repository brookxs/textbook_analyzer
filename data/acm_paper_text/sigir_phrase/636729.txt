techniques for measuring the stability-of-clustering : a comparative-study among the significant factors in assessing the suitability of a clustering-technique to a given application is its stability ; that is , how sensitive the algorithm is to perturbations in the input data . a number of techniques that appear to be suitable for measuring the stability-of-clustering have been published in the literature . the details about each of these measures , such as a description of the steps involved in their computation and an identification of precisely what they measure , are presented . these measures are considered in the context of analysing the stability characteristics of clustering-techniques and are compared using a framework developed for this purpose . the question of generalizing some of these measures is addressed and the measures are also analyzed to identify conditions under which they can be reduced to one another .
