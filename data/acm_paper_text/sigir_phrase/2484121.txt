composition of tf normalizations : new insights on scoring-functions for ad-hoc ir previous papers in ad-hoc ir reported that scoring-functions should satisfy a set of heuristic retrieval-constraints , providing a mathematical justification for the normalizations historically applied to the term-frequency (tf) . in this paper , we propose a further level of abstraction , claiming that the successive normalizations are carried out through composition . thus we introduce a principled framework that fully explains bm25 as a variant of tf-idf with an inverse order of function-composition . our experiments over standard-datasets indicate that the respective orders of composition chosen in the original papers for both tf-idf and bm25 are the most effective ones . moreover , since the order is different between the two models , they also demonstrated that the order is instrumental in the design of weighting models . in fact , while considering more complex scoring-functions such as bm25 + , we discovered a novel weighting-model in terms of order of composition that consistently outperforms all the rest . our contribution here is twofold : we provide a unifying mathematical-framework for ir and a novel scoring-function discovered using this framework .
