a joint framework for collaborative and content-filtering this paper proposes a novel , unified , and systematic approach to combine collaborative and content-based-filtering for ranking and user-preference prediction . the framework incorporates all available information by coupling together multiple-learning problems and using a suitable kernel or similarity-function between user-item pairs . we propose and evaluate an on-line-algorithm (jrank) that generalizes perceptron-learning using this framework and shows significant improvement over other approaches .
