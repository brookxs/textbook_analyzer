a boosting-algorithm for learning bipartite ranking-functions with partially-labeled-data this paper presents a boosting based algorithm for learning a bipartite ranking-function (brf) with partially-labeled-data . until now different attempts had been made to build a brf in a transductive setting , in which the test points are given to the methods in advance as unlabeled-data . the proposed approach is a semi-supervised inductive ranking-algorithm which , as opposed to transductive algorithms , is able to infer an ordering on new examples that were not used for its training . we evaluate our approach using the trec-9 ohsumed and the reuters-21578 data-collections , comparing against two semi-supervised-classification algorithms for rocarea (auc) , uninterpolated average-precision (aup) , mean precision@50 (tp) and precision-recall (pr) curves . in the most interesting cases where there are an unbalanced number of irrelevant examples over relevant ones , we show our method to produce statistically significant improvements with respect to these ranking-measures .
