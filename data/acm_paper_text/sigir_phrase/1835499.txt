evaluating verbose-query processing techniques verbose or long-queries are a small but significant part of the query stream in web-search , and are common in other applications such as collaborative-question-answering (cqa) . current search-engines perform well with keyword-queries but are not , in general , effective for verbose-queries . in this paper , we examine query-processing techniques which can be applied to verbose-queries prior to submission to a search-engine in order to improve the search-engine 's results . we focus on verbose-queries that have sentence-like structure , but are not simple `` wh - '' questions , and assume the search-engine is a `` black-box . '' we evaluated the output of two search-engines using queries from a cqa service and our results show that , among a broad range of techniques , the most effective approach is to simply reduce the length of the query . this can be achieved effectively by removing `` stop structure '' instead of only stop words . we show that the process of learning and removing stop structure from a query can be effectively automated .
