word document density and relevance-scoring (poster session) previous work addressing the issue of word-distribution in documents has shown the importance of word repetitiveness as an indicator of the word content-bearing characteristics . in this paper we propose a simple method using a measure of the tendency of words to repeat within a document to separate the words with similar document frequencies , but different topic discriminating characteristics . we describe the application of the new measure in query-document relevance-scoring . experiments on the trec ad-hoc and spoken-document-retrieval tasks [7] show useful performance-improvements .
