the utah text-retrieval project : a status report the utah text-retrieval project addresses a number of areas in information-retrieval , including basic system structure , user-interfaces integrating information-retrieval with word-processing , indexing-techniques , and the use of specialized backend processors . although the work on the development of a high-speed text-search-engine is generally the best known , probably the most exciting aspect of the project is the message-based architecture , which provides an adaptable testbed for information-retrieval-techniques . it can support a variety of index and search-strategies , while instrumenting their performance so that they can be accurately compared in an identical environment.this paper describes the goals and design-decisions for the utah retrieval-system architecture (ursa) . it discusses the prototype-system 's features and limitations , and the changes that will be made to produce the production version .
