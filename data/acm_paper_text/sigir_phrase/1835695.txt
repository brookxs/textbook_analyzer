learning hidden-variable models for blog-retrieval we describe probabilistic-models that leverage individual blog post evidence to improve blog seed retrieval performances . our model offers a intuitive and principled method to combine multiple posts in scoring a whole blog-site by treating individual posts as hidden variables . when applied to the seed retrieval-task , our model yields state-of-the-art results on the trec 2007 blog-distillation task dataset .
