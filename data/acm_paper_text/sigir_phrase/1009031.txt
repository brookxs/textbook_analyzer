document-clustering via adaptive subspace iteration document-clustering has long been an important problem in information-retrieval . in this paper , we present a new clustering-algorithm asi 1 , which uses explicitly modeling of the subspace structure associated with each cluster . asi simultaneously performs data-reduction and subspace identification via an iterative alternating-optimization procedure . motivated from the optimization-procedure , we then provide a novel method to determine the number of clusters . we also discuss the connections of asi with various existential clustering approaches . finally , extensive experimental-results on real-data sets show the effectiveness of asi algorithm .
