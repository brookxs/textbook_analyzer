knowledge-effects on document-selection in search-results pages click-through events in search-results pages (serps) are not reliable implicit indicators of document-relevance . a user 's task and domain-knowledge are key factors in recognition and link selection and the most useful serp document links may be those that best match the user 's domain-knowledge . user-study participants rated their knowledge of genomics mesh-terms before conducting 2004 trec-genomics track tasks . each participant 's document knowledge was represented by their knowledge of the indexing mesh-terms . results show high , intermediate , and low domain-knowledge groups had similar document selection serp rank distributions . serp link selection distribution varied when participant knowledge of the available documents was analyzed . high domain-knowledge participants usually selected a document with the highest personal knowledge rating . low domain-knowledge participants were reasonably successful at selecting available documents of which they had the most knowledge , while intermediate knowledge participants often failed to do so . this evidence for knowledge-effects on serp link selection may contribute to understanding the potential-for-personalization of search-results ranking based on user domain-knowledge .
