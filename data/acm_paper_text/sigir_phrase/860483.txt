collaborative-filtering via gaussian probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis collaborative-filtering aims at learning predictive-models of user-preferences , interests or behavior from community data , i.e. a database of available user-preferences . in this paper , we describe a new model-based algorithm designed for this task , which is based on a generalization of probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis to continuous-valued response variables . more specifically , we assume that the observed user-ratings can be modeled as a mixture of user-communities or interest groups , where users may participate probabilistically in one or more groups . each community-is characterized by a gaussian-distribution on the normalized ratings for each item . the normalization of ratings is performed in a user-specific manner to account for variations in absolute shift and variance of ratings . experiments on the eachmovie data-set show that the proposed approach compares favorably with other collaborative-filtering techniques .
