a ranking approach to target-detection for automatic-link-generation we focus on the task of target-detection in automatic-link-generation with wikipedia , i.e. , given an n-gram in a snippet of text , find the relevant wikipedia concepts that explain or provide background-knowledge for it . we formulate the task as a ranking problem and investigate the effectiveness of learning-to-rank approaches and of the features that we use to rank the target concepts for a given n-gram . our experiments show that learning-to-rank approaches outperform traditional binary-classification approaches . also , our proposed features are effective both in binary-classification and learning-to-rank settings .
