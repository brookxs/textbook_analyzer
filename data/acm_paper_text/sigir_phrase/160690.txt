efficient context-sensitive plausible inference for information-disclosure plausible inference is an essential aspect of logic-based information-disclosure . this paper proposes a context-sensitive plausible inference-mechanism based on a so-called index expression belief network . plausible inference is cloaked as probabilistic evidence propagation within this network . preliminary experiments show general evidence propagation algorithms to be too inefficient for real-life information-disclosure applications . the paper sketches two optimizations whereby efficient , special-purpose evidence propagation may be realized .
