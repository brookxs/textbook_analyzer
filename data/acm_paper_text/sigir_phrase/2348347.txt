finding translations in scanned book collections this paper describes an approach for identifying translations of books in large scanned book collections with ocr-errors . the method is based on the idea that although individual sentences do not necessarily preserve the word-order when translated , a book must preserve the linear progression of ideas for it to be a valid translation . consider two books in two different languages , say english and german . the english book in the collection is represented by the sequence of words (in the order they appear in the text) which appear only once in the book . similarly , the book in german is represented by its sequence of words which appear only once . an english-german dictionary is used to transform the word-sequence of the english book into german by translating individual words in place . it is not necessary to translate all the words and this method works even with small dictionaries . both sequences are now in german and can , therefore , be aligned using a longest-common-subsequence (lcs) algorithm . we describe two scoring-functions trans-cs and trans-its which account for both the lcs length and the lengths of the original word-sequences . experiments demonstrate that trans-its is particularly successful in finding translations of books and outperforms several baselines including metadata-search based on matching titles and authors . experiments performed on a europarl parallel-corpus for four language-pairs , english-finnish , english-french , english-german , english-spanish , and a scanned book collection of 50k english-german books show that the proposed method retrieves translations of books with an average map score of 1.0 and a speed of 10k book pair comparisons per second on a single core .
