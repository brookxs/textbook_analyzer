combining audio content and social-context for semantic music discovery when attempting to annotate music , it is important to consider both acoustic content and social-context . this paper explores techniques for collecting and combining multiple sources of such information for the purpose of building a query-by-text music-retrieval system . we consider two representations of the acoustic content (related to timbre and harmony) and two social sources (social-tags and web-documents) . we then compare three algorithms that combine these information-sources : calibrated-score-averaging (csa) , rankboost , and kernel-combination support-vector-machines (kc-svm) . we demonstrate empirically that each of these algorithms is superior to algorithms that use individual-information sources .
