statistical-feature-extraction for cross-language web content-quality assessment web-content quality-assessment is a typical static-ranking problem . heuristic content and tfidf features based statistical systems have proven effective for web-content quality-assessment . but they are all language dependent features , which are not suitable for cross-language ranking . in this paper , we fuse a series of language-independent features including hostname features , domain-registration features , two-layer hyperlink-analysis features and third-party web-service features to assess the-web content-quality . the experiments on ecml/pkdd 2010 discovery challenge cross-language datasets show that the assessment is effective .
