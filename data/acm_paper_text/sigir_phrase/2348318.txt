index-maintenance for time-travel-text-search time-travel-text-search enriches standard text-search by temporal predicates , so that users of web-archives can easily retrieve document versions that are considered relevant to a given keyword-query and existed during a given time-interval . different index-structures have been proposed to efficiently support time-travel-text-search . none of them , however , can easily be updated as the-web evolves and new document versions are added to the-web archive . in this work , we describe a novel index-structure that efficiently supports time-travel-text-search and can be maintained incrementally as new document versions are added to the-web archive . our solution uses a sharded index organization , bounds the number of spuriously read index entries per shard , and can be maintained using small in-memory buffers and append-only operations . we present experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrating that maintaining our novel index-structure is an order of magnitude more efficient than periodically rebuilding one of the existing index-structures , while query-processing performance is not adversely affected .
