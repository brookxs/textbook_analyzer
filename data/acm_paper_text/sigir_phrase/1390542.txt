on multiword entity-ranking in peer-to-peer-search previously [2] , we postulated the advantage of using entity-extraction to implement a new peer-to-peer (p2p) search framework for reducing network-traffic and providing a trade-off between precision-and-recall . we now propose an entity-ranking method designed for the ` short documents ' characteristic of p2p , which significantly improves both precision-and-recall in ` top results ' p2p-search . we construct a dynamic-entity corpus using n-grams statistics and metadata , study its reliability , and use it to identify correlations between user-query terms .
