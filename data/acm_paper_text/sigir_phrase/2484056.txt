leveraging conceptual lexicon : query-disambiguation using proximity information for patent-retrieval patent-prior-art-search is a task in patent-retrieval where the goal is to rank documents which describe prior art work related to a patent application . one of the main properties of patent-retrieval is that the query topic is a full patent application and does not represent a focused information-need . this query by document nature of patent-retrieval introduces new challenges and requires new investigations specific to this problem . researchers have addressed this problem by considering different information-resources for query-reduction and query-disambiguation . however , previous work has not fully studied the effect of using proximity information and exploiting domain-specific resources for performing query-disambiguation . in this paper , we first reduce the query document by taking the first claim of the document itself . we then build a query-specific patent lexicon based on definitions of the international-patent-classification (ipc) . we study how to expand queries by selecting expansion terms from the lexicon that are focused on the query topic . the key problem is how to capture whether an expansion term is focused on the query topic or not . we address this problem by exploiting proximity information . we assign high weights to expansion terms appearing closer to query terms based on the intuition that terms closer to query terms are more likely to be related to the query topic . experimental-results on two patent-retrieval datasets show that the proposed method is effective and robust for query-expansion , significantly outperforming the standard pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) and existing baselines in patent-retrieval .
