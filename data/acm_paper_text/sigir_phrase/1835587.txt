spatial-relationships in visual graph modeling for image-categorization in this paper , a language-model adapted to graph-based representation of image-content is proposed and assessed . the full-indexing and retrieval processes are evaluated on two different image corpora . we show that using the spatial-relationships with graph-model has a positive impact on the results of standard language-model (lm) and outperforms the baseline built upon the current state-of-the-art support-vector-machine (svm) classification-method .
