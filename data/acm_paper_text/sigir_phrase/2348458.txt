clarity re-visited we present a novel interpretation of clarity [5] , a widely used query-performance-predictor . while clarity is commonly described as a measure of the `` distance '' between the language-model of the top-retrieved documents and that of the collection , we show that it actually quantifies an additional property of the result list , namely , its diversity . this analysis , along with empirical-evaluation , helps to explain the low prediction-quality of clarity for large-scale web collections .
