designing an information-retrieval interface based on user-characteristics with the increasing number of information-retrieval-systems and databases available and the increasing demand of end-users to utilize the systems , a need exists for improved interfaces and improved training mechanisms . this paper reports on a project to develop an integrated online-instruction and assistance-system to be used as a front end to the u.s. department-of-energy 's recon retrieval-system . the conceptual-framework for the interface-design is based on individual-characteristics of its current and prospective users , predominantly scientists conducting energy-research . we are building a prototype based on information gained from interviews with scientists using the system (either directly or through a search intermediary) and interviews with search intermediaries . the paper reports on research in progress , including the results of the interviews and the preliminary-design of the interface . the conference presentation will include a fuller description of the interface than can be specified here .
