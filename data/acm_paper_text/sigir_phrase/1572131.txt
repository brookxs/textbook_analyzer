tagging products using image-classification associating labels with online-products can be a labor-intensive task . we study the extent to which a standard `` bag-of-visual-words '' image classifier can be used to tag products with useful information , such as whether a sneaker has laces or velcro straps . using scale-invariant-feature-transform (sift) image-descriptors at random keypoints , a hierarchical visual-vocabulary , and a variant of nearest-neighbor classification , we achieve accuracies between 66 \ % and 98 \ % on 2 - and 3-class classification-tasks using several dozen training-examples . we also increase accuracy by combining information from multiple-views of the same product .
