probabilistic-retrieval based on staged logistic-regression the goal of a probabilistic-retrieval-system design is to rank the elements of the search universe in descending order of their estimated probability of usefulness to the user . previously explored methods for computing such a ranking have involved the use of statistical independence assumptions and multiple-regression-analysis on a learning sample . in this paper these techniques are recombined in a new way to achieve greater accuracy of probabilistic estimate without undue additional computational-complexity . the novel element of the proposed design is that the regression-analysis be carried out in two or more levels or stages . such an approach allows composite or grouped retrieval clues to be analyzed in an orderly manner -- first within-groups , and then between . it compensates automatically for systematic biases introduced by the statistical simplifying assumptions , and gives rise to search-algorithms of reasonable computational-efficiency .
