the automatic-generation of extended queries in the extended vector-space-model , each document-vector consists of a set of subvectors representing the multiple concepts or concept classes present in the document . typical information concepts , in addition to the usual content terms or descriptors , include author-names , bibliographic links , etc. . the extended vector-space-model is known to improve retrieval-effectiveness . however , a major impediment to the use of the extended model is the construction of an extended query . in this paper , we describe a method for automatically extending a query containing only content terms (a single concept class) to a representation containing multiple concept classes . no relevance-feedback is involved . experiments using the cacm collection resulted in an average-precision 34 \ % better than that obtained using the standard single-concept term vector-model .
