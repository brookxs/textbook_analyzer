random-walks on the click-graph search-engines can record which documents were clicked for which query , and use these query-document pairs as `` soft '' relevance-judgments . however , compared to the true judgments , click-logs give noisy and sparse relevance information . we apply a markov-random-walk model to a large click-log , producing a probabilistic-ranking of documents for a given query . a key advantage of the model is its ability to retrieve relevant documents that have not yet been clicked for that query and rank those effectively . we conduct experiments on click-logs from image-search , comparing our (`` backward '') random-walk-model to a different (`` forward '') random-walk , varying parameters such as walk length and self-transition probability . the most effective combination is a long backward walk with high self-transition probability .
