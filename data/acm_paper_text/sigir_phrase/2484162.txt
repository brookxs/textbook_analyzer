neighbourhood preserving quantisation for lsh we introduce a scheme for optimally allocating multiple bits per hyperplane for locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) . existing approaches binarise lsh projections by thresholding at zero yielding a single bit per dimension . we demonstrate that this is a sub-optimal bit-allocation approach that can easily destroy the neighbourhood structure in the original feature-space . our proposed method , dubbed neighbourhood preserving quantization (npq) , assigns multiple bits per hyperplane based upon adaptively learned thresholds . npq exploits a pairwise affinity matrix to discretise each dimension such that nearest neighbours in the original feature-space fall within the same quantisation thresholds and are therefore assigned identical bits . npq is not only applicable to lsh , but can also be applied to any low-dimensional projection scheme . despite using half the number of hyperplanes , npq is shown to improve lsh-based retrieval-accuracy by up to 65 % compared to the state-of-the-art .
