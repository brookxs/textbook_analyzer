a heathkit method for building data-management programs one of the difficulties faced in implementing information-management-and-retrieval systems is that each case seems to present its own special complexities . as a result information-retrieval-systems typically fall behind their programming schedule and have many bugs when delivered . in this paper a set of basic operations on types of files are defined . these operations are intended to fulfill the same role for information-retrieval-systems programmers that functions such as log (x) fill for mathematical applications programmers . . they should make the job very much easier . the file operations have been implemented as a run-time package written in fortran iv and burroughs extended algol . the approach has been used to develop three different information-management-systems ; an apl interactive-computing system , a generalized information-retrieval-system , and a specialized information-retrieval-system for map oriented data . these systems are described .
