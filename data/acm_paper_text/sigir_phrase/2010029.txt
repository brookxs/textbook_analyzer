multifaceted toponym-recognition for streaming-news news sources on the web generate constant streams of information , describing many aspects of the events that shape our world . in particular , geography plays a key role in the news , and enabling geographic retrieval of news-articles involves recognizing the textual references to geographic locations (called toponyms) present in the articles , which can be difficult due to ambiguity in natural-language . toponym-recognition in news is often accomplished with algorithms designed and tested around small corpora of news-articles , but these static collections do not reflect the streaming nature of online-news , as evidenced by poor performance in tests . in contrast , a method for toponym-recognition is presented that is tuned for streaming-news by leveraging a wide variety of recognition components , both rule-based and statistical . an evaluation of this method shows that it outperforms two prominent toponym-recognition systems when tested on large-datasets of streaming-news , indicating its suitability for this domain .
