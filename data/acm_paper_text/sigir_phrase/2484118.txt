leveraging viewer comments for mood classification of music-video clips this short paper proposes a method to classify music-video clips uploaded to a video-sharing service into music-mood categories such as ` cheerful , ' ` wistful , ' and ` aggressive . ' the method leverages viewer comments posted to the music-video clips for the music-mood-classification . it extracts specific-features from the comments : (1) adjectives in comments , (2) lengthened words in comments , and (3) comments in chorus sections . our experimental-results classifying 695 video-clips into six mood categories showed that our method outperformed the baseline in terms of macro and micro averaged f-measures . in addition , our method outperformed the existing approaches that utilize lyrics and audio signals of songs .
