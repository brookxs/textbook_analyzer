robust music-identification based on low-order zernike-moment in the compressed-domain in this paper , we devise a novel robust music-identification algorithm utilizing compressed-domain audio zernike-moment adapted from image-processing techniques as the pivotal feature . audio fingerprint derived from this feature exhibits strong robustness against various audio signal distortions including the challenging pitch-shifting and time-scale modification . experiments show that in our test dataset composed of 1822 popular songs , a 5s music query example which might have been severely corrupted is still sufficient to identify its original near-duplicate copy , with more than 90 \ % top five precision rate .
