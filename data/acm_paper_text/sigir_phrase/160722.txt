retrieval from hierarchical texts by partial patterns structured texts (for example dictionaries and user manuals) typically have a heirarchical (tree-like) structure . we describe a query-language for retrieving information from collections of hierarchical text . the language is based on a tree-pattern matching notion called tree-inclusion . tree-inclusion allows easy expression of queries that use the structure and the content of the document . in using it a user-need not be aware of the whole structure of the database . thus a language based on tree-inclusion is data independent , a property made necessary because of the great variance in the structure of the texts .
