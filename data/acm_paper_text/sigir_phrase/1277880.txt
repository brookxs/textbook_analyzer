towards robust-query-expansion : model-selection in the language-modeling framework we propose a language-model-based approach for addressing the performance robustness problem -- with respect to free-parameters ' values -- of pseudo-feedback-based query-expansion methods . given a query , we create a set of language-models representing different forms of its expansion by varying the parameters ' values of some expansion method ; then , we select a single model using criteria originally proposed for evaluating the performance of using the original query , or for deciding whether to employ expansion at all . experimental-results show that these criteria are highly effective in selecting relevance language-models that are not only significantly more effective than poor performing ones , but that also yield performance that is almost indistinguishable from that of manually optimized relevance-models .
