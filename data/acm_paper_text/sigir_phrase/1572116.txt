a relevance-model_based filter for improving ad quality recently there has been a surge in research that predicts retrieval relevance using historical click-through-data . while a larger number of clicks between a query and a document provides a stronger `` confidence '' of relevance , most models in the literature that learn from clicks are error-prone as they do not take into account any confidence estimates . sponsored-search models are especially prone to this error as they are typically trained on search-engine-logs in order to predict click-through-rate (ctr) . the estimated ctr ultimately determines the rank at which an ad is shown and also impacts the price (cost-per-click) for the advertiser . in this paper , we improve a model that applies collaborative-filtering on click-data by training a filter that has been trained to predict pure relevance . applying the filter to ads that have seen few clicks on live traffic results in improved ctr and click-yield (cy) . additionally , in offline experiments we find that using features based on the \ emph {organic} results improves the relevance_based filter 's performance .
