knowledge-based-systems versus thesaurus : an architecture problem about expert-systems design the use of expert-systems (es) within information-retrieval-systems (irs) seems to be an interesting way , particularly for the query process . nevertheless we must examine what knowledge we need . we think that the thesaurus may be the kernel of which knowledge : for this , we must define it larger than in classical irs.after some recalls about what may be the principal features of a query es , we discuss about the relationship between thesaurus and a query expert-system . the problem is to determine if the thesaurus must be integrated within the knowledge base.in fact this choice is an architecture problem of the es . we analyze , in parallel , the effects of this choice about thesaurus representation , es functionnalities , es architecture.the choice of an architecture depends on the goal searched : ie a general ir expert-system able to handle a set of thesauri (independent thesaurus) or a specialized ir expert-system which can be very performant but strongly tied to a specific area (integrated thesaurus) .
