many are better than one : improving multi-document-summarization via weighted-consensus given a collection of documents , various multi-document-summarization methods have been proposed to generate a short summary . however , few studies have been reported on aggregating different summarization methods to possibly generate better summarization results . we propose a weighted-consensus summarization-method to combine the results from single summarization-systems . experimental-results on duc2004 data-sets demonstrate the performance-improvement by aggregating multiple summarization-systems , and our proposed weighted-consensus summarization-method outperforms other combination methods .
