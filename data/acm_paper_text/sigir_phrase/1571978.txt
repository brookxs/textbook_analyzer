learning to recommend with social-trust-ensemble as an indispensable technique in the field of information-filtering , recommender-system has been well studied and developed both in academia and in industry recently . however , most of current recommender-systems suffer the following problems : (1) the large-scale and sparse-data of the user-item-matrix seriously affect the recommendation quality . as a result , most of the recommender-systems can not easily deal with users who have made very few ratings . (2) the traditional recommender-systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed ; this assumption ignores the connections among users , which is not consistent with the real-world recommendations . aiming at modeling recommender-systems more accurately and realistically , we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis framework , which naturally fuses the users ' tastes and their trusted friends ' favors together . in this framework , we coin the term social-trust-ensemble to represent the formulation of the social trust restrictions on the recommender-systems . the complexity-analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very-large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations , while the experimental-results show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches .
