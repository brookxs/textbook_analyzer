unsupervised-estimation of dirichlet-smoothing parameters a standard approach for determining a dirichlet-smoothing parameter is to choose a value which maximizes a retrieval-performance metric using training-data consisting of queries and relevance-judgments . there are , however , situations where training-data does not exist or the queries and relevance-judgments do not reflect typical user-information-needs for the application . we propose an unsupervised-approach for estimating a dirichlet-smoothing parameter based on collection statistics . we show empirically that this approach can suggest a plausible dirichlet-smoothing parameter value in cases where relevance-judgments can not be used .
