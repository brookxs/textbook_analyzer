intentions and attention in exploratory health-search we study information goals and patterns of attention in explorato-ry search for health-information on the web , reporting results of a large-scale log-based study . we examine search activity associated with the goal of diagnosing illness from symptoms versus more general information-seeking about health and illness . we decom-pose exploratory health-search into evidence-based and hypothe-sis-directed information-seeking . evidence-based search centers on the pursuit of details and relevance of signs and symptoms . hypothesis-directed search includes the pursuit of content on one or more illnesses , including risk-factors , treatments , and therapies for illnesses , and on the discrimination among different diseases under the uncertainty that exists in advance of a confirmed diag-nosis . these different goals of exploratory health-search are not independent , and transitions can occur between them within or across search-sessions . we construct a classifier that identifies medically-related search-sessions in log-data . given a set of search-sessions flagged as health-related , we show how we can identify different intentions persisting as foci of attention within those sessions . finally , we discuss how insights about foci dynamics can help us better understand exploratory health-search behavior and better support health-search on the web .
