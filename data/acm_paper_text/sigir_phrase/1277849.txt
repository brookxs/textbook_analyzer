indexing confusion-networks for morph-based spoken-document-retrieval in this paper , we investigate methods for improving the performance of morph-based spoken-document-retrieval in finnish by extracting relevant index-terms from confusion-networks . our approach uses morpheme-like subword units (`` morphs '') for recognition and indexing . this alleviates the problem of out-of-vocabulary-words , especially with inflectional languages like finnish . confusion-networks offer a convenient representation of alternative recognition candidates by aligning mutually exclusive terms and by giving the posterior-probability of each term . the rank of the competing terms and their posterior-probability is used to estimate term-frequency for indexing . comparing against 1-best recognizer transcripts , we show that retrieval-effectiveness is significantly improved . finally , the effect of pruning in recognition is analyzed , showing that when recognition speed is increased , the reduction in retrieval-performance due to the increase in the 1-best error-rate can be compensated by using confusion-networks .
