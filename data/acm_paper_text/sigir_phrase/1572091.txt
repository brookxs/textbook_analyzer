is this urgent ? : exploring time-sensitive information-needs in collaborative-question-answering as online collaborative question-answering (cqa) servicessuch as yahoo!-answers and baidu knows are attracting users , questions , and answers at an explosive rate , the truly urgent and important questions are increasingly getting lost in the crowd . that is , questions that require immediate responses are pushed out of the way by the trivial but more recently arriving questions . unlike other questions in collaborative-question-answering (cqa) for which users might be willing to wait until good answers appear , urgent questions are likely to be of interest to the asker only if answered in the next few minutes or hours . for such questions , late responses are either not useful or are simply not applicable . unfortunately , current collaborative question-answering-systems do not distinguish urgent questions from the rest , and could thus be ineffective for urgent-information needs . we explore text - and data - mining-methods for automatically identifying urgent questions in the cqa setting . our results indicate that modeling the question context (i.e. , the particular forum/category where the question was posted) can increase classification-accuracy compared to the text of the question alone .
