extracting structured-information from user queries with semi-supervised conditional-random-fields when search is against structured-documents , it is beneficial to extract information from user queries in a format that is consistent with the backend data-structure . as one step toward this goal , we study the problem of query tagging which is to assign each query-term to a pre-defined category . our problem could be approached by learning a conditional-random-field (crf) model (or other statistical-models) in a supervised fashion , but this would require substantial human-annotation effort . in this work , we focus on a semi-supervised-learning method for crfs that utilizes two data sources : (1) a small amount of manually-labeled queries , and (2) a large amount of queries in which some word tokens have derived labels , i.e. , label-information automatically obtained from additional resources . we present two principled ways of encoding derived label-information in a crf-model . such information is viewed as hard evidence in one setting and as soft evidence in the other . in addition to the general methodology of how to use derived labels in semi-supervised crfs , we also present a practical method on how to obtain them by leveraging user click-data and an in-domain database that contains structured-documents . evaluation on product-search queries shows the effectiveness of our approach in improving tagging accuracies .
