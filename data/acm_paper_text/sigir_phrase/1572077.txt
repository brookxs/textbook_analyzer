feature-selection for automatic taxonomy induction most existing automatic taxonomy induction systems exploit one or more features to induce a taxonomy ; nevertheless there is no systematic study examining which are the best features for the task under various conditions . this paper studies the impact of using different features on taxonomy-induction for different types of relations and for terms at different abstraction-levels . the evaluation shows that different conditions need different technologies or different combination of the technologies . in particular , co-occurrence and lexico-syntactic-patterns are good features for is-a , sibling and part-of relations ; contextual , co-occurrence , patterns , and syntactic-features work well for concrete terms ; co-occurrence works well for abstract terms .
