question-answering by predictive-annotation we present a new technique for question-answering called predictive-annotation . predictive-annotation identifies potential answers to questions in text , annotates them accordingly and indexes them . this technique , along with a complementary analysis of questions , passage-level ranking and answer-selection , produces a system effective at answering natural-language fact-seeking questions posed against large document collections . experimental-results show the effects of different parameter-settings and lead to a number of general observations about the question-answering problem .
