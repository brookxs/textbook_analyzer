crter : using cross terms to enhance probabilistic-information-retrieval term-proximity retrieval rewards a document where the matched query terms occur close to each other . although term-proximity is known to be effective in many information-retrieval (ir) applications , the within-document distribution of each individual query-term and how the query terms associate with each other , are not fully considered . in this paper , we introduce a pseudo term , namely cross-term , to model term-proximity for boosting retrieval-performance . an occurrence of a query-term is assumed to have an impact towards its neighboring text , which gradually weakens with the increase of the distance to the place of occurrence . we use a shape function to characterize such an impact . a cross-term occurs when two query terms appear close to each other and their impact shape-functions have an intersection . we propose a cross-term retrieval (crter) model that combines the cross terms ' information with basic probabilistic weighting models to rank the retrieved documents . extensive experiments on standard trec collections illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed crter model .
