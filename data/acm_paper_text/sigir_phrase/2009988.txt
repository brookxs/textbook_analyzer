efficient manifold-ranking for image-retrieval manifold-ranking (mr) , a graph-based-ranking algorithm , has been widely applied in information-retrieval and shown to have excellent performance and feasibility on a variety of data-types . particularly , it has been successfully applied to content-based-image-retrieval , because of its outstanding ability to discover underlying geometrical structure of the given image-database . however , manifold-ranking is computationally very expensive , both in graph-construction and ranking computation stages , which significantly limits its applicability to very-large-data-sets . in this paper , we extend the original manifold-ranking algorithm and propose a new framework named efficient manifold-ranking (emr) . we aim to address the shortcomings of mr from two perspectives : scalable graph-construction and efficient-computation . specifically , we build an anchor graph on the data-set instead of the traditional k-nearest-neighbor-graph , and design a new form of adjacency-matrix utilized to speed up the ranking computation . the experimental-results on a real-world image-database demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method . with a comparable performance to the original manifold-ranking , our method significantly reduces the computational time , makes it a promising method to large-scale real-world retrieval problems .
