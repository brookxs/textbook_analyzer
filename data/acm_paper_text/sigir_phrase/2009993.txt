faster temporal range-queries over versioned text versioned textual collections are collections that retain multiple versions of a document as it evolves over time . important large-scale examples are wikipedia and the-web collection of the-internet archive . search queries over such collections often use keywords as well as temporal-constraints , most commonly a time range of interest . in this paper , we study how to support such temporal range-queries over versioned text . our goal is to process these queries faster than the corresponding keyword-only queries , by exploiting the additional constraint . a simple approach might partition the index into different time ranges , and then access only the relevant parts . however , specialized inverted-index-compression techniques are crucial for large versioned collections , and a naive partitioning can negatively affect index-size and query throughput . we show how to achieve high query throughput by using smart index-partitioning techniques that take index-compression into account . experiments on over 85 million versions of wikipedia articles show that queries can be executed in a few milliseconds on memory-based index-structures , and only slightly more time on disk-based structures . we also show how to efficiently support the recently proposed stable top-k-search primitive on top of our schemes .
