a joint probabilistic-classification model for resource-selection resource-selection is an important task in federated-search to select a small number of most relevant-information sources . current resource-selection algorithms such as gloss , cori , redde , geometric average and the recent classification-based method focus on the evidence of individual-information sources to determine the relevance of available sources . current algorithms do not model the important relationship-information among individual sources . for example , an information-source tends to be relevant to a user-query if it is similar to another source with high probability of being relevant . this paper proposes a joint probabilistic-classification model for resource-selection . the model estimates the probability of relevance of information-sources in a joint manner by considering both the evidence of individual sources and their relationship . an extensive set of experiments have been conducted on several datasets to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model .
