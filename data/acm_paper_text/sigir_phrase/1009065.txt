query_based event-extraction along a timeline in this paper , we present a framework and a system that extracts events relevant to a query from a collection c of documents , and places such events along a timeline . each event is represented by a sentence extracted from c , based on the assumption that `` important '' events are widely cited in many documents for a period of time within which these events are of interest . in our experiments , we used queries that are event types (`` earthquake '') and person-names (e.g. `` george bush '') . evaluation was performed using g8 leader names as queries : comparison made by human evaluators between manually and system generated timelines showed that although manually generated timelines are on average more preferable , system generated timelines are sometimes judged to be better than manually constructed ones .
