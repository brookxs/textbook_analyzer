high precision retrieval using relevance-flow graph traditional bag-of-words information-retrieval-models use aggregated term statistics to measure the relevance of documents , making it difficult to detect non-relevant documents that contain many query terms by chance or in the wrong context . in-depth document-analysis is needed to filter out these deceptive documents . in this paper , we hypothesize that truly relevant documents have relevant-sentences in predictable patterns . our experimental-results show that we can successfully identify and exploit these patterns to significantly improve retrieval-precision at top ranks .
