friend or frenemy ? : predicting signed ties in social-networks we study the problem of labeling the edges of a social-network graph (e.g. , acquaintance connections in facebook) as either positive (i.e. , trust , true friendship) or negative (i.e. , distrust , possible frenemy) relations . such signed relations provide much stronger signal in tying the behavior of online users than the unipolar homophily effect , yet are largely unavailable as most social graphs only contain unsigned edges . we show the surprising fact that it is possible to infer signed social ties with good accuracy solely based on users ' behavior of decision-making (or using only a small fraction of supervision information) via unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms . this work hereby makes it possible to turn an unsigned acquaintance network (e.g. facebook , myspace) into a signed trust-distrust network (e.g. epinion , slashdot) . our results are based on a mixed effects framework that simultaneously captures users ' behavior , social-interactions as well as the interplay between the two . the framework includes a series of latent-factor-models and it also encodes the principles of balance and status from social-psychology . experiments on epinion and yahoo! pulse networks illustrate that (1) signed social ties can be predicted with high-accuracy even in fully unsupervised settings , and (2) the predicted signed ties are significantly more useful for social-behavior prediction than simple homophily .
