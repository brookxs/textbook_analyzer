information-behaviour modeling with external cues much of human-activity defines an information-context . we awaken , start work , and hold meetings at roughly the same time every day , and retrieve the same information items (day planners , itineraries , schedules , agendas , reports , menus , web-pages , etc.) for many of these activities . information-retrieval-systems in general lack sensitivity to such recurrent context , requiring users to remember and re-enter search cues for objects regardless of how regularly or consistently the objects are used , and to develop ad-hoc storage strategies . we propose that in addition to semantic cues , information objects should also be indexed by temporal and sensory cues , such as clock time and location , so that objects can be retrieved by external environmental context , in addition to any internal semantic-content . our cue-event-object (ceo) model uses a network-representation to associate information objects with the times and conditions (location , weather , etc.) when they are typically used . users can query the system to review their activities , revealing what they do at particular times , and which information objects tend to be most often used and when . the system can also pre-fetch items that have proven useful in past similar situations . the ceo model is incremental , real-time , and dynamic , maintaining an accurate summary even as a user 's information-behaviour changes over time . such environmentally-aware systems have applications in personal-information-management , mobile-devices , and smart-homes . as a memory-prosthesis , the model can support autonomous living for the cognitively-impaired . we present a comprehensive research-agenda based on some promising preliminary findings .
