score-distribution-models : assumptions , intuition , and robustness to score manipulation inferring the score-distribution of relevant and non-relevant documents is an essential task for many ir applications (e.g. information-filtering , recall-oriented ir , meta-search , distributed-ir) . modeling-score-distributions in an accurate manner is the basis of any inference . thus , numerous score-distribution-models have been proposed in the literature . most of the models were proposed on the basis of empirical evidence and goodness-of-fit . in this work , we model score distributions in a rather different , systematic manner . we start with a basic assumption on the distribution of terms in a document . following the transformations applied on term frequencies by two basic ranking-functions , bm25 and language-models , we derive the distribution of the produced scores for all documents . then we focus on the relevant documents . we detach our analysis from particular ranking-functions . instead , we consider a model for precision-recall curves , and given this model , we present a general mathematical-framework which , given any score-distribution for all retrieved documents , produces an analytical formula for the score-distribution of relevant documents that is consistent with the precision-recall curves that follow the aforementioned model . in particular , assuming a gamma-distribution for all retrieved documents , we show that the derived distribution for the relevant documents resembles a gaussian-distribution with a heavy right tail .
