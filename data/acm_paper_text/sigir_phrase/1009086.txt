a session-based-search engine in this poster , we describe a novel session-based-search engine , which puts the search-in-context . the search-engine has a number of session-based features including expansion of the current query with user-query history and clickthrough-data (title and summary of clicked web-pages) in the same search-session and the session-boundary-recognition through temporal closeness and probabilistic similarity between query terms . in addition , the search-engine visualizes the rank change of web-pages as different queries are submitted in the same search-session to help the user reformulate the query .
