multi-field-learning for email-spam-filtering through the investigation of email document-structure , this paper proposes a multi-field-learning (mfl) framework , which breaks the multi-field document-text classification (tc) problem into several sub-document tc problems , and makes the final category prediction by weighted linear-combination of several sub-document tc results . many previous statistical tc algorithms can be easily rebuilt within the mfl framework via turning binary result to spamminess score , which is a real number and reflects the likelihood that the classified email is spam . the experimental-results in the trec spam track show that the performances of many tc algorithms can be improved within the mfl framework .
