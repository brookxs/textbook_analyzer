two axioms for evaluation-measures in information-retrieval in this paper evaluation-measures for information-retrieval-system outputs are investigated from a measurement theoretic point-of-view . two axioms are introduced : the axiom of monoto-nicity and the archimedian axiom . it is shown that the measures fullfilling these axioms are exactly the measures equivalent to some measure of the form ? a + ? d where a is the number of relevant retrieved documents and d is the number of nonrelevant not retrieved documents . some consequences for retrieval tests are discussed .
