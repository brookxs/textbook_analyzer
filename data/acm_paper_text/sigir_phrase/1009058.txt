human versus machine in the topic-distillation task this paper reports on and discusses a set of user-experiments using the trec 2003 web interactive track protocol . the focus is on comparing humans and machine algorithms in terms of performance in a topic-distillation task . we also investigated the effect of the search-results layout in supporting the users ' effort.we have demonstrated that machines can perform nearly as well as people on the topic-distillation task . given a system tailored to the task there is significant performance-improvement and finally , given a presentation that supports the task , there is strong user-satisfaction .
