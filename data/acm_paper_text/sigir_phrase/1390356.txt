query-dependent-ranking using k-nearest-neighbor many ranking-models have been proposed in information-retrieval , and recently machine-learning-techniques have also been applied to ranking-model construction . most of the existing methods do not take into consideration the fact that significant differences exist between queries , and only resort to a single function in ranking of documents . in this paper , we argue that it is necessary to employ different ranking-models for different queries and onduct what we call query-dependent ranking . as the first such attempt , we propose a k-nearest-neighbor (knn) method for query-dependent ranking . we first consider an online method which creates a ranking-model for a given query by using the labeled neighbors of the query in the query feature-space and then rank the documents with respect to the query using the created model . next , we give two offline approximations of the method , which create the ranking-models in advance to enhance the efficiency of ranking . and we prove a theory which indicates that the approximations are accurate in terms of difference in loss of prediction , if the learning-algorithm used is stable with respect to minor changes in training-examples . our experimental-results show that the proposed online and offline methods both outperform the baseline method of using a single ranking-function .
