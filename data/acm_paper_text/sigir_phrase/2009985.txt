query by document via a decomposition-based two-level retrieval approach retrieving similar documents from a large-scale text corpus according to a given document is a fundamental technique for many applications . however , most of existing indexing-techniques have difficulties to address this problem due to special properties of a document query , e.g. high-dimensionality , sparse-representation and semantic concern . towards addressing this problem , we propose a two-level retrieval solution based on a document-decomposition idea . a document is decomposed to a compact vector and a few document specific keywords by a dimension-reduction approach . the compact vector embodies the major semantics of a document , and the document specific keywords complement the discriminative power lost in dimension-reduction process . we adopt locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) to index the compact vectors , which guarantees to quickly find a set of related documents according to the vector of a query document . then we re-rank documents in this set by their document specific keywords . in experiments , we obtained promising results on various datasets in terms of both accuracy and performance . we demonstrated that this solution is able to index large-scale corpus for efficient similarity-based document-retrieval .
