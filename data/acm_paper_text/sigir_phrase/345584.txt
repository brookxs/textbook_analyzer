the impact of database-selection on distributed-searching the proliferation of online-information resources increases the importance of effective and efficient distributed-searching . distributed-searching is cast in three parts database-selection , query-processing , and results-merging . in this paper we examine the effect of database-selection on retrieval-performance . we look at retrieval-performance in three different distributed-retrieval testbeds and distill some general results . first we find that good database-selection can result in better retrieval-effectiveness than can be achieved in a centralized database . second we find that good performance can be achieved when only a few sites are selected and that the performance generally increases as more sites are selected . finally we find that when database-selection is employed , it is not necessary to maintain collection wide information (cwi) , e.g. global idf . local-information can be used to achieve superior performance . this means that distributed-systems can be engineered with more autonomy and less cooperation . this work suggests that improvements in database-selection can lead to broader improvements in retrieval-performance , even in centralized (i.e. single database) systems . given a centralized database and a good selection-mechanism , retrieval-performance can be improved by decomposing that database conceptually and employing a selection step .
