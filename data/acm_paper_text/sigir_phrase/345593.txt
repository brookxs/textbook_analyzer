hierarchical-classification of web-content this paper explores the use of hierarchical-structure for classifying a large , heterogeneous collection of web-content . the hierarchical-structure is initially used to train different second-level classifiers . in the hierarchical case , a model is learned to distinguish a second-level category from other categories within the same top level . in the flat non-hierarchical case , a model distinguishes a second-level category from all other second-level categories . scoring-rules can further take advantage of the hierarchy by considering only second-level categories that exceed a threshold at the top level . we use support-vector-machine (svm) classifiers , which have been shown to be efficient and effective for classification , but not previously explored in the context of hierarchical-classification . we found small advantages in accuracy for hierarchical-models over flat models . for the hierarchical-approach , we found the same accuracy using a sequential boolean decision-rule and a multiplicative decision-rule . since the sequential approach is much more efficient , requiring only 14 \ % -16 \ % of the comparisons used in the other approaches , we find it to be a good choice for classifying text into large hierarchical-structures .
