syntactic-features in question-answering syntactic-information potentially plays a much more important role in question-answering than it does in information-retrieval . although many people have used syntactic-evidence in question-answering , there have n't been many detailed experiments reported in the literature . the aim of the experiment described in this paper is to study the impact of a particular approach for using syntactic-information on question-answering effectiveness . our results indicate that a combination of syntactic-information with heuristics for ranking potential answers can perform better than the ranking heuristics on their own .
