improving document-representation by accumulating relevance-feedback (abstract only) : the relevance-feedback accumulation algorithm this paper presents a document-representation improvement technique named the relevance-feedback accumulation (rfa) algorithm . using prior relevance-feedback assessments and a data-mining measure called support this algorithm improves document representations and generates higher quality indexes . at the same time , the algorithm is efficient and scalable , suited for retrieval-systems managing large document collections . the results of the preliminary evaluation reveal that the rfa algorithm is able to reduce the index dimensionality while improving retrieval-effectiveness .
