cross-language-retrieval using link-based language-models we propose a cross-language-retrieval model that is solely based on wikipedia as a training-corpus . the main contributions of our work are : 1 . a translation-model based on linked text in wikipedia and a term-weighting method associated with it . 2 . a combination scheme to interpolate the link translation-model with retrieval based on latent-dirichlet-allocation . on the clef 2000 data we achieve improvement with respect to the best german-english system at the bilingual track (non-significant) and improvement against a baseline based on machine-translation (significant) .
