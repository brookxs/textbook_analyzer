detecting outlier sections in us congressional legislation reading congressional legislation , also known as bills , is often tedious because bills tend to be long and written in complex language . in ibm many bills , an interactive web-based-visualization of legislation , users of different backgrounds can browse bills and quickly explore parts that are of interest to them . one task users have is to be able to locate sections that do n't seem to fit with the overall topic of the bill . in this paper , we present novel techniques to determine which sections within a bill are likely to be outliers by employing approaches from information-retrieval . the most promising techniques first detect the most topically relevant parts of a bill by ranking its sections , followed by a comparison between these topically relevant parts and the remaining sections in the bill . to compare sections we use various dissimilarity metrics based on kullback-leibler-divergence . the results indicate that these techniques are more successful than a classification_based approach . finally , we analyze how the dissimilarity metrics succeed in discriminating between sections that are strong outliers versus those that are ` milder ' outliers .
