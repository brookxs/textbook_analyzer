an exploration of proximity measures in information-retrieval in most existing retrieval-models , documents are scored primarily based on various kinds of term statistics such as within-document frequencies , inverse document frequencies , and document lengths . intuitively , the proximity of matched query terms in a document can also be exploited to promote scores of documents in which the matched query terms are close to each other . such a proximity heuristic , however , has been largely under-explored in the literature ; it is unclear how we can model proximity and incorporate a proximity-measure into an existing retrieval-model . in this paper , we systematically explore the query-term proximity heuristic . specifically , we propose and study the effectiveness of five different proximity measures , each modeling proximity from a different perspective . we then design two heuristic constraints and use them to guide us in incorporating the proposed proximity measures into an existing retrieval-model . experiments on five standard trec test-collections show that one of the proposed proximity measures is indeed highly correlated with document-relevance , and by incorporating it into the kl-divergence language-model and the okapi-bm25 model , we can significantly improve retrieval-performance .
