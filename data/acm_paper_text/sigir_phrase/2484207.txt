a framework for specific term-recommendation systems in this paper we present the irsa framework that enables the automatic creation of search-term suggestion or recommendation-systems (ts) . such ts are used to operationalize interactive-query-expansion and help users in refining their information-need in the query-formulation phase . our recent research has shown ts to be more effective when specific to a certain domain . the presented technical framework allows owners of digital-libraries to create their own specific ts constructed via oai-harvested metadata with very little effort .
