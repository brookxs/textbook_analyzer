context-based methods for text-categorisation we propose several context-based methods for text-categorization . one method , a small modification to the ppm compression-based model which is known to significantly degrade compression performance , counter-intuitively has the opposite effect on categorization performance . another method , called c-measure , simply counts the presence of higher-order character contexts , and outperforms all other approaches investigated .
