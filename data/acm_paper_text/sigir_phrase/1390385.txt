comments-oriented document-summarization : understanding documents with readers ' feedback-comments left by readers on web-documents contain valuable information that can be utilized in different information-retrieval-tasks including document-search , visualization , and summarization . in this paper , we study the problem of comments-oriented document-summarization and aim to summarize a web-document (e.g. , a blog post) by considering not only its content , but also the comments left by its readers . we identify three relations (namely , topic , quotation , and mention) by which comments can be linked to one another , and model the relations in three graphs . the importance of each comment is then scored by : (i) graph-based-method , where the three graphs are merged into a multi-relation graph ; (ii) tensor-based method , where the three graphs are used to construct a 3rd-order tensor . to generate a comments-oriented summary , we extract sentences from the given web-document using either feature-biased approach or uniform-document approach . the former scores sentences to bias keywords derived from comments ; while the latter scores sentences uniformly with comments . in our experiments using a set of blog posts with manually labeled sentences , our proposed summarization methods utilizing comments showed significant improvement over those not using comments . the methods using feature-biased sentence-extraction approach were observed to outperform that using uniform-document approach .
