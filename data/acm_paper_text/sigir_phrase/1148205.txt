adapting ranking-svm to document-retrieval the paper is concerned with applying learning-to-rank to document-retrieval . ranking-svm is a typical method of learning-to-rank . we point out that there are two factors one must consider when applying ranking-svm , in general a `` learning-to-rank '' method , to document-retrieval . first , correctly ranking documents on the top of the result list is crucial for an information-retrieval-system . one must conduct training in a way that such ranked results are accurate . second , the number of relevant documents can vary from query to query . one must avoid training a model biased toward queries with a large number of relevant documents . previously , when existing methods that include ranking-svm were applied to document-retrieval , none of the two factors was taken into consideration . we show it is possible to make modifications in conventional ranking-svm , so it can be better used for document-retrieval . specifically , we modify the `` hinge loss '' function in ranking-svm to deal with the problems described above . we employ two methods to conduct optimization on the loss-function : gradient-descent and quadratic-programming . experimental-results show that our method , referred to as ranking-svm for ir , can outperform the conventional ranking-svm and other existing methods for document-retrieval on two datasets .
