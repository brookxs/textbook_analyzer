advances in a bayesian decision model of user stopping-behavior for scanning the output of an information-retrieval-system the formal-modeling of information-storage-and-retrieval systems has been an important element in the analysis-and-design of these systems . the retrieval mechanism has been viewed as a probablistic decision-problem , often involving utilities . one key element is the evaluation of such retrieval-systems . in this paper , we focus on the impact of the stopping rule , which determines when the user chooses to stop scanning the list of records retrieved in response to a given query . we shall first trace the evolution of the modelling and use of the stopping rule approach . then , we shall briefly report on some recent results in our attempt to better model the generation of stopping rules .
