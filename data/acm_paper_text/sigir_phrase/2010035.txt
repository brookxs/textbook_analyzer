cluster-based-fusion of retrieved lists methods for fusing document lists that were retrieved in response to a query often use retrieval scores (or ranks) of documents in the lists . we present a novel probabilistic fusion approach that utilizes an additional source of rich information , namely , inter-document similarities . specifically , our model integrates information induced from clusters of similar documents created across the lists with that produced by some fusion-method that relies on retrieval scores (ranks) . empirical-evaluation shows that our approach is highly effective for fusion . for example , the performance of our model is consistently better than that of the standard (effective) fusion-method that it integrates . the performance also transcends that of standard fusion of re-ranked lists , where list-re-ranking is based on clusters created from documents in the list .
