algorithmic-mediation for collaborative exploratory-search we describe a new approach to information-retrieval : algorithmic-mediation for intentional , synchronous collaborative exploratory-search . using our system , two or more users with a common information need search together , simultaneously . the collaborative-system provides tools , user-interfaces and , most importantly , algorithmically-mediated retrieval to focus , enhance and augment the team 's search and communication activities . collaborative-search outperformed post hoc merging of similarly instrumented single user runs . algorithmic-mediation improved both collaborative-search (allowing a team of searchers to find relevant-information more efficiently and effectively) , and exploratory-search (allowing the searchers to find relevant-information that can not be found while working individually) .
