probfuse : a probabilistic-approach to data-fusion data-fusion is the combination of the results of independent searches on a document-collection into one single output result-set . it has been shown in the past that this can greatly improve retrieval-effectiveness over that of the individual results.this paper presents probfuse , a probabilistic-approach to data-fusion . probfuse assumes that the performance of the individual input systems on a number of training queries is indicative of their future performance . the fused result-set is based on probabilities of relevance calculated during this training-process . retrieval experiments using data from the trec ad-hoc collection demonstrate that probfuse achieves results superior to that of the popular combmnz fusion-algorithm .
