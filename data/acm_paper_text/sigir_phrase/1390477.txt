exploring question subjectivity prediction in community qa in this paper we begin to investigate how to automatically determine the subjectivity orientation of questions posted by real-users in community-question-answering (cqa) portals . subjective questions seek answers containing private states , such as personal opinion and experience . in contrast , objective questions request objective , verifiable information , often with support from reliable sources . knowing the question orientation would be helpful not only for evaluating answers provided by users , but also for guiding the cqa engine to process questions more intelligently . our experiments on yahoo!-answers data show that our method exhibits promising performance .
