a user-centred evaluation of ranking-algorithms for interactive-query-expansion the evaluation of 6 ranking-algorithms for the ranking of terms for query-expansion is discussed within the context of an investigation of interactive-query-expansion and relevance-feedback in a real operational environment . the yardstick for the evaluation was provided by the user relevance judgements on the lists of the candidate-terms for query-expansion . the evaluation focuses on the similarities in the performance of the different algorithms and how the algorithms with similar performance treat terms .
