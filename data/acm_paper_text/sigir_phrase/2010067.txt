image-annotation based on recommendation-model in this paper , a novel approach based on recommendation-model is proposed for automatic-image-annotation . for any to-be-annotated image , we first select some related images with tags from training-dataset according to their visual-similarity . and then we estimate the initial ratings for tags of the training-images based on tag-ranking method and construct a rating matrix . we also construct a trust matrix based on visual-similarity with a k-nn strategy . then a recommendation-model is built on both matrices to rank candidate tags for the target image . the proposed approach is evaluated using two benchmark image datasets , and experimental-results have indicated its effectiveness .
