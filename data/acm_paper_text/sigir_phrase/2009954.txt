social-context summarization we study a novel problem of social-context summarization for web-documents . traditional summarization research has focused on extracting informative sentences from standard documents . with the rapid growth of online-social-networks , abundant user-generated-content (e.g. , comments) associated with the standard documents is available . which parts in a document are social users really caring about ? how can we generate summaries for standard documents by considering both the informativeness of sentences and interests of social users ? this paper explores such an approach by modeling web-documents and social contexts into a unified-framework . we propose a dual wing factor-graph (dwfg) model , which utilizes the mutual-reinforcement between web-documents and their associated social contexts to generate summaries . an efficient-algorithm is designed to learn the proposed factor-graph model.experimental results on a twitter data-set validate the effectiveness of the proposed model . by leveraging the social-context information , our approach obtains significant improvement (averagely +5.0 \ % -17.3 \ %) over several alternative methods (crf , svm , lr , pr , and doclead) on the performance of summarization .
