parsimonious-language-models for information-retrieval we systematically investigate a new approach to estimating the parameters of language-models for information-retrieval , called parsimonious-language-models . parsimonious-language-models explicitly address the relation between levels of language-models that are typically used for smoothing . as such , they need fewer (non-zero) parameters to describe the data . we apply parsimonious-models at three stages of the retrieval-process : 1) at indexing time ; 2) at search-time ; 3) at feedback time . experimental-results show that we are able to build models that are significantly smaller than standard models , but that still perform at least as well as the standard approaches .
