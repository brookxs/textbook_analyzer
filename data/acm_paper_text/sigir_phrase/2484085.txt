fast document-at-a-time query-processing using two-tier indexes in this paper we present two new algorithms designed to reduce the overall time required to process top-k-queries . these algorithms are based on the document-at-a-time approach and modify the best baseline we found in the literature , blockmax wand (bmw) , to take advantage of a two-tiered index , in which the first tier is a small index containing only the higher impact entries of each inverted list . this small index is used to pre-process the query before accessing a larger index in the second tier , resulting in considerable speeding up the whole process . the first algorithm we propose , named bmw-cs , achieves higher performance , but may result in small changes in the top results provided in the final ranking . the second algorithm , named bmw-t , preserves the top results and , while slower than bmw-cs , it is faster than bmw . in our experiments , bmw-cs was more than 40 times faster than bmw when computing top 10 results , and , while it does not guarantee preserving the top results , it preserved all ranking results evaluated at this level .
