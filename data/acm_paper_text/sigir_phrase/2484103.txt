timeline generation with social-attention timeline generation is an important research task which can help users to have a quick understanding of the overall evolution of any given topic . it thus attracts much attention from research-communities in recent years . nevertheless , existing work on timeline generation often ignores an important-factor , the attention attracted to topics of interest (hereafter termed `` social-attention '') . without taking into consideration social-attention , the generated timelines may not reflect users ' collective interests . in this paper , we study how to incorporate social-attention in the generation of timeline summaries . in particular , for a given topic , we capture social-attention by learning users ' collective interests in the form of word distributions from twitter , which are subsequently incorporated into a unified-framework for timeline summary-generation . we construct four evaluation sets over six diverse topics . we demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to generate both informative and interesting timelines . our work sheds light on the feasibility of incorporating social-attention into traditional text-mining tasks .
