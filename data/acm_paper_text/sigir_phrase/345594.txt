a practical hypertext catergorization method using links and incrementally available class-information as www grows at an increasing speed , a classifier targeted at hypertext has become in high demand . while document-categorization is quite a mature , the issue of utilizing hypertext-structure and hyperlinks has been relatively unexplored . in this paper , we propose a practical method for enhancing both the speed and the quality of hypertext categorization using hyperlinks . in comparison against a recently proposed technique that appears to be the only one of the kind , we obtained up to 18.5 \ % of improvement in effectiveness while reducing the processing-time dramatically . we attempt to explain through experiments what factors contribute to the improvement .
