relevance-feedback and inference-networks relevance-feedback , which modifies queries using judgements of the relevance of a few , highly-ranked documents , has historically been an important method for increasing the performance of information-retrieval-systems . in this paper , we extend the inference-network model introduced by turtle and croft to include relevance-feedback techniques . the difference between relevance-feedback on text abstracts and full text collections is studied . preliminary results for relevance-feedback on the structured-queries supported by the inference net model are also reported .
