multiple approaches to analysing query-diversity in this paper we examine user queries with respect to diversity : providing a mix of results across different interpretations . using two query-log-analysis techniques (click entropy and reformulated queries) , 14.9 million queries from the microsoft live search-log were analysed . we found that a broad range of query-types may benefit from diversification . additionally , although there is a correlation between word ambiguity and the need for diversity , the range of results users may wish to see for an ambiguous-query stretches well beyond traditional notions of word-sense .
