learning-to-rank with ties designing effective ranking-functions is a core problem for information-retrieval and web-search since the ranking-functions directly impact the relevance of the search-results . the problem has been the focus of much of the research at the intersection of web-search and machine-learning , and learning ranking-functions from preference data in particular has recently attracted much interest . the objective of this paper is to empirically examine several objective-functions that can be used for learning ranking-functions from preference data . specifically , we investigate the roles of ties in the learning-process . by ties , we mean preference-judgments that two documents have equal degree of relevance with respect to a query . this type of data has largely been ignored or not properly modeled in the past . in this paper , we analyze the properties of ties and develop novel learning-frameworks which combine ties and preference data using statistical paired-comparison models to improve the performance of learned ranking-functions . the resulting optimization-problems explicitly incorporating ties and preference data are solved using gradient-boosting methods . experimental-studies are conducted using three publicly available data-sets which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new methods .
