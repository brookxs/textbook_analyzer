multiple sources of evidence for xml-retrieval document-centric-xml collections contain text-rich documents , marked up with xml tags . the tags add lightweight-semantics to the text . querying such collections calls for a hybrid-query-language : the text-rich nature of the documents suggest a content-oriented (ir) approach , while the mark-up allows users to add structural constraints to their ir queries . we will show how evidence for relevancy from different sources helps to answer such hybrid-queries . we evaluate our methods using the inex 2003 test-set , and show that structural hints in hybrid-queries help to improve retrieval-effectiveness .
