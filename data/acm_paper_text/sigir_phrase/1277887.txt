bordaconsensus : a new consensus function for soft-cluster-ensembles consensus-clustering is the task of deriving a single labeling by applying a consensus function on a cluster-ensemble . this work introduces bordaconsensus , a new consensus function for soft-cluster-ensembles based on the borda-voting scheme . in contrast to classic , hard consensus functions that operate on labelings , our proposal considers cluster membership information , thus being able to tackle multiclass clustering problems . initial small scale experiments reveal that , compared to state-of-the-art consensus functions , bordaconsensus constitutes a good performance vs. complexity trade-off .
