using odp metadata to personalize search the open-directory-project is clearly one of the largest collaborative efforts to manually annotate web-pages . this effort involves over 65,000 editors and resulted in metadata specifying topic and importance for more than 4 million web-pages . still , given that this number is just about 0.05 percent of the-web pages indexed by google , is this effort enough to make a difference ? in this paper we discuss how these metadata can be exploited to achieve high quality personalized-web-search . first , we address this by introducing an additional criterion for web-page-ranking , namely the distance between a user-profile defined using odp topics and the sets of odp topics covered by each url returned in regular web-search . we empirically show that this enhancement yields better results than current web search using google . then , in the second part of the paper , we investigate the boundaries of biasing pagerank on subtopics of the odp in order to automatically extend these metadata to the whole web .
