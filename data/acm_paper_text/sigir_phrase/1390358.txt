asymmetric-distance-estimation with sketches for similarity-search in high-dimensional spaces efficient similarity-search in high-dimensional spaces is important to content-based-retrieval systems . recent studies have shown that sketches can effectively approximate l 1 distance in high-dimensional spaces , and that filtering with sketches can speed up similarity-search by an order of magnitude . it is a challenge to further reduce the size of sketches , which are already compact , without compromising accuracy of distance-estimation . this paper presents an efficient sketch algorithm for similarity-search with l 2 distances and a novel asymmetric-distance-estimation technique . our new asymmetric estimator takes advantage of the original feature-vector of the query to boost the distance-estimation accuracy . we also apply this asymmetric method to existing sketches for cosine-similarity and l 1 distance . evaluations with datasets extracted from images and telephone records show that our l 2 sketch outperforms existing methods , and the asymmetric estimators consistently improve the accuracy of different sketch methods . to achieve the same search-quality , asymmetric estimators can reduce the sketch size by 10 \ % to 40 \ % .
