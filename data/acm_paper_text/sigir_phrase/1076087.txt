pagerank without hyperlinks : structural-re-ranking using links induced by language-models inspired by the pagerank and hits (hubs-and-authorities) algorithms for web-search , we propose a structural-re-ranking approach to ad-hoc-information-retrieval : we reorder the documents in an initially retrieved set by exploiting asymmetric relationships between them . specifically , we consider generation links , which indicate that the language-model induced from one document assigns high probability to the text of another ; in doing so , we take care to prevent bias against long documents . we study a number of re-ranking criteria based on measures of centrality in the graphs formed by generation links , and show that integrating centrality into standard language-model-based retrieval is quite effective at improving precision-at-top-ranks .
