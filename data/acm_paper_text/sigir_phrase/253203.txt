the efficiency of inverted-index and cluster searches the processing-time and disk space requirements of an inverted-index and top-down cluster search are compared . the cluster search is shown to use both more time and more disk space , mostly due to the large number of cluster centroids needed by the search . when shorter centroids are used , the efficiency of the cluster search improves , but the inverted-index search remains more efficient .
