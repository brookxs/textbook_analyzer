wikipedia in the pocket : indexing technology for near-duplicate-detection and high similarity-search we develop and implement a new indexing technology which allows us to use complete (and possibly very-large) documents as queries , while having a retrieval-performance comparable to a standard term query . our approach aims at retrieval tasks such as near-duplicate-detection and high similarity-search . to demonstrate the performance of our technology we have compiled the search-index `` wikipedia in the pocket '' , which contains about 2 million english and german wikipedia articles . 1 this index -- along with a search-interface -- fits on a conventional cd (0.7 gigabyte) . the ingredients of our indexing technology are similarity hashing and minimal-perfect-hashing .
