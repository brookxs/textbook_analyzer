the role of knowledge in conceptual retrieval : a study in the domain of clinical medicine despite its intuitive appeal , the hypothesis that retrieval at the level of `` concepts '' should outperform purely term-based approaches remains unverified empirically . in addition , the use of `` knowledge '' has not consistently resulted in performance gains . after identifying possible reasons for previous negative results , we present a novel framework for `` conceptual retrieval '' that articulates the types of knowledge that are important for information-seeking . we instantiate this general-framework in the domain of clinical medicine based on the principles of evidence-based-medicine (ebm) . experiments show that an ebm-based scoring algorithm dramatically outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline that employs only term statistics . ablation studies further yield a better understanding of the performance contributions of different components . finally , we discuss how other domains can benefit from knowledge-based-approaches .
