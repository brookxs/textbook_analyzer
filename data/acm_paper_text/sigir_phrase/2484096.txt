compact query-term selection using topically related text many recent and highly effective retrieval-models for long-queries use query-reformulation methods that jointly optimize term-weights and term-selection . these methods learn using word context and global context but typically fail to capture query-context . in this paper , we present a novel term-ranking algorithm , phrank , that extends work on markov-chain frameworks for query-expansion to select compact and focused terms from within a query itself . this focuses queries so that one to five terms in an unweighted model achieve better retrieval-effectiveness than weighted term-selection models that use up to 30 terms . phrank terms are also typically compact and contain 1-2 words compared to competing models that use query subsets up to 7 words long . phrank captures query-context with an affinity-graph constructed using word-co-occurrence in pseudo-relevant documents . a random-walk of the graph is used for term-ranking in combination with discrimination weights . empirical-evaluation using newswire and web collections demonstrates that performance of reformulated queries is significantly improved for long-queries and at least as good for short , keyword-queries compared to highly competitive information-retrieval (ir) models .
