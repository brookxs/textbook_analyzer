one-sided measures for evaluating ranked-retrieval effectiveness with spontaneous-conversational-speech early speech-retrieval experiments focused on news broadcasts , for which adequate automatic-speech-recognition (asr) accuracy could be obtained . like newspapers , news broadcasts are a manually selected and arranged set of stories . evaluation-designs reflected that , using known story-boundaries as a basis for evaluation . substantial advances in asr-accuracy now make it possible to build search systems for some types of spontaneous-conversational-speech , but present evaluation-designs continue to rely on known topic boundaries that are no longer well matched to the nature of the materials . we propose a new class of measures for speech-retrieval based on manual-annotation of points at which a user with specific topical interests would wish replay to begin .
