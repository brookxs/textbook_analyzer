summarizing the differences in multilingual news there usually exist many news-articles written in different languages about a hot news event . the news-articles in different languages are written in different ways to reflect different standpoints . for example , the chinese news agencies and the western news agencies have published many articles to report the same news of `` liu xiaobo 's nobel-prize '' in chinese and english languages , respectively . the chinese news articles and the english news articles share something about the news fact in common , but they focus on different aspects in order to reflect different standpoints about the event . in this paper , we investigate the task of multilingual news summarization for the purpose of finding and summarizing the major differences between the news-articles about the same event in the chinese and english languages . we propose a novel constrained-co-ranking (c-corank) method for addressing this special task . the c-corank method adds the constraints between the difference score and the common score of each sentence to the co-ranking process . evaluation results on the manually labeled test-set with 15 news topics show the effectiveness of our proposed method , and the constrained-co-ranking method can outperform a few baselines and the typical co-ranking method .
