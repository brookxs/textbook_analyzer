the utility of linguistic rules in opinion-mining online-product-reviews are one of the important opinion sources on the web . this paper studies the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive or negative) of opinions expressed on product-features in reviews . most existing approaches use a set of opinion-words for the purpose . however , the semantic orientations of many words are context-dependent . in this paper , we propose to use some linguistic rules to deal with the problem together with a new opinion aggregation function . extensive experiments show that these rules and the function are highly effective . a system , called opinion observer , has also been built .
