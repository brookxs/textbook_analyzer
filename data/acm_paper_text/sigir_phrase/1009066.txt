sentence-completion we discuss a retrieval-model in which the task is to complete a sentence , given an initial fragment , and given an application-specific document-collection . this model is motivated by administrative and call-center environments , in which users have to write documents with a certain repetitiveness . we formulate the problem setting and discuss appropriate performance-metrics . we present an index-based-retrieval algorithm and a cluster-based approach , and evaluate our algorithms using collections of emails that have been written by two distinct service-centers .
