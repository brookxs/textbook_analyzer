using manually-built web-directories for automatic-evaluation of known-item retrieval information-retrieval-system evaluation is complicated by the need for manually assessed relevance-judgments . large manually-built directories on the web open the door to new evaluation procedures . by assuming that web-pages are the known relevant items for queries that exactly match their title , we use the odp (open-directory-project) and looksmart directories for system-evaluation . we test our approach with a sample from a log of ten million web-queries and show that such an evaluation is unbiased in terms of the directory used , stable with respect to the query set selected , and correlated with a reasonably large manual-evaluation .
