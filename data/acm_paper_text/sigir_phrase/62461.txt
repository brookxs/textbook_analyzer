concept_based retrieval in classical ir systems this paper describes some aspects of a project with the aim of developing a user-friendly interface to a classical information retrieval (ir) system in order to improve the effectiveness of retrieval . the character by character approach to ir has been abandoned in favor of an approach based on the meaning of both the queries and the texts containing the information to be sought . the concept-space , locally derived from a thesaurus , is used to represent a query as well as documents retrieved in atomic concept units . dependencies between the search-terms are taken into account . the meanings of the query and the retrieved documents (results of elementary logical conjuncts (elcs)) are compared . the ranking-method on the semantical level is used in connection with existing data of a classical ir-system . the user enters queries without using complex boolean-expressions .
