unsupervised-query-segmentation using clickthrough for information-retrieval query-segmentation is an important task toward understanding queries accurately , which is essential for improving search-results . existing segmentation models either use labeled-data to predict the segmentation boundaries , for which the training-data is expensive to collect , or employ unsupervised strategy based on a large text corpus , which might be inaccurate because of the lack of relevant-information . in this paper , we propose a probabilistic-model to exploit clickthrough-data for query-segmentation , where the model-parameters are estimated via an efficient em-algorithm . we further study how to properly interpret the segmentation results and utilize them to improve retrieval-accuracy . specifically , we propose an integrated language-model based on the standard bigram-language-model to exploit the probabilistic structure obtained through query-segmentation . experiment results on two datasets show that our segmentation-model outperforms existing segmentation models . furthermore , extensive experiments on a large retrieval dataset reveals that the results of query-segmentation can be leveraged to improve retrieval relevance by using the proposed integrated language-model .
