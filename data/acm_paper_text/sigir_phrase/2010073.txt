collective topic-modeling for heterogeneous-networks in this paper , we propose a joint probabilistic-topic-model for simultaneously modeling the contents of multi-typed objects of a heterogeneous-information-network . the intuition behind our model is that different objects of the heterogeneous-network share a common set of latent topics so as to adjust the multinomial distributions over topics for different objects collectively . experimental-results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the tasks of topic-modeling and object clustering .
