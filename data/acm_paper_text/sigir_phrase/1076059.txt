simfusion : measuring similarity using unified relationship matrix in this paper we use a unified relationship matrix (urm) to represent a set of heterogeneous-data objects (e.g. , web-pages , queries) and their interrelationships (e.g. , hyperlinks , user click-through sequences) . we claim that iterative computations over the urm can help overcome the data-sparseness-problem and detect latent relationships among heterogeneous-data objects , thus , can improve the quality-of-information applications that require com - bination of information from heterogeneous-sources . to support our claim , we present a unified similarity-calculating algorithm , simfusion . by iteratively computing over the urm , simfusion can effectively integrate relationships from heterogeneous-sources when measuring the similarity of two data objects . experiments based on a web-search-engine query-log and a web-page-collection demonstrate that simfusion can improve similarity-measurement of web-objects over both traditional content-based algorithms and the cutting edge simrank algorithm .
