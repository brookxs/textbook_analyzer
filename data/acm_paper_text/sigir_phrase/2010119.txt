enhancing mobile-search using web-search log-data mobile-search is still in infancy compared with general purpose web-search . with limited training-data and weak relevance features , the ranking-performance in mobile-search is far from satisfactory . to address this problem , we propose to leverage the knowledge of web-search to enhance the ranking of mobile-search . in this paper , we first develop an equivalent page conversion between web-search and mobile search , then we design a few novel ranking-features , generated from the click-through-data in web-search , for estimating the relevance of mobile-search . large-scale evaluations demonstrate that the knowledge from web-search is quite effective for boosting the relevance of ranking on mobile-search .
