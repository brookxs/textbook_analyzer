improving text-classification accuracy using topic-modeling over an additional corpus the world-wide-web has many document-repositories that can act as valuable sources of additional data for various machine-learning tasks . in this paper , we propose a method of improving text-classification accuracy by using such an additional corpus that can easily be obtained from the-web . this additional corpus can be unlabeled and independent of the given classification-task . the method proposed here uses topic-modeling to extract a set of topics from the additional corpus . those extracted topics then act as additional features of the data of the given classification-task . an evaluation on the rcv1 dataset shows significant improvement over a baseline method .
