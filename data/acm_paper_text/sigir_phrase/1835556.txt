properties of optimally weighted data-fusion in cbmir content-based multimedia information-retrieval (cbmir) systems which leverage multiple retrieval experts (e n) often employ a weighting-scheme when combining expert results through data-fusion . typically however a query will comprise multiple query images (i m) leading to potentially n m weights to be assigned . because of the large number of potential weights , existing approaches impose a hierarchy for data-fusion , such as uniformly combining query image results from a single retrieval expert into a single list and then weighting the results of each expert . in this paper we will demonstrate that this approach is sub-optimal and leads to the poor state of cbmir performance in benchmarking evaluations . we utilize an optimization-method known as coordinate ascent to discover the optimal set of weights (| e n | ? | i m |) which demonstrates a dramatic difference between known results and the theoretical maximum . we find that imposing common combinatorial hierarchies for data-fusion will half the optimal-performance that can be achieved . by examining the optimal weight sets at the topic level , we observe that approximately 15 \ % of the weights (from set | e n | ? | i m |) for any given query , are assigned 70 \ % -82 \ % of the total weight mass for that topic . furthermore we discover that the ideal distribution of weights follows a log-normal-distribution . we find that we can achieve up to 88 \ % of the performance of fully optimized query using just these 15 \ % of the weights . our investigation was conducted on trecvid evaluations 2003 to 2007 inclusive and imageclefphoto 2007 , totalling 181 search topics optimized over a combined collection-size of 661,213 images and 1,594 topic images .
