time-based query-performance predictors query-performance-prediction is aimed at predicting the retrieval-effectiveness that a query will achieve with respect to a particular ranking-model . in this paper , we study query-performance-prediction for a ranking-model that explicitly incorporates the time-dimension into ranking . different time-based predictors are proposed as analogous to existing keyword-based predictors . in order to improve predicting performance , we combine different predictors using linear-regression and neural-networks . extensive experiments are conducted using queries and relevance-judgments obtained by crowdsourcing .
