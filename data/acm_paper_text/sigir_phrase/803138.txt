a block-structured query-language for accessing a relational-data-base this paper describes a b lock s tructured q uery l anguage (bsql) to be used with relational-data-bases . the syntax of the language is presented and discussed . facilities of the language are illustrated by examples of actual queries . in particular we demonstrate the ability of bsql to obtain useful information from a relational-data-base that is incomplete . a relational-calculus is then presented which forms a basis for a formalism which precisely describes the semantics of bsql . finally , comparative examples with other query-languages are given .
