building a web thesaurus from web link structure thesaurus has been widely used in many applications , including information-retrieval , natural-language-processing , and question-answering . in this paper , we propose a novel approach to automatically constructing a domain-specific-thesaurus from the-web using link-structure information . the proposed approach is able to identify new terms and reflect the latest relationship between terms as the-web evolves . first , a set of high quality and representative websites of a specific domain is selected . after filtering out navigational links , link-analysis is applied to each website to obtain its content-structure . finally , the thesaurus is constructed by merging the content-structures of the selected websites . the experimental-results on automatic-query-expansion based on our constructed thesaurus show 20 \ % improvement in search precision compared to the baseline .
