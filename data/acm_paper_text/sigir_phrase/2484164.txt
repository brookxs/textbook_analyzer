towards retrieving relevant-information graphics information-retrieval-research has made significant progress in the retrieval of text-documents and images . however , relatively little attention has been given to the retrieval of information-graphics (non-pictorial images such as bar charts and line-graphs) despite their proliferation in popular media such as newspapers and magazines . our goal is to build a system for retrieving bar charts and line-graphs that reasons about the content of the graphic itself in deciding its relevance to the user-query . this paper presents the first steps toward such a system , with a focus on identifying the category of intended message of potentially relevant bar charts and line-graphs . our learned model achieves accuracy higher than 80 % on a corpus of collected user queries .
