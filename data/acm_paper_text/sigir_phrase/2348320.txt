to index or not to index : time-space trade-offs in search-engines with positional ranking-functions positional ranking-functions , widely used in web-search-engines , improve result quality by exploiting the positions of the query terms within documents . however , it is well known that positional indexes demand large amounts of extra space , typically about three times the space of a basic nonpositional index . textual data , on the other hand , is needed to produce text-snippets . in this paper , we study time-space trade-offs for search-engines with positional ranking-functions and text snippet-generation . we consider both index-based and non-index based alternatives for positional data . we aim to answer the question of whether one should index positional data or not . we show that there is a wide range of practical time-space trade-offs . moreover , we show that both position and textual data can be stored using about 71 % of the space used by traditional positional indexes , with a minor increase in query time . this yields considerable space-savings and outperforms , both in space and time , recent alternatives from the literature . we also propose several efficient compressed text-representations for snippet-generation , which are able to use about half of the space of current state-of-the-art alternatives with little impact in query-processing time .
