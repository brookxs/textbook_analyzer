adaptive-information-retrieval : using a connectionist-representation to retrieve and learn about documents air represents a connectionist approach to the task of information-retrieval . the system uses relevance-feedback from its users to change its representation of authors , index-terms and documents so that , over time , air improves at its task . the result is a representation of the consensual meaning of keywords and documents shared by some group of users . the central focus goal of this paper is to use our experience with air to highlight those characteristics of connectionist representations that make them particularly appropriate for ir applications . we argue that this associative representation is a natural generalization of traditional ir techniques , and that connectionist-learning techniques are effective in this setting .
