a new approach to text-searching we introduce a family of simple and fast-algorithms for solving the classical string-matching problem , string-matching with do n't care symbols and complement symbols , and multiple-patterns . in addition we solve the same problems allowing up to k mismatches . among the features of these algorithms are that they are real-time algorithms , they do n't need to buffer the input , and they are suitable to be implemented in hardware .
