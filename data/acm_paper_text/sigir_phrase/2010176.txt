search-engines that learn online the goal of my research is to develop self-learning search-engines , that can learn online , i.e. , directly from interactions with actual users . such systems can continuously adapt to user-preferences throughout their lifetime , leading to better search-performance in settings where expensive manual tuning is infeasible . challenges that are addressed in my work include the development of effective online-learning-to-rank algorithms for ir , user aspects , and evaluation .
