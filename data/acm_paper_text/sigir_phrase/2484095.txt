term level search-result-diversification current approaches for search-result-diversification have been categorized as either implicit or explicit . the implicit approach assumes each document represents its own topic , and promotes diversity by selecting documents for different topics based on the difference of their vocabulary . on the other hand , the explicit approach models the set of query topics , or aspects . while the former approach is generally less effective , the latter usually depends on a manually created description of the query-aspects , the automatic-construction of which has proven difficult . this paper introduces a new approach : term-level diversification . instead of modeling the set of query-aspects , which are typically represented as coherent groups of terms , our approach uses terms without the grouping . our results on the clueweb collection show that the grouping of topic terms provides very little benefit to diversification compared to simply using the terms themselves . consequently , we demonstrate that term-level diversification , with topic terms identified automatically from the search-results using a simple greedy-algorithm , significantly outperforms methods that attempt to create a full topic-structure for diversification .
