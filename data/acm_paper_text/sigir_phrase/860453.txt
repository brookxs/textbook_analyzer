using terminological-feedback for web-search refinement : a log-based study although interactive-query reformulation has been actively studied in the laboratory , little is known about the actual behavior of web searchers who are offered terminological-feedback along with their search-results . we analyze log sessions for two groups of users interacting with variants of the altavista search-engine - a baseline group given no terminological-feedback and a feedback group to whom twelve refinement terms are offered along with the search-results . we examine uptake , refinement effectiveness , conditions of use , and refinement-type preferences . although our measure of overall session `` success '' shows no difference between outcomes for the two groups , we find evidence that a subset of those users presented with terminological-feedback do make effective use of it on a continuing basis .
