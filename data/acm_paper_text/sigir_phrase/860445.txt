quantitative-evaluation of passage-retrieval algorithms for question-answering passage-retrieval is an important component common to many question-answering-systems . because most evaluations of question-answering-systems focus on end-to-end-performance , comparison of common components becomes difficult . to address this shortcoming , we present a quantitative-evaluation of various passage-retrieval algorithms for question-answering , implemented in a framework called pauchok . we present three important findings : boolean querying schemes perform well in the question-answering-task . the performance-differences between various passage-retrieval algorithms vary with the choice of document retriever , which suggests significant interactions between document-retrieval and passage-retrieval . the best algorithms in our evaluation employ density-based measures for scoring query terms . our results reveal future-directions for passage-retrieval and question-answering .
