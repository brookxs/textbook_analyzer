social-annotation in query-expansion : a machine-learning-approach automatic-query-expansion technologies have been proven to be effective in many information-retrieval-tasks . most existing approaches are based on the assumption that the most informative terms in top-retrieved documents can be viewed as context of the query and thus can be used for query-expansion . one problem with these approaches is that some of the expansion terms extracted from feedback documents are irrelevant to the query , and thus may hurt the retrieval-performance . in social-annotations , users provide different keywords describing the respective web-pages from various aspects . these features may be used to boost ir performance . however , to date , the potential of social-annotation for this task has been largely unexplored . in this paper , we explore the possibility and potential of social-annotation as a new resource for extracting useful expansion terms . in particular , we propose a term-ranking approach based on social-annotation resource . the proposed approach consists of two phases : (1) in the first phase , we propose a term-dependency method to choose the most likely expansion terms ; (2) in the second phase , we develop a machine-learning method for term-ranking , which is learnt from the statistics of the candidate expansion terms , using listnet . experimental-results on three trec test-collections show that the retrieval-performance can be improved when the term-ranking method is used . in addition , we also demonstrate that terms selected by the term-dependency method from social-annotation resources are beneficial to improve the retrieval-performance .
