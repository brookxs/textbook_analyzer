computerised information-retrieval-systems for open learning the paper starts with a theoretical consideration of the requirements for a computerised information-retrieval-system to aid open learning within an educational establishment . the requirements for such a system include consideration of the need to fulfill information-retrieval objectives and also educational objectives . these requirements are then considered in the context of the theoretical information-retrieval work which has been carried out by belkin and others and takes into account the representation of the user 's anomalous-state-of-knowledge . the paper then considers the practical-problems of trying to implement such a system . attention is focussed on the use of current and developing information-technology to fulfill both information-retrieval and educational objectives . it is shown that current systems as exemplified by prestel , dialog , browse and staf individually will not fulfill the requirements of this system . however , in combination these types of systems should be quite suitable . another solution is the use of an expert-system . the paper also considers the use of an expert-system to `` replace '' the traditional teacher .
