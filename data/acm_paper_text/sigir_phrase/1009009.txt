length-normalization in xml-retrieval xml-retrieval is a departure from standard document-retrieval in which each individual xml element , ranging from italicized words or phrases to full blown articles , is a potentially retrievable unit . the distribution of xml element lengths is unlike what we usually observe in standard document-collections , prompting us to revisit the issue of document-length-normalization . we perform a comparative-analysis of arbitrary elements versus relevant elements , and show the importance of length as a parameter for xml-retrieval . within the language-modeling framework , we investigate a range of techniques that deal with length either directly or indirectly . we observe a length bias introduced by the amount of smoothing , and show the importance of extreme length priors for xml-retrieval . we also show that simply removing shorter elements from the index (by introducing a cut-off value) does not create an appropriate document-length-normalization . even after increasing the minimal size of xml elements occurring in the index , the importance of an extreme length bias remains .
