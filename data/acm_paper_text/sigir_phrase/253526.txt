concepts of the cover coefficient-based clustering methodology document-clustering has several unresolved problems . among them are high time-and-space-complexity , difficulty of determining similarity thresholds , order dependence , nonuniform document distribution in clusters , and arbitrariness in determination of various cluster intiators . to overcome these problems to some degree , the cover coefficient_based clustering methodology has been introduced . the concepts used in this methodology have created certain new concepts , relationships , and measures such as the effect of indexing on clustering , an optimal vocabulary generation for indexing , and a new matching-function . these new concepts are discussed . the result of performance experiments that show the effectiveness of the clustering methodology and the matching-function are also included . in these experiments , it has been also observed that the majority of the documents obtained in a search are concentrated in a few clusters containing a low percentage of documents of the database .
