building and applying a concept-hierarchy representation of a user-profile term-dependence is a natural consequence of language-use . its successful representation has been a long standing goal for information-retrieval-research . we present a methodology for the construction of a concept-hierarchy that takes into account the three basic dimensions of term-dependence . we also introduce a document-evaluation function that allows the use of the concept-hierarchy as a user-profile for information-filtering . initial experimental-results indicate that this is a promising approach for incorporating term-dependence in the way documents are filtered .
