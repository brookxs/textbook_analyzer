using statistical-testing in the evaluation of retrieval experiments the standard strategies for evaluation based on precision-and-recall are examined and their relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed . in particular , it is suggested that relevance-feedback be evaluated from the perspective of the user . a number of different statistical-tests are described for determining if differences in performance between retrieval-methods are significant . these tests have often been ignored in the past because most are based on an assumption of normality which is not strictly valid for the standard performance-measures . however , one can test this assumption using simple diagnostic plots , and if it is a poor approximation , there are a number of non-parametric alternatives .
