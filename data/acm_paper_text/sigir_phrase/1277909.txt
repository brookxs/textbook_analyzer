clustering short-texts using wikipedia subscribers to the popular news or blog feeds (rss/atom) often face the problem of information-overload as these feed sources usually deliver large number of items periodically . one solution to this problem could be clustering similar items in the feed-reader to make the information more manageable for a user . clustering items at the feed-reader end is a challenging task as usually only a small part of the actual article is received through the feed . in this paper , we propose a method of improving the accuracy of clustering short-texts by enriching their representation with additional features from wikipedia . empirical-results indicate that this enriched representation of text items can substantially improve the clustering accuracy when compared to the conventional bag-of-words representation .
