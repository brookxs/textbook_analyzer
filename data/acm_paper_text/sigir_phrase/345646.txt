collaborative-filtering and the generalized vector-space-model (poster session) collaborative-filtering is a technique for recommending documents to users based on how similar their tastes are to other users . if two users tend to agree on what they like , the system will recommend the same documents to them . the generalized vector-space-model of information-retrieval represents a document by a vector of its similarities to all other documents . the process of collaborative-filtering is nearly identical to the process of retrieval using gvsm in a matrix of user-ratings . using this observation , a model for filtering collaboratively using document-content is possible .
