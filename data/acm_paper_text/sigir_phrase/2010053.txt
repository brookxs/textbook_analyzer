associative tag-recommendation exploiting multiple textual-features this work addresses the task of recommending relevant tags to a target object by jointly exploiting three-dimensions of the problem : (i) term-co-occurrence with tags pre-assigned to the target object , (ii) terms extracted from multiple textual-features , and (iii) several metrics of tag-relevance . in particular , we propose several new heuristic-methods , which extend state-of-the-art strategies by including new metrics that try to capture how accurately a candidate-term describes the object 's content . we also exploit two learning-to-rank (l2r) techniques , namely ranksvm and genetic-programming , for the task of generating ranking-functions that combine multiple metrics to accurately estimate the relevance of a tag to a given object . we evaluate all proposed methods in various scenarios for three popular web-2.0-applications , namely , lastfm , youtube and yahoovideo . we found that our new heuristics greatly outperform the methods on which they are based , producing gains in precision of up to 181 \ % , as well as another state-of-the-art technique , with improvements in precision of up to 40 \ % over the best baseline in any scenario . further improvements can also be achieved with the new l2r strategies , which have the additional advantage of being quite flexible and extensible to exploit other aspects of the tag-recommendation problem .
