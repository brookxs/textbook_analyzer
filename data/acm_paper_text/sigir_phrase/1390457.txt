structuring collections with scatter/gather extensions a major component of sense-making is organizing -- grouping , labeling , and summarizing -- the data at hand in order to form a useful mental-model , a necessary precursor to identifying missing-information and to reasoning about the data . previous work has shown the scatter/gather model to be useful in exploratory activities that occur when users encounter unknown document-collections . however , the topic-structure communicated by scatter/gather is closely tied to the behavior of the underlying clustering-algorithm ; this structure may not reflect the mental-model most applicable to the information-need . in this paper we describe the initial design of a mixed-initiative information structuring tool that leverages aspects of the well-studied scatter/gather model but permits the user to impose their own desired structure when necessary .
