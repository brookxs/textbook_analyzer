detecting dominant locations from search queries accurately and effectively detecting the locations where search queries are truly about has huge potential impact on increasing search-relevance . in this paper , we define a search-query 's dominant-location (qdl) and propose a solution to correctly detect it . qdl is geographical-location (s) associated with a query in collective human-knowledge , i.e. , one or few prominent locations agreed by majority of people who know the answer to the query . qdl is a subjective and collective attribute of search queries and we are able to detect qdls from both queries containing geographical-location names and queries not containing them . the key challenges to qdl detection include false-positive suppression (not all contained location-names in queries mean geographical locations) , and detecting implied locations by the context of the query . in our solution , a query is recursively broken into atomic tokens according to its most popular web-usage for reducing false-positives . if we do not find a dominant-location in this step , we mine the top search-results and/or query-logs (with different approaches discussed in this paper) to discover implicit-query locations . our large-scale experiments on recent msn search queries show that our query location detection solution has consistent high accuracy for all query frequency ranges .
