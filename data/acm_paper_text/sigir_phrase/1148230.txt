distributed-query sampling : a quality-conscious approach we present an adaptive distributed query-sampling framework that is quality-conscious for extracting high-quality text-database samples . the framework divides the query-based-sampling process into an initial seed sampling phase and a quality-aware iterative sampling phase . in the second phase the sampling process is dynamically scheduled based on estimated database-size and-quality parameters derived during the previous sampling process . the unique characteristic of our adaptive query-based-sampling framework is its self-learning and self-configuring ability based on the overall quality of all text-databases under consideration . we introduce three quality-conscious sampling schemes for estimating database quality , and our initial results show that the proposed framework supports higher-quality document-sampling than existing approaches .
