solving grammatical ambiguities within a surface syntactical-parser for automatic-indexing this paper describes linguistic-tools specifically designed for performant automatic-indexing of natural-language-texts . by performant indexing , we mean the ability of the system to extract noun-phrases (considered as main conceptual frames regarding text-content) without processing full syntactic-analysis of sentences (surface analyzer) both with its ability in learning unknown words . the paper describes the overall principles of this parser , emphasizing the use of syntactic networks and precedence matrix to fulfil the above goals of reducing the analysis cost and infering new vocabularies without interrupting the indexing process .
