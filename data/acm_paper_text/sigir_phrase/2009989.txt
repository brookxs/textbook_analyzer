mining weakly labeled web-facial-images for search-based face-annotation in this paper , we investigate a search-based face-annotation framework by mining weakly labeled facial-images that are freely available on the internet . a key component of such a search-based annotation paradigm is to build a database of facial-images with accurate labels . this is however challenging since facial-images on the www are often noisy and incomplete . to improve the label quality of raw web-facial-images , we propose an effective unsupervised label refinement (ulr) approach for refining the labels of web-facial-images by exploring machine-learning-techniques . we develop effective optimization-algorithms to solve the large-scale-learning tasks efficiently , and conduct an extensive empirical-study on a web facial image-database with 400 persons and 40,000 web-facial-images . encouraging results showed that the proposed ulr technique can significantly boost the performance of the promising search-based face-annotation scheme .
