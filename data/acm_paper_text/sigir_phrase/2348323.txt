a semi-supervised-approach to modeling web-search satisfaction web-search is an interactive-process that involves actions from web-search users and responses from the search-engine . many research efforts have been made to address the problem of understanding search-behavior in general . some of this work focused on predicting whether a particular user has succeeded in achieving her search-goal or not . most of these studies have faced the problem of the lack of reliable labeled-data to learn from . unlike labeled-data , unlabeled-data recording behavioral-signals in web-search is widely available in search-logs . in this work , we study the plausibility of using labeled and unlabeled-data to learn better models-of-user behavior that can be used to predict search-success more effectively . we present a semi-supervised-approach to modeling web-search satisfaction . the proposed approach can use either labeled-data only or both labeled and unlabeled-data . we show that the proposed model outperforms previous methods for modeling search-success using labeled-data . we also show that adding unlabeled-data improves the effectiveness of the proposed models and that the proposed method outperforms other strong semi-supervised baselines .
