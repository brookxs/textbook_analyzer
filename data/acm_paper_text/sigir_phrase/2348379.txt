mining the-web for points-of-interest a point-of-interest (poi) is a focused geographic entity such as a landmark , a school , an historical building , or a business . points-of-interest are the basis for most of the data supporting location-based-applications . in this paper we propose to curate pois from online-sources by bootstrapping training-data from web-snippets , seeded by pois gathered from social-media . this large-corpus is used to train a sequential tagger to recognize mentions of pois in text . using wikipedia data as the training-data , we can identify pois in free-text with an accuracy that is 116 % better than the-state-of-the-art poi identifier in terms of precision , and 50 % better in terms of recall . we show that using foursquare and gowalla checkins as seeds to bootstrap training-data from web-snippets , we can improve precision between 16 % and 52 % , and recall between 48 % and 187 % over the state-of-the-art . the name of a poi is not sufficient , as the poi must also be associated with a set of geographic coordinates . our method increases the number of pois that can be localized nearly three-fold , from 134 to 395 in a sample of 400 , with a median localization accuracy of less than one kilometer .
