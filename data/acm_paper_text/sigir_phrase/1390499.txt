wisa : a novel web-image semantic-analysis-system we present a novel web-image semantic-analysis (wisa) system , which explores the problem of adaptively modeling the distributions of the semantic labels of the-web image on its surrounding text . to deal with this problem , we employ a new piecewise penalty weighted regression-model to learn the weights of the contributions of the different parts of the surrounding text to the semantic labels of images . experimental-results on a real web-image data-set show that it can improve the performance of web-image semantic-annotation significantly .
