surrogate subsets : a free space management-strategy for the index of a text-retrieval-system this paper presents a new data-structure and an associated strategy to be utilized by indexing facilities for text-retrieval-systems . the paper starts by reviewing some of the goals that may be considered when designing such an index and continues with a small survey of various current strategies . it then presents an indexing strategy referred to as surrogate subsets discussing its appropriateness in the light of the specified goals . various design-issues and implementation details are discussed . our strategy requires that a surrogate file be divided into a large number of subsets separated by free space which will allow the index to expand when new material is appended to the database . experimental-results report on the utilization of free space when the database is enlarged .
