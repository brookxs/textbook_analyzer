an evaluation of term-dependence models in information-retrieval in practical retrieval environments the assumption is normally made that the terms assigned to the documents of a collection occur independently of each other . the term independence-assumption is unrealistic in many cases , but its use leads to a simple retrieval algorithm . more realistic retrieval-systems take into account dependencies between certain term pairs and possibly between term triples . in this study , methods are outlined for generating dependency factors for term pairs and term triples and for using them in retrieval . evaluation output is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested methodologies .
