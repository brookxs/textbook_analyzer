flat vs. hierarchical phrase-based-translation models for cross-language-information-retrieval although context-independent word-based approaches remain popular for cross-language-information-retrieval , many recent studies have shown that integrating insights from modern statistical-machine-translation systems can lead to substantial improvements in effectiveness . in this paper , we compare flat and hierarchical phrase-based-translation models for query-translation . both approaches yield significantly better results than either a token-based or a one-best translation baseline on standard test-collections . the choice of model manifests interesting tradeoffs in terms of effectiveness , efficiency , and model compactness .
