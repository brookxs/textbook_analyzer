searching databases for sematically-related schemas in this paper , we address the problem of searching schema databases for semantically-related schemas . we first give a method of finding semantic-similarity between pair-wise schemas based on tokenization , part-of-speech-tagging , word expansion , and ontology-matching . we then address the problem of indexing the schema database through a semantic hash-table . matching schemas in the database are found by hashing the query-attributes and recording peaks in the histogram of schema hits . results indicated a 90 \ % improvement in search-performance while maintaining high precision and recall .
