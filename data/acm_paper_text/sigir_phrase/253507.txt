handling multiple data bases in document-retrieval there is no such thing as a standard document . bibliographic-information comes in a wide variety of formats . existing retrieval-systems handle different document styles either by creating an artificial document-type or by providing different and independent data-bases . neither approach seems satisfactory . in this paper we describe a data-model which we feel is more appropriate for document-representation and show it can handle the multiple document-type problem quite naturally .
