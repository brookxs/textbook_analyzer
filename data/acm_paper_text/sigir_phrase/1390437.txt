a simple and efficient sampling-method for estimating ap and ndcg we consider the problem of large-scale retrieval-evaluation . recently two methods based on random-sampling were proposed as a solution to the extensive effort required to judge tens of thousands of documents . while the first method proposed by aslam et al. [1] is quite accurate and efficient , it is overly complex , making it difficult to be used by the community , and while the second method proposed by yilmaz et al. , infap [14] , is relatively simple , it is less efficient than the former since it employs uniform random-sampling from the set of complete judgments . further , none of these methods provide confidence-intervals on the estimated values . the contribution of this paper is threefold : (1) we derive confidence-intervals for infap , (2) we extend infap to incorporate nonrandom relevance-judgments by employing stratified random-sampling , hence combining the efficiency of stratification with the simplicity of random-sampling , (3) we describe how this approach can be utilized to estimate ndcg from incomplete-judgments . we validate the proposed methods using trec-data and demonstrate that these new methods can be used to incorporate nonrandom samples , as were available in trec terabyte track ' 06 .
