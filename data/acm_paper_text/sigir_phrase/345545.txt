ir-evaluation methods for retrieving highly relevant documents this paper proposes evaluation-methods based on the use of non-dichotomous relevance-judgements in ir experiments . it is argued that evaluation-methods should credit ir methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents . this is desirable from the user point-of-view in modern large ir environments . the proposed methods are (1) a novel application of p-r curves and average-precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance , and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulative-gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position . we then demonstrate the use of these evaluation-methods in a case-study on the effectiveness of query-types , based on combinations of query structures and expansion , in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance . the test was run with a best match retrieval-system (in-query 1) in a text-database consisting of newspaper articles . the results indicate that the tested strong-query structures are most effective in retrieving highly relevant documents . the differences between the query-types are practically essential and statistically significant . more generally , the novel evaluation-methods and the case demonstrate that non-dichotomous relevance-assessments are applicable in ir experiments , may reveal interesting phenomena , and allow harder testing of ir methods .
