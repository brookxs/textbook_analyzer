mapping queries to questions : towards understanding users ' information-needs in this paper , for the first time , we study the problem of mapping keyword-queries to questions on community-based-question-answering (cqa) sites . mapping general web-queries to questions enables search-engines not only to discover explicit and specific information-needs (questions) behind keywords queries , but also to find high quality information (answers) for answering keyword-queries . in order to map queries to questions , we propose a ranking-algorithm containing three steps : candidate question selection , candidate question ranking , and candidate question grouping . preliminary experimental-results using 60 queries from search-logs of a commercial engine show that the presented approach can efficiently find the questions which capture user 's information-needs explicitly .
