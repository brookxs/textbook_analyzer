on theme location-discovery for travelogue-services in this paper , we aim to develop a travelogue service that discovers and conveys various travelogue digests , in form of theme locations , geographical-scope , traveling trajectory and location snippet , to users . in this service , theme locations in a travelogue are the core information to discover . thus we aim to address the problem of theme location-discovery to enable the above travelogue-services . due to the inherent ambiguity of location relevance , we perform location relevance mining (lrm) in two complementary angles , relevance classification and relevance-ranking , to provide comprehensive understanding of locations . furthermore , we explore the textual (e.g. , surrounding words) and geographical (e.g. , geographical relationship among locations) features of locations to develop a co-training model for enhancement of classification-performance . built upon the mining result of lrm , we develop a series of techniques for provisioning of the aforementioned travelogue digests in our travelogue system . finally , we conduct comprehensive experiments on collected travelogues to evaluate the performance of our location relevance mining techniques and demonstrate the effectiveness of the travelogue service .
