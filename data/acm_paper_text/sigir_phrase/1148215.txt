identifying comparative-sentences in text-documents this paper studies the problem of identifying comparative-sentences in text-documents . the problem is related to but quite different from sentiment/opinion sentence-identification or classification . sentiment-classification studies the problem of classifying a document or a sentence based on the subjective opinion of the author . an important application area of sentiment/opinion identification is business-intelligence as a product manufacturer always wants to know consumers ' opinions on its products . comparisons on the other hand can be subjective or objective . furthermore , a comparison is not concerned with an object in isolation . instead , it compares the object with others . an example opinion sentence is `` the sound quality of cd player x is poor '' . an example comparative sentence is `` the sound quality of cd player x is not as good as that of cd player y '' . clearly , these two sentences give different information . their language constructs are quite different too . identifying comparative-sentences is also useful in practice because direct comparisons are perhaps one of the most convincing ways of evaluation , which may even be more important than opinions on each individual object . this paper proposes to study the comparative sentence-identification problem . it first categorizes comparative-sentences into different types , and then presents a novel integrated pattern-discovery and supervised-learning-approach to identifying comparative-sentences from text-documents . experiment results using three types of documents , news-articles , consumer-reviews of products , and internet forum postings , show a precision of 79 \ % and recall of 81 \ % . more detailed results are given in the paper .
