order preserving minimal-perfect-hash-functions and information retrieval rapid access-to-information is essential for a wide variety of retrieval-systems and applications . hashing has long been used when the fastest possible direct-search is desired , but is generally not appropriate when sequential or range searches are also required . this paper describes a hashing method , developed for collections that are relatively static , that supports both direct and sequential access . indeed , the algorithm described gives hash-functions that are optimal in terms of time and hash-table space-utilization , and that preserve any a priori ordering desired . furthermore , the resulting order preserving minimal-perfect-hash-functions (opmphfs) can be found using space and time that is on average linear in the number of keys involved .
