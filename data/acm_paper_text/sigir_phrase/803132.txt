weird : an approach to concept-based information-retrieval weird is an automatic document retrieval-system designed and implemented at syracuse university , which attempts to advance the art of computerized retrieval from word-matching to judging conceptual-similarity . weird uses a vector-space-model to represent the relations among terms and documents . items in the space are located according to their - & - ldquo ; meaning - & - rdquo ; , which is their proximity to all other items in the data-base as measured by co-occurrence frequencies . this is done without manipulating large matrices . the dimensions of the space are not used to define relations ; items are defined solely by their position relative to the other items . retrieval is determined by euclidean-distance from the plotted query . in the first section of the paper the basic characteristics of weird are described . second , the results of a preliminary evaluation are reported . alternatives for further development of weird are then considered .
