improving local-search ranking through external logs the signals used for ranking in local-search are very different from web-search : in addition to (textual) relevance , measures of (geographic) distance between the user and the search result , as well as measures of popularity of the result are important for effective ranking . depending on the query and search result , different ways to quantify these factors exist -- for example , it is possible to use customer ratings to quantify the popularity of restaurants , whereas different measures are more appropriate for other types of businesses . hence , our approach is to capture the different notions of distance/popularity relevant via a number of external data sources (e.g. , logs of customer ratings , driving-direction requests , or site accesses) . in this paper we will describe the relevant signal contained in a number of such data sources in detail and present methods to integrate these external data sources into the feature-generation for local-search ranking . in particular , we propose novel backoff methods to alleviate the impact of skew , noise or incomplete-data in these logs in a systematic manner . we evaluate our techniques on both human-judged relevance data as well as click-through-data from a commercial local-search engine .
