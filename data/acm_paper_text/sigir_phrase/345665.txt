bayes optimal metasearch : a probabilistic-model for combining the results of multiple retrieval-systems (poster session) we introduce a new , probabilistic-model for combining the outputs of an arbitrary number of query-retrieval systems . by gathering simple statistics on the average-performance of a given set of query-retrieval systems , we construct a bayes optimal mechanism for combining the outputs of these systems . our construction yields a metasearch strategy whose empirical performance nearly always exceeds the performance of any of the constituent systems . our construction is also robust in the sense that if good and bad systems are combined , the performance of the composite is still on par with , or exceeds , that of the best constituent system . finally , our model and theory provide theoretical and empirical avenues for the improvement of this metasearch strategy .
