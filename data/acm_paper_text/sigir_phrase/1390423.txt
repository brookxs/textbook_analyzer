real-time automatic tag recommendation tags are user-generated labels for entities . existing research on tag-recommendation either focuses on improving its accuracy or on automating the process , while ignoring the efficiency issue . we propose a highly-automated novel framework for real-time tag-recommendation . the tagged training-documents are treated as triplets of (words , docs , tags) , and represented in two bipartite-graphs , which are partitioned into clusters by spectral recursive embedding (sre) . tags in each topical cluster are ranked by our novel ranking-algorithm . a two-way poisson mixture-model (pmm) is proposed to model the document distribution into mixture components within each cluster and aggregate words into word clusters simultaneously . a new document is classified by the mixture-model based on its posterior probabilities so that tags are recommended according to their ranks . experiments on large-scale tagging datasets of scientific documents (citeulike) and web-pages del.icio.us) indicate that our framework is capable of making tag-recommendation efficiently and effectively . the average tagging time for testing a document is around 1 second , with over 88 \ % test documents correctly labeled with the top nine tags we suggested .
