diversification of search-results using webgraphs a set of words is often insufficient to express a user 's information-need . in order to account for various information needs associated with a query , diversification seems to be a reasonable strategy . by diversifying the result-set , we increase the probability of results being relevant to the user 's information-needs when the given query is ambiguous . a diverse result-set must contain a set of documents that cover various subtopics for a given query . we propose a graph-based method which exploits the link-structure of the-web to return a ranked list that provides complete coverage for a query . our method not only provides diversity to the results set , but also avoids excessive redundancy . moreover , the probability of relevance of a document is conditioned on the documents that appear before it in the result list . we show the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with a query-likelihood model as the baseline .
