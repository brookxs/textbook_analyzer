data cashing in ir systems information-retrieval (ir) systems provide individual remote access to centrally-managed data . the current proliferation of personal-computer systems , as well as advances in storage and communication-technology , have created new possibilities for designing information-systems which are easily accessible , economical , and responsive to user-needs . this paper outlines methods of integrating personal-computers (pcs) into large information systems , with emphasis on effective use of the storage and processing capabilities of these computers . in particular we discuss means for caching retrieved data at pc-equipped user sites , noting that caching in this environment poses unique problems . an event-driven-simulation program is described which models information-system operation . this simulator is being used to examine caching-strategies . some results of these studies are presented .
