automatic url-completion and prediction using fuzzy type-ahead-search type-ahead-search is a new information-access paradigm , in which systems can find answers to keyword-queries `` on-the-fly '' as a user-types in a query . it improves traditional autocomplete search by allowing query keywords to appear at different places in an answer . in this paper we study the problem of automatic url-completion and prediction using fuzzy type-ahead-search . that is , we interactively find relevant urls that contain words matching query keywords , even approximately , as the user-types in a query . supporting fuzzy-search is very important when the user has limited knowledge about urls . we describe the design and implementation of our method , and report the experimental-results on firefox .
