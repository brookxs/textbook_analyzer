automatic boolean-query-suggestion for professional search in professional search environments , such as patent-search or legal search , search-tasks have unique characteristics : 1) users interactively issue several queries for a topic , and 2) users are willing to examine many retrieval results , i.e. , there is typically an emphasis on recall . recent surveys have also verified that professional searchers continue to have a strong preference for boolean-queries because they provide a record of what documents were searched . to support this type of professional search , we propose a novel boolean-query-suggestion technique . specifically , we generate boolean-queries by exploiting decision-trees learned from pseudo-labeled documents and rank the suggested queries using query-quality predictors . we evaluate our algorithm in simulated patent and medical-search environments . compared with a recent effective query-generation system , we demonstrate that our technique is effective and general .
