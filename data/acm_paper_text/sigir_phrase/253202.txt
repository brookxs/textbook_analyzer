user-oriented document clustering : a framework for learning-in-information-retrieval in information-retrieval , cluster-analysis is an important tool employed to enhance both efficiency-and-effectiveness of the retrieval-process . most clustering-algorithms have difficulty in reflecting the closeness of documents as perceived by the user . a two phase scheme for document-clustering , whose results reflect the conceptual clusters that are perceived by the user of the retrieval-system , is proposed . since the clusters obtained by this scheme are not characterized in terms of the document representations , a strategy for cluster searching is also developed . both the proposed document-clustering scheme and document searching strategy are experimentally evaluated using a test-collection from the smart system . the preliminary experimental-results obtained are very encouraging .
