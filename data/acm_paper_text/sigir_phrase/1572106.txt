on single-pass indexing with mapreduce indexing is an important information-retrieval (ir) operation , which must be parallelised to support large-scale document corpora . we propose a novel adaptation of the state-of-the-art single-pass indexing-algorithm in terms of the mapreduce programming-model . we then experiment with this adaptation , in the context of the hadoop-mapreduce implementation . in particular , we explore the scale of improvements that can be achieved when using firstly more processing hardware and secondly larger corpora . our results show that indexing speed increases in a close to linear fashion when scaling corpus-size or number of processing machines . this suggests that the proposed indexing implementation is viable to support upcoming large-scale corpora .
