task detection for activity-based desktop-search the desktop-search-tools provide powerful query-capabilities and result-presentation techniques . however , they do not take the user-context into account . we propose to exploit collected information about user-activities with desktop files and applications for activity-based desktop-search . when i prepare for a project review and type in a search box the name of a colleague , i expect to find her last deliverable draft , but not her email with a paper review or our joint conference presentation . ideally , the desktop-search system should be able to infer my current task from the logs of my previous activities and present task-specific search-results .
