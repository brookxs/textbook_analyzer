a probabilistic relational model for the integration of ir and databases in this paper , a probabilistic relational model is presented which combines relational-algebra with probabilistic-retrieval . based on certain independence assumptions , the operators of the relational-algebra are redefined such that the probabilistic algebra is a generalization of the standard relational-algebra . furthermore , a special join-operator implementing probabilistic-retrieval is proposed . when applied to typical document-databases , queries can not only ask for documents , but for any kind of object in the database . in addition , an implicit ranking of these objects is provided in case the query relates to probabilistic indexing or uses the probabilistic-join operator . the proposed algebra is intended as a standard interface to combined database and ir systems , as a basis for implementing user-friendly-interfaces .
