using parsimonious-language-models on web-data in this paper we explore the use of parsimonious-language-models for web-retrieval . these models are smaller thus more efficient than the standard language-models and are therefore well suited for large-scale web retrieval . we have conducted experiments on four trec topic sets , and found that the parsimonious language model results in improvement of retrieval-effectiveness over the standard language-model for all data-sets and measures . in all cases the improvement is significant , and more substantial than in earlier experiments on newspaper/newswire data .
