the impact of intent selection on diversified search-evaluation to construct a diversified search test-collection , a set of possible subtopics (or intents) needs to be determined for each topic , in one way or another , and perintent relevance-assessments need to be obtained . in the trec web track diversity task , subtopics are manually developed at nist , based on results of automatic click-log-analysis ; in the ntcir intent task , intents are determined by manually clustering ` subtopics strings ' returned by participating systems . in this study , we address the following research question : does the choice of intents for a test-collection affect relative performances of diversified search systems ? to this end , we use the trec 2012 web track diversity task data and the ntcir-10 intent-2 task data , which share a set of 50 topics but have different intent sets . our initial results suggest that the choice of intents may affect relative performances , and that this choice may be far more important than how many intents are selected for each topic
