relevant knowledge helps in choosing right teacher : active query selection for ranking-adaptation learning to adapt in a new setting is a common challenge to our knowledge and capability . new life would be easier if we actively pursued supervision from the right mentor chosen with our relevant but limited prior-knowledge . this variant principle of active-learning seems intuitively useful to many domain-adaptation problems . in this paper , we substantiate its power for advancing automatic-ranking adaptation , which is important in web-search since it 's prohibitive to gather enough labeled-data for every search domain for fully training domain-specific rankers . for the cost-effectiveness , it is expected that only those most informative instances in target-domain are collected to annotate while we can still utilize the abundant ranking knowledge in source-domain . we propose a unified ranking framework to mutually reinforce the active selection of informative target-domain queries and the appropriate weighting of source training-data as related prior-knowledge . we select to annotate those target queries whose documents ' order most disagrees among the members of a committee built on the mixture of source training-data and the already selected target data . then the replenished labeled set is used to adjust the importance of source queries for enhancing their rank transfer . this procedure iterates until labeling budget exhausts . based on letor3 .0 and yahoo! learning-to-rank challenge data-sets , our approach significantly outperforms the random query-annotation commonly used in ranking-adaptation and the active rank learner on target-domain data only .
