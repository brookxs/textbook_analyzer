settings and the setting structure : the description and automated propagation of networks for perusing videodisk image states this paper describes a system for formally representing spatial-relationships between videodisc image states called settings . a number of setting relations are defined , these being based on the manipulations of the camera typically used in the production of the moving film : zooming in or out , panning etc. . an algorithm is presented which , given a limited level of initial specification by a describer , will constrain , where possible , the setting relations holding between all pairs of settings . the resulting network is called the settings structure . the paper begins by placing the settings structure into the context of its being one part of the cloris system .
