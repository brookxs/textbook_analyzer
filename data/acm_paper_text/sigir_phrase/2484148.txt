estimating topical-context by diverging from external resources improving query understanding is crucial for providing the user with information that suits her needs . to this end , the retrieval-system must be able to deal with several sources of knowledge from which it could infer a topical-context . the use of external-sources of information for improving document-retrieval has been extensively studied . improvements with either structured or large-sets of data have been reported . however , in these studies resources are often used separately and rarely combined together . we experiment in this paper a method that discounts documents based on their weighted divergence from a set of external resources . we present an evaluation of the combination of four resources on two standard trec test-collections . our proposed method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art mixture of relevance-models on one test-collection , while no significant differences are detected on the other one .
