stuff i 've seen : a system for personal-information-retrieval and re-use most information-retrieval technologies are designed to facilitate information-discovery . however , much knowledge-work involves finding and re-using previously seen information . we describe the design and evaluation of a system , called stuff i 've seen (sis) , that facilitates information re-use . this is accomplished in two ways . first , the system provides a unified index of information that a person has seen , whether it was seen as email , web-page , document , appointment , etc. . second , because the information has been seen before , rich contextual cues can be used in the search-interface . the system has been used internally by more than 230 employees . we report on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of system-use . initial findings show that time and people are important retrieval cues . users find information more easily using sis , and use other search-tools less frequently after installation .
