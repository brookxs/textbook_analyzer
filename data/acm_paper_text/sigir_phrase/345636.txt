multimedia-information-retrieval from recorded presentations (poster session) in presentation-recording special effort is usually put into the automation of the production-process , that is in automatically creating high quality data files without much or any need for manual recording and post-editing [5] . with the advent of such systems and their usage in classroom teaching , at conferences , etc. , there is an increasing need for techniques and abilities which enable users to search in those documents and to localize some specific information . in this paper we describe how we integrated information retrieval techniques into the authoring on-the-fly (aof) system , an approach for automatic-presentation-recording . we have chosen the aof system for two reasons . on the one hand , it is a well-established way for presentation-recording , used by various universities and institutions 1 . on the other hand it is general enough to illustrate typical problems and challenges a developer is facing when designing a system for information-retrieval from multimedia-data streams which occur in the presentation-recording scenario .
