managing semantic data in an associative-net this paper describes the design and implementation of a general associative-net structure to be used in an interactive information system , and presents a scheme designed to manage large quantities of semantic data stored in a data-base on disc . the associative-net-structured data-base is functionally divided into two pools : the hierarchy pool and the linguistic pool . the network of items in the hierarchy pool represents the descriptive information about documents and the network of items in the linguistic pool represents the syntactic and semantic properties of the items in the hierarchy pool . two search functions and a general search-algorithm are presented in this paper . in the implementation , the data-base is a regional data-set on disc . items and their associated labeled links are stored on disc tracks . the system establishes a directory to keep track of the items which have associated information stored on more than one track . the use of the directory eliminates unnecessary disc accesses and allows the system to move a proper track into core storage for data-processing .
