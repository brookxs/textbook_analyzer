collaborative factorization for recommender-systems recommender-system has become an effective tool for information-filtering , which usually provides the most useful items to users by a top-k-ranking list . traditional recommendation techniques such as nearest-neighbors (nn) and matrix-factorization (mf) have been widely used in real recommender-systems . however , neither approaches can well accomplish recommendation task since that : (1) most nn methods leverage the neighbor 's behaviors for prediction , which may suffer the severe data-sparsity problem ; (2) mf methods are less sensitive to sparsity , but neighbors ' influences on latent-factors are not fully explored , since the latent-factors are often used independently . to overcome the above problems , we propose a new framework for recommender-systems , called collaborative factorization . it expresses the user as the combination of his own factors and those of the neighbors ' , called collaborative latent-factors , and a ranking loss is then utilized for optimization . the advantage of our approach is that it can both enjoy the merits of nn and mf methods . in this paper , we take the logistic loss in ranknet and the likelihood loss in listmle as examples , and the corresponding collaborative factorization methods are called cof-net and cof-mle . our experimental-results on three benchmark datasets show that they are more effective than several state-of-the-art recommendation-methods .
