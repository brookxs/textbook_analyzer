mase : create your own mash-up search-interface mase provides a sandbox environment for high-school-students to create their own personalised-search interface . it has been designed with two major goals in mind : (1) as a hands-on tutorial for school children , to excite them about programming and computing science through the development of a practical application , and (2) to enable children to design and create their own search-interface without extensive programming-knowledge or prior-experience . consequently , mase provides a way to ascertain what children would like from a search-engine interface in an exploratory and creative way as they can create a working prototype . this approach contrasts with previous work on exploring children 's requirements of ir systems which attempts to directly elicit user-needs through more traditional methods (i.e. surveys , interviews , focus-groups , etc) . however , we have attempted to incorporate the design guidelines for children as identified by large (2006) into mase , where : we make use of bright colours , large text fonts , spell-checking and the use of icons to represent search-services , as well as including a thematic experience as suggested by large (2006) , with the use of a puppy avatar and puppy dog footprints .
