the semantic binary relationship model of information the semantic binary relationship model (sbrm) is a first-order formalism which combines an organisationally simple basis (i.e. binary relationships) with the capabilities of semantic-networks and logical integrity and deduction rules . the aim is to permit the efficient modelling of practical enterprises in a dbms context , whilst accommodating the requirements of knowledge-based-systems . the theoretical-foundations of the sbrm are described , with particular attention to inheritance hierarchies and rule-representation . the low-level unit of sbrm information is the triple . a 4mbyte associatively-accessed triple-store is being constructed , and will form the heart of a smart information machine based on the sbrm .
