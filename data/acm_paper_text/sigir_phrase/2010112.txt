how diverse are web-search-results ? search-result-diversification has recently gained attention as a means to tackle ambiguous-queries . while query-ambiguity is of particular concern for the short queries commonly observed in a web-search scenario , it is unclear how much diversity is actually promoted by web-search-engines (wses) . in this paper , we assess the diversification performance of two leading wses in the context of the diversity task of the trec 2009 and 2010 web tracks . our results show that these wses perform effectively for queries with multiple-interpretations , but not for those open to multiple aspects related to a single interpretation . moreover , by deploying a state-of-the-art diversification approach based on query-suggestions from these wses themselves , we show that their diversification performance can be further improved .
