hcc : a hierarchical-co-clustering algorithm in this poster , we develop a novel method , called hcc , for hierarchical-co-clustering . hcc brings together two interrelated but distinct themes from clustering : hierarchical-clustering and co-clustering . the goal of the former theme is to organize clusters into a hierarchy that facilitates browsing and navigation , while the goal of the latter theme is to cluster different types of data simultaneously by making use of the relationship-information . our initial empirical-results are promising and they demonstrate that simultaneously attempting both these goals in a single model leads to improvements over models that focus on a single goal .
