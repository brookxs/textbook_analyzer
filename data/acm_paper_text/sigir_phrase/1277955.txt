using collaborative-queries to improve retrieval for difficult-topics we describe a preliminary analysis of queries created by 81 users for 4 topics from the trec robust track . our goal was to explore the potential benefits of using queries created by multiple-users on retrieval-performance for difficult-topics . we first examine the overlap in users ' queries and the overlap in results with respect to different queries for the same topic . we then explore the potential benefits of combining users ' queries in various ways . our results provide some evidence that having access to multiple-users ' queries can improve retrieval for individual searchers and for difficult-topics .
