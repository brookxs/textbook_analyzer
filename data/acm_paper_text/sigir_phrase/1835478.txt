learning-to-rank only using training-data from related-domain like traditional supervised and semi-supervised algorithms , learning-to-rank-for-information-retrieval requires document-annotations provided by domain-experts . it is costly to annotate training-data for different search domains and tasks . we propose to exploit training-data annotated for a related-domain to learn-to-rank retrieved documents in the target-domain , in which no labeled-data is available . we present a simple yet effective approach based on instance-weighting scheme . our method first estimates the importance of each related-domain document relative to the target-domain . then heuristics are studied to transform the importance of individual documents to the pairwise weights of document pairs , which can be directly incorporated into the popular-ranking algorithms . due to importance weighting , ranking-model trained on related-domain is highly adaptable to the data of target-domain . ranking-adaptation experiments on letor3 .0 dataset [27] demonstrate that with a fair amount of related-domain training-data , our method significantly outperforms the baseline without weighting , and most of time is not significantly worse than an `` ideal '' model directly trained on target-domain .
