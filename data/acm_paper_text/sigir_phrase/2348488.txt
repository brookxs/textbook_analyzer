learning to select a time-aware retrieval-model time-aware retrieval-models exploit one of two time dimensions , namely , (a) publication time or (b) content time (temporal-expressions mentioned in documents) . we show that the effectiveness for a temporal-query (e.g. , illinois earthquake 1968) depends significantly on which time-dimension is factored into ranking results . motivated by this , we propose a machine-learning-approach to select the most suitable time-aware retrieval-model for a given temporal-query . our method uses three classes of features obtained from analyzing distributions over two time dimensions , a distribution over terms , and retrieval scores within top-k result documents . experiments on real-world-data with crowdsourced relevance-assessments show the potential of our approach .
