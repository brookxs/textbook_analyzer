effects of expertise differences in synchronous social q &#38; a synchronous social question-and-answer (q &#38; a) systems match askers to answerers and support real-time dialog between them to resolve questions . these systems typically find answerers based on the degree of expertise match with the asker 's initial question . however , since synchronous social q &#38; a involves a dialog between asker and answerer , differences in expertise may also matter (e.g. , extreme novices and experts may have difficulty establishing common-ground) . in this poster we use data from a live social q &#38; a system to explore the impact of expertise differences on answer-quality and aspects of the dialog itself . the findings of our study suggest that synchronous social q &#38; a systems should consider the relative expertise of candidate answerers with respect to the asker , and offer interactive dialog support to help establish common-ground between askers and answerers .
