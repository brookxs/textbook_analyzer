learning effective ranking-functions for newsgroup-search web-communities are web virtual broadcasting spaces where people can freely discuss anything . while such communities function as discussion-boards , they have even greater value as large repositories of archived information . in order to unlock the value of this resource , we need an effective means for searching archived discussion threads . unfortunately the techniques that have proven successful for searching document-collections and the-web are not ideally suited to the task of searching archived community discussions . in this paper , we explore the problem of creating an effective ranking-function to predict the most relevant messages to queries in community search . we extract a set of predictive features from the thread trees of newsgroup messages as well as features of message authors and lexical distribution within a message thread . our final results indicate that when using linear-regression with this feature-set , our search-system achieved a 28.5 \ % performance-improvement compared to our baseline system .
