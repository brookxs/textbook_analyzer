link-based and content-based evidential information in a belief network-model this work presents an information-retrieval-model developed to deal with hyperlinked environments . the model is based on belief-networks and provides a framework for combining information extracted from the content of the documents with information derived from cross-references among the documents . the information extracted from the content of the documents is based on statistics regarding the keywords in the collection and is one of the basis for traditional information-retrieval (ir) ranking-algorithms . the information derived from cross-references among the documents is based on link references in a hyperlinked environment and has received increased attention lately due to the success of the-web . we discuss a set of strategies for combining these two types of sources of evidential information and experiment with them using a reference collection extracted from the-web . the results show that this type of combination can improve the retrieval-performance without requiring any extra information from the users at query time . in our experiments , the improvements reach up to 59 \ % in terms of average-precision figures .
