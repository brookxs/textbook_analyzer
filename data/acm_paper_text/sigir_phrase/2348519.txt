unsupervised linear score-normalization revisited we give a fresh look into score-normalization for merging result-lists , isolating the problem from other components . we focus on three of the simplest , practical , and widely-used linear methods which do not require any training-data , i.e. minmax , sum , and z-score . we provide theoretical arguments on why and when the methods work , and evaluate them experimentally . we find that minmax is the most robust under many circumstances , and that sum is - in contrast to previous literature - the worst . based on the insights gained , we propose another three simple methods which work as good or better than the baselines .
