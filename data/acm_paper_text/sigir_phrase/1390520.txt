parsimonious relevance-models we describe a method for applying parsimonious-language-models to re-estimate the term probabilities assigned by relevance-models . we apply our method to six topic sets from test-collections in five different genres . our parsimonious relevance-models (i) improve retrieval-effectiveness in terms of map on all collections , (ii) significantly outperform their non-parsimonious counterparts on most measures , and (iii) have a precision enhancing effect , unlike other blind-relevance-feedback methods .
