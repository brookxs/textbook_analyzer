feature subset non-negative-matrix-factorization and its-applications to document-understanding in this paper , we propose feature subset non-negative-matrix-factorization (nmf) , which is an unsupervised-approach to simultaneously cluster data points and select important features . we apply our proposed approach to various document-understanding tasks including document-clustering , summarization , and visualization . experimental-results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for these tasks .
