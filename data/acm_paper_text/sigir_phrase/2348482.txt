how query extensions reflect search result abandonments it is often considered that high abandonment rate corresponds to poor ir-system performance . however several studies suggested that there are so called good abandonments , i.e. situations when search-engine result page contains enough details to satisfy the user-information need without necessity to click on search-results . in this work we propose to look at query extensions . we see that an extension by itself might motivate abandonment type (good or bad) for the underlying query to some degree . we also propose a way to find potentially good-abandonment extensions in an automated manner .
