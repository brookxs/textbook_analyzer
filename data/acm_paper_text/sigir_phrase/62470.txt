the automatic-indexing-system air/phys - from research to applications since october 1985 , the automatic-indexing-system air/phys has been used in the input production of the physics data-base of the fachinformationsentrum karlsruhe/west germany . the texts to be indexed are abstracts written in english . the system of descriptors is prescribed . for the application of the air/phys system a large-scale dictionary containing more than 600 000 word-descriptor relations reap . phrase-descriptor relations has been developed . most of these relations have been obtained by means of statistical and heuristical methods . in consequence , the relation system is rather imperfect . therefore , the indexing system-needs some fault - tolerating features . an appropriate indexing-approach and the corresponding structure of the air/phys system are described . finally , the conditions of the application as well as problems of further development are discussed .
