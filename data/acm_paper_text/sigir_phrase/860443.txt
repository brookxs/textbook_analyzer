question-classification using support-vector-machines question-classification is very important for question-answering . this paper presents our research work on automatic question classification through machine-learning-approaches . we have experimented with five machine-learning-algorithms : nearest-neighbors (nn) , naive-bayes (nb) , decision-tree (dt) , sparse network of winnows (snow) , and support-vector-machines (svm) using two kinds of features : bag-of-words and bag-of-ngrams . the experiment results show that with only surface text-features the svm outperforms the other four methods for this task . further , we propose to use a special kernel-function called the tree kernel to enable the svm to take advantage of the syntactic-structures of questions . we describe how the tree kernel can be computed efficiently by dynamic-programming . the performance of our approach is promising , when tested on the questions from the trec qa track .
