bayesian extension to the language-model for ad-hoc-information-retrieval we propose a bayesian extension to the ad-hoc language-model . many smoothed estimators used for the multinomial query-model in ad-hoc language-models (including laplace and bayes-smoothing) are approximations to the bayesian predictive distribution . in this paper we derive the full predictive distribution in a form amenable to implementation by classical ir-models , and then compare it to other currently used estimators . in our experiments the proposed model outperforms bayes-smoothing , and its combination with linear-interpolation smoothing outperforms all other estimators .
