mining adjacent markets from a large-scale ads video collection for image-advertising the research on image-advertising is still in its infancy . most previous approaches suggest ads by directly matching an ad to a query image , which lacks the power to identify ads from adjacent market . in this paper , we tackle the problem by mining knowledge on adjacent markets from ads videos with a novel multi-modal dirichlet-process-mixture sets model , which is a unified-model of (video frames) clustering and (ads) ranking . our approach is not only capable of discovering relevant ads (e.g. car ads for a query car image) , but also suggesting ads from adjacent markets (e.g. tyre ads) . experimental-results show that our proposed approach is fairly effective .
