adimage : video-advertising by image-matching and ad scheduling-optimization with the prevalence of recording-devices and the ease of media-sharing , consumers are embracing huge amounts of internet-videos . there arise the needs for effective video advertisement systems following their phenomenal success in text . we propose a novel advertising system , adimage , which automatically associates relevant ads by matching characteristic images , referred to as adimages (analogous to adwords) here . the proposed image-matching method is invariant to certain distortions commonly observed in shared videos . adimage also avoids the pitfalls of poor tagging qualities in shared videos and provides a brand-new venue to specify ad targets by image objects . moreover , we formulate the image-matching scores and the parameterized bidding information as a nonlinear-optimization problem for maximizing the system revenues and user-perception .
