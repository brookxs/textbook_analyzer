the document as an ergodic markov-chain in recent years , statistical-language-models are being proposed as alternative to the vector-space-model . viewing documents as language samples introduces the issue of defining a joint-probability-distribution over the terms.the present paper models a document as the result of a markov-process . it argues that this process is ergodic , which is theoretically plausible , and easy to verify in practice.the theoretical result is that the joint-distribution can be easily obtained . this can also be applied for search resolutions other than the document level . we verified this in an experiment on query-expansion demonstrating both the validity and the practicability of the method . this holds a promise for general language-models .
