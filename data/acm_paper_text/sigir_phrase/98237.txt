on hypertext this panel will employ two different interpretations of the phrase growing up to address areas of common interest between hypertext and information retrieval researchers . first , the panelists will question whether or not hypertext is growing up as a scientific discipline ; they will discuss characteristics that separate hypertext-research from other related disciplines . second , the panelists will discuss the problems encountered when a hypertext system grows up in size and complexity ; they will discuss the very real problems expected when representing and integrating large knowledge-bases , accommodating multiple-users , and distributing single logical hypertexts across multiple physical sites . the panelists will not lecture , but they will advance a number of themes including the myth of modularity (frisse) , new architectures employing hyperconcept databases (agosti) , hypertext in software-engineering (bruandet) , automatic-hypertext-generation (hahn) , and large-scale hypertexts (weiss) .
