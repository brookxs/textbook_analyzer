document-selection-methodologies for efficient and effective learning-to-rank learning-to-rank has attracted great attention in the ir community . much thought and research has been placed on query-document feature-extraction and development of sophisticated learning-to-rank algorithms . however , relatively little research has been conducted on selecting documents for learning-to-rank data-sets nor on the effect of these choices on the efficiency-and-effectiveness of learning-to-rank algorithms . in this paper , we employ a number of document-selection-methodologies , widely used in the context of evaluation -- depth-k pooling , sampling (infap , statap) , active-learning (mtc) , and on-line heuristics (hedge) . certain methodologies , e.g. sampling and active-learning , have been shown to lead to efficient and effective evaluation . we investigate whether they can also enable efficient and effective learning-to-rank . we compare them with the document selection-methodology used to create the letor datasets . further , all of the utilized methodologies are different in nature , and thus they construct training-data sets with different properties , such as the proportion of relevant documents in the data or the similarity among them . we study how such properties affect the efficiency , effectiveness , and robustness of learning-to-rank collections .
