quality through flow and immersion : gamifying crowdsourced relevance-assessments crowdsourcing is a market of steadily-growing importance upon which both academia and industry increasingly rely . however , this market appears to be inherently infested with a significant share of malicious workers who try to maximise their profits through cheating or sloppiness . this serves to undermine the very merits crowdsourcing has come to represent . based on previous experience as well as psychological insights , we propose the use of a game in order to attract and retain a larger share of reliable workers to frequently-requested crowdsourcing tasks such as relevance-assessments and clustering . in a large-scale comparative-study conducted using recent trec-data , we investigate the performance of traditional hit designs and a game-based alternative that is able to achieve high quality at significantly lower pay rates , facing fewer malicious submissions .
