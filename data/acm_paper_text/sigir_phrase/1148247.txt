semantic-search via xml-fragments : a high-precision approach to ir in some ir applications , it is desirable to adopt a high precision search-strategy to return a small set of documents that are highly focused and relevant to the user 's information-need . with these applications in mind , we investigate semantic-search using the xml-fragments query-language on text-corpora automatically pre-processed to encode semantic-information useful for retrieval . we identify three xml fragment operations that can be applied to a query to conceptualize , restrict , or relate terms in the query . we demonstrate how these operations can be used to address four different query-time semantic needs : to specify target information type , to disambiguate keywords , to specify search-term context , or to relate select terms in the query . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our semantic-search technology through a series of experiments using the two applications in which we embed this technology and show that it yields significant improvement in precision in the search-results .
