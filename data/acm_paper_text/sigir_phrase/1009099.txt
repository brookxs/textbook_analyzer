collaborative-filing in a document-repository we introduce an emergent , collaborative-filing system . in such a system , an individual is allowed to organize a subset of documents in a repository into a personal hierarchy and share the hierarchy with others . the system generates a `` consensus '' hierarchy from all users ' personal hierarchies , which provides a full , common , and emergent view of all documents . we believe that collaborative-filing helps translate personal , tacit-knowledge into sharable structures , which help the user as well a-community of which he or she is a part . our filing-system is suitable for any documents from text to multimedia files . initial results on an experimental website show promise . for a knowledge task involving extensive document-retrieval , hierarchies are not only used frequently but are also effective in identifying high quality documents . one surprising finding is how often subjects use others ' personal hierarchies , and upon close examination , social-networks play a key role as well .
