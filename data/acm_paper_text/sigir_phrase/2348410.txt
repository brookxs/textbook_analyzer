confidence-aware graph-regularization with heterogeneous pairwise-features conventional classification-methods tend to focus on features of individual objects , while missing out on potentially valuable pairwise-features that capture the relationships between objects . although recent developments on graph-regularization exploit this aspect , existing works generally assume only a single kind of pairwise feature , which is often insufficient . we observe that multiple , heterogeneous pairwise-features can often complement each other and are generally more robust in modeling the relationships between objects . furthermore , as some objects are easier to classify than others , objects with higher initial classification confidence should be weighed more towards classifying related but more ambiguous objects , an observation missing from previous graph-regularization techniques . in this paper , we propose a dirichlet-based regularization-framework that supports the combination of heterogeneous pairwise-features with confidence-aware prediction using limited labeled-training-data . next , we showcase a few applications of our framework in information-retrieval , focusing on the problem of query-intent classification . finally , we demonstrate through a series of experiments the advantages of our framework on a large-scale real-world dataset .
