some remarks about the inference techniques of reseda , an intelligent-information-retrieval system the aim of this paper is to provide some details about the inference procedures of reseda , an `` intelligent '' information-retrieval-system using techniques borrowed from knowledge-engineering . a reseda prototype has been operational for over a year : amongst its characteristics are a `` case-grammar '' like knowledge-representation-language , intensive use of temporal-data , use of the notion of `` type '' , automatic-generation of logical links , etc. . first , the paper makes it clear what is meant in reseda by `` level zero inference '' . subsequently , it provides an informal description of the two kinds of high level inference operation , relying on information in the rule-base , that are implemented in the system : these are known as `` transformations '' and `` hypotheses '' . finally , the article describes in some detail the computational structure of the `` machines '' which enable reseda 's inference-engine to execute this type of high level operation .
