the use of adaptive mechanisms for selection of search-strategies in document retrival systems a document-retrieval-system can incorporate many types of flexibility . one example of this is the ability to choose a search-strategy that is appropriate for a particular user and query . this paper investigates the use of adaptive mechanisms to control the selection of search-strategies . the experimental-results indicate that , although an adaptive-mechanism is capable of learning the appropriate response in simple situations , there are serious problems with using them to make complex decisions in a document-retrieval-system .
