an application of text-categorization methods to gene-ontology annotation this paper describes an application of ir and text-categorization methods to a highly practical problem in biomedicine , specifically , gene-ontology (go) annotation . go-annotation is a major activity in most model organism database projects and annotates gene functions using a controlled-vocabulary . as a first step toward automatic go-annotation , we aim to assign go domain codes given a specific gene and an article in which the gene appears , which is one of the task challenges at the trec 2004 genomics track . we approached the task with careful consideration of the specialized-terminology and paid special attention to dealing with various forms of gene synonyms , so as to exhaustively locate the occurrences of the target gene . we extracted the words around the gene occurrences and used them to represent the gene for go domain code-annotation . as a classifier , we adopted a variant of k-nearest-neighbor (k nn) with supervised term-weighting-schemes to improve the performance , making our method among the top-performing systems in the trec official evaluation . moreover , it is demonstrated that our proposed framework is successfully applied to another task of the genomics track , showing comparable results to the best performing system .
