the implementation of a document-retrieval-system the significant advances made in theoretical and experimental-research in information-retrieval have many implications for system-design . one possible design for a document-retrieval-system based on these advances is presented . a major part of this system-design has been implemented as a bibliography filing and retrieval-system for the computer-science department at the university of massachusetts . the implementation issues considered here are functionality , user-interface and file-organization . the main point of this implementation was to demonstrate that an efficient , effective and flexible system can be constructed using modern techniques .
