document-classification by topic-labeling in this paper , we propose latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) [1] based document-classification algorithm which does not require any labeled dataset . in our algorithm , we construct a topic-model using lda , assign one topic to one of the class labels , aggregate all the same class label topics into a single topic using the aggregation property of the dirichlet-distribution and then automatically assign a class label to each unlabeled document depending on its `` closeness '' to one of the aggregated topics . we present an extension to our algorithm based on the combination of expectation-maximization (em) algorithm and a naive-bayes-classifier . we show effectiveness of our algorithm on three real-world datasets .
