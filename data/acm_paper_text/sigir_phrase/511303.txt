quantitative-evaluation of design-tradeoffs in file-systems the design of a file-system has never been a simple nor a straightforward task because of its complexity . heuristics and experience still play a major role in guiding the design process . to organize the entire design-process in a more systematic manner , large-scale-simulation has proved to be an effective technique . the forem models developed during the past several years (specifically for the evaluation of file-system designs) represent facilities of this type . this paper utilizes the forem model as the principal tool and presents a hypothetical design example dealing with many essential issues of the design process . evaluation of designs of several other actual file-systems are also being carried out and will be reported at a later date . only through quantitative-evaluation can each design-decision be arrived at correctly and the possible tradeoffs be identified .
