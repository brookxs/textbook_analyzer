an information-retrieval-system based on artificial-intelligence techniques this paper describes a possible use of artificial-intelligence models and techniques in the design of a small information-retrieval-system . in particular , some knowledge-representation models , such as semantic-networks and frame-like structures , are viewed as interesting tools for the implementation of a thesaurus , and also for a description of the stored documents ' contents . in addition , a parser based on the atn (augmented-transition-network) model which can analyze italian sentences concerning a legal domain is described . we are including it in an user/system interface whose goal is to provide the user with the possibility of expressing search topics by using noun-phrases or other linguistic-expressions , rather than single words or boolean combinations of them . finally , some tasks requiring automated-reasoning facilities are outlined . the kernel of the system , i.e. the component which both performs traditional information-retrieval and allows the insertion of new documents , is described in an appendix . it was first applied to a bibliographic database containing about a thousand references (with abstracts) of both papers and books concerned with artificial-intelligence ; now we are working on its application to a legal domain , with a database of laws , decrees and sentences concerning pollution and environmental protection .
