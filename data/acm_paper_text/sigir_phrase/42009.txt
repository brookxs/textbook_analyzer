an approach to natural-language for document-retrieval document-retrieval systems have been restricted , by the nature of the task , to techniques that can be used with large numbers of documents and broad domains . the most effective techniques that have been developed are based on the statistics of word occurrences in text . in this paper , we describe an approach to using natural-language-processing (nlp) techniques for what is essentially a natural-language problem - the comparison of a request text with the text of document titles and abstracts . the proposed nlp-techniques are used to develop a request model based on conceptual case frames and to compare this model with the texts of candidate documents . the request model is also used to provide information to statistical-search techniques that identify the candidate documents . as part of a preliminary evaluation of this approach , case-frame representations of a set of requests from the cacm collection were constructed . statistical searches carried out using dependency and relative-importance information derived from the request models indicate that performance benefits can be obtained .
