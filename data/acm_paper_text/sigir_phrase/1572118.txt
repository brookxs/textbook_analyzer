revisiting logical-imaging for information-retrieval retrieval with logical-imaging is derived from belief-revision and provides a novel mechanism for estimating the relevance of a document through logical implication (i.e. p (q - > d) . in this poster , we perform the first comprehensive evaluation of logical-imaging (li) in information-retrieval (ir) across several trec test-collections . when compared against standard baseline models , we show that li fails to improve performance . this failure can be attributed to a nuance within the model that means non-relevant documents are promoted in the ranking , while relevant documents are demoted . this is an important contribution because it not only contextualizes the effectiveness of li , but crucially explains why it fails . by addressing this nuance , future li models could be significantly improved .
