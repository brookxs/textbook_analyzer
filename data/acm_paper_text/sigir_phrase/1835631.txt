high precision opinion-retrieval using sentiment-relevance flows opinion-retrieval involves the measuring of opinion score of a document about the given topic . we propose a new method , namely sentiment-relevance-flow , that naturally unifies the topic-relevance and the opinionated nature of a document . experiments conducted over a large-scaled web-corpus show that the proposed approach improves performance of opinion-retrieval in terms of precision-at-top-ranks .
