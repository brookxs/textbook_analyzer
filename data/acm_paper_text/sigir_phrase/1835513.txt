understanding web-browsing behaviors through weibull-analysis of dwell-time dwell-time on web-pages has been extensively used for various information retrieval tasks . however , some basic yet important questions have not been sufficiently addressed , eg , what distribution is appropriate to model the distribution of dwell times on a web-page , and furthermore , what the distribution tells us about the underlying browsing-behaviors . in this paper , we draw an analogy between abandoning a page during web-browsing and a system-failure in reliability-analysis , and propose to model the dwell-time using the weibull-distribution . using this distribution provides better goodness-of-fit to real-world data , and it uncovers some interesting patterns of user-browsing behaviors not previously reported . for example , our analysis reveals that web-browsing in general exhibits a significant `` negative aging '' phenomenon , which means that some initial screening has to be passed before a page is examined in detail , giving rise to the browsing-behavior that we call `` screen-and-glean . '' in addition , we demonstrate that dwell-time distributions can be reasonably predicted purely based on low-level page features , which broadens the possible applications of this study to situations where log-data may be unavailable .
