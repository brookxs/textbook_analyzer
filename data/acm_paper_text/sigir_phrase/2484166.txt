improving lda topic-models for microblogs via tweet pooling and automatic-labeling twitter , or the world of 140 characters poses serious challenges to the efficacy of topic-models on short , messy text . while topic-models such as latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) have a long history of successful application to news-articles and academic abstracts , they are often less coherent when applied to microblog content like twitter . in this paper , we investigate methods to improve topics learned from twitter content without modifying the basic machinery of lda ; we achieve this through various pooling schemes that aggregate tweets in a data-preprocessing step for lda . we empirically establish that a novel method of tweet pooling by hashtags leads to a vast improvement in a variety of measures for topic coherence across three diverse twitter datasets in comparison to an unmodified lda baseline and a variety of pooling schemes . an additional contribution of automatic hashtag labeling further improves on the hashtag pooling results for a subset of metrics . overall , these two novel schemes lead to significantly improved lda topic-models on twitter content .
