a topical-pagerank_based algorithm for recommender-systems in this paper , we propose a topical-pagerank_based algorithm for recommender-systems , which aim to rank products by analyzing previous user-item relationships , and recommend top-rank items to potentially interested users . we evaluate our algorithm on movielens dataset and empirical experiments demonstrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art recommending algorithms .
