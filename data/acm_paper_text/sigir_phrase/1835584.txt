context-aware query-classification using dynamic-query window and relationship net the context of the user queries , preceding a given query , is utilized to improve the effectiveness of query-classification . earlier efforts utilize fixed number of preceding queries to derive such context-information . we propose and evaluate an approach (dqw) that identifies a set of unambiguous preceding queries in a dynamically determined window to utilize in classifying an ambiguous-query . furthermore , utilizing a relationship-net (r-net) that represents relationships among known categories , we improve the classification effectiveness for those ambiguous-queries whose predicted category in this relationship-net is related to the category of a query within the window . our results indicate that the hybrid approach (dqw+r - net) statistically significantly improves the conditional-random-field (crf) query-classification approach when static query windowing and hierarchical-taxonomy are used (sqw+t ax) , in terms of precision (10.8 \ %) , recall (13.2 \ %) , and f1 measure (11.9 \ %) .
