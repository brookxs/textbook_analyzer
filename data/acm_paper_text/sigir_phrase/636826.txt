dependency-parsing for information-retrieval this paper describes the development of a parser based on the moulton and robinson (1981) dependency-theory of syntax , and several strategies by which we are attempting to apply the outputs of this parser to the processes of information-retrieval . we first discuss the limits of present information-retrieval theory and the potential benefits of linguistic-analysis for information-retrieval . next we briefly present the moulton and robinson theory , contrast it to rewrite rule-based theories , and outline its general advantages as an approach to natural-language-processing . next we describe the parser we have implemented based on the moulton and robinson theory , and some of the implementation issues we have addressed . finally , we discuss several strategies by which this parser could be applied to information-retrieval , and the problems involved in this application .
