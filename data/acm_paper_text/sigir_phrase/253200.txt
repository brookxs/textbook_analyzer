hierarchic document-classification using ward 's clustering-method in this paper , we discuss the application of a recent hierarchic clustering-algorithm to the automatic-classification of files of documents . whereas most hierarchic clustering-algorithms involve the generation and updating of an inter-object dissimilarity matrix , this new algorithm is based upon a series of nearest-neighbor searches . such an approach is appropriate to several clustering-methods , including ward 's method which has been shown to perform well in experimental-studies of hierarchic document-clustering . a description is given of heuristics which can increase the efficiency of the new algorithm when it is used to cluster three document-collections by ward 's method .
