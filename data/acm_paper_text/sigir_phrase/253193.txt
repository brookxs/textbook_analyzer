incorporating syntactic-information into a document-retrieval strategy : an investigation this paper deals with mechanisms for performing text-retrieval which incorporate a degree of linguistic-processing into the overall strategy . we have performed some experiments using parsing of text an a test-collection of documents and queries to try and find out exactly if and how parsing could contribute to an overall improvement in retrieval-effectiveness . investigating this topic has led us to the definition of a retrieval-strategy which incorporates parsing of query text and a more shallow-parsing of document texts , whose retrieval-effectiveness is investigated and described . our results indicate that significant improvements in retrieval-effectiveness can be obtained by incorporating such linguistic-processing into an overall retrieval-strategy .
