evaluating different methods of estimating retrieval quality for resource-selection in a federated digital library system , it is too expensive to query every accessible library . resource-selection is the task to decide to which libraries a query should be routed . most existing resource-selection algorithms compute a library ranking in a heuristic way . in contrast , the decision-theoretic-framework (dtf) follows a different approach on a better theoretic foundation : it computes a selection which minimises the overall costs (e.g. retrieval quality , time , money) of the distributed-retrieval . for estimating retrieval quality the recall-precision function is proposed . in this paper , we introduce two new methods : the first one computes the empirical distribution of the probabilities of relevance from a small library sample , and assumes it to be representative for the whole library . the second method assumes that the indexing weights follow a normal-distribution , leading to a normal-distribution for the document scores . furthermore , we present the first evaluation of dtf by comparing this theoretical approach with the heuristical state-of-the-art system cori ; here we find that dtf outperforms cori in most cases .
