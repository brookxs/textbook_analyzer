semantic-video-classification by integrating unlabeled-samples for classifier-training semantic-video-classification has become an active research-topic to enable more effective video-retrieval and knowledge-discovery from large-scale video databases . however , most existing techniques for classifier-training require a large number of hand-labeled samples to learn correctly . to address this problem , we have proposed a semi-supervised framework to achieve incremental classifier-training by integrating a limited number of labeled samples with a large number of unlabeled-samples . specifically , this emi-supervised framework includes : (a) modeling the semantic video concepts by using the finite-mixture-models to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient-objects ; (b) developing an adaptive-em-algorithm to integrate the unlabeled-samples to achieve parameter-estimation and model-selection simultaneously ; the experimental-results in a certain domain of medical videos are also provided .
