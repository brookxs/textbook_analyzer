term conflation for information-retrieval this paper describes two experiments concerned with term conflation for information-retrieval , and the catalog-retrieval-system designed utilizing the results of the experiments . the experiments performed here has as their aim 1) finding a theoretical basis and method for maximizing the effect of conflation , and 2) determining if conflation can be automated with no loss of system performance.experimental results indicate that ,1 . experienced searchers generally truncate terms at root morpheme boundaries . when searchers do not truncate at root boundaries , the deviations are small .2 . small deviations from root boundaries do not significantly affect retrieval-performance .3 . there is no significant performance difference between automatic-conflation and manual conflation carried out by experienced searchers .4 . based on 3 , term conflation can be automated in a retrieval-system with no average loss of performance , thus allowing easier and user-access to the system.a retrieval-system incorporating the information in 4 is described , and shown to be feasible .
