evolutionary timeline summarization : a balanced optimization framework via iterative substitution classic news-summarization plays an important role with the exponential document growth on the web . many approaches are proposed to generate summaries but seldom simultaneously consider evolutionary characteristics of news plus to traditional summary elements . therefore , we present a novel framework for the-web mining problem named evolutionary timeline summarization (ets) . given the massive collection of time-stamped web-documents related to a general news query , ets aims to return the evolution trajectory along the timeline , consisting of individual but correlated summaries of each date , emphasizing relevance , coverage , coherence and cross-date diversity . ets greatly facilitates fast news-browsing and knowledge comprehension and hence is a necessity . we formally formulate the task as an optimization-problem via iterative substitution from a set of sentences to a subset of sentences that satisfies the above requirements , balancing coherence/diversity measurement and local/global summary-quality . the optimized substitution is iteratively conducted by incorporating several constraints until convergence . we develop experimental-systems to evaluate on 6 instinctively different datasets which amount to 10251 documents . performance comparisons between different system-generated timelines and manually created ones by human editors demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in terms of rouge metrics .
