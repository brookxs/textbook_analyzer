statistical visual-feature indexes in video-retrieval four statistical visual-feature indexes are proposed : slm (shot length mean) , the average length of each shot in a video ; sld (shot length deviation) , the standard-deviation of shot lengths for a video ; onm (object number mean) , the average number of objects per frame of the video ; and ond (object number deviation) , the standard-deviation of the number of objects per frame across the video . each of these indexes provides a unique perspective on video-content . a novel video-retrieval interface has been developed as a platform to examine our assumption that the new indexes facilitate some video-retrieval tasks . initial feedback is promising and formal experiments are planned .
