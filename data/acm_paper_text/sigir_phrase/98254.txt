a new method for information-retrieval , based on the theory of relative concentration this paper introduces a new method for information-retrieval of documents that are represented by a vector . the novelty of the algorithm lies in the fact that no (generalized) p-norms are used as a matching-function between the query and the document (as is done e.g. by salton and others) but a function that measures the relative dispersion of the terms between a document and a query . this function originates from an earlier paper of the author where a good measure of relative concentration was introduced , used in informetrics to measure the degree of specialization of a journal w.r.t. the entire subject . this new information retrieval algorithm is shown to have many desirable properties (in the sense of the new cater-kraft wish list) including those of the original cosine-matching function of salton . in addition the property of the cosine-matching function that , if one only uses weights 0 to 1 , one is reduced to boolean ir , is refined in the sense that one takes into consideration the broadness or specialization of a document and a query . our new matching-function satisfies these additional properties .
