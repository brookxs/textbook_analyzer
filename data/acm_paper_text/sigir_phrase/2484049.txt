how query cost affects search-behavior affects how users interact with a search-system . microeconomic theory is used to generate the cost-interaction hypothesis that states as the cost of querying increases , users will pose fewer queries and examine more documents per query . a between-subjects laboratory study with 36 undergraduate subjects was conducted , where subjects were randomly assigned to use one of three search-interfaces that varied according to the amount of physical cost required to query : structured (high cost) , standard (medium cost) and query-suggestion (low-cost) . results show that subjects who used the structured interface submitted significantly fewer queries , spent more time on search-results pages , examined significantly more documents per query , and went to greater depths in the search-results list . results also showed that these subjects spent longer generating their initial queries , saved more relevant documents and rated their queries as more successful . these findings have implications for the usefulness of microeconomic theory as a way to model and explain search interaction , as well as for the design of query facilities .
