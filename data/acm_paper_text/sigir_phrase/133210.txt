parameterised compression for sparse bitmaps full-text-retrieval systems often use either a bitmap or an inverted-file to identify which documents contain which terms , so that the documents containing any combination of query terms can be quickly located . bitmaps of term occurrences are large , but are usually sparse , and thus are amenable to a variety of compression techniques . here we consider techniques in which the encoding of each bitvector within the bitmap is parameterised , so that a different code can be used for each bitvector . our experimental-results show that the new methods yield better compression than previous techniques .
