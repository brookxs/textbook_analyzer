user-specified domain-knowledge for document-retrieval the introduction of domain-knowledge into a document-retrieval-system has two important consequences ; an increase in the effectiveness of retrieval and a decrease in the efficiency of text-processing . in this paper , a method is presented of combining user-specified domain-knowledge with efficient retrieval techniques based on probabilistic-models . the domain-knowledge is represented as a collection of frames that contain rules specifying recognition conditions for domain-concepts and relationships between concepts . the inference-network represented in these frames is used to infer the concepts that are related to a user 's query . this approach is being implemented as part of the i 3 r expert intermediary system .
