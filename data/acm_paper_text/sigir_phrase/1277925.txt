document-clustering : an optimization-problem clustering-algorithms have been widely used in information-retrieval applications . however , it is difficult to define an objective `` best '' result . this article analyzes some document-clustering algorithms and illustrates that they are equivalent to the optimization-problem of some global functions . experiments show their good performance , but there are still counter-examples where they fail to return the optimal-solution . we argue that monte-carlo algorithms in the global-optimization framework have the potential to find better solutions than traditional clustering , and they are able to handle more complex structures .
