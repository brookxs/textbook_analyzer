vote calibration in community-question-answering systems user votes are important signals in community-question-answering (cqa) systems . many features of typical cqa systems , e.g. the best answer to a question , status of a user , are dependent on ratings or votes cast by the community . in a popular cqa site , yahoo!-answers , users vote for the best-answers to their questions and can also thumb up or down each individual answer . prior work has shown that these votes provide useful predictors for content-quality and user-expertise , where each vote is usually assumed to carry the same weight as others . in this paper , we analyze a set of possible factors that indicate bias in user voting behavior -- these factors encompass different gaming behavior , as well as other eccentricities , e.g. , votes to show appreciation of answerers . these observations suggest that votes need to be calibrated before being used to identify good answers or experts . to address this problem , we propose a general machine-learning framework to calibrate such votes . through extensive experiments based on an editorially judged cqa dataset , we show that our supervised-learning method of content-agnostic vote calibration can significantly improve the performance of answer-ranking and expert-ranking .
