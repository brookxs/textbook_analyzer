generalising multiple capture-recapture to non-uniform sample sizes algorithms in distributed-information-retrieval often rely on accurate knowledge of the size of a collection . the `` multiple capture-recapture '' method of shokouhi et al. is one of the more reliable algorithms for determining collection-size , but it relies on samples with a uniform number of documents . such uniform samples are often hard to obtain in a working system . a simple generalisation of multiple capture-recapture does not rely on uniform sample sizes . simulations show it is as accurate as the original method even when sample sizes vary considerably , making it a useful technique in real tools .
