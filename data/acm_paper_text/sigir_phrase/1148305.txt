simple questions to improve pseudo-relevance-feedback results we explore interactive methods to further improve the performance of pseudo-relevance-feedback . studies \ citeria suggest that new methods for tackling difficult-queries are required . our approach is to gather more information about the query from the user by asking her simple questions . the equally simple responses are used to modify the original query . our experiments using the trec robust track queries show that we can obtain a significant improvement in mean-average-precision averaging around 5 \ % over pseudo-relevance-feedback . this improvement is also spread across more queries compared to ordinary pseudo-relevance-feedback , as suggested by geometric-mean average-precision .
