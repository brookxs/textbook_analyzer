spotsigs : robust and efficient near-duplicate-detection in large web collections motivated by our work with political scientists who need to manually analyze large web-archives of news sites , we present spotsigs , a new algorithm for extracting and matching signatures for near-duplicate-detection in large web crawls . our spot signatures are designed to favor natural-language portions of web-pages over advertisements and navigational bars . the contributions of spotsigs are twofold : 1) by combining stopword antecedents with short chains of adjacent content terms , we create robust document-signatures with a natural ability to filter out noisy components of web-pages that would otherwise distract pure n-gram-based approaches such as shingling ; 2) we provide an exact and efficient , self-tuning matching-algorithm that exploits a novel combination of collection partitioning and inverted-index-pruning for high-dimensional-similarity-search . experiments confirm an increase in combined precision-and-recall of more than 24 percent over state-of-the-art approaches such as shingling or i-match and up to a factor of 3 faster execution times than locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) , over a demonstrative `` gold set '' of manually assessed near-duplicate news-articles as well as the trec wt10g web collection .
