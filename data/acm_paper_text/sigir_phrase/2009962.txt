exploiting geographical-influence for collaborative point-of-interest recommendation in this paper , we aim to provide a point-of-interests (poi) recommendation-service for the rapid growing location-based-social-networks (lbsns) , e.g. , foursquare , whrrl , etc. . our idea is to explore user-preference , social-influence and geographical-influence for poi recommendations . in addition to deriving user-preference based on user-based-collaborative-filtering and exploring social-influence from friends , we put a special emphasis on geographical-influence due to the spatial-clustering phenomenon exhibited in user check-in activities of lbsns . we argue that the geographical-influence among pois plays an important role in user check-in behaviors and model it by power-law-distribution . accordingly , we develop a collaborative-recommendation algorithm based on geographical-influence based on naive-bayesian . furthermore , we propose a unified poi recommendation framework , which fuses user-preference to a poi with social-influence and geographical-influence . finally , we conduct a comprehensive performance-evaluation over two large-scale-datasets collected from foursquare and whrrl . experimental-results with these real datasets show that the unified collaborative-recommendation approach significantly outperforms a wide-spectrum of alternative recommendation approaches .
