effective query-expansion with the resistance-distance_based term-similarity metric in this paper , we define a new query-expansion method that relies on term-similarity metric derived from the electric resistance network . this proposed metric lets us measure the mutual relevancy in between terms and between their groups . this paper shows how to define this metric automatically from the document collection , and then apply it in query-expansion for document-retrieval tasks . the experiments show this method can be used to find good expansion terms of search queries and improve document-retrieval performance on two trec genomic track datasets .
