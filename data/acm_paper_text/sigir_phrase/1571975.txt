a syntactic-tree matching approach to finding similar questions in community-based qa services while traditional question-answering (qa) systems tailored to the trec qa task work relatively well for simple questions , they do not suffice to answer real-world questions . the community-based qa-systems offer this service well , as they contain large archives of such questions where manually crafted answers are directly available . however , finding similar questions in the qa archive is not trivial . in this paper , we propose a new retrieval-framework based on syntactic-tree structure to tackle the similar question-matching problem . we build a ground-truth set from yahoo!-answers , and experimental-results show that our method outperforms traditional bag-of-word or tree-kernel_based methods by 8.3 \ % in mean-average-precision . it further achieves up to 50 \ % improvement by incorporating semantic-features as well as matching of potential answers . our model does not rely on training , and it is demonstrated to be robust against grammatical errors as well .
