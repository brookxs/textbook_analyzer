document centered approach to text-normalization in this paper we present an approach to tackle three important problems of text-normalization : sentence-boundary-disambiguation , disambiguation of capitalized words when they are used in positions where capitalization is expected , and identification of abbreviations . the main feature of our approach is that it uses a minimum of pre-built resources , instead dynamically inferring disambiguation clues from the entire document itself . this makes it domain-independent , closely targeted to each individual document and portable to other languages . we thoroughly evaluated this approach on several corpora and it showed high accuracy .
