measure-based metasearch we propose a simple method for converting many standard measures of retrieval-performance into metasearch algorithms . our focus is both on the analysis of retrieval measures themselves and on the development of new metasearch algorithms . given the conversion-method proposed , our experimental-results using trec-data indicate that system-oriented measures of overall retrieval-performance (such as average-precision) yield good metasearch algorithms whose performance equals or exceeds that of benchmark techniques such as combmnz and condorcet .
