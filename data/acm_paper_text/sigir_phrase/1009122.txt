information-retrieval using hierarchical-dirichlet-processes an information-retrieval method is proposed using a hierarchical-dirichlet-process as a prior on the parameters of a set of multinomial distributions . the resulting method naturally includes a number of features found in other popular methods . specifically , tf.idf-like term-weighting and document-length normalisation are recovered . the new method is compared with okapi bm-25 [3] and the twenty-one model [1] on trec-data and is shown to give better performance .
