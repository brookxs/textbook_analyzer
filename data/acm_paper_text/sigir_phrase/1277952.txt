ranking by community relevance a web-page may be relevant to multiple topics ; even when nominally on a single topic , the page may attract attention (and thus links) from multiple communities . instead of indiscriminately summing the authority provided by all pages , we decompose a web-page into separate subnodes with respect to each community pointing to it . by considering the relevance of these communities , we are able to better model the query-specific reputation for each potential result . we apply a total of 125 queries to the trec . gov dataset to demonstrate how the use of community relevance can improve ranking-performance .
