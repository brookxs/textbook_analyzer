empirical development of an exponential probabilistic-model for text-retrieval : using textual-analysis to build a better model much work in information-retrieval focuses on using a model of documents and queries to derive retrieval algorithms . model-based-development is a useful alternative to heuristic development because in a model the assumptions are explicit and can be examined and refined independent of the particular retrieval algorithm . we explore the explicit assumptions underlying the na ve framework by performing computational-analysis of actual corpora and queries to devise a generative document-model that closely matches text . our thesis is that a model so developed will be more accurate than existing models , and thus more useful in retrieval , as well as other applications . we test this by learning from a corpus the best document model . we find the learned model better predicts the existence of text-data and has improved performance on certain ir tasks .
