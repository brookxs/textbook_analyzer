translating unknown queries with web-corpora for cross-language-information-retrieval it is crucial for cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) systems to deal with the translation of unknown queries due to that real queries might be short . the purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of exploiting the-web as the corpus source to translate unknown queries for clir . we propose an online translation approach to determine effective translations for unknown query terms via mining of bilingual search-result pages obtained from web-search-engines . this approach can alleviate the problem of the lack of large bilingual-corpora , translate many unknown query terms , provide flexible-query specifications , and extract semantically-close translations to benefit clir tasks -- especially for cross-language-web-search .
