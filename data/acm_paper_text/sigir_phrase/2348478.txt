fixed versus dynamic co-occurrence windows in textrank term-weights for information-retrieval textrank is a variant of pagerank typically used in graphs that represent documents , and where vertices denote terms and edges denote relations between terms . quite often the relation between terms is simple term-co-occurrence within a fixed window of k terms . the output of textrank when applied iteratively is a score for each vertex , i.e. a term-weight , that can be used for information-retrieval (ir) just like conventional term-frequency_based term-weights . so far , when computing textrank term-weights over co-occurrence-graphs , the window of term-co-occurrence is always fixed . this work departs from this , and considers dynamically adjusted windows of term-co-occurrence that follow the document-structure on a sentence - and paragraph-level . the resulting textrank term-weights are used in a ranking-function that re-ranks 1000 initially returned search-results in order to improve the precision of the ranking . experiments with two ir collections show that adjusting the vicinity of term-co-occurrence when computing textrank term-weights can lead to gains in early-precision .
