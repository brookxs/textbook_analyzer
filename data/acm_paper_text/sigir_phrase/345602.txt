incorporating quality-metrics in centralized/distributed information-retrieval on the world-wide-web most information-retrieval-systems on the internet rely primarily on similarity ranking-algorithms based solely on term-frequency statistics . information-quality is usually ignored . this leads to the problem that documents are retrieved without regard to their quality . we present an approach that combines similarity-based similarity ranking with quality ranking in centralized and distributed-search environments . six quality-metrics , including the currency , availability , information-to-noise ratio , authority , popularity , and cohesiveness , were investigated . search-effectiveness was significantly improved when the currency , availability , information-to-noise ratio and page cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in centralized search . the improvement seen when the availability , information-to - noise ratio , popularity , and cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in site-selection was also significant . finally , incorporating the popularity metric in information-fusion resulted in a significant improvement . in summary , the results show that incorporating quality-metrics can generally improve search-effectiveness in both centralized and distributed-search environments .
