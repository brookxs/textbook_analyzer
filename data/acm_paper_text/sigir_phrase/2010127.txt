forecasting counts of user-visits for online-display-advertising with probabilistic latent class models display-advertising is a multi-billion dollar industry where advertisers promote their products to users by having publishers display their advertisements on popular web-pages . an important problem in online-advertising is how to forecast the number of user-visits for a web-page during a particular period of time . prior research addressed the problem by using traditional time-series forecasting techniques on historical-data of user-visits ; (e.g. , via a single regression-model built for forecasting based on historical-data for all web-pages) and did not fully explore the fact that different types of web-pages have different patterns of user-visits . in this paper we propose a probabilistic latent class model to automatically learn the underlying user visit patterns among multiple web-pages . experiments carried out on real-world-data demonstrate the advantage of using latent classes in forecasting online user visits .
