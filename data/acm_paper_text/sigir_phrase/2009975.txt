competition-based user-expertise score estimation in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the relative expertise score of users in community question and answering services (cqa) . previous approaches typically only utilize the explicit question-answering relationship between askers and an-swerers and apply link-analysis to address this problem . the im-plicit pairwise-comparison between two users that is implied in the best answer-selection is ignored . given a question and answering thread , it 's likely that the expertise score of the best answerer is higher than the asker 's and all other non-best answerers ' . the goal of this paper is to explore such pairwise-comparisons inferred from best answer selections to estimate the relative expertise scores of users . formally , we treat each pairwise-comparison between two users as a two-player competition with one winner and one loser . two competition models are proposed to estimate user-expertise from pairwise-comparisons . using the ntcir-8 cqa task data with 3 million questions and introducing answer-quality prediction_based evaluation-metrics , the experimental-results show that the pairwise-comparison_based competition-model significantly outperforms link-analysis_based approaches (pagerank and hits) and pointwise approaches (number of best-answers and best answer ratio) for estimating the expertise of active users . furthermore , it 's shown that pairwise-comparison based competi-tion models have better discriminative power than other methods . it 's also found that answer-quality (best answer) is an important-factor to estimate user-expertise .
