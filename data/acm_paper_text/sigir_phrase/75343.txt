optimum polynomial retrieval functions we show that any approach to develop optimum retrieval functions is based on two kinds of assumptions : first , a certain form of representation for documents and requests , and second , additional simplifying assumptions that predefine the type of the retrieval-function . then we describe an approach for the development of optimum polynomial retrieval functions : request-document pairs (l , d m) are mapped onto description vectors @@@@ (l , d m) , and a polynomial function of the form @@@@ t @@@@ (@@@@) is developed such that it yields estimates of the probability of relevance p (r | @@@@ (l , d m)) with minimum square errors . we give experimental-results for the application of this approach to documents with weighted indexing as well as to documents with complex representations . in contrast to other probabilistic-models , our approach yields estimates of the actual probabilities , it can handle very complex representations of documents and requests , and it can be easily applied to multi-valued relevance scales . on the other hand , this approach is not suited to log-linear probabilistic-models , and it needs large samples of relevance-feedback data for its application .
