a content-based approach for discovering missing anchor-text for web-search although anchor-text provides very useful information for web-search , a large portion of web-pages have few or no incoming hyperlinks (anchors) , which is known as the anchor-text-sparsity problem . in this paper , we propose a language-modeling_based technique for overcoming anchor-text-sparsity by discovering a web-page 's plausible missing anchor-text from its similar web-pages ' in-link anchor-text . we design-experiments with two publicly available trec web-corpora (gov2 and clueweb09) to evaluate different approaches for discovering missing anchor-text . experimental-results show that our approach can effectively discover plausible missing anchor terms . we then use the-web named page finding task in the trec terabyte track to explore the utility of missing anchor-text information discovered by our approach for helping retrieval . experimental-results show that our approach can statistically significantly improve retrieval-performance , compared with several approaches that only use anchor-text aggregated over the-web graph .
