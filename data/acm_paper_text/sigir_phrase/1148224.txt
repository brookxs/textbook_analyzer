building implicit-links from content for forum-search the objective of web-forums is to create a shared-space for open communications and discussions of specific topics and issues . the tremendous information behind forum sites is not fully-utilized yet . most links between forum pages are automatically created , which means the link-based-ranking algorithm can not be applied efficiently . in this paper , we proposed a novel ranking-algorithm which tries to introduce the content information into link-based methods as implicit-links . the basic idea is derived from the more focused random surfer : the surfer may more likely jump to a page which is similar to what he is reading currently . in this manner , we are allowed to introduce the content similarities into the link-graph as a personalization bias . our method , named fine-grained rank (fgrank) , can be efficiently computed based on an automatically generated topic-hierarchy . not like the topic-sensitive-pagerank , our method only need to compute single pagerank score for each page . another contribution of this paper is to present a very efficient-algorithm for automatically generating topic-hierarchy and map each page in a large-scale collection onto the computed hierarchy . the experimental-results show that the proposed method can improve retrieval-performance , and reveal that content-based link-graph is also important compared with the hyper-link graph .
