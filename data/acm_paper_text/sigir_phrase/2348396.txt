personalized diversification of search-results search-personalization and diversification are often seen as opposing alternatives to cope with query uncertainty , where , given an ambiguous-query , it is either preferable to adapt the search result to a specific aspect that may interest the user (personalization) or to regard multiple aspects in order to maximize the probability that some query aspect is relevant to the user (diversification) . in this work , we question this antagonistic view , and hypothesize that these two directions may in fact be effectively combined and enhance each other . we research the introduction of the user as an explicit random-variable in state-of-the-art diversification methods , thus developing a generalized framework for personalized diversification . in order to evaluate our hypothesis , we conduct an evaluation with real-users using crowdsourcing services . the obtained results suggest that the combination of personalization and diversification achieves competitive performance , improving the base-line , plain personalization , and plain diversification approaches in terms of both diversity and accuracy measures .
