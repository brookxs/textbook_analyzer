on the robustness of relevance-measures with incomplete-judgments we investigate the robustness of three widely used ir relevance-measures for large-data collections with incomplete-judgments . the relevance-measures we consider are the bpref measure introduced by buckley and voorhees [7] , the inferred-average-precision (infap) introduced by aslam and yilmaz [4] , and the normalized-discounted-cumulative-gain (ndcg) measure introduced by j rvelin and kek l inen [8] . our main results show that ndcg consistently performs better than both bpref and infap . the experiments are performed on standard trec datasets , under different levels of incompleteness of judgments , and using two different evaluation-methods , namely , the kendall correlation measures order between system rankings and pairwise-statistical-significance testing ; the latter may be of independent interest .
