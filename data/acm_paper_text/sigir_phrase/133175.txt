automatic document classification : natural-language-processing , statistical-analysis , and expert-system techniques used together in this paper we describe an automated-method of classifying research project descriptions : a human expert classifies a sample set of projects into a set of disjoint and pre-defined classes , and then the computer learns from this sample how to classify new projects into these classes . both textual and non-textual information associated with the projects are used in the learning and classification phases . textual-information is processed by two methods of analysis : a natural-language-analysis followed by a statistical analysis . non-textual information is processed by a symbolic-learning technique . we present the results of some experiments done on real-data : two different classifications of our research projects .
