self-taught hashing for fast similarity-search the ability of fast similarity-search at large-scale is of great importance to many information-retrieval (ir) applications . a promising way to accelerate similarity-search is semantic-hashing which designs compact binary codes for a large number of documents so that semantically similar documents are mapped to similar codes (within a short hamming-distance) . although some recently proposed techniques are able to generate high-quality codes for documents known in advance , obtaining the codes for previously unseen documents remains to be a very challenging problem . in this paper , we emphasise this issue and propose a novel self-taught hashing (sth) approach to semantic-hashing : we first find the optimal l - bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via unsupervised-learning , and then train l classifiers via supervised-learning to predict the l - bit code for any query document unseen before . our experiments on three real-world-text datasets show that the proposed approach using binarised laplacian-eigenmap (lapeig) and linear-support-vector-machine (svm) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly .
