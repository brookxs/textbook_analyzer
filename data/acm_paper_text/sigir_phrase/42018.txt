fast object partitioning using stochastic-learning-automata let & ohgr ; = {a 1 , , a w} be a set of w objects to be partitioned into r classes {p 1 , , p r} . the objects are accessed in groups of unknown size and the size of these groups need not be equal . additionally , the joint access probabilities of the objects are unknown . the intention is that the objects accessed more frequently together are located in the same class . this problem has been shown to be np-hard [15 , 16] . in this paper , we propose two stochastic-learning-automata solutions to the problem . although the first one is relatively fast , its accuracy is not so remarkable in some environments . the second solution , which uses a new variable structure stochastic automation , demonstrates an excellent partitioning capability . experimentally , this solution converges an order of magnitude faster than the best known algorithm in the literature [15 , 16] .
