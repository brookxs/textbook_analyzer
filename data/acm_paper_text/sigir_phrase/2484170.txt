a document rating-system for preference judgements high quality relevance-judgments are essential for the evaluation of information-retrieval-systems . traditional methods of collecting relevance-judgments are based on collecting binary or graded nominal judgments , but such judgments are limited by factors such as inter-assessor disagreement and the arbitrariness of grades . previous research has shown that it is easier for assessors to make pairwise-preference judgments . however , unless the preferences collected are largely transitive , it is not clear how to combine them in order to obtain document-relevance scores . another difficulty is that the number of pairs that need to be assessed is quadratic in the number of documents . in this work , we consider the problem of inferring document-relevance scores from pairwise-preference judgments by analogy to tournaments using the elo rating-system . we show how to combine a linear number of pairwise-preference judgments from multiple assessors to compute relevance-scores for every document .
