the effect of threshold priming and need-for-cognition on relevance calibration and assessment human assessments of document-relevance are needed for the construction of test-collections , for ad-hoc evaluation , and for training-text classifiers . showing documents to assessors in different orderings , however , may lead to different assessment outcomes . we examine the effect that defineterm {threshold priming} , seeing varying degrees of relevant documents , has on people 's calibration of relevance . participants judged the relevance of a prologue of documents containing highly relevant , moderately relevant , or non-relevant ocuments , followed by a common epilogue of documents of mixed relevance . we observe that participants exposed to only non-relevant documents in the prologue assigned significantly higher average relevance-scores to prologue and epilogue documents than participants exposed to moderately or highly relevant documents in the prologue . we also examine how defineterm {need-for-cognition} , an individual difference measure of the extent to which a person enjoys engaging in effortful cognitive-activity , impacts relevance-assessments . high need-for-cognition participants had a significantly higher level of agreement with expert assessors than low need-for-cognition participants did . our findings indicate that assessors should be exposed to documents from multiple relevance levels early in the judging process , in order to calibrate their relevance thresholds in a balanced way , and that individual difference measures might be a useful way to screen assessors .
