improved video-categorization from text metadata and user-comments we consider the task of assigning categories (e.g. , howto/cooking , sports/basketball , pet/dogs) to youtube-videos from video-and-text signals . we show that two complementary views on the data -- from the video-and-text perspectives -- complement each other and refine predictions . the contributions of the paper are threefold : (1) we show that a text-based classifier trained on imperfect predictions of the weakly supervised video content-based classifier is not redundant ; (2) we demonstrate that a simple model which combines the predictions made by the two classifiers outperforms each of them taken independently ; (3) we analyse such sources of text-information as video title , description , user tags and viewers ' comments and show that each of them provides valuable clues to the topic of the video .
