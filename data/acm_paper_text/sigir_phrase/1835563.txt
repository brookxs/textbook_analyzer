discriminative-models of integrating document evidence and document-candidate associations for expert-search generative-models such as statistical-language-modeling have been widely studied in the task of expert-search to model the relationship between experts and their expertise indicated in supporting documents . on the other hand , discriminative-models have received little attention in expert-search research , although they have been shown to outperform generative-models in many other information-retrieval and machine-learning-applications . in this paper , we propose a principled relevance-based discriminative-learning framework for expert-search and derive specific discriminative-models from the framework . compared with the state-of-the-art language-models for expert-search , the proposed research can naturally integrate various document evidence and document-candidate associations into a single model without extra modeling assumptions or effort . an extensive set of experiments have been conducted on two trec enterprise track corpora (i.e. , w3c and cerc) to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework .
