towards zero-click mobile-ir evaluation : knowing what and knowing when in this poster , we propose two evaluation tasks for mobile-information-access . the first task evaluates the system 's ability to guess what the user 's query should be given a context (`` knowing what '') . the second task evaluates the system 's ability to decide when to proactively deploy a given query (`` knowing when '') . we conduct a preliminary manual analysis of a mobile query log to limit the space of possible queries so as to design feasible and practical evaluation tasks .
