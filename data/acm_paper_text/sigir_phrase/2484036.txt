incorporating vertical results into search click-models in modern search-engines , an increasing number of search result pages (serps) are federated from multiple specialized-search-engines (called verticals , such as image or video) . as an effective approach to interpret users ' click-through-behavior as feedback information , most click-models were designed to reduce the position bias and improve ranking-performance of ordinary search-results , which have homogeneous appearances . however , when vertical results are combined with ordinary ones , significant differences in presentation may lead to user-behavior biases and thus failure of state-of-the-art click-models . with the help of a popular commercial-search-engine in china , we collected a large-scale log-data set which contains behavior information on both vertical and ordinary results . we also performed eye-tracking-analysis to study user 's real-world examining behavior . according these analysis , we found that different result appearances may cause different behavior biases both for vertical results (local effect) and for the whole result lists (global effect) . these biases include : examine bias for vertical results (especially those with multimedia components) , trust bias for result lists with vertical results , and a higher probability of result revisitation for vertical results . based on these findings , a novel click-model considering these biases besides position bias was constructed to describe interaction with serps containing verticals . experimental-results show that the new vertical-aware click-model (vcm) is better at interpreting user click-behavior on federated searches in terms of both log-likelihood and perplexity than existing models .
