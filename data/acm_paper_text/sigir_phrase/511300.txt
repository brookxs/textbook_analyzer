file-structure-determination an approach to determining an appropriate file-structure for a given application is presented , by outlining a methodology for comparing some important aspects of data-management-system performance . the aspect chosen for analysis is the processing-time required to evaluate boolean-functions defined on data-values contained within a file-structure and select elements from the structure satisfying the expression.two file-structures are studied . the structures are each combinations of hierarchical and inverted-file organizations , which differ in the use of the pointers contained in the inverted-file . in one case they link a value to nodes corresponding to its occurrence in the data hierarchy and in the second they link a value to the entry which contains the node corresponding to an occurrence.algorithms for processing within each of the structures are discussed . each algorithm is then modeled , and approximating models developed for simulation of the algorithms .
