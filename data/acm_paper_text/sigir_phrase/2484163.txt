a comparison of the optimality of statistical-significance tests for information-retrieval-evaluation previous research has suggested the permutation-test as the theoretically optimal statistical-significance test for ir-evaluation , and advocated for the discontinuation of the wilcoxon and sign tests . we present a large-scale-study comprising nearly 60 million system comparisons showing that in practice the bootstrap , t-test and wilcoxon-test outperform the permutation-test under different optimality criteria . we also show that actual error-rates seem to be lower than the theoretically expected 5 % , further confirming that we may actually be underestimating significance .
