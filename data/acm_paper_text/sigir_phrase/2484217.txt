a portable multilingual medical directory by automatic-categorization of wikipedia articles wikipedia has become one of the most important sources-of-information available all over the world . however , the categorization of wikipedia articles is not standardized and the searches are mainly performed on keywords rather than concepts . in this paper we present an application that builds a hierarchical-structure to organize all wikipedia entries , so that medical articles can be reached from general to particular , using the well known medical subject-headings (mesh) thesaurus . moreover , the language links between articles will allow using the directory created in different languages . the final system can be packed and ported to mobile-devices as a standalone offline application .
