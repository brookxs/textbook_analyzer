multi-document-summarization via sentence-level-semantic-analysis and symmetric-matrix factorization multi-document-summarization aims to create a compressed summary while retaining the main characteristics of the original set of documents . many approaches use statistics and machine-learning-techniques to extract sentences from documents . in this paper , we propose a new multi-document-summarization framework based on sentence-level-semantic-analysis and symmetric-non-negative-matrix-factorization . we first calculate sentence-sentence similarities using semantic-analysis and construct the similarity-matrix . then symmetric-matrix factorization , which has been shown to be equivalent to normalized spectral-clustering , is used to group sentences into clusters . finally , the most informative sentences are selected from each group to form the summary . experimental-results on duc2005 and duc2006 data-sets demonstrate the improvement of our proposed framework over the implemented existing summarization-systems . a further study on the factors that benefit the high-performance is also conducted .
