a semantic-model and schema notation for bibliographic retrieval-systems logical-models or schema are used to represent the entities , relationships , and transformations of an information-system . the relational-model and the relational-algebra have been developed to perform this function for database-systems , but until recently only a few writers (e.g. , crawford , macleod , schek) have studied logical-models for bibliographic retrieval-systems . this paper examines an extension of the relational-model , called a semantic-model , as a schema for bibliographic systems . an alternative notation is suggested for the semantic model , based on the warnier/orr diagram . an experimental semantic-model user-interface , which has been developed for an experimental microcomputer information-retrieval-system , is briefly described .
