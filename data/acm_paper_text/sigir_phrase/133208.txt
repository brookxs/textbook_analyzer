searching for historical word-forms in a database of 17th-century english-text using spelling-correction methods this paper discusses the application of algorithmic spelling-correction techniques to the identification of those words in a database of 17 th century english-text that are most similar to a query word in modern-english . the experiments have used n - gram matching , non-phonetic coding and dynamic-programming methods for spelling-correction , and have demonstrated that high-recall searches can be carried out , although some of the searches are very demanding of computational-resources . the methods are , in principle , applicable to historical texts in many languages and from many diffeent periods .
