the maximum-entropy-principle in information-retrieval applications , assumptions and properties of the maximum-entropy-principle are discussed . the maximum-entropy-principle integrates prior estimates of relevance with the observed distribution of term combinations . the result may be a reordering of the segments of a database , compared to a naive estimate . numerical examples obtained by solution of the non-linear equations for the dual variables are presented and discussed . * supported in part by the national-science-foundation under grant ist-8318630 .
