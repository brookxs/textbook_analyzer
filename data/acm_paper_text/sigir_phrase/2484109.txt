finding knowledgeable groups in enterprise corpora the task of finding groups is a natural extension of search-tasks aimed at retrieving individual entities . we introduce a group finding task : given a query topic , find knowledgeable groups that have expertise on that topic . we present four general strategies to this task . the models are formalized using generative language-models . two of the models aggregate expertise scores of the experts in the same group for the task , one locates documents associated with experts in the group and then determines how closely the documents are associated with the topic , whilst the remaining model directly estimates the degree to which a group is a knowledgeable group for a given topic . we construct a test-collections based on the trec 2005 and 2006 enterprise collections . we find significant differences between different ways of estimating the association between a topic and a group . experiments show that our knowledgeable group finding models achieve high absolute scores .
