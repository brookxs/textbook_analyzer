multi-aspect query-summarization by composite query conventional search-engines usually return a ranked list of web-pages in response to a query . users have to visit several pages to locate the relevant parts . a promising future search scenario should involve : (1) understanding user-intents ; (2) providing relevant-information directly to satisfy searchers ' needs , as opposed to relevant pages . in this paper , we present a search paradigm to summarize a query 's information from different aspects . query-aspects could be aligned to user-intents . the generated summaries for query-aspects are expected to be both specific and informative , so that users can easily and quickly find relevant-information . specifically , we use a composite query for summarization '' method , where a set of component queries are used for providing additional-information for the original query . the system leverages the search-engine to proactively gather information by submitting multiple component queries according to the original query and its aspects . in this way , we could get more relevant-information for each query aspect and roughly classify information . by comparative mining the search-results of different component queries , it is able to identify query (dependent) aspect words , which help to generate more specific and informative summaries . the experimental-results on two data-sets , wikipedia and trec clueweb2009 , are encouraging . our method outperforms two baseline methods on generating informative summaries .
