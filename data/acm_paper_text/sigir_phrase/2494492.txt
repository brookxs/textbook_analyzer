riding the multimedia big-data wave in this talk we present a perspective across multiple industry-problems , including safety-and-security , medical , web , social and mobile-media , and motivate the need for large-scale-analysis and retrieval of multimedia-data . we describe a multi-layer architecture that incorporates capabilities for audio-visual-feature-extraction , machine-learning and semantic-modeling and provides a powerful framework for learning and classifying contents of multimedia-data . we discuss the role semantic ontologies for representing audio-visual concepts and relationships , which are essential for training semantic classifiers . we discuss the importance of using faceted-classification schemes in particular for organizing multimedia semantic-concepts in order to achieve effective learning and retrieval . we also show how training and scoring of multimedia-semantics can be implemented on big-data distributed-computing platforms to address both massive-scale analysis and low-latency processing . we describe multiple efforts at ibm on image-and-video-analysis and retrieval , including ibm multimedia-analysis-and-retrieval system (imars) , and show recent results for semantic-based classification and retrieval . we conclude with future-directions for improving analysis of multimedia through interactive and curriculum-based techniques for multimedia semantics-based learning and retrieval .
