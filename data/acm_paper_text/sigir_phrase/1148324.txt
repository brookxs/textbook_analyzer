lightening the load of document-smoothing for better language-modeling retrieval we hypothesized that language-modeling retrieval would improve if we reduced the need for document-smoothing to provide an inverse-document-frequency (idf) like effect . we created inverse collection frequency (icf) weighted query-models as a tool to partially separate the idf-like role from document-smoothing . compared to maximum-likelihood estimated (mle) queries , the icf weighted queries achieved a 6.4 \ \ % improvement in mean-average-precision on description queries . the icf weighted queries performed better with less document-smoothing than that required by mle queries . language-modeling retrieval may benefit from a means to separately incorporate an idf-like behavior outside of document-smoothing .
