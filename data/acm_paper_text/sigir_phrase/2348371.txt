learning-to-rank social update streams as online-social-media further integrates deeper into our lives , we spend more time consuming social update streams that come from our online connections . although social update streams provide a tremendous opportunity for us to access information on-the-fly , we often complain about its relevance . some of us are flooded with a steady stream of information and simply can not process it in full . ranking the incoming content becomes the only solution for the overwhelmed users . for some others , in contrast , the incoming information-stream is pretty weak , and they have to actively search for relevant-information which is quite tedious . for these users , augmenting their incoming content-flow with relevant-information from outside their first-degree network would be a viable solution . in that case , the problem of relevance becomes even more prominent . in this paper , we start an open discussion on how to build effective systems for ranking social updates from a unique perspective of linkedin -- the largest professional network in the world . more specifically , we address this problem as an intersection of learning-to-rank , collaborative-filtering , and clickthrough modeling , while leveraging ideas from information-retrieval and recommender-systems . we propose a novel probabilistic latent factor model with regressions on explicit features and compare it with a number of non-trivial baselines . in addition to demonstrating superior performance of our model , we shed some light on the nature of social updates on linkedin and how users interact with them , which might be applicable to social update streams in general .
