evaluation of filtering current news-search results we describe an evaluation of result-set filtering techniques for providing ultra-high precision in the task of presenting related news for general web-queries . in this task , the negative user-experience generated by retrieving non-relevant documents has a much worse impact than not retrieving relevant ones . we adapt cost-based metrics from the document filtering domain to this result filtering problem in order to explicitly examine the tradeoff between missing relevant documents and retrieving non-relevant ones . a large manual-evaluation of three simple threshold filters shows that the basic approach of counting matching title terms outperforms also incorporating selected abstract terms based on part-of-speech or higher-level linguistic-structures . simultaneously , leveraging these cost-based metrics allows us to explicitly determine what other tasks would benefit from these alternative techniques .
