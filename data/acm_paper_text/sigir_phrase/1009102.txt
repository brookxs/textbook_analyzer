detection and translation of oov-terms prior to query time accurate cross-language-information-retrieval requires that query terms be correctly translated . several new techniques to improve the translation of out of vocabulary terms in english-chinese cross-language-information-retrieval have been developed . however , these require queries and a document-collection to enable translation-disambiguation . although effective , they involve much processing and searching of the-web at query time , and may not be practical in a production web-search-engine . in this work , we consider what tasks maybe carried out beforehand , the goal being to reduce the processing required at query time . we have successfully developed new techniques to extract and translate out of vocabulary terms using the-web and add them into a translation-dictionary prior to query time .
