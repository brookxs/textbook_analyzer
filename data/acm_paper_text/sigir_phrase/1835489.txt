on statistical-analysis and optimization of information-retrieval effectiveness-metrics this paper presents a new way of thinking for ir metric-optimization . it is argued that the optimal-ranking problem should be factorized into two distinct yet interrelated stages : the relevance-prediction stage and ranking decision stage . during retrieval the relevance of documents is not known a priori , and the joint-probability of relevance is used to measure the uncertainty of documents ' relevance in the collection as a whole . the resulting optimization objective-function in the latter stage is , thus , the expected value of the ir metric with respect to this probability measure of relevance . through statistically analyzing the expected values of ir-metrics under such uncertainty , we discover and explain some interesting properties of ir-metrics that have not been known before . our analysis-and-optimization framework do not assume a particular (relevance) retrieval-model and metric , making it applicable to many existing ir-models and metrics . the experiments on one of resulting applications have demonstrated its significance in adapting to various ir-metrics .
