annod : a navigator of natural-language organized (textual) data annod is the name of a system developed at the national-library-of-medicine (nlm) , which implements a set of linguistic and empirical techniques that permit retrieval of natural-language information in response to natural-language queries . the system is based on dr. gerard salton 's smart [1] document-retrieval-system and is presently implemented on a mini-computer as part of an interactive-text management-system , items . [2] actual experience with retrieval of information from nlm 's hepatitis knowledge-base (hkb) , an encyclopedic hierarchical , full-text file , is presented . the techniques used in annod include : automatic stemming of words , common word deletion , thesaurus-expansion , a complex empirical matching (ranking) algorithm (similarity-measure) , and techniques expressly designed to permit rapid response in a mini-computer environment . preliminary testing demonstrates high efficiency in identifying portions of a text which are relevant to users .
