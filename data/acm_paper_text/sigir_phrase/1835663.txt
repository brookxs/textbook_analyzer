user-comments for news-recommendation in social-media reading and commenting online-news is becoming a common user behavior in social-media . discussion in the form of comments following news postings can be effectively facilitated if the service-provider can recommend articles based on not only the original news itself but also the thread of changing comments . this turns the traditional news-recommendation to a `` discussion moderator '' that can intelligently assist online-forums . in this work , we present a framework to recommend relevant-information in the forum-based social-media using user-comments . when incorporating user-comments , we consider structural and semantic information carried by them . experiments indicate that our proposed solutions provide an effective recommendation-service .
