evaluation in (xml) information-retrieval : expected precision-recall with user-modelling (eprum) standard information-retrieval (ir) metrics assume a simple model where documents are understood as independent units . such an assumption is not adapted to new paradigms like xml or web-ir where retrievable informations are parts of documents or sets of related documents . moreover , classical hypotheses assumes that the user ignores the structural or logical context of document elements and hence the possibility of navigation between units . eprum is a generalisation of precision-recall (pr) that aims at allowing the user to navigate or browse in the corpus-structure . like the cumulated-gain metrics , it is able to handle continuous valued relevance . we apply and compare eprum in the context of xml-retrieval -- a very active field for evaluation-metrics . we also explain how eprum can be used in other ir paradigms .
