development of a modern opac : from revtolc to marian since 1986 we have investigated the problems and possibilities of applying modern information retrieval-methods to large online public access library catalogs (opacs) . in the retrieval-experiment virginia tech online catalog (revtolc) study we carried out a large pilot test in 1987 and a larger , controlled investigation in 1990 , with 216 users and roughly 500,000 marc-records . results indicated that a forms-based interface coupled with vector and relevance-feedback retrieval-methods would be well received . recent efforts developing the multiple access and retrieval of information with annotations (marian) system have involved used of a specially developed object-oriented dbms , construction of a client running under nextstep , programming of a distributed-server with a thread assigned to each user-session to increase concurrency on a small network of nexts , refinement of algorithms to use objects and stopping rules for greater efficiency , usability-testing and iterative interface refinement .
