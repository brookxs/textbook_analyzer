intelligent fusion of structural and citation-based evidence for text-classification this paper shows how different measures of similarity derived from the citation-information and the structural content (e.g. , title , abstract) of the collection can be fused to improve classification effectiveness . to discover the best fusion framework , we apply genetic-programming (gp) techniques . our experiments with the acm-computing-classification-scheme , using documents from the acm digital-library , indicate that gp can discover similarity-functions superior to those based solely on a single type of evidence . effectiveness of the similarity-functions discovered through simple-majority-voting is better than that of content-based as well as combination-based support-vector-machine classifiers . experiments also were conducted to compare the performance between gp techniques and other fusion techniques such as genetic-algorithms (ga) and linear fusion . empirical-results show that gp was able to discover better similarity-functions than other fusion techniques .
