indexing strategies for graceful-degradation of search-quality large web-search-engines process billions of queries each day over tens of billions of documents with often very stringent requirements for a user 's search experience , in particular , low-latency and highly relevant search-results . index generation and serving are key to satisfying both these requirements . for example , the load to search-engines can vary drastically when popular events happen around the world . in the case when the load is exceeding what the search-engine can serve , queries will get dropped . this results in an un - graceful-degradation in search-quality . another example that could increase the query load and affect the user 's search experience are ambiguous-queries which often result in the execution of multiple query alterations in the back end . in this paper , we look into the problem of designing robust indexing strategies , i.e. strategies that allow for a graceful-degradation of search-quality in both the above scenarios . we study the problems of index generation and serving using the notions of document allocation , server-selection , and document-replication . we explore the space of efficient-algorithms for these problems and empirically corroborate with existing theory that it is hard to optimally solve the alocation and selection problems without any replication . we propose a greedy replication-algorithm and study its performance under different choices of allocation and selection . further , we show hat under random-selection and allocation , our algorithm is optimal .
