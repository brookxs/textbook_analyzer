best-document-selection based on approximate utility optimization this poster describes an alternative approach to handling the best-document-selection problem . best-document-selection is a common problem with many real-world-applications , but is not a well studied problem by itself ; a simple solution would be to treat it as a ranking problem and to use existing ranking-algorithms to rank all documents . we could then select only the first element of the sorted list . however , because ranking-models optimize for all ranks , the model may sacrifice accuracy of the top rank for the sake of overall accuracy . this is an unnecessary trade-off . we begin by first defining an appropriate objective-function for the domain , then create a boosting-algorithm that explicitly targets this function . based on experiments on a benchmark retrieval data-set and digg.com news commenting data-set , we find that even a simple algorithm built for this specific problem gives better results than baseline algorithms that were designed for the more complicated ranking tasks .
