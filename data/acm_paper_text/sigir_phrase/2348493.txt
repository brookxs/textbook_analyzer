new assessment-criteria for query-suggestion query-suggestion is a useful tool to help users express their information-needs by supplying alternative queries . when evaluating the effectiveness of query-suggestion algorithms , many previous studies focus on measuring whether a suggestion query is relevant or not to the input query . this assessment criterion is too simple to describe users ' requirements . in this paper , we introduce two scenarios of query-suggestion . the first scenario represents cases where the search result of the input query is unsatisfactory . the second scenario represents cases where the search result is satisfactory but the user may be looking for alternative solutions . based on the two scenarios , we propose two assessment-criteria . our labeling results indicate that the new assessment-criteria provide finer distinctions among query-suggestions than the traditional relevance-based criterion .
