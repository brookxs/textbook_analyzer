divq : diversification for keyword-search over structured databases keyword-queries over structured databases are notoriously ambiguous . no single interpretation of a keyword-query can satisfy all users , and multiple-interpretations may yield overlapping results . this paper proposes a scheme to balance the relevance and novelty of keyword-search results over structured databases . firstly , we present a probabilistic-model which effectively ranks the possible interpretations of a keyword-query over structured-data . then , we introduce a scheme to diversify the search-results by re-ranking query interpretations , taking into account redundancy of query results . finally , we propose ? - ndcg-w and ws-recall , an adaptation of ? - ndcg and s-recall metrics , taking into account graded-relevance of subtopics . our evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that search-results obtained using the proposed diversification algorithms better characterize possible answers available in the database than the results of the initial relevance-ranking .
