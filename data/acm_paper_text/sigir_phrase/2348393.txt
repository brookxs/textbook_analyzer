mixture-model with multiple centralized retrieval algorithms for result-merging in federated-search result-merging is an important research problem in federated-search for merging documents retrieved from multiple ranked-lists of selected information-sources into a single list . the state-of-the-art result-merging algorithms such as semi-supervised-learning (ssl) and sample-agglomerate fitting estimate (safe) try to map document scores retrieved from different sources to comparable scores according to a single centralized retrieval algorithm for ranking those documents . both ssl and safe arbitrarily select a single centralized retrieval algorithm for generating comparable-document scores , which is problematic in a heterogeneous federated-search environment , since a single centralized algorithm is often suboptimal for different information-sources . based on this observation , this paper proposes a novel approach for result-merging by utilizing multiple centralized retrieval algorithms . one simple approach is to learn a set of combination weights for multiple centralized retrieval algorithms (e.g. , logistic-regression) to compute comparable-document scores . the paper shows that this simple approach generates suboptimal results as it is not flexible enough to deal with heterogeneous-information-sources . a mixture probabilistic-model is thus proposed to learn more appropriate combination weights with respect to different types of information sources with some training-data . an extensive set of experiments on three datasets have proven the effectiveness of the proposed new approach .
