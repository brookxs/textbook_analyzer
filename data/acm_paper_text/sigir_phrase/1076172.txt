automated-evaluation of search-engine-performance via implicit-user-feedback measuring the information-retrieval effectiveness of web-search-engines can be expensive if human-relevance-judgments are required to evaluate search-results . using implicit-user-feedback for search-engine-evaluation provides a cost and time effective manner of addressing this problem . web-search-engines can use human-evaluation of search-results without the expense of human evaluators . an additional advantage of this approach is the availability of real-time data regarding system-performance . wecapture user relevance judgments actions such as print , save and bookmark , sending these actions and the corresponding document identifiers to a central server via a client application . we use this implicit-feedback to calculate performance-metrics , such as precision . we can calculate an overall system-performance metric based on a collection of weighted metrics .
