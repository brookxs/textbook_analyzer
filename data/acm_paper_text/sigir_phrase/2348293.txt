manhattan hashing for large-scale-image-retrieval hashing is used to learn binary-code representation for data with expectation of preserving the neighborhood-structure in the original feature-space . due to its fast-query speed and reduced storage-cost , hashing has been widely used for efficient nearest-neighbor-search in a large variety of applications like text and image-retrieval . most existing hashing methods adopt hamming-distance to measure the similarity (neighborhood) between points in the hashcode space . however , one problem with hamming-distance is that it may destroy the neighborhood-structure in the original feature-space , which violates the essential goal of hashing . in this paper , manhattan hashing (mh) , which is based on manhattan-distance , is proposed to solve the problem of hamming-distance based hashing . the basic idea of mh is to encode each projected dimension with multiple bits of natural binary-code (nbc) , based on which the manhattan-distance between points in the hashcode space is calculated for nearest-neighbor-search . mh can effectively preserve the neighborhood-structure in the data to achieve the goal of hashing . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to adopt manhattan-distance with nbc for hashing . experiments on several large-scale image data-sets containing up to one million points show that our mh method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods .
