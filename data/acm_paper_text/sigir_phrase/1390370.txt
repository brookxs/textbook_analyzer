a study of learning a merge-model for multilingual-information-retrieval this paper proposes a learning-approach for the merging process in multilingual-information-retrieval (mlir) . to conduct the learning-approach , we also present a large number of features that may influence the mlir merging process ; these features are mainly extracted from three levels : query , document , and translation . after the feature-extraction , we then use the frank ranking-algorithm to construct a merge-model ; to our knowledge , this practice is the first attempt to use a learning-based ranking-algorithm to construct a merge-model for mlir merging . in our experiments , three test-collections for the task of crosslingual-information-retrieval (clir) in ntcir3 , 4 , and 5 are employed to assess the performance of our proposed method ; moreover , several merging methods are also carried out for a comparison , including traditional merging methods , the 2-step merging strategy , and the merging method based on logistic-regression . the experimental-results show that our method can significantly improve merging quality on two different types of datasets . in addition to the effectiveness , through the merge-model generated by frank , our method can further identify key factors that influence the merging process ; this information might provide us more insight and understanding into mlir merging .
