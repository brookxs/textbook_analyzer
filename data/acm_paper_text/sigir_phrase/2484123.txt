explicit-feedback in local-search tasks modern search-engines make extensive use of people 's contextual-information to finesse result rankings . using a searcher 's location provides an especially strong signal for adjusting results for certain classes of queries where people may have clear preference for local results , without explicitly specifying the location in the query direct-ly . however , if the location estimate is inaccurate or searchers want to obtain many results from a particular location , they have limited control on the location focus in the search-results returned . in this paper we describe a user-study that examines the effect of offering searchers more control over how local preferences are gathered and used . we studied providing users with functionality to offer explicit-relevance-feedback (erf) adjacent to results automatically identi-fied as location-dependent (i.e. , more from this location) . they can use this functionality to indicate whether they are interested in a particular search result and desire more results from that result 's location . we compared the erf system against a baseline (noerf) that used the same underlying mechanisms to retrieve and rank results , but did not offer erf support . user-performance was as-sessed across 12 experimental participants over 12 location-sensitive topics , in a fully counter-balanced design . we found that participants interacted with erf frequently , and there were signs that erf has the potential to improve success-rates and lead to more efficient searching for location-sensitive search-tasks than noerf .
