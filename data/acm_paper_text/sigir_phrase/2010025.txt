post-ranking query-suggestion by diversifying search-results query-suggestion refers to the process of suggesting related queries to search-engine users . most existing researches have focused on improving the relevance of suggested queries . in this paper , we introduce the concept of diversifying the content of the search-results from suggested queries while keeping the suggestion relevant . our framework first retrieves a set of query candidates from search-engine-logs using random-walk and other techniques . we then re-rank the suggested queries by ranking them in the order which maximizes the diversification function that measures the difference between the original search-results and the results from suggested queries . the diversification function we proposed includes features like odp category , url and domain similarity and so on . one important outcome from our research which contradicts with most existing researches is that , with the increase of suggestion relevance , the similarity between the queries actually decreases . experiments are conducted on a large set of human-labeled data , which is randomly sampled from a commercial-search-engine 's log . results indicate that the post-ranking framework significantly improves the relevance of suggested queries by comparing to existing models .
