capturing collection-size for distributed non-cooperative retrieval modern distributed-information-retrieval techniques require accurate knowledge of collection-size . in non-cooperative environments , where detailed collection statistics are not available , the size of the underlying collections must be estimated . while several approaches for the estimation of collection-size have been proposed , their accuracy has not been thoroughly evaluated . an empirical-analysis of past estimation approaches across a variety of collections demonstrates that their prediction-accuracy is low . motivated by ecological techniques for the estimation of animal populations , we propose two new approaches for the estimation of collection-size . we show that our approaches are significantly more accurate that previous methods , and are more efficient in use of resources required to perform the estimation .
