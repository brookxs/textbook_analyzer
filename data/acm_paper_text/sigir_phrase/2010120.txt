award prediction with temporal citation-network analysis each year many acm sig communities will recognize an outstanding researcher through an award in honor of his or her profound impact and numerous research contributions . this work is the first to investigate an automated mechanism to help in selecting future award winners . we approach the problem as a researchers ' expertise ranking problem , and propose a temporal probabilistic-ranking model which combines content with citation-network analysis . experimental-results based on real-world citation data and historical awardees indicate that some kinds of sig awards are well-modeled by this approach .
