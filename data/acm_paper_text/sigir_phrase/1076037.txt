challenges in running a commercial-search-engine these are exciting times for information-retrieval . web-search-engines have brought ir to the masses . it now affects the lives of hundreds of millions of people , and growing , as internet-search companies launch ever more products based on techniques developed in these are exciting times for information-retrieval . web-search-engines have brought ir to the masses . it now affects the lives of hundreds of millions of people , and growing , as internet-search companies launch ever more products based on techniques developed in ir research.the real-world poses unique challenges for search-algorithms . they operate at unprecedented scales , and over a wide diversity-of-information . in addition , we have entered an unprecedented world of `` adversarial-information-retrieval '' . the lure of billions of dollars of commerce , guided by search-engines , motivates all kinds of people to try all kinds of tricks to get their sites to the top of the search results.what techniques do people use to defeat ir algorithms ? what are the evaluation challenges for a web-search-engine ? how much impact has ir had on search-engines ? how does google serve over 250 million queries a day , often with sub-second response-times ? this talk will show that the world of algorithm and system-design for commercial search engines can be described by two of murphy 's laws : a) if anything can go wrong , it will , and b) if anything can not go wrong , it will anyway .
