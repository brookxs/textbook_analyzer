towards musical query-by-semantic-description using the cal500 data-set query-by-semantic-description (qbsd) is a natural paradigm for retrieving content from large-databases of music . a major impediment to the development of good qbsd systems for music-information-retrieval has been the lack of a cleanly-labeled , publicly-available , heterogeneous-data set of songs and associated annotations . we have collected the computer-audition lab 500-song (cal500) data-set by having humans listen to and annotate songs using a survey designed to capture ` semantic-associations ' between music and words . we adapt the supervised multi-class labeling (sml) model , which has shown good performance on the task of image-retrieval , and use the cal500 data to learn a model for music-retrieval . the model-parameters are estimated using the weighted mixture-hierarchies expectation-maximization-algorithm which has been specifically designed to handle real-valued semantic-association between words and songs , rather than binary class labels . the output of the sml model , a vector of class-conditional probabilities , can be interpreted as a semantic multinomial-distribution over a vocabulary . by also representing a semantic-query as a query multinomial-distribution , we can quickly rank-order the songs in a database based on the kullback-leibler-divergence between the query multinomial and each song 's semantic multinomial . qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our sml model can both annotate a novel song with meaningful words and retrieve relevant songs given a multi-word , text-based query .
