user-evaluation of query-quality although a great deal of research has been conducted about automatic techniques for determining query-quality , there have been relatively few studies about how people judge query-quality . this study investigated this topic through a laboratory-experiment with 40 subjects . subjects were shown eight information problems (five fact-finding and three exploratory) and asked to evaluate queries for these problems according to several quality-attributes . subjects then evaluated search-engine-results-pages (serps) for each query , which were manipulated to exhibit different levels of performance . following this , subjects reevaluated the queries , were interviewed about their evaluation approaches and repeated the rating procedure for two information problems . results showed that for fact-finding information problems , longer queries received higher ratings (both initial and post-serp) , and that post-serp query ratings were more affected by the proportion of relevant documents viewed to all documents viewed rather than the ranks of the relevant documents . for exploratory information problems , subjects ' ratings were highly correlated with the number of relevant documents in the serp as well as the proportion of relevant documents viewed . subjects adopted several approaches when evaluating query-quality , which led to different quality ratings . finally , during the reliability check subjects ' initial evaluations were fairly stable , but their post-serp evaluations significantly increased .
