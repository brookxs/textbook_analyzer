search , interrupted : understanding and predicting search-task continuation many important search-tasks require multiple search-sessions to complete . tasks such as travel-planning , large purchases , or job searches can span hours , days , or even weeks . inevitably , life interferes , requiring the searcher either to recover the `` state '' of the search manually (most common) , or plan for interruption in advance (unlikely) . the goal of this work is to better understand , characterize , and automatically detect search-tasks that will be continued in the near future . to this end , we analyze a query-log from the bing web-search-engine to identify the types of intents , topics , and search-behavior patterns associated with long-running tasks that are likely to be continued . using our insights , we develop an effective prediction-algorithm that significantly outperforms both the previous state-of-the-art method , and even the ability of human judges , to predict future task continuation . potential applications of our techniques would allow a search-engine to pre-emptively `` save state '' for a searcher (e.g. , by caching search-results) , perform more targeted personalization , and otherwise better support the searcher experience for interrupted search-tasks .
