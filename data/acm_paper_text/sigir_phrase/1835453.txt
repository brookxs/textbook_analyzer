prototype-hierarchy_based clustering for the categorization and navigation of web collections this paper presents a novel prototype-hierarchy_based clustering (phc) framework for the organization of web collections . it solves simultaneously the problem of categorizing web collections and interpreting the clustering results for navigation . by utilizing prototype hierarchies and the underlying topic structures of the collections , phc is modeled as a multi-criterion optimization-problem based on minimizing the hierarchy evolution , maximizing category cohesiveness and inter-hierarchy structural and semantic resemblance . the flexible design of metrics enables phc to be a general-framework for applications in various domains . in the experiments on categorizing 4 collections of distinct domains , phc achieves 30 \ % improvement in f 1 over the state-of-the-art techniques . further experiments provide insights on performance variations with abstract and concrete domains , completeness of the prototype-hierarchy , and effects of different combinations of optimization criteria .
