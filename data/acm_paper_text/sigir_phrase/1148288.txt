first large-scale-information-retrieval experiments on turkish texts we present the results of the first large-scale turkish information-retrieval experiments performed on a trec-like test-collection . the test-bed , which has been created for this study , contains 95.5 million words , 408,305 documents , 72 ad-hoc queries and has a size of about 800mb . all documents come from the turkish newspaper milliyet . we implement and apply simple to sophisticated stemmers and various query-document-matching functions and show that truncating words at a prefix length of 5 creates an effective retrieval environment in turkish . however , a lemmatizer-based stemmer provides significantly better effectiveness over a variety of matching-functions .
