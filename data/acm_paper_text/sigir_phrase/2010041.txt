cross-language web page-classification via dual knowledge-transfer using nonnegative matrix tri-factorization the lack of sufficient labeled web-pages in many languages , especially for those uncommonly used ones , presents a great challenge to traditional supervised-classification methods to achieve satisfactory web-page-classification performance . to address this , we propose a novel nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (nmtf) based dual knowledge-transfer (dkt) approach for cross-language web page-classification , which is based on the following two important observations . first , we observe that web-pages for a same topic from different languages usually share some common semantic patterns , though in different representation forms . second , we also observe that the associations between word clusters and web-page classes are a more reliable carrier than raw words to transfer knowledge across languages . with these recognitions , we attempt to transfer knowledge from the auxiliary language , in which abundant labeled web-pages are available , to target-languages , in which we want classify web-pages , through two different paths : word cluster approximations and the associations between word clusters and web-page classes . due to the reinforcement between these two different knowledge-transfer paths , our approach can achieve better classification-accuracy . we evaluate the proposed approach in extensive experiments using a real-world cross-language web page data-set . promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach that is consistent with our theoretical analyses .
