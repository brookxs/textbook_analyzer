information-retrieval using impression of documents as a clue proposed here is an internal-representation and mapping-method for multimedia-information in which retrieval is based on the impression documents are desired to make . a user-interface-design for a system using this method is also proposed . the proposed internal-representation and mapping-method represents each desired document impression as an axis in a semantic-space . documents are represented as points in the space . queries are represented as subspaces . the proposed user-interface-design employs a method of visual-presentation of the semantic space . for evaluation purposes , a prototype-system has been developed . an image-retrieval experiment shows that the proposed internal-representation and mapping-method and the user-interface-design provide effective tools for information-retrieval .
