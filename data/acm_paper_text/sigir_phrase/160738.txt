an application of least-squares fit mapping to text-information-retrieval this paper describes a unique example-based mapping-method for document-retrieval . we discovered that the knowledge about relevance among queries and documents can be used to obtain empirical connections between query terms and the canonical concepts which are used for indexing the content of documents . these connections do not depend on whether there are shared terms among the queries and documents ; therefore , they are especially effective for a mapping from queries to the documents where the concepts are relevant but the terms used by article authors happen to be different from the terms of database users . we employ a linear least-squares fit (llsf) technique to compute such connections from a collection of queries and documents where the relevance is assigned by humans , and then use these connections in the retrieval of documents where the relevance is unknown . we tested this method on both retrieval and indexing with a set of medline documents which has been used by other information-retrieval-systems for evaluations . the effectiveness of the llsf-mapping and the significant improvement over alternative approaches was evident in the tests .
