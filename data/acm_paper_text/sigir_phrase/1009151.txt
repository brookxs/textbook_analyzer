understanding combination-of-evidence using generative probabilistic models for information-retrieval (abstract only) structured-documents , rich information-needs , and detailed information about users are becoming more pervasive within everyday-computing usage . applications such as question-answering , reading tutors , and xml-retrieval demand more robust-retrieval on richly annotated documents . in order to effectively serve these applications , the community will need a better understanding of the combination-of-evidence . in this work , i propose that the use of simple generative probabilistic models will be an effective framework for these problems . statistical-language-models , which are a special case of generative probabilistic models , have been used extensively within recent information-retrieval-research . their flexibility has been very effective in adapting to numerous tasks and problems . i propose to extend the statistical-language-modeling framework to handle rich information-needs and documents with structural and linguistic annotations . much of the prior work on combination-of-evidence has had few well-studied theoretical contributions , so i also propose to develop a sounder theoretical basis which gives more predictable results .
