on the mathematical relationship between expected n-call@k and the relevance vs. diversity trade-off it has been previously noted that optimization of the n-call@k relevance objective (i.e. , a set-based objective that is 1 if at least n documents in a set of k are relevant , otherwise 0) encourages more result-set diversification for smaller n , but this statement has never been formally quantified . in this work , we explicitly derive the mathematical relationship between expected n-call@k and the relevance vs. diversity trade-off -- through fortuitous cancellations in the resulting combinatorial-optimization , we show the trade-off is a simple and intuitive function of n (notably independent of the result-set size k e n) , where diversification increases as n approaches 1 .
