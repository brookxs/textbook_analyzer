tuning before feedback : combining ranking discovery and blind-feedback for robust-retrieval both ranking-functions and user queries are very important factors affecting a search-engine 's performance . prior research has looked at how to improve ad-hoc-retrieval performance for existing queries while tuning the ranking-function , or modify and expand user queries using a fixed ranking-scheme using blind-feedback . however , almost no research has looked at how to combine ranking-function tuning and blind-feedback together to improve ad-hoc-retrieval performance . in this paper , we look at the performance-improvement for ad-hoc-retrieval from a more integrated point-of-view by combining the merits of both techniques . in particular , we argue that the ranking-function should be tuned first , using user-provided queries , before applying the-blind feedback technique . the intuition is that highly-tuned ranking offers more high quality documents at the top of the hit list , thus offers a stronger baseline for blind-feedback . we verify this integrated model in a large-scale heterogeneous collection and the experimental-results show that combining ranking-function tuning and blind-feedback can improve search-performance by almost 30 \ % over the baseline okapi system .
