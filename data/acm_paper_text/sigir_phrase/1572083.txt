identifying the original contribution of a document via language-modeling one goal of text-mining is to provide readers with automatic methods for quickly finding the key ideas in individual documents and whole corpora . to this effect , we propose a statistically well-founded method for identifying the original ideas that a document contributes to a corpus , focusing on self-referential diachronic corpora such as research-publications , blogs , email , and news-articles . our statistical-model of passage impact defines (interesting) original content through a combination of impact and novelty , and it can be used to identify the most original passages in a document . unlike heuristic approaches , this statistical-model is extensible and open to analysis . we evaluate the approach on both synthetic and real-data , showing that the passage impact model outperforms a heuristic baseline method .
