bag-of-visual-words expansion using visual-relatedness for video-indexing bag-of-visual-words (bow) has been popular for visual classification in recent years . in this paper , we propose a novel bow expansion method to alleviate the effect of visual-word correlation problem . we achieve this by diffusing the weights of visual-words in bow based on visual-word relatedness , which is rigorously defined within a visual ontology . the proposed method is tested in video-indexing experiment on trecvid-2006 video-retrieval benchmark , and an improvement of 7 \ % over the traditional bow is reported .
