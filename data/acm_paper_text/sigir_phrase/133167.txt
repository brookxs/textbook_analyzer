relevance-feedback revisited researchers have found relevance-feedback to be effective in interactive-information-retrieval , although few formal user-experiments have been made . in order to run a user-experiment on a large-document-collection , experiments were performed at nist to complete some of the missing-links found in using the probabilistic-retrieval-model . these experiments , using the cranfield 1400 collection , showed the importance of query-expansion in addition to query reweighting , and showed that adding as few as 20 well-selected terms could result in performance-improvements of over 100 \ % . additionally it was shown that performing multiple iterations of feedback is highly effective .
