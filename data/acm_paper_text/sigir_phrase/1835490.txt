information-based-models for ad-hoc ir we introduce in this paper the-family of information-based-models for ad-hoc-information-retrieval . these models draw their inspiration from a long-standing hypothesis in ir , namely the fact that the difference in the behaviors of a word at the document and collection levels brings information on the significance of the word for the document . this hypothesis has been exploited in the 2-poisson mixture-models , in the notion of eliteness in bm25 , and more recently in dfr models . we show here that , combined with notions related to burstiness , it can lead to simpler and better models .
