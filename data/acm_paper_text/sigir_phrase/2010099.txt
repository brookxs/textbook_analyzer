recommending interesting activity-related local-entities when searching for entities with a strong local character (e.g. , a museum) , people may also be interested in discovering proximal activity-related entities (e.g. , a caf) . geographical proximity is a necessary , but not sufficient , qualifier for recommending other entities such that they are related in a useful manner (e.g. , interest in a fish market does not imply interest in nearby bookshops , but interest in other produce stores is more likely) . we describe and evaluate methods to identify such activity-related local-entities .
