retrieving information from the book of humanity : the personalized-medicine data tsunami crashes on the beach of jeopardy from a mute but eloquent alphabet of 4 characters emerges a complex biological ` literature ' whose highest expression is human existence . the rapidly advancing technologies of ` nextgen sequencing ' will soon make it possible to inexpensively acquire and store the characters of our complete personal genetic instruction-set and make it available for health-assessment and disease-management . this uniquely personal form of ` big-data ' brings with it challenges that will be discussed in this keynote presentation . topics will include a brief introduction to the linguistic challenges of ` biology as literature ' , the impact of personal molecular variation on traditional approaches to disease prevention , diagnosis and treatment , and the challenges of information-retrieval when a large volume of primary observations is made that is associated with an evanescent and rapidly changing corpus of scientific interpretation of those primary observations . experience with extracting high quality pheonotypes from electronic-medical-records has shown that natural-language-processing capability is an essential information-extraction function for correlation of clinical events with personal genetic variation . any powerful set of information can be used or misused , and put those who depend upon it in jeopardy . these issues , and a lesson from the long running jeopardy tv series , will be discussed .
