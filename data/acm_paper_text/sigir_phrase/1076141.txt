characterization of a simple case of the reassignment of document identifiers as a pattern sequencing problem in this poster , we analyze recent work in the document identifiers reassignment problem . after that , we present a formalization of a simple case of the problem as a psp (pattern sequencing problem) . this may facilitate future work as it opens a new research line to solve the general problem .
