the feature quantity : an information-theoretic perspective of tfidf-like measures the feature quantity , a quantitative representation of specificity introduced in this paper , is based on an information-theoretic perspective of co-occurrence events between terms and documents . mathematically , the feature quantity is defined as a product of probability and information , and maintains a good correspondence with the tfidf - like measures popularly used in today 's ir systems . in this paper , we present a formal-description of the feature quantity , as well as some illustrative examples of applying such a quantity to different types of information retrieval tasks : representative term-selection and text-categorization .
