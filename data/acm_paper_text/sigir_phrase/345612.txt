latent-semantic-indexing model for boolean-query formulation (poster session) a new model named boolean latent-semantic-indexing model based on the singular-value-decomposition and boolean-query formulation is introduced . while the singular-value-decomposition alleviates the problems of lexical-matching in the traditional information-retrieval-model , boolean-query formulation can help users to make precise representation of their information-search needs . retrieval experiments on a number of test-collections seem to show that the proposed model achieves substantial performance gains over the latent-semantic-indexing model .
