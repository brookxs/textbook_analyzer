improving biomedical-document-retrieval using domain-knowledge research-articles typically introduce new results or findings and relate them to knowledge entities of immediate relevance . however , a large body of context knowledge related to the results is often not explicitly mentioned in the article . to overcome this limitation the state-of-the-art information-retrieval approaches rely on the latent-semantic-analysis in which terms in articles are projected to a lower dimensional latent-space and best possible matches in this space are identified . however , this approach may not perform well enough if the number of explicit-knowledge entities in the articles is too small compared to the amount of knowledge in the domain . we address the problem by exploiting a domain-knowledge layer , a rich network of relations among knowledge entities in the domain extracted from a large-corpus of documents . the knowledge layer supplies the context knowledge that lets us relate different knowledge entities and hence improve the information-retrieval performance . we develop and study a new framework for i) learning and aggregating the relations in the knowledge layer from the literature corpus ; ii) and for exploiting these relations to improve the information-retrieval of relevant documents .
