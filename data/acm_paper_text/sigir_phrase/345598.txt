interactive internet-search : keyword , directory and query-reformulation mechanisms compared this article compares search-effectiveness when using query-based internet-search (via the google-search-engine) , directory-based search (via yahoo) and phrase-based query-reformulation assisted search (via the hyperindex browser) by means of a controlled , user-based experimental-study . the focus was to evaluate aspects of the search-process . cognitive-load was measured using a secondary digit-monitoring task to quantify the effort of the user in various search states ; independent relevance-judgements were employed to gauge the quality of the documents accessed during the search-process . time was monitored in various search states . results indicated the directory-based search does not offer increased relevance over the query-based search (with or without query-formulation assistance) , and also takes longer . query-reformulation does significantly improve the relevance of the documents through which the user must trawl versus standard query-based internet-search . however , the improvement in document-relevance comes at the cost of increased search-time and increased cognitive-load .
