juse : a picture dictionary-query system for children as adults we take for granted our capacity to express our information-needs verbally and textually . however , young-children also have preferences and information needs , but are just learning to be able to express themselves effectively . consequently they encounter many barriers when trying to spell , type , and communicate their needs to a ` faceless ' search-engine text box . junior search (juse) is an-interface that enables preschoolers and young-children to search and find consumable online-content (such as games for kids , videos , etc.) through adaptable picture dictionaries . inspired by educational children 's toys , rather than search-engines designed for adults , juse incorporates a learning element by combining audio-visual and textual cues to improve written word-recognition and vocabulary skills . juse provides an interactive-learning-environment that allows parents to introduce new words and concepts into the child 's lexicon , as well as controlling the content and search queries .
