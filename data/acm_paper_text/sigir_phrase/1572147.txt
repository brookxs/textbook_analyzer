using wikipedia-categories for ad-hoc search in this paper we explore the use of category-information for ad-hoc-retrieval in wikipedia . we show that techniques for entity-ranking exploiting this category-information can also be applied to ad-hoc topics and lead to significant improvements . automatically assigned target categories are good surrogates for manually assigned categories , which perform only slightly better .
