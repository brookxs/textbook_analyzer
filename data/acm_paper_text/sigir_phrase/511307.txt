efficient utilization of limited access archival-storage in a time shared-environment the public storage in any time-sharing system tends to continually grow . this necessitates the implementation of certain measures to maintain public storage . one of these possibilities is creation of an archival level of storage called `` migrated '' storage . data that have not been referenced recently are moved or `` migrated '' to a less accessible level of external storage . since these data are not accessed by the users directly , i.e. , the data must be restored to public storage before being used , a certain variable-length coding technique , viz. , huffman-coding , is used to compact and store these data . the ideas presented have been implemented on a version of tss/360 time-sharing system and are presently being used in a real environment . the overall compaction rate achieved was 3 . 16 to 1 . further details on compaction rates and timings are also presented .
