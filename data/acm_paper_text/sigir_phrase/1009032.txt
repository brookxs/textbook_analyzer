restrictive-clustering and metaclustering for self-organizing document-collections this paper addresses the problem of automatically structuring heterogenous document-collections by using clustering-methods . in contrast to traditional clustering , we study restrictive methods and ensemble-based meta methods that may decide to leave out some documents rather than assigning them to inappropriate clusters with low confidence . these techniques result in higher cluster purity , better overall accuracy , and make unsupervised self-organization more robust . our comprehensive experimental-studies on three different real-world-data collections demonstrate these benefits . the proposed methods seem particularly suitable for automatically substructuring personal email-folders or personal-web directories that are populated by focused-crawlers , and they can be combined with supervised-classification techniques .
