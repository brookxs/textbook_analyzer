smoothing clickthrough-data for web-search-ranking incorporating features extracted from clickthrough-data (called clickthrough features) has been demonstrated to significantly improve the performance of ranking-models for web-search applications . such benefits , however , are severely limited by the data-sparseness-problem , i.e. , many queries and documents have no or very few clicks . the ranker thus can not rely strongly on clickthrough features for document-ranking . this paper presents two smoothing-methods to expand clickthrough-data : query-clustering via random-walk on click graphs and a discounting-method inspired by the good-turing estimator . both methods are evaluated on real-world-data in three web-search domains . experimental-results show that the ranking-models trained on smoothed clickthrough features consistently outperform those trained on unsmoothed features . this study demonstrates both the importance and the benefits of dealing with the sparseness-problem in clickthrough-data .
