exploring traversal-strategy for web-forum crawling in this paper , we study the problem of web-forum crawling . web-forum has now become an important data source of many web-applications ; while forum crawling is still a challenging task due to complex in-site link-structures and login controls of most forum sites . without carefully selecting the traversal path , a generic crawler usually downloads many duplicate and invalid pages from forums , and thus wastes both the precious bandwidth and the limited storage space . to crawl forum data more effectively and efficiently , in this paper , we propose an automatic approach to exploring an appropriate traversal-strategy to direct the crawling of a given target forum . in detail , the traversal-strategy consists of the identification of the skeleton links and the detection of the page-flipping links . the skeleton links instruct the crawler to only crawl valuable pages and meanwhile avoid duplicate and uninformative ones ; and the page-flipping links tell the crawler how to completely download a long discussion thread which is usually shown in multiple pages in web-forums . the extensive experimental-results on several forums show encouraging performance of our approach . following the discovered traversal-strategy , our forum-crawler can archive more informative pages in comparison with previous related work and a commercial generic crawler .
