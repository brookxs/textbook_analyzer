graph-based text-classification : learn from your neighbors automatic-classification of data items , based on training-samples , can be boosted by considering the neighborhood of data items in a graph-structure (e.g. , neighboring documents in a hyperlink environment or co-authors and their publications for bibliographic-data entries) . this paper presents a new method for graph-based-classification , with particular emphasis on hyperlinked text-documents but broader applicability . our approach is based on iterative-relaxation labeling and can be combined with either bayesian or svm classifiers on the feature spaces of the given data items . the graph neighborhood is taken into consideration to exploit locality patterns while at the same time avoiding overfitting . in contrast to prior work along these lines , our approach employs a number of novel techniques : dynamically inferring the link/class pattern in the graph in the run of the iterative-relaxation labeling , judicious pruning of edges from the neighborhood-graph based on node dissimilarities and node degrees , weighting the influence of edges based on a distance-metric between the classification labels of interest and weighting edges by content-similarity measures . our techniques considerably improve the robustness and accuracy of the classification outcome , as shown in systematic experimental comparisons with previously published methods on three different real-world datasets .
