modeling subset distributions for verbose-queries improving verbose (or long) queries poses a new challenge for search systems . previous techniques mainly focused on two aspects , weighting the important-words or phrases and selecting the best subset query . the former does not consider how words and phrases are used in actual subset-queries , while the latter ignores alternative subset-queries . recently , a novel reformulation framework has been proposed to transform the original query as a distribution of reformulated queries , which overcomes the disadvantages of previous techniques . in this paper , we apply this framework to verbose-queries , where a reformulated query is specified as a subset query . experiments on trec collections show that the query-distribution_based framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques .
