quantify query-ambiguity using odp metadata query ambiguity prevents existing retrieval-systems from returning reasonable results for every query . as there is already lots of work done on resolving ambiguity , vague-queries could be handled using corresponding approaches separately if they can be identified in advance . quantification of the degree of (lack of) ambiguity laysthe groundwork for the identification . in this poster , we propose such a measure using query topics based on the topic-structure selected from the open-directory-project (odp) taxonomy . we introduce clarity score to quantify the lack of ambiguity with respect to data-sets constructed from the trec collections and the rank-correlation-test results demonstrate a strong positive association between the clarity scores and retrieval precisions for queries .
