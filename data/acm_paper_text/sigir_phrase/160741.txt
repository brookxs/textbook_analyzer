on the evaluation of boolean-operators in the extended boolean-retrieval framework the retrieval-models based on the extended boolean-retrieval framework , e.g. , the fuzzy-set model and the extended boolean-model have been proposed in the past to provide the conventional boolean-retrieval system with the document ranking facility . however , due to undesirable properties of evaluation formulas for the and and or operations , the former generates incorrect ranked output in certain cases and the latter suffers from the complexity-of-computation . there have been a variety of fuzzy operators to replace the evaluation formulas . in this paper we first investigate the behavioral aspects of the fuzzy operators and address important issues to affect retrieval-effectiveness . we then define an operator class called positively compensatory operators giving high retrieval-effectiveness , and present a pair of positively compensatory operators providing high retrieval-efficiency as well as high retrieval-effectiveness . all the claims are justified through experiments .
