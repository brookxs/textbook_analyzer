sentiment diversification with different biases prior search-result-diversification work focuses on achieving topical variety in a ranked list , typically equally across all aspects . in this paper , we diversify with sentiments according to an explicit bias . we want to allow users to switch the result perspective to better grasp the polarity of opinionated content , such as during a literature-review . for this , we first infer the prior sentiment bias inherent in a controversial topic -- the ` topic sentiment ' . then , we utilize this information in 3 different ways to diversify results according to various sentiment biases : (1) equal diversification to achieve a balanced and unbiased representation of all sentiments on the topic ; (2) diversification towards the topic sentiment , in which the actual sentiment bias in the topic is mirrored to emphasize the general perception of the topic ; (3) diversification against the topic sentiment , in which documents about the ` minority ' or outlying sentiment (s) are boosted and those with the popular sentiment are demoted . since sentiment-classification is an essential tool for this task , we experiment by gradually degrading the accuracy of a perfect classifier down to 40 % , and show which diversification approaches prove most stable in this setting . the results reveal that the proportionality-based methods and our scsf model , considering sentiment strength and frequency in the diversified list , yield the highest gains . further , in case the topic sentiment can not be reliably estimated , we show how performance is affected by equal diversification when actually an emphasis either towards or against the topic sentiment is desired : in the former case , an average of 6.48 % is lost across all evaluation-measures , whereas in the latter case this is 16.23 % , confirming that bias-specific sentiment diversification is crucial .
