cloudsearch and the democratization of information-retrieval amazon cloudsearch is a new hosted search-service , built on top of many cloud-based aws services , and based on the same technology that powers search on amazon 's retail sites . because of its ease of configuration and scalability , cloudsearch represents the next step in the democratization of information-retrieval . this democratization process , increasing access to search for both end-users and potential search providers , has continued over several decades , through technologies like early online metered search-services , enterprise-search software , web-search , and open-source-search tools . cloudsearch further reduces barriers to entry , allowing a person or organization to basically say `` make my content searchable '' and have it happen automatically . cloudsearch may also offer an opportunity to overcome the stagnation that has occurred in search user experiences over the past 15 years . when you no longer need to be a search expert to make your content available , you 're not stuck with ten blue links . instead , you can focus on providing the kind of interaction that makes sense for your application and your users . cloudsearch enables a flowering of search-applications that need not be tied to the-web , and an opportunity to explore new ways of interacting with information-retrieval-technology .
