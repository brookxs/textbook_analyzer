a combined component approach for finding collection-adapted ranking-functions based on genetic-programming in this paper , we propose a new method to discover collection-adapted ranking-functions based on genetic-programming (gp) . our combined component approach (cca) is based on the combination of several term-weighting components (i.e. , term-frequency , collection frequency , normalization) extracted from well-known ranking-functions . in contrast to related work , the gp terminals in our cca are not based on simple statistical-information of a document-collection , but on meaningful , effective , and proven components . experimental-results show that our approach was able to outper form standard tf-idf , bm25 and another gp-based approach in two different collections . cca obtained improvements in mean-average-precision up to 40.87 \ % for the trec-8 collection , and 24.85 \ % for the wbr99 collection (a large brazilian web collection) , over the baseline functions . the cca evolution process also was able to reduce the overtraining , commonly found in machine-learning-methods , especially genetic-programming , and to converge faster than the other gp-based approach used for comparison .
