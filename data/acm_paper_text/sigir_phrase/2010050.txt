utilizing marginal net utility for recommendation in e-commerce traditional recommendation-algorithms often select products with the highest predicted ratings to recommend . however , earlier research in economics and marketing indicates that a consumer usually makes purchase decision (s) based on the product 's marginal net utility (i.e. , the marginal-utility minus the product price) . utility is defined as the satisfaction or pleasure user u gets when purchasing the corresponding product . a rational consumer chooses the product to purchase in order to maximize the total net utility . in contrast to the predicted rating , the marginal-utility of a product depends on the user 's purchase history and changes over time . according to the law of diminishing marginal-utility , many products have the decreasing marginal-utility with the increase of purchase count , such as cell-phones , computers , and so on . users are not likely to purchase the same or similar product again in a short time if they already purchased it before . on the other hand , some products , such as pet food , baby diapers , would be purchased again and again . to better match users ' purchase decisions in the real-world , this paper explores how to recommend products with the highest marginal net utility in e-commerce sites . inspired by the cobb-douglas utility-function in consumer-behavior theory , we propose a novel utility-based recommendation framework . the framework can be utilized to revamp a family of existing recommendation-algorithms . to demonstrate the idea , we use singular-value-decomposition (svd) as an example and revamp it with the framework . we evaluate the proposed algorithm on an e-commerce (shop.com) data-set . the new algorithm significantly improves the base algorithm , largely due to its ability to recommend both products that are new to the user and products that the user is likely to re-purchase .
