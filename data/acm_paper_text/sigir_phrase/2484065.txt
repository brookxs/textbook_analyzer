faster upper bounding of intersection sizes there is a long history of developing efficient-algorithms for set-intersection , which is a fundamental operation in information-retrieval-and-databases . in this paper , we describe a new data-structure , a cardinality filter , to quickly compute an upper-bound on the size of a set-intersection . knowing an upper-bound of the size can be used to accelerate many applications such as top-k-query-processing in text-mining . given finite sets a and b , the expected computation-time for the upper-bound of the size of the intersection | a cap b | is o ((| a | + | b |) w) , where w is the machine word length . this is much faster than the current best algorithm for the exact intersection , which runs in o ((| a | + | b |) / &#8730; w + | a cap b |) expected time . our performance-studies show that our implementations of cardinality filters are from 2 to 10 times faster than existing set-intersection algorithms , and the time for a top-k-query in a text-mining application can be reduced by half .
