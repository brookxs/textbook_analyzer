structured translation for cross-language-information-retrieval the paper introduces a query-translation model that reflects the structure of the cross-language-information-retrieval task . the model is based on a structured bilingual-dictionary in which the translations of each term are clustered into groups with distinct meanings . query-translation is modeled as a two-stage process , with the system first determining the intended meaning of a query-term and then selecting translations appropriate to that meaning that might appear in the document-collection . an implementation of structured translation based on automatic dictionary clustering is described and evaluated by using chinese queries to retrieve english documents . structured translation achieved an average-precision that was statistically indistinguishable from pirkola 's technique for very short queries , but pirkola 's technique outperformed structured translation on long-queries . the paper concludes with some observations on future work to improve retrieval-effectiveness and on other potential uses of structured translation in interactive cross-language retrieval applications .
