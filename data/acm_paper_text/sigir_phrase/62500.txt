compression of concordances in full-text-retrieval systems the concordance of a full-text-information-retrieval system contains for every different word w of the data-base , a list l (w) of coordinates , each of which describes the exact location of an occurrence of w in the text . the concordance should be compressed , not only for the savings in storage space , but also in order to reduce the number of i/o operations , since the file is usually kept in secondary-memory . several methods are presented , which efficiently compress concordances of large fulltext retrieval-systems . the methods were tested on the concordance of the responsa retrieval project and yield savings of up to 49 \ % relative to the non-compressed file ; this is a relative improvement of about 27 \ % over the currently used prefix-omission compression-technique .
