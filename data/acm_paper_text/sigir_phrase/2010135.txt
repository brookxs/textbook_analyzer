a bipartite-graph_based social-network splicing method for person-name-disambiguation the key issue of person-name-disambiguation is to discover different namesakes in massive web-documents rather than simply cluster documents by using textual-features . in this paper , we describe a novel person-name-disambiguation method based on social-networks to effectively identify namesakes . the social-network snippets in each document are extracted . then , the namesakes are identified via splicing the social-networks of each namesake by using the snippets as a bipartite-graph . experimental-results show that our method achieves better result than the top performance of weps-2 in identifying different namesakes .
