dependency trigram-model for social relation-extraction from news-articles we propose a kernel-based model to automatically extract social-relations such as economic relations and political relations between two people from news-articles . to determine whether two people are structurally associated with each other , the proposed model uses an svm (support-vector-machine) tree-kernel based on trigrams of head-dependent relations between them . in the experiments with the automatic-content-extraction (ace) corpus and a korean-news corpus , the proposed model outperformed the previous systems based on svm tree-kernels even though it used more shallow linguistic-knowledge .
