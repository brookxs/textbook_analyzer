probabilistic structured-query methods structured methods for query-term replacement rely on separate estimates of term tes of replacement probabilities . statistically significantfrequency and document-frequency to compute a weight for each query-term . this paper reviews prior work on structured-query techniques and introduces three new variants that leverage estima improvements in retrieval-effectiveness are demonstrated for cross-language-retrieval and for retrieval based on optical-character-recognition when replacement probabilities are used to estimate both term-frequency and document-frequency .
