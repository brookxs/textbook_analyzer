title extraction from bodies of html-documents and its application to web-page-retrieval this paper is concerned with automatic-extraction of titles from the bodies of html-documents . titles of html-documents should be correctly defined in the title fields ; however , in reality html titles are often bogus . it is desirable to conduct automatic-extraction of titles from the bodies of html-documents . this is an issue which does not seem to have been investigated previously . in this paper , we take a supervised-machine-learning approach to address the problem . we propose a specification on html titles . we utilize format information such as font-size , position , and font weight as features in title extraction . our method significantly outperforms the baseline method of using the lines in largest font-size as title (20.9 \ % -32.6 \ % improvement in f1 score) . as application , we consider web-page-retrieval . we use the trec web track data for evaluation . we propose a new method for html-documents retrieval using extracted titles . experimental-results indicate that the use of both extracted titles and title fields is almost always better than the use of title fields alone ; the use of extracted titles is particularly helpful in the task of named page finding (23.1 \ % -29.0 \ % improvements) .
