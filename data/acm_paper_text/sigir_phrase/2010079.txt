multi-layer graph-based semi-supervised learning for large-scale image datasets using mapreduce semi-supervised-learning is to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled-data in the world . this paper proposes a scalable graph-based-technique leveraging the distributed-computing power of the mapreduce programming-model . for a higher quality of learning , the paper also presents a multi-layer learning structure to unify both visual and textual-information of image-data during the learning-process . experimental-results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods .
