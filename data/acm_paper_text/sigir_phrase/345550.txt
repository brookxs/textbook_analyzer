improving text-categorization methods for event-tracking automated tracking of events from chronologically ordered document streams is a new challenge for statistical text classification . existing learning-techniques must be adapted or improved in order to effectively handle difficult situations where the number of positive training instances per event is extremely small , the majority of training-documents are unlabelled , and most of the events have a short duration in time . we adapted several supervised-text-categorization methods , specifically several new variants of the k-nearest-neighbor (knn) algorithm and a rocchio approach , to track events . all of these methods showed significant improvement (up to 71 \ % reduction in weighted error-rates) over the performance of the original knn algorithm on tdt benchmark collections , making knn among the top-performing systems in the recent tdt3 official evaluation . furthermore , by combining these methods , we significantly reduced the variance in performance of our event-tracking system over different data-collections , suggesting a robust-solution for parameter-optimization .
