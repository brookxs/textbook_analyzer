latent concepts and the number orthogonal factors in latent-semantic-analysis we seek insight into latent-semantic-indexing by establishing a method to identify the optimal number of factors in the reduced matrix for representing a keyword . this method is demonstrated empirically by duplicating all documents containing a term t , and inserting new documents in the database that replace t with t ' . by examining the number of times term t is identified for a search on term t ' (precision) using differing ranges of dimensions , we find that lower ranked dimensions identify related terms and higher-ranked dimensions discriminate between the synonyms .
