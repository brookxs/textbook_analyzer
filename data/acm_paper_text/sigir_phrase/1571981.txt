building enriched document representations using aggregated anchor-text it is well known that anchor-text plays a critical role in a variety of search-tasks performed over hypertextual domains , including enterprise-search , wiki search , and web-search . it is common practice to enrich a document 's standard textual representation with all of the anchor-text associated with its incoming hyperlinks . however , this approach does not help match relevant pages with very few inlinks . in this paper , we propose a method for overcoming anchor-text-sparsity by enriching document representations with anchor-text that has been aggregated across the hyperlink graph . this aggregation-mechanism acts to smooth , or diffuse , anchor-text within a domain . we rigorously evaluate our proposed approach on a large web-search test-collection . our results show the approach significantly improves retrieval-effectiveness , especially for longer , more difficult-queries .
