intent-aware search-result-diversification search-result-diversification has gained momentum as a way to tackle ambiguous-queries . an effective approach to this problem is to explicitly model the possible aspects underlying a query , in order to maximise the estimated relevance of the retrieved documents with respect to the different aspects . however , such aspects themselves may represent information-needs with rather distinct intents (e.g. , informational or navigational) . hence , a diverse ranking could benefit from applying intent-aware retrieval-models when estimating the relevance of documents to different aspects . in this paper , we propose to diversify the results retrieved for a given query , by learning the appropriateness of different retrieval-models for each of the aspects underlying this query . thorough experiments within the evaluation-framework provided by the diversity task of the trec 2009 and 2010 web tracks show that the proposed approach can significantly improve state-of-the-art diversification approaches .
