web-derived resources for web-information-retrieval : from conceptual-hierarchies to attribute-hierarchies a weakly-supervised extraction-method identifies concepts within conceptual-hierarchies , at the appropriate level of specificity (e.g. , bank vs. institution) , to which attributes (e.g. , routing number) extracted from unstructured-text best apply . the extraction exploits labeled classes of instances acquired from a combination of web-documents and query-logs , and inserted into existing conceptual-hierarchies . the correct concept is identified within the top three positions on average over gold-standard attributes , which corresponds to higher accuracy than in alternative experiments .
