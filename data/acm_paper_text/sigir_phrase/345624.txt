modeling question-response patterns by scaling and visualization (poster session) the evaluation of question difficulty is usually considered the domain of latent trait theory . however , these methods require standardized question sets normalized by large populations , rendering them inefficient for use in the numerous areas where questions must be evaluated . a new technique is illustrated that models the question-response cycle well , but without the procedural difficulty of the traditional methods .
