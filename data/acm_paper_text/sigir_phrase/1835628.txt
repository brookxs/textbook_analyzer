exploring the use of labels to shortcut-search trails search-trails comprising queries and web-page views are created as searchers engage in information-seeking activity online . during known-item search (where the objective may be to locate a target web-page) , searchers may waste valuable time repeatedly reformulating queries as they attempt to locate an elusive page . trail shortcuts help users bypass unnecessary queries and get them to their desired destination faster . in this poster we present a comparative oracle study of techniques to shortcut sub-optimal search-trails using labels derived from social-bookmarking , anchor-text , query-logs , and a human-computation game . we show that labels can help users reach target pages efficiently , that the label sources perform differently , and that shortcuts are potentially most useful when the target is challenging to find .
