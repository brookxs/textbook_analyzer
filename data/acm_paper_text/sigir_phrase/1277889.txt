semantic text classification of disease reporting traditional text-classification studied in the ir literature is mainly based on topics . that is , each class or category represents a particular topic , e.g. , sports , politics or sciences . however , many real-world-text classification problems require more refined classification based on some semantic aspects . for example , in a set of documents about a particular disease , some documents may report the outbreak of the disease , some may describe how to cure the disease , some may discuss how to prevent the disease , and yet some others may include all the above information . to classify text at this semantic level , the traditional `` bag-of-words '' model is no longer sufficient . in this paper , we report a text-classification study at the semantic level and show that sentence semantic and structure-features are very useful for such kind of classification . our experimental-results based on a disease-outbreak dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach .
