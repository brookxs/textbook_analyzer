locality discriminating indexing for document-classification this paper introduces a locality discriminating indexing (ldi) algorithm for document-classification . based on the hypothesis that samples from different classes reside in class-specific manifold structures , ldi seeks for a projection which best preserves the within-class local-structures while suppresses the between-class overlap . comparative experiments show that the proposed method isable to derives compact discriminating document representations for classification .
