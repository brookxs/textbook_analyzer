eusum : extracting easy-to-understand english summaries for non-native readers in this paper we investigate a novel and important problem in multi-document-summarization , i.e. , how to extract an easy-to-understand english summary for non-native readers . existing summarization-systems extract the same kind of english summaries from english news documents for both native and non-native readers . however , the non-native readers have different english reading skills because they have different english education-and-learning backgrounds . an english summary which can be easily understood by native readers may be hardly understood by non-native readers . we propose to add the dimension of reading-easiness or difficulty to multi-document-summarization , and the proposed eusum system can produce easy-to-understand summaries according to the english reading skills of the readers . the sentence-level reading-easiness (or difficulty) is predicted by using the svm-regression method . and the reading easiness score of each sentence is then incorporated into the summarization-process . empirical-evaluation and user-study have been performed and the results demonstrate that the eusum system can produce more easy-to-understand summaries for non-native readers than existing summarization-systems , with very little sacrifice of the summary 's informativeness .
