updating collection representations for federated-search to facilitate the search for relevant-information across a setof online distributed collections , a federated information retrieval-system typically represents each collection , centrally , by a set of vocabularies or sampled documents . accurate-retrieval is therefore related to how precise each representation reflects the underlying content stored in that collection . as collections evolve over time , collection representations should also be updated to reflect any change , however , a current solution has not yet been proposed . in this study we examine both the implications of out-of-date representation sets on retrieval-accuracy , as well as proposing three different policies for managing necessary updates . each policyis evaluated on a testbed of forty-four dynamic collections over an eight-week period . our findings show that out-of-date representations significantly degrade performance overtime , however , adopting a suitable update-policy can minimise this problem .
