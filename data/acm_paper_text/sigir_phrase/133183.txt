versioning a full-text-information-retrieval system in this paper , we present an approach to the incorporation of object-versioning into a distributed full-text-information-retrieval system . we propose an implementation based on partially versioned index sets , arguing that its space-overhead and query-time performance make it suitable for full-text ir , with its heavy dependence on inverted-indexing . we develop algorithms for computing both historical queries and time range-queries and show how these algorithms can be applied to a number of problems in distributed information management , such as data-replication , caching , transactional consistency , and hybrid-media repositories .
