effectiveness/efficiency tradeoffs for candidate-generation in multi-stage retrieval architectures this paper examines a multi-stage retrieval architecture consisting of a candidate-generation stage , a feature-extraction stage , and a reranking stage using machine-learned models . given a fixed set-of-features and a learning-to-rank model , we explore effectiveness/efficiency tradeoffs with three candidate-generation approaches : postings intersection with svs , conjunctive-query evaluation with wand , and disjunctive query-evaluation with wand . we find no significant differences in end-to-end effectiveness as measured by ndcg between conjunctive and disjunctive wand , but conjunctive-query evaluation is substantially faster . postings intersection with svs , while fast , yields substantially lower end-to-end effectiveness , suggesting that document and term frequencies remain important in the initial ranking stage . these findings show that conjunctive wand is the best overall candidate-generation strategy of those we examined .
