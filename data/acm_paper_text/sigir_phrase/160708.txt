integrating a dynamic-lexicon with a dynamic full-text-retrieval system there has been a great deal of interest within the information-retrieval-community in evaluating the use of linguistic-knowledge to improve the indexing and searching of textual-databases . such systems must often employ a lexicon to store information about the words and phrases comprising the application 's domain . unlike a static lexicon , a dynamic-lexicon raises practical concerns about the coordination between the state of the lexicon and ir indexing schemes based on lexical-knowledge . additionally , it introduces a host of database-management issues , many of which are similar to those found in the text-databases as well . in this paper , we explore a range of system-design and performance issues that arise when integrating a dynamic-lexicon with a dynamic full-text-information-retrieval system . we observe that the principle of functional isolation argues against the use of language-dependent information in article indexes and favors the use of query-time strategies for applying lexical-knowledge . we propose and evaluate a system-architecture which embodies this principle . we also show how a storage-and-retrieval infrastructure based on burkowski 's [burkowski92] containment-model abstraction can be employed to implement both the text-retrieval and lexicon facilities required in an integrated-system .
