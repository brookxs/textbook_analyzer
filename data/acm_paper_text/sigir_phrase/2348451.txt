a hybrid-model for ad-hoc information-retrieval many information-retrieval (ir) techniques have been proposed to improve the performance , and some combinations of these techniques has been demonstrated to be effective . however , how to effectively combine them is largely unexplored . it is possible that a method reduces the positive influence of the other one even if both of them are effective separately . in this paper , we propose a new hybrid-model which can simply and flexibly combine components of three different ir techniques under a uniform framework . extensive experiments on the trec standard collections indicate that our proposed model can outperform the best trec systems consistently in the ad-hoc-retrieval . it shows that the combination strategy in our proposed model is very effective . meanwhile , this method is also re-useable for other researchers to test whether their new methods are additive to the current technologies .
