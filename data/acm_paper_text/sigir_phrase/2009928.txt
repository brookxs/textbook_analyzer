learning search-tasks in queries and web-pages via graph-regularization as the-internet grows explosively , search-engines play a more and more important role for users in effectively accessing online-information . recently , it has been recognized that a query is often triggered by a search-task that the user wants to accomplish . similarly , many web-pages are specifically designed to help accomplish a certain task . therefore , learning hidden tasks behind queries and web-pages can help-search engines return the most useful web-pages to users by task-matching . for instance , the search-task that triggers query `` thinkpad t410 broken '' is to maintain a computer , and it is desirable for a search-engine to return the lenovo troubleshooting page on the top of the list . however , existing search-engine technologies mainly focus on topic-detection or relevance-ranking , which are not able to predict the task that triggers a query and the task a web-page can accomplish . in this paper , we propose to simultaneously classify queries and web-pages into the popular search-tasks by exploiting their content together with click-through logs . specifically , we construct a taskoriented heterogeneous graph among queries and web-pages . each pair of objects in the graph are linked together as long as they potentially share similar search-tasks . a novel graph-based-regularization algorithm is designed for search-task prediction by leveraging the graph . extensive experiments in real search-log data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art classifiers , and the search-performance can be significantly improved by using the task-prediction results as additional-information .
