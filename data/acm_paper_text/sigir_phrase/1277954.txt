making mind and machine meet : a study of combining cognitive and algorithmic relevance-feedback using saracevic 's relevance types , we explore approaches to combining algorithm and cognitive-relevance in a term-relevance feedback scenario . data collected from 21 users who provided relevance-feedback about terms suggested by a system for 50 trec-hard topics are used . the former type of feedback is considered as cognitive-relevance and the latter type is considered as algorithm relevance . we construct retrieval runs using these two types of relevance-feedback and experiment with ways of combining them with simple boolean-operators . results show minimal differences in performance with respect to the different techniques .
