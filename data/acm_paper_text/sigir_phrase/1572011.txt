compositemap : a novel framework for music-similarity measure with the continuing advances in data-storage and communication-technology , there has been an explosive growth of music-information from different application-domains . as an effective technique for organizing , browsing , and searching large-data collections , music-information-retrieval is attracting more and more attention . how to measure and model the similarity between different music items is one of the most fundamental yet challenging research problems . in this paper , we introduce a novel framework based on a multimodal and adaptive-similarity measure for various applications . distinguished from previous approaches , our system can effectively combine music properties from different aspects into a compact signature via supervised-learning . in addition , an incremental locality-sensitive-hashing algorithm has been developed to support efficient retrieval processes with different kinds of queries . experimental-results based on two large music collections reveal various advantages of the proposed framework including effectiveness , efficiency , adaptiveness , and scalability .
