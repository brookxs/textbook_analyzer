using the-web for automated-translation extraction in cross-language-information-retrieval there have been significant advances in cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) in recent years . one of the major remaining reasons that clir does not perform as well as monolingual-retrieval is the presence of out of vocabulary (oov) terms . previous work has either relied on manual-intervention or has only been partially successful in solving this problem . we use a method that extends earlier work in this area by augmenting this with statistical-analysis , and corpus-based-translation disambiguation to dynamically discover translations of oov-terms . the method can be applied to both chinese-english and english-chinese clir , correctly extracting translations of oov-terms from the-web automatically , and thus is a significant improvement on earlier work .
