retrieving documents with mathematical content many documents with mathematical content are published on the web , but conventional search-engines that rely on keyword-search only can not fully exploit their mathematical information . in particular , keyword-search is insufficient when expressions in a document are not annotated with natural keywords or the user can not describe her query with keywords . retrieving documents by querying their mathematical content directly is very appealing in various domains such as education , digital-libraries , engineering , patent documents , medical sciences , etc. . capturing the relevance of mathematical expressions also greatly enhances document-classification in such domains . unlike text-retrieval , where keywords carry enough semantics to distinguish text-documents and rank them , math symbols do not contain much semantic-information on their own . in fact , mathematical expressions typically consist of few alphabetical symbols organized in rather complex structures . hence , the structure of an expression , which describes the way such symbols are combined , should also be considered . unfortunately , there is no standard testbed with which to evaluate the effectiveness of a mathematics-retrieval algorithm . in this paper we study the fundamental and challenging problems in mathematics-retrieval , that is how to capture the relevance of mathematical expressions , how to query them , and how to evaluate the results . we describe various search paradigms and propose retrieval-systems accordingly . we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each approach , and further compare them through an extensive empirical-study .
