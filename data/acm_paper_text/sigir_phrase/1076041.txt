better than the real thing ? : iterative pseudo-query processing using cluster-based-language-models we present a novel approach to pseudo-feedback-based ad-hoc-retrieval that uses language-models induced from both documents and clusters . first , we treat the pseudo-feedback documents produced in response to the original query as a set of pseudo-query that themselves can serve as input to the retrieval-process . observing that the documents returned in response to the pseudo-query can then act as pseudo-query for subsequent rounds , we arrive at a formulation of pseudo-query-based retrieval as an iterative-process . experiments show that several concrete instantiations of this idea , when applied in conjunction with techniques designed to heighten precision , yield performance-results rivaling those of a number of previously-proposed algorithms , including the standard language-modeling approach . the use of cluster-based-language-models is a key contributing factor to our algorithms ' success .
