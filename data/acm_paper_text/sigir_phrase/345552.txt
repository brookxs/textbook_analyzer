phonetic confusion-matrix_based spoken-document-retrieval combined word-based index and phonetic indexes have been used to improve the performance of spoken-document-retrieval systems primarily by addressing the out-of-vocabulary retrieval problem . however , a known problem with phonetic recognition is its limited accuracy in comparison with word-level recognition . we propose a novel method for phonetic retrieval in the cuevideo system based on the probabilistic-formulation of term-weighting using phone confusion data in a bayesian-framework . we evaluate this method of spoken-document-retrieval against word-based-retrieval for the search levels identified in a realistic video-based distributed-learning setting . using our test-data , we achieved an average recall of 0.88 with an average-precision of 0.69 for retrieval of out-of-vocabulary-words on phonetic transcripts with 35 \ % word-error-rate . for in-vocabulary words , we achieved a 17 \ % improvement in recall over word-based-retrieval with a 17 \ % loss in precision for word error rites ranging from 35 to 65 \ % .
