enhanced results for web-search `` ten blue links '' have defined web-search-results for the last fifteen years -- snippets of text combined with document titles and urls . in this paper , we establish the notion of enhanced-search results that extend web-search-results to include multimedia objects such as images and video , intent-specific key value pairs , and elements that allow the user to interact with the contents of a web-page directly from the search-results page . we show that users express a preference for enhanced results both explicitly , and when observed in their search-behavior . we also demonstrate the effectiveness of enhanced results in helping users to assess the relevance of search-results . lastly , we show that we can efficiently generate enhanced results to cover a significant fraction of search result pages .
