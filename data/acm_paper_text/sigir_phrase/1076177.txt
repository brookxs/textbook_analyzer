self-organizing distributed-collaborative-filtering we propose a fully decentralized collaborative-filtering-approach that is self-organizing and operates in a distributed way . the relevances between downloading files (items) are stored locally at these items in so called item-based buddy tables and are updated each time that the items are downloaded . we then propose to use the language-model to build recommendations for the different users based on the buddy tables of those items a user has downloaded previously . we have tested and compared our distributed-collaborative-filtering approach to centralized collaborative-filtering and showed that it has similar performance . it is therefore a promising technique to facilitate recommendations in peer-to-peer-networks .
