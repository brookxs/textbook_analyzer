how features resolve syntactic-ambiguity ambiguity is a pervasive and important aspect of natural-language . ambiguities , which are disambiguated by context , contribute powerfully to the expressiveness of natural-language as compared to formal-languages . in computational systems using natural-language , problems of properly controlling ambiguity are particularly large , partially because of the necessity to circumvent parsings due to multiple orderings in the application of rules.features , that is , subcategorizations of parts-of-speech , constitute an effective means for controlling syntactic-ambiguity through ordering the hierarchical organization of syntactic-constituents . this is the solution adopted for controlling ambiguity in rel english , which is part of the rel (rapidly extensible-language) system . rel is a total software-system for facilitating man/machine communications . the efficiency of processing natural-language in rel english is achieved both by the detailed syntactic aspects which are incorporated into the rel english-grammar , and by means of the particular implementation for processing features in the parsing-algorithm .
