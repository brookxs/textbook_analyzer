what makes a query difficult ? this work tries to answer the question of what makes a query difficult . it addresses a novel model that captures the main components of a topic and the relationship between those components and topic difficulty . the three components of a topic are the textual expression describing the information-need (the query or queries) , the set of documents relevant to the topic (the qrels) , and the entire collection of documents . we show experimentally that topic difficulty strongly depends on the distances between these components . in the absence of knowledge about one of the model components , the model is still useful by approximating the missing component based on the other components . we demonstrate the applicability of the difficulty model for several uses such as predicting query-difficulty , predicting the number of topic aspects expected to be covered by the search-results , and analyzing the findability of a specific domain .
