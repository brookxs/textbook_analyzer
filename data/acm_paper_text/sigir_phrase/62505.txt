integrated information retrieval for law in a hypertext environment a prototype information-retrieval-system for lawyers , justus , has been developed on a sun workstation to run in a guide hypertext environment . the hypertext database is created automatically by justus from machine readable versions of the ordinary printed texts , ideally the publisher 's typesetting tapes . the database incorporates primary legal sources , such as statutes and cases , and secondary sources , such as textbooks and a dictionary . initially , the lawyer may select any document in the system . from this initial document , he may access any other document , or part of any other document , to which reference is made . reference selection is by a pointing-device , such as a mouse . there is no limit on the number of selections that can be made , and no restrictions on the path through the system .
