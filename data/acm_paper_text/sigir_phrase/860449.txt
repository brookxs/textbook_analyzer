query-type-classification for web-document retrieval the heterogeneous web exacerbates ir problems and short user queries make them worse . the contents of web documents are not enough to find good answer documents . link-information and url-information compensates for the insufficiencies of content information . however , static combination-of-multiple-evidences may lower the retrieval-performance . we need different strategies to find target documents according to a query type . we can classify user queries as three categories , the topic-relevance task , the homepage finding task , and the service finding task . in this paper , a user-query classification-scheme is proposed . this scheme uses the difference of distribution , mutual-information , the usage rate as anchor-texts , and the pos-information for the classification . after we classified a user-query , we apply different algorithms and information for the better results . for the topic-relevance task , we emphasize the content information , on the other hand , for the homepage finding task , we emphasize the link-information and the url-information . we could get the best performance when our proposed classification-method with the okapi scoring algorithm was used .
