automatic term mismatch diagnosis for selective query-expansion people are seldom aware that their search queries frequently mismatch a majority of the relevant documents . this may not be a big problem for topics with a large and diverse set of relevant documents , but would largely increase the chance of search failure for less popular search needs . we aim to address the mismatch problem by developing accurate and simple queries that require minimal effort to construct . this is achieved by targeting retrieval interventions at the query terms that are likely to mismatch relevant documents . for a given topic , the proportion of relevant documents that do not contain a term measures the probability for the term to mismatch relevant documents , or the term-mismatch probability . recent research demonstrates that this probability can be estimated reliably prior to retrieval . typically , it is used in probabilistic-retrieval-models to provide query dependent term-weights . this paper develops a new use : automatic-diagnosis of term-mismatch . a search-engine can use the diagnosis to suggest manual query reformulation , guide interactive-query-expansion , guide automatic-query-expansion , or motivate other responses . the research described here uses the diagnosis to guide interactive-query-expansion , and create boolean conjunctive-normal-form (cnf) structured-queries that selectively expand ` problem ' query terms while leaving the rest of the query untouched . experiments with trec-ad-hoc and legal track datasets demonstrate that with high quality manual expansion , this diagnostic approach can reduce user effort by 33 % , and produce simple and effective structured-queries that surpass their bag-of-word counterparts .
