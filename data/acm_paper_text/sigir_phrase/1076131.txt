analysis of factoid questions for effective relation-extraction we present an analysis of the structured relationships observed in a randomly sampled set of question-like queries submitted to a search-engine for a popular online encyclopedic document-collection . our study shows that a relatively small number of binary relationships account for most of the queries in the sample . this empirically validates an approach of analyzing query-logs to identify the relationships most relevant to user-needs and populating corresponding fact tables from the collection for factoid-question-answering . our analysis shows that such an approach can lead to substantial coverage of user questions .
