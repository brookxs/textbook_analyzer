finding semantically similar questions based on their answers a large number of question-and-answer pairs can be collected from question-and-answer boards and faq pages on the web . this paper proposes an automatic-method of finding the questions that have the same meaning . the method can detect semantically similar questions that have little word overlap because it calculates question-question similarities by using the corresponding answers as well as the questions . we develop two different similarity-measures based on language-modeling and compare them with the traditional similarity-measures . experimental-results show that semantically similar questions pairs can be effectively found with the proposed similarity-measures .
