measuring improvement in user-search performance resulting from optimal-search tips web-search performance can be improved by either improving the search-engine itself or by educating the user to search more efficiently . there is a large amount of literature describing techniques for measuring the former ; whereas , improvements resulting from the latter are more difficult to quantify . in this paper we demonstrate an experimental-methodology that proves to successfully quantify improvements from user-education . the user-education in our study is realized in the form of tactical search feature tips that expand user-awareness of task-relevant tools and features of the search application . initially , these tips are presented in an idealized situation : each tip is shown at the same time as the study participants are given a task that is constructed to benefit from the specific tip . however , we also present a follow-up study roughly one week later in which the search tips are no longer presented but the study participants who previously were shown search tips still demonstrate improved-search efficiency compared to the control group . this research has implications for search-user-interface designers and the study-of-information retrieval-systems .
