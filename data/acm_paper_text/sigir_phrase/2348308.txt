tfmap : optimizing map for top-n context-aware-recommendation in this paper , we tackle the problem of top-n context-aware-recommendation for implicit-feedback scenarios . we frame this challenge as a ranking problem in collaborative-filtering (cf) . much of the past work on cf has not focused on evaluation-metrics that lead to good top-n-recommendation lists in designing recommendation models . in addition , previous work on context-aware-recommendation has mainly focused on explicit-feedback data , i.e. , ratings . we propose tfmap , a model that directly maximizes mean-average-precision with the aim of creating an optimally ranked list of items for individual users under a given context . tfmap uses tensor-factorization to model implicit-feedback data (e.g. , purchases , clicks) with contextual-information . the optimization of map in a large-data collection is computationally too complex to be tractable in practice . to address this computational bottleneck , we present a fast learning-algorithm that exploits several intrinsic properties of average-precision to improve the learning-efficiency of tfmap , and to ensure its scalability . we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed fast learning-algorithm , and demonstrate that tfmap significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation approaches .
