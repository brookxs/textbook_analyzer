predicting escalations of medical queries based on web-page-structure and content logs of users ' searches on web health topics can exhibit signs of escalation of medical concerns , where initial queries about common symptoms are followed by queries about serious , rare illnesses . we present an effort to predict such escalations based on the structure-and-content of pages encountered during medical-search sessions . we construct and then characterize the performance of classifiers that predict whether an escalation will occur after the access of a page . our findings have implications for ranking-algorithms and the design of search-interfaces .
