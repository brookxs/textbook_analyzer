relating retrievability , performance and length retrievability provides a different way to evaluate an information-retrieval (ir) system as it focuses on how easily documents can be found . it is intrinsically related to retrieval-performance because a document needs to be retrieved before it can be judged relevant . in this paper , we undertake an empirical-investigation into the relationship between the retrievability of documents , the retrieval bias imposed by a retrieval-system , and the retrieval-performance , across different amounts of document-length-normalization . to this end , two standard ir-models are used on three trec test-collections to show that there is a useful and practical link between retrievability and performance . our findings show that minimizing the bias across the document collection leads to good performance (though not the best performance possible) . we also show that past a certain amount of document-length-normalization the retrieval bias increases , and the retrieval-performance significantly and rapidly decreases . these findings suggest that the relationship between retrievability and effectiveness may offer a way to automatically tune systems .
