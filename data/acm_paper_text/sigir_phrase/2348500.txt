optimizing parameters of the expected reciprocal rank most popular ir-metrics are parameterized . usually parameters of these metrics are chosen on the basis of general considerations and not adjusted by experiments with real-users . particularly , the parameters of the expected reciprocal rank measure are the normalized parameters of the dcg metric , and the latter are chosen in an ad-hoc manner . we suggest an approach for adjusting parameters of the err metric that allows to reach maximum agreement with the real-users behavior . more exactly , we optimized the parameters by maximizing pearson weighted correlation between err and several online click metrics . for each click metric we managed to find the parameters of err that result into its higher correlation with the given online click metric .
