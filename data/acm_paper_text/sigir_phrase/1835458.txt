predicting searcher-frustration when search-engine users have trouble finding information , they may become frustrated , possibly resulting in a bad experience (even if they are ultimately successful) . in a user-study in which participants were given difficult information-seeking-tasks , half of all queries submitted resulted in some degree of self-reported frustration . a third of all successful tasks involved at least one instance of frustration . by modeling searcher-frustration , search-engines can predict the current-state of user-frustration and decide when to intervene with alternative search-strategies to prevent the user from becoming more frustrated , giving up , or switching to another search-engine . we present several models to predict frustration using features extracted from query-logs and physical sensors . we are able to predict frustration with a mean-average-precision of 65 \ % from the physical sensors , and 87 \ % from the query-log features .
