comparing query-logs and pseudo-relevance feedbackfor web-search query-refinement query-logs and pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) offer ways in which terms to refine web searchers ' queries can be selected , offered to searchers , and used to improve search-effectiveness . in this poster we present a study of these techniques that aims to characterize the degree of similarity between them across a set of test queries , and the same set broken out by query type . the results suggest that : (i) similarity increases with the amount of evidence provided to the prf algorithm , (ii) similarity is higherwhen titles/snippets are used for prf than full-text , and (iii) similarity is higher for navigational than informational-queries . the findings have implications for the combined usage of query-logs and prf in generating query-refinement alternatives .
