predicting query-potential-for-personalization , classification or regression ? the goal of predicting query-potential-for-personalization is to determine which queries can benefit from personalization . in this paper , we investigate which kind of strategy is better for this task : classification or regression . we quantify the potential benefits of personalizing search-results using two implicit click-based measures : click entropy and potential@n . meanwhile , queries are characterized by query-features and history features . then we build c-svm classification-model and epsilon-svm regression-model respectively according to these two measures . the experimental-results show that the classification-model is a better choice for predicting query-potential-for-personalization .
