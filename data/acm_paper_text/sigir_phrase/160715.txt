using wordnet to disambiguate word-senses for text-retrieval this paper describes an automatic-indexing procedure that uses the is-a relations contained within wordnet and the set of nouns contained in a text to select a sense for each plysemous noun in the text . the result of the indexing procedure is a vector in which some of the terms represent word-senses instead of word stems . retrieval experiments comparing the effectivenss of these sense-based vectors vs. stem-based vectors show the stem-based vectors to be superior overall , although the sense-based vectors do improve the performance of some queries . the overall degradation is due in large part to the difficulty of disambiguating senses in short query statements . an analysis of these results suggests two conclusions : the is-a links define a generalization/specialization hierarchy that is not sufficient to reliably select the correct sense of a noun from the set of fine sense-distinctions in wordnet ; and missing correct matches because of incorrect sense-resolution has a much more deleterious effect on retrieval-performance than does making spurious matches .
