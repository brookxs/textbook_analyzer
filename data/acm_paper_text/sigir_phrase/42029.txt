a vlsi chip for efficient transmission and retrieval of information in this paper , we present a functional-description of a vlsi chip aimed at reducing the cost of data-transmission and data-access within information-processing machines and distributed-information-systems . the chip maps standard character codes (e.g. , ascii) into more efficient codes (e.g. , huffman 's codes) using a tree module of basic cells . in bit-serial communication-controllers , for example , the parallel-to-serial transformation unit can be simply replaced by the proposed chip . the vlsi-design can provide speeds that far exceed current and projected peak transfer rates of high-speed disks and communication-controllers .
