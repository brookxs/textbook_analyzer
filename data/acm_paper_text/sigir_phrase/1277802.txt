structured-retrieval for question-answering bag-of-words retrieval is popular among question-answering (qa) system developers , but it does not support constraint-checking and ranking on the linguistic and semantic-information of interest to the qa-system . we present anapproach to retrieval for qa , applying structured-retrieval techniques to the types of text-annotations that qa-systems use . we demonstrate that the structured-approach can retrieve more relevant results , more highly ranked , compared with bag-of-words , on a sentence-retrieval task . we also characterize the extent to which structured-retrieval effectiveness depends on the quality of the annotations .
