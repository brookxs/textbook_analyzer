appraisal navigator much interesting text n the-web consists largely of opinionated or evaluative-text , as opposed to directly informative text . the new field of ` sentiment-analysis ' seeks to characterize such aspects of natural-language-text , as opposed to just the bare facts . we suggest that ` appraisal expression-extraction ' should be viewed as a fundamental task for sentiment-analysis . we define an ` appraisal expression ' to be a piece of text expressing some evaluative stance towards a particular object . the task is to find these elements and characterize the type and orientation (positive or negative) of the evaluative stance , as well as its target and possibly its source . potential applications of these methods include new approaches to the now-traditional tasks of sentiment-classification and pinion mining , as well as possibly for adversarial textual-analysis and intention detection for intelligence applications .
