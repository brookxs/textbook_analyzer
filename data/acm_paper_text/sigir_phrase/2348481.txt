glase 0.1 : eyes tell more than mice this paper proposes a prototype-system called gaze-learning-access-and-search-engine 0.1 (glase) , which can perform image relevance-ranking based on gaze data and within-session learning . we developed a search-user-interface that uses an eye-tracker as an input-device and employed a relevance-re-ranking algorithm based on the gaze length . the preliminary experimental-results showed that using our gaze-driven system reduced the task-completion-time an average of 13.7 % in a search-session .
