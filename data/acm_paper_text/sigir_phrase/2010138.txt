decayed divrank : capturing relevance , diversity and prestige in information-networks many network-based ranking approaches have been proposed to rank objects according to different criteria , including relevance , prestige and diversity . however , existing approaches either only aim at one or two of the criteria , or handle them with additional heuristics in multiple steps . inspired by divrank , we propose a unified ranking-model , decayed divrank (ddrank) , to meet the three criteria simultaneously . empirical experiments on paper citation-network show that ddrank can outperform existing algorithms in capturing relevance , diversity and prestige simultaneously in ranking .
