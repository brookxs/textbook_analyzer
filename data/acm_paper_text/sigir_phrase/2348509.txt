re-examining search result snippet examination time for relevance-estimation previous studies of web-search result examination have provided valuable insights in understanding and modelling searcher-behavior . yet , recent work (e.g. , [3]) has been developed based on the assumption that the time a searcher spends examining a particular result abstract or snippet , correlates with result relevance . while this idea is intuitively attractive , to the best of our knowledge it has not been empirically tested . this poster investigates this hypothesis empirically , in a controlled setting , using eye-tracking equipment to compare search result examination time with result relevance . interestingly , while we replicate previous findings showing examination time to be indicative of whole-page relevance , we find that viewing time of individual results alone is a poor indicator of either absolute result relevance or even of pairwise preferences . our results should not be taken as negating the usefulness of modeling searcher examination behavior , but rather to emphasize that snippet examination time is not in itself a good indicator of relevance .
