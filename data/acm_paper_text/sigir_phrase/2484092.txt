how do users respond to voice-input errors ? : lexical and phonetic query reformulation in voice search voice search offers users with a new search experience : instead of typing , users can vocalize their search queries . however , due to voice-input errors (such as speech-recognition-errors and improper system interruptions) , users need to frequently reformulate queries to handle the incorrectly recognized queries . we conducted user-experiments with native english speakers on their query-reformulation behaviors in voice search and found that users often reformulate queries with both lexical and phonetic changes to previous queries . in this paper , we first characterize and analyze typical voice-input errors in voice search and users ' corresponding reformulation strategies . then , we evaluate the impacts of typical voice-input errors on users ' search-progress and the effectiveness of different reformulation strategies on handling these errors . this study provides a clearer picture on how to further improve current voice search systems .
