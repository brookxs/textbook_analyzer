tirs : a topological information-retrieval-system satisfying the requirements of the waller-kraft wish list most document-retrieval systems based on probabilistic-models of feature distributions assume random-selection of documents for retrieval . the assumptions of these models are met when documents are randomly selected from the database or when retrieving all available documents . a more suitable model for retrieval of a single-document assumes that the best document available is to be retrieved first . models of document-retrieval systems assuming random-selection and best-first selection are developed and compared under binary independence and two poisson independence feature distribution models . under the best-first model , feature discrimination varies with the number of documents in each relevance class in the database . a weight similar to the inverse-document-frequency weight and consistent with the best-first model is suggested which does not depend on knowledge of the characteristics of relevant documents .
