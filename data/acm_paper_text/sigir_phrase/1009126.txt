supporting federated information sharing communities in this paper we describe the concept of federated information sharing communities (fisc) , and associated architecture , which provide a way for organisations , distributed-workgroups and individuals to build up a federated community based on their common interests over the world-wide-web . to support communities , we develop capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people , their interests and inter-relationships . we focus on providing social-awareness `` in the large '' to help users understand the members within a-community and the relationships between them . within the fisc framework , we provide viewpoint-retrieval to enable a user to construct visual contextual-views of the community from the perspective of any community member . to evaluate these ideas we develop test beds to compare individual component-technologies such as user and group profile construction and similarity-matching , and we develop prototypes to explore the broader architecture and usage issues .
