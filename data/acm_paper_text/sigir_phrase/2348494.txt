on automatically tagging web-documents from examples an emerging need in information-retrieval is to identify a set of documents conforming to an abstract description . this task presents two major challenges to existing methods of document-retrieval and classification . first , similarity based on overall content is less effective because there may be great variance in both content and subject of documents produced for similar functions , e.g. a presidential speech or a government ministry white paper . second , the function of the document can be defined based on user-interests or the specific data-set through a set of existing examples , which can not be described with standard categories . additionally , the increasing volume and complexity of document-collections demands new scalable computational solutions . we conducted a case-study using web-archived data from the latin-american government-documents archive (lagda) to illustrate these problems and challenges . we propose a new hybrid-approach based on na &#239; ve-bayes inference that uses mixed n-gram-models obtained from a training-set to classify documents in the corpus . the approach has been developed to exploit parallel-processing for large-scale-data set . the preliminary work shows promising results with improved accuracy for this type of retrieval problem .
