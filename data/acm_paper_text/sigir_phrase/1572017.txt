on rank-correlation and the distance between rankings rank-correlation statistics are useful for determining whether a there is a correspondence between two measurements , particularly when the measures themselves are of less interest than their relative ordering . kendall 's - in particular has found use in information-retrieval as a `` meta-evaluation '' measure : it has been used to compare evaluation-measures , evaluate system rankings , and evaluate predicted performance . in the meta-evaluation domain , however , correlations between systems confound relationships between measurements , practically guaranteeing a positive and significant estimate of - regardless of any actual correlation between the measurements . we introduce an alternative measure of distance between rankings that corrects this by explicitly accounting for correlations between systems over a sample of topics , and moreover has a probabilistic interpretation for use in a test of statistical-significance . we validate our measure with theory , simulated data , and experiment .
