a utility theoretic approach to determining optimal wait times in distributed-information-retrieval distributed-ir systems query a large number of ir servers , merge the retrieved results and display them to users . since different servers handle collections of different sizes , have different processing and bandwidth capacities , there can be considerable heterogeneity in their response-times . the broker in the distributed-ir system thus has to make decisions regarding terminating searches based on perceived-value of waiting -- retrieving more documents -- and the costs imposed on users by waiting for more responses . in this paper , we apply utility-theory to formulate the broker 's decision-problem . the problem is a stochastic nonlinear program . we use monte-carlo-simulations to demonstrate how the optimal-wait-time may be determined in the context of a comparison-shopping engine that queries multiple store websites for price and product information . we use data gathered from 30 stores for a set of 60 books . our research demonstrates how a broker can leverage information about past retrievals regarding distributions of server response-time and relevance-scores to optimize its performance . our main contribution is the formulation of the decision-model for optimal-wait-time and proposal of a solution method . our results suggest that the optimal-wait-time is highly sensitive to the manner in which users value from a set of retrieved results differs from the sum of user-value from each result evaluated independently . we also find that the optimal-wait-time increases with the size of the distributed-collections , but only if user utility from a set of results is nearly equal to the sum of utilities from each result .
