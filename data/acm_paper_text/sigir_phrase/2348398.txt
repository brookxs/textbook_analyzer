using preference-judgments for novel document-retrieval there has been considerable interest in incorporating diversity in search-results to account for redundancy and the space of possible user-needs . most work on this problem is based on subtopics : diversity rankers score documents against a set of hypothesized subtopics , and diversity rankings are evaluated by assigning a value to each ranked document based on the number of novel (and redundant) subtopics it is relevant to . this can be seen as modeling a user who is always interested in seeing more novel subtopics , with progressively decreasing interest in seeing the same subtopic multiple times . we put this model to test : if it is correct , then users , when given a choice , should prefer to see a document that has more value to the evaluation . we formulate some specific hypotheses from this model and test them with actual users in a novel preference-based design in which users express a preference for document a or document b given document c . we argue that while the user-study shows the subtopic model is good , there are many other factors apart from novelty and redundancy that may be influencing user-preferences . from this , we introduce a new framework to construct an ideal diversity ranking using only preference-judgments , with no explicit subtopic judgments whatsoever .
