scalable hierarchical-topic-detection : exploring a sample_based approach hierarchical-topic-detection is a new task in the tdt 2004 evaluation program , which aims to organize an unstructured news collection in a directed-acyclic-graph (dag) structure , reflecting the topics discussed . we present a scalable-architecture for htd and compare several alternative choices for agglomerative-clustering and dag optimization in order to minimize the htd cost metric .
