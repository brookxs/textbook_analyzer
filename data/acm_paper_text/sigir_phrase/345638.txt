influence of speech-recognition-errors on topic-detection (poster session) we investigate the effect of speech-recognition errors on a system for the unsupervised , nearly synchronous clustering of broadcast-news stories , using the tdt (topic-detection-and-tracking) corpora . two questions are addressed : (1) are speech-recognition-errors detrimental to the performance of the system ? (2) can a background collection of contemporaneous clean text improve performance ? we investigate both the large-cluster and small-cluster limits .
