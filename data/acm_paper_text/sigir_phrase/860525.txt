xml-retrieval : what to retrieve ? the fundamental difference between standard information-retrieval and xml-retrieval is the unit of retrieval . in traditional ir , the unit of retrieval is fixed : it is the complete document . in xml-retrieval , every xml element in a document is a retrievable unit . this makes xml-retrieval more difficult : besides being relevant , a retrieved unit should be neither too large nor too small . the research presented here , a comparative-analysis of two approaches to xml-retrieval , aims to shed light on which xml elements should be retrieved . the experimental-evaluation uses data from the initiative for the evaluation of xml-retrieval (inex 2002) .
