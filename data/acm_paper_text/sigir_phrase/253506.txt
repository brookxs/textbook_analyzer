generalized vector-spaces model in information-retrieval in information-retrieval , it is common to model index-terms and documents as vectors in a suitably defined vector-space . the main difficulty with this approach is that the explicit representation of term vectors is not known a priori . for this reason , the vector-space-model adopted by salton for the smart system treats the terms as a set of orthogonal vectors . in such a model it is often necessary to adopt a separate , corrective procedure to take into account the correlations between terms . in this paper , we propose a systematic method (the generalized vector-space-model) to compute term correlations directly from automatic-indexing scheme . we also demonstrate how such correlations can be included with minimal modification in the existing vector_based information-retrieval-systems . the preliminary experimental-results obtained from the new model are very encouraging .
