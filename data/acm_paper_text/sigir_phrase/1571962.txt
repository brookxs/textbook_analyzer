approximating true-relevance-distribution from a mixture-model based on irrelevance data pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) , which has been widely applied in ir , aims to derive a distribution from the top n pseudo relevant documents d . however , these documents are often a mixture of relevant and irrelevant documents . as a result , the derived distribution is actually a mixture-model , which has long been limiting the performance of prf . this is particularly the case when we deal with difficult-queries where the truly relevant documents in d are very sparse . in this situation , it is often easier to identify a small number of seed irrelevant documents , which can form a seed irrelevant distribution . then , a fundamental and challenging problem arises : solely based on the mixed distribution and a seed irrelevance distribution , how to automatically generate an optimal approximation of the true-relevance-distribution ? in this paper , we propose a novel distribution-separation-model (dsm) to tackle this problem . theoretical justifications of the proposed algorithm are given . evaluation results from our extensive simulated experiments on several large-scale trec-data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method , which outperforms a well respected prf model , the relevance-model (rm) , as well as the use of rm on d with the seed negative documents directly removed .
