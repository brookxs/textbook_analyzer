selecting hierarchical-clustering cut points for web person-name-disambiguation hierarchical-clustering is often used to cluster person-names referring to the same entities . since the correct number-of-clusters for a given person-name is not known a priori , some way of deciding where to cut the resulting dendrogram to balance risks of over - or under-clustering is needed . this paper reports on experiments in which outcome-specific and result-set measures are used to learn a global similarity-threshold . results on the web-people-search (weps) -2 task indicate that approximately 85 \ % of the optimal f1 measure can be achieved on held-out data .
