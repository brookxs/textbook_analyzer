the effects of choice in routing relevance-judgments the emergence of human-computation systems , including mechanical-turk and games-with-a-purpose , has made it feasible to distribute relevance-judgment tasks to workers over the-web . most human-computation systems assign tasks to individuals randomly , and such assignments may match workers with tasks that they may be unqualified or unmotivated to perform . we compare two groups of workers , those given a choice of queries to judge versus those who are not , in terms of their self-rated competence and their actual performance . results show that when given a choice of task , workers choose ones for which they have greater expertise , interests , confidence , and understanding .
