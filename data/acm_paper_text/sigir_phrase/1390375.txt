a bayesian-logistic-regression model for active relevance-feedback relevance-feedback , which traditionally uses the terms in the relevant documents to enrich the user 's initial query , is an effective method for improving retrieval-performance . the traditional relevance-feedback algorithms lead to overfitting because of the limited amount of training-data and large term space . this paper introduces an online bayesian-logistic-regression algorithm to incorporate relevance-feedback information . the new approach addresses the overfitting problem by projecting the original feature-space onto a more compact set which retains the necessary information . the new set-of-features consist of the original retrieval-score , the distance to the relevant documents and the distance to non-relevant documents . to reduce the human-evaluation effort in ascertaining relevance , we introduce a new active-learning-algorithm based on variance-reduction to actively select documents for user-evaluation . the new active-learning-algorithm aims to select feedback documents to reduce the model variance . the variance-reduction approach leads to capturing relevance , diversity and uncertainty of the unlabeled documents in a principled manner . these are the critical-factors of active-learning indicated in previous literature . experiments with several trec datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach .
