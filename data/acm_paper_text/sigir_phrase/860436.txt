keynote address - exploring , modeling , and using the-web graph the-web graph , meaning the graph induced by web-pages as nodes and their hyperlinks as directed-edges , has become a fascinating object of study for many people : physicists , sociologists , mathematicians , computer scientists , and information retrieval specialists.recent results range from theoretical (e.g. : models for the graph , semi-external algorithms) , to experimental (e.g. : new insights regarding the rate-of-change of pages , new data on the distribution of degrees) , to practical (e.g. : improvements in crawling technology) . recent results range from theoretical (e.g. : models for the graph , semi-external algorithms) , to experimental (e.g. : new insights regarding the rate-of-change of pages , new data on the distribution of degrees) , to practical (e.g. : improvements in crawling technology) . the goal of this talk is to convey an introduction to the-state-of-the-art in this area and to sketch the current issues in collecting , representing , analyzing , and modeling this graph . although graph analytic methods are essential tools in the web-ir arsenal , they are well known to the sigir community and will not be discussed here in any detail ; instead , we will explore some challenges and opportunities for using ir methods-and-techniques in the exploration of the-web graph , in particular in dealing with legitimate and `` spam '' perturbations of the `` natural '' process of birth and death of nodes and links , and conversely , the challenges and opportunities of using graph methods in support of ir on the web and in the enterprise .
