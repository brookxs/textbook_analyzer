simple word-strings as compound keywords : an indexing and ranking-method for japanese texts this paper describes a new indexing-method for japanese-text databases using the simple keyword string , in which a compound word is treated as a string of simple words , which are the smallest units in japanese grammar which still maintain their meanings . this method allows retrieved texts to be ranked , according to the similarity of their meaning to the query , without using a control vocabulary or thesaurus . this paper also introduces the keyword feature , which describes the syntactic and semantic characteristics of a word , and results in more precise keyword-extraction and text-retrieval as well as simple dictionary-maintenance .
