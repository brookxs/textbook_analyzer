a search-engine in a few lines. : yes , we can ! many research implementations of search-engines are written in c , c++ , or java . they are difficult to understand and modify because they are at least a few thousand lines of code and contain many low-level details . in this paper , we show how to achieve a much shorter and higher level implementation : one in about a few hundred lines . we accomplish this result through the use of a high-level functional-programming-language , f# , and some of its features such as sequences , pipes and structured input-and-output . by using a search-engine implementation as a case-study , we argue that functional-programming fits the domain of information-retrieval problems much better than imperative/oo languages like c++ and java . functional-programming-languages are ideal for rapid algorithm prototyping and data-exploration in the field of information-retrieval (ir) . additionally , our implementation can be used as case-study in an ir course since it is a very high level , but nevertheless executable-specification of a search-engine .
