ranking document clusters using markov-random-fields an important challenge in cluster-based document-retrieval is ranking document clusters by their relevance to the query . we present a novel cluster ranking approach that utilizes markov-random-fields (mrfs) . mrfs enable the integration of various types of cluster-relevance evidence ; e.g. , the query-similarity values of the cluster 's documents and query-independent measures of the cluster . we use our method to re-rank an initially retrieved document list by ranking clusters that are created from the documents most highly ranked in the list . the resultant retrieval-effectiveness is substantially better than that of the initial list for several lists that are produced by effective retrieval-methods . furthermore , our cluster ranking approach significantly outperforms state-of - the-art cluster ranking methods . we also show that our method can be used to improve the performance of (state-of - the-art) results-diversification methods .
