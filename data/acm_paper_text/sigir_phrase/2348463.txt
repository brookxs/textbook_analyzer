detecting candidate named-entities in search queries the information-extraction-task of named-entities-recognition (ner) has been recently applied to search-engine-queries , in order to better understand their semantics . here we concentrate on the task prior to the classification of the named-entities (nes) into a set of categories , which is the problem of detecting candidate nes via the subtask of query segmentation.we present a novel method for detecting candidate nes using grammar annotation and query-segmentation with the aid of top-n snippets from search-engine-results and a web-n-gram model , to accurately identify ne boundaries . the proposed method addresses the problem of accurately setting boundaries of nes and the detection of multiple nes in queries .
