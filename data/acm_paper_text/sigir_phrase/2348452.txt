exploiting paths for entity-search in rdf-graphs the field of entity-search using semantic-web (rdf) data has gained more interest recently . in this paper , we propose a probabilistic entity-retrieval model for rdf-graphs using paths in the graph . unlike previous work which assumes that all descriptions of an entity are directly linked to the entity node , we assume that an entity can be described with any node that can be reached from the entity node by following paths in the rdf graph . our retrieval-model simulates the generation-process of query terms from an entity node by traversing the graph . we evaluate our approach using a standard evaluation-framework for entity-search .
