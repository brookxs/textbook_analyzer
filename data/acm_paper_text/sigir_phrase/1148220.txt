dynamic test collections : measuring search-effectiveness on the live web existing methods for measuring the quality of search-algorithms use a static collection of documents . a set of queries and a mapping from the queries to the relevant documents allow the experimenter to see how well different search-engines or engine configurations retrieve the correct answers . this methodology assumes that the document set and thus the set of relevant documents are unchanging . in this paper , we abandon the static collection requirement . we begin with a recent trec collection created from a web-crawl and analyze how the documents in that collection have changed over time . we determine how decay of the document collection affects trec systems , and present the results of an experiment using the decayed collection to measure a live web-search system . we employ novel measures of search-effectiveness that are robust despite incomplete relevance information . lastly , we propose a methodology of `` collection maintenance '' which supports measuring search-performance both for a single system and between systems run at different points in time .
