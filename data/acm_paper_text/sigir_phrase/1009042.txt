focused named-entity-recognition using machine-learning in this paper we study the problem of finding most topical named-entities among all entities in a document , which we refer to as focused named-entity-recognition . we show that these focused named-entities are useful for many natural-language-processing-applications , such as document-summarization , search-result-ranking , and entity-detection-and-tracking . we propose a statistical model for focused named-entity-recognition by converting it into a classification-problem . we then study the impact of various linguistic-features and compare a number of classification algorithms . from experiments on an annotated chinese news corpus , we demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve near human-level accuracy .
