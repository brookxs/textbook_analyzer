ep-x : a demonstration of semantically based search of bibliographic-databases ep-x (environmental-pollution expert) is a prototype knowledge-based-system that assists users in conducting bibliographic searches of the environmental-pollution literature . this system combines artificial-intelligence and human-factors engineering techniques , allowing us to redesign traditional bibliographic-information-retrieval interfaces . the result supports semantically-based search as opposed to the typical character-string matching approach . this paper discusses a sample interaction with ep-x , the knowledge representations necessary to support this semantically-based interaction , preliminary results of empirical-studies to evaluate the interface , and recommendations for future-directions
