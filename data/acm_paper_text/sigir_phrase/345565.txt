ocelot : a system for summarizing web-pages we introduce ocelot , a prototype-system for automatically generating the gist of a web-page by summarizing it . although most text-summarization research to date has focused on the task of news-articles , web-pages are quite different in both structure-and-content . instead of coherent text with a well-defined discourse-structure , they are more often likely to be a chaotic jumble of phrases , links , graphics and formatting commands . such text provides little foothold for extractive-summarization techniques , which attempt to generate a summary of a document by excerpting a contiguous , coherent span of text from it . this paper builds upon recent work in non-extractive-summarization , producing the gist of a web-page by translating it into a more concise representation rather than attempting to extract a text span verbatim . ocelot uses probabilistic-models to guide it in selecting and ordering words into a gist . this paper describes a technique for learning these models automatically from a collection of human-summarized web-pages .
