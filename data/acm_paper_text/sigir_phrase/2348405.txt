improving retrieval of short-texts through document-expansion collections containing a large number of short documents are becoming increasingly common . as these collections grow in number and size , providing effective retrieval of brief texts presents a significant research problem . we propose a novel approach to improving information-retrieval (ir) for short-texts based on aggressive document-expansion . starting from the hypothesis that short documents tend to be about a single topic , we submit documents as pseudo-queries and analyze the results to learn about the documents themselves . document-expansion helps in this context because short documents yield little in the way of term-frequency information . however , as we show , the proposed technique helps us model not only lexical properties , but also temporal-properties of documents . we present experimental-results using a corpus of microblog (twitter) data and a corpus of metadata records from a federated digital library . with respect to established baselines , results of these experiments show that applying our proposed document-expansion method yields significant improvements in effectiveness . specifically , our method improves the lexical-representation of documents and the ability to let time influence retrieval .
