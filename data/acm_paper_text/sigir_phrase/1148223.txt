structure-driven crawler generation by example many web-ir and digital-library-applications require a crawling process to collect pages with the ultimate goal of taking advantage of useful information available on web-sites . for some of these applications the criteria to determine when a page is to be present in a collection are related to the page content . however , there are situations in which the inner-structure of the pages provides a better criteria to guide the crawling process than their content . in this paper , we present a structure-driven approach for generating web-crawlers that requires a minimum effort from users . the idea is to take as input a sample page and an entry point to a web-site and generate a structure-driven crawler based on navigation-patterns , sequences of patterns for the links a crawler has to follow to reach the pages structurally similar to the sample page . in the experiments we have carried out , structure-driven crawlers generated by our new approach were able to collect all pages that match the samples given , including those pages added after their generation .
