optimizing multimodal reranking for web-image-search in this poster , we introduce a web-image-search reranking approach with exploring multiple-modalities . diff erent from the conventional methods that build graph with one feature-set for reranking , our approach integrates multiple-feature sets that describe visual-content from different aspects . we simultaneously integrate the learning of relevance-scores , the weighting of different feature-sets , the distance-metric and the scaling for each feature-set into a unified scheme . experimental-results on a large-data-set that contains more than 1,100 queries and 1 million images demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .
