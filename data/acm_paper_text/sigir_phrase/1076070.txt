web-page summarization using clickthrough-data most previous web-page summarization methods treat a web-page as plain-text . however , such methods fail to uncover the full knowledge associated with a web-page needed in building a high-quality summary , because many of these methods do not consider the hidden relationships in the web . uncovering the hidden knowledge is important in building good web-page summarizers . in this paper , we extract the extra knowledge from the clickthrough-data of a web-search-engine to improve web-page summarization . wefirst analyze the feasibility in utilizing the clickthrough-data to enhance web-page summarization and then propose two adapted summarization methods that take advantage of the relationships discovered from the clickthrough-data . for those pages that are not covered by the clickthrough-data , we design a thematic-lexicon approach to generate implicit-knowledge for them . our methods are evaluated on a dataset consisting of manually annotated pages as well as a large dataset that is crawled from the open-directory-project website . the experimental-results indicate that significant improvements can be achieved through our proposed summarizer as compared to the summarizers that do not use the clickthrough-data .
