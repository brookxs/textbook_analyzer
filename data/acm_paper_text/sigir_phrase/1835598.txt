semi-supervised spam-filtering using aggressive consistency-learning a graph-based semi-supervised method for email-spam-filtering , based on the local and global consistency method , yields low error-rates with very few labeled examples . the motivating application of this method is spam-filters with access to very few labeled message . for example , during the initial deployment of a spam-filter , only a handful of labeled examples are available but unlabeled-examples are plentiful . we demonstrate the performance of our approach on trec 2007 and ceas 2008 email corpora . our results compare favorably with the best-known methods , using as few as just two labeled examples : one spam and one non-spam .
