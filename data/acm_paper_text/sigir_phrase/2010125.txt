disambiguating biomedical acronyms using emim expanding a query with acronyms or their corresponding ` long-forms ' has not been shown to provide consistent improvements in the biomedical-ir literature . the major open issue with expanding acronyms in a query is their inherent ambiguity , as an acronym can refer to multiple long-forms . at the same time , a long-form identified in a query can be expanded with its acronym (s) ; however , some of these may be also ambiguous and lead to poor retrieval-performance . in this work , we propose the use of the emim (expected mutual-information measure) between a long-form and its abbreviated acronym to measure ambiguity . we experiment with expanding both acronyms and long-forms identified in the queries from the adhoc task of the trec 2004 genomics track . our preliminary analysis shows the potential of both acronym and long-form expansions for biomedical-ir .
