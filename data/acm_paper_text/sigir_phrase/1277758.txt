an interactive algorithm for asking and incorporating feature feedback into support-vector-machines standard machine-learning-techniques typically require ample training-data in the form of labeled-instances . in many situations it may be too tedious or costly to obtain sufficient labeled-data for adequate classifier-performance . however , in text-classification , humans can easily guess the relevance of features , that is , words that are indicative of a topic , thereby enabling the classifier to focus its feature-weights more appropriately in the absence of sufficient labeled-data . we will describe an algorithm for tandem learning that begins with a couple of labeled-instances , and then at each iteration recommends features and instances for a human to label . tandem learning using an `` oracle '' results in much better performance than learning on only features or only instances . we find that humans can emulate the oracle to an extent that results in performance (accuracy) comparable to that of the oracle . our unique experimental-design helps factor out system error from human-error , leading to a better understanding of when and why interactive-feature-selection works .
