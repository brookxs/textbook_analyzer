ester : efficient search on text , entities , and relations we present ester , a modular and highly efficient system for combined full-text and ontology search . ester builds on a query-engine that supports two basic operations : prefix search and join . both of these can be implemented very efficiently with a compact index , yet in combination provide powerful querying capabilities . we show how ester can answer basic sparql graph-pattern queries on the ontology by reducing them to a small number of these two basic operations . ester further supports a natural blend of such semantic-queries with ordinary full-text queries . moreover , the prefix search operation allows for a fully interactive and proactive user interface , which after every keystroke suggests to the user possible semantic interpretations of his or her query , and speculatively executes the most likely of these interpretations . as a proof-of-concept , we applied ester to the english wikipedia , which contains about 3 million documents , combined with the recent yago ontology , which contains about 2.5 million facts . for a variety of complex-queries , ester achieves worst-case query-processing times of a fraction of a second , on a single-machine , with an index-size of about 4 gb .
