modeling-and-analysis of cross-session-search-tasks the information-needs of search-engine users vary in complexity , depending on the task they are trying to accomplish . some simple needs can be satisfied with a single query , whereas others require a series of queries issued over a longer period of time . while search-engines effectively satisfy many simple needs , searchers receive little support when their information-needs span session-boundaries . in this work , we propose methods for modeling and analyzing user-search-behavior that extends over multiple search-sessions . we focus on two problems : (i) given a user-query , identify all of the related queries from previous sessions that the same user has issued , and (ii) given a multi-query task for a user , predict whether the user will return to this task in the future . we model both problems within a classification framework that uses features of individual queries and long-term user-search-behavior at different granularity . experimental-evaluation of the proposed models for both tasks indicates that it is possible to effectively model and analyze cross-session search behavior . our findings have implications for improving search for complex-information-needs and designing search-engine features to support cross-session-search-tasks .
