feature-selection for ranking ranking is a very important topic in information-retrieval . while algorithms for learning ranking-models have been intensively studied , this is not the case for feature-selection , despite of its importance . the reality is that many feature-selection methods used in classification are directly applied to ranking . we argue that because of the striking differences between ranking and classification , it is better to develop different feature-selection methods for ranking . to this end , we propose a new feature-selection-method in this paper . specifically , for each feature we use its value to rank the training instances , and define the ranking accuracy in terms of a performance-measure or a loss-function as the importance of the feature . we also define the correlation between the ranking results of two features as the similarity between them . based on the definitions , we formulate the feature-selection issue as an optimization-problem , for which it is to find the features with maximum total importance scores and minimum total similarity-scores . we also demonstrate how to solve the optimization-problem in an efficient way . we have tested the effectiveness of our feature-selection-method on two information-retrieval datasets and with two ranking-models . experimental-results show that our method can outperform traditional feature-selection methods for the ranking task .
