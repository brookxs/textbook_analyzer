closed-form-solution of similarity algorithms algorithms defining similarities between objects of an information-network are important of many ir tasks . simrank algorithm and its variations are popularly used in many applications . many fast-algorithms are also developed . in this note , we first reformulate them as random-walks on the network and express them using forward and backward transition probably in a matrix form . second , we show that p-rank (simrank is only the special case of p-rank) has a unique-solution of eet when decay factor c is equal to 1 . we also show that simfusion algorithm is a special case of p-rank algorithm and prove that the similarity-matrix of simfusion is the product of pagerank vector . our experiments on the-web datasets show that for p-rank the decay factor c does n't seriously affect the similarity accuracy and accuracy of p-rank is also higher than simfusion and simrank .
