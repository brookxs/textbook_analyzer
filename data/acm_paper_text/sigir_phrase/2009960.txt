clr : a collaborative location-recommendation framework based on co-clustering gps-data tracked on mobile-devices contains rich information about human activities and preferences . in this paper , gps-data is used in location-based-services (lbss) to provide collaborative location recommendations . we observe that most existing lbss provide location recommendations by clustering the user-location matrix . since the user-location matrix created based on gps-data is huge , there are two major problems with these methods . first , the number of similar locations that need to be considered in computing the recommendations can be numerous . as a result , the identification of truly relevant locations from numerous candidates is challenging . second , the clustering process on large matrix is time consuming . thus , when new gps-data arrives , complete re-clustering of the whole matrix is infeasible . to tackle these two problems , we propose the collaborative location-recommendation (clr) framework for location-recommendation . by considering activities (i.e. , temporal preferences) and different user classes (i.e. , pattern users , normal users , and travelers) in the recommendation process , clr is capable of generating more precise and refined recommendations to the users compared to the existing methods . moreover , clr employs a dynamic-clustering algorithm cadc to cluster the trajectory-data into groups of similar users , similar activities and similar locations efficiently by supporting incremental-update of the groups when new gps-trajectory data arrives . we evaluate clr with a real-world gps dataset , and confirm that the clr framework provides more accurate location recommendations compared to the existing methods .
