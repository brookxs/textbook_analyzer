the automatic-extraction of words from texts especially for input into information-retrieval-systems based on inverted-files the automatic-extraction of words from texts to form the input for information-retrieval-systems based on inverted-files is partly considered on a theoretical basis , and partly in relation to experience gained from developing what has become an operational system . this system was developed to operate on abstracted texts , but is being modified to handle more extended texts either for input into an inverted-file or as a stage in creating pre-coordinate indexes . the system is capable of handling compound-words , homographs , and synonyms and identifying particular forms of text (such as authors) on the basis of what are termed semantic markers .
