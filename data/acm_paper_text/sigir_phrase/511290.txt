the converse natural-language data-management-system : current-status and plans this paper presents an overview of research in progress in which the principal aim is the achievement of more natural and expressive modes of on-line-communication with complexly structured-data bases . a natural-language compiler has been constructed that accepts sentences in a user-extendable english subset , produces surface and deep-structure syntactic analyses , and uses a network of concepts to construct semantic interpretations formalized as computable procedures . the procedures are evaluated by a data-management-system that updates , modifies , and searches data-bases that can be formalized as finite-models of states of affairs . the system has been designed and programmed to handle large vocabularies and large-collections of facts efficiently . plans for extending the research vehicle to interface with a deductive-inference component and a voice input-output effort are briefly described .
