learning-to-rank audience for behavioral-targeting behavioral-targeting (bt) is a recent trend of online-advertising market . however , some classical bt solutions , which predefine the user segments for bt ads delivery , are sometimes too large to numerous long-tail advertisers , who can not afford to buy any large user segments due to budget consideration . in this extend abstract , we propose to rank users according to their probability of interest in an advertisement in a learning-to-rank framework . we propose to extract three types of features between user-behaviors such as search queries , ad click history etc and the ad content provided by advertisers . through this way , a long-tail advertiser can select a certain number of top ranked users as needed from the user segments for ads delivery . in the experiments , we use a 30-days ' ad click-through log from a commercial-search-engine . the results show that using our proposed features under a learning-to-rank framework , we can well rank users who potentially interest in an advertisement .
