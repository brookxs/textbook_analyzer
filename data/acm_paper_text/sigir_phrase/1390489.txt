web-page-retrieval in ubiquitous sensor environments this paper proposes new concept of query free web-search for daily-living . we ordinarily benefit from additional-information about our daily activities that we are currently engaged in . when washing a coffee maker , for example , we receive the benefit if we obtain such information as ` cleaning a coffee maker with vinegar removes its stain well . ' our proposed method automatically searches for a web-page including such information relates to an activity-of-daily-living when the activity is performed . we assume that wireless-sensor-nodes are attached to daily objects to detect object use ; our method makes a query from the names of objects which are used . then , the method retrieves a web-page relates to the activity-of-daily-living by using the query .
