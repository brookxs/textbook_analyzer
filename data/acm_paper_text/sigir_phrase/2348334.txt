simfusion + : extending simfusion towards efficient estimation on large and dynamic-networks simfusion has become a captivating measure of similarity between objects in a web-graph . it is iteratively distilled from the notion that `` the similarity between two objects is reinforced by the similarity of their related objects '' . the existing simfusion model usually exploits the unified relationship matrix (urm) to represent latent relationships among heterogeneous-data , and adopts an iterative paradigm for simfusion computation . however , due to the row normalization of urm , the traditional simfusion model may produce the trivial solution ; worse still , the iterative-computation of simfusion may not ensure the global-convergence of the solution . this paper studies the revision of this model , providing a full treatment from complexity to algorithms . (1) we propose simfusion + based on a notion of the unified adjacency-matrix (uam) , a modification of the urm , to prevent the trivial solution and the divergence issue of simfusion . (2) we show that for any vertex-pair , simfusion + can be performed in o (1) time and o (n) space with an o (km) - time precomputation done only once , as opposed to the o (kn3) time and o (n2) space of its traditional counterpart , where n , m , and k denote the number of vertices , edges , and iterations respectively . (3) we also devise an incremental-algorithm for further improving the computation of simfusion + when networks are dynamically updated , with performance-guarantees for similarity-estimation . we experimentally verify that these algorithms scale well , and the revised notion of simfusion is able to converge to a non-trivial solution , and allows us to identify more sensible structure-information in large real-world networks .
