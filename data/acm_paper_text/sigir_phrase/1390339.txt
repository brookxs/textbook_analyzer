effective and efficient user-interaction for long-queries handling long-queries can involve either pruning the query to retain only the important terms (reduction) , or expanding the query to include related concepts (expansion) . while automatic techniques to do so exist , roughly 25 \ % performance-improvements in terms of map have been realized in past work through interactive variants . we show that selectively reducing or expanding a query leads to an average improvement of 51 \ % in map over the baseline for standard trec test-collections . we demonstrate how user-interaction can be used to achieve this improvement . most interaction-techniques present users with a fixed number of options for all queries . we achieve improvements by interacting less with the user , i.e. , we present techniques to identify the optimal number of options to present to users , resulting in an-interface with an average of 70 \ % fewer options to consider . previous algorithms supporting interactive reduction and expansion are exponential in nature . to extend their utility to operational environments , we present techniques to make the complexity of the algorithms polynomial . we finally present an analysis of long-queries that continue to exhibit poor performance in spite of our new techniques .
