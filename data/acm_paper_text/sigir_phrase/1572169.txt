exploiting temporal-information in retrieval of archived documents in a text-retrieval community , many researchers have shown a good quality of searching a current snapshot of the-web . however , only a small number have demonstrated a good quality of searching a long-term archival domain , where documents are preserved for a long time , i.e. , ten years or more . in such a domain , a search application is not only applicable for archivists or historians , but also in a context of national library and enterprise-search (searching document-repositories , emails , etc.) . in the rest of this paper , we will explain three problems of searching document-archives and propose possible approaches to solve these problems . our main research question is : how to improve the quality of search in a document archive using temporal-information ?
