topic-distillation using hierarchy-concept-tree in this paper , we propose a new approach for topic-distillation on world-wide-web . topic-distillation is to find quality documents related to the user-query topic . our approach is based on bharat 's topic-distillation algorithm [1] . we present the analysis of hyperlink graph-structure using hierarchy-concept-tree to solve the mixed hubs problem that is also remained in the bharat 's algorithm . for assigning better weights to hyperlinks which point to relevant documents among hyperlinks in a document , we try to find the relationship in documents connected by hyperlinks using content-analysis and we assign weights to hyperlinks based on the relationship . we evaluated this algorithm using 50 topics on wt10g corpus and obtained improved results .
