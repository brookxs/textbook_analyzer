efficient variants of huffman-codes in high-level-languages although it is well-known that huffman-codes are optimal for text-compression in a character-per-character encoding-scheme , they are seldom used in practical situations since they require a bit-per-bit decoding-algorithm , which has to be written in some assembly-language , and will perform rather slowly . a number-of-methods are presented that avoid these difficulties . the decoding-algorithms efficiently process the encoded string on a byte-per-byte basis , are faster than the original algorithm , and can be programmed in any high-level-language . this is achieved at the cost of storing some tables in the internal memory , but with no loss in the compression savings of the optimal huffman-codes . the internal memory-space needed can be reduced either at the cost of increased processing-time , or by using non-binary huffman-codes , which give sub-optimal compression . experimental-results for english and hebrew-text are also presented .
