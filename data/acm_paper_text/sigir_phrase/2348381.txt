adaptive context features for toponym-resolution in streaming-news news sources around the world generate constant streams of information , but effective streaming-news retrieval requires an intimate understanding of the geographic content of news . this process of understanding , known as geotagging , consists of first finding words in article text that correspond to location-names (toponyms) , and second , assigning each toponym its correct lat/long values . the latter step , called toponym-resolution , can also be considered a classification-problem , where each of the possible interpretations for each toponym is classified as correct or incorrect . hence , techniques from supervised-machine-learning can be applied to improve accuracy . new classification features to improve toponym-resolution , termed adaptive context features , are introduced that consider a window of context around each toponym , and use geographic attributes of toponyms in the window to aid in their correct resolution . adaptive parameters controlling the window 's breadth and depth afford flexibility in managing a tradeoff between feature computation speed and resolution accuracy , allowing the features to potentially apply to a variety of textual domains . extensive experiments with three large-datasets of streaming-news demonstrate the new features ' effectiveness over two widely-used competing methods .
