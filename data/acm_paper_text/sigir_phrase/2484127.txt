bias-variance decomposition of ir-evaluation it has been recognized that , when an information-retrieval (ir) system achieves improvement in mean retrieval-effectiveness (e.g. mean-average-precision (map)) over all the queries , the performance (e.g. , average-precision (ap)) of some individual queries could be hurt , resulting in retrieval instability . some stability/robustness metrics have been proposed . however , they are often defined separately from the mean effectiveness metric . consequently , there is a lack of a unified formulation of effectiveness , stability and overall retrieval quality (considering both) . in this paper , we present a unified formulation based on the bias-variance decomposition . correspondingly , a novel evaluation-methodology is developed to evaluate the effectiveness and stability in an integrated manner . a case-study applying the proposed methodology to evaluation of query-language modeling illustrates the usefulness and analytical power of our approach .
