efficient and self-tuning incremental query-expansion for top-k-query-processing we present a novel approach for efficient and self-tuning query-expansion that is embedded into a top-k-query processor with candidate-pruning . traditional query-expansion methods select expansion terms whose thematic similarity to the original query terms is above some specified threshold , thus generating a disjunctive query with much higher dimensionality . this poses three major problems : 1) the need for hand-tuning the expansion threshold , 2) the potential topic dilution with overly aggressive expansion , and 3) the drastically increased execution cost of a high-dimensional query . the method developed in this paper addresses all three problems by dynamically and incrementally merging the inverted-lists for the potential expansion terms with the lists for the original query terms . a priority-queue is used for maintaining result candidates , the pruning of candidates is based on fagin 's family of top-k-algorithms , and optionally probabilistic estimators of candidate scores can be used for additional pruning . experiments on the trec collections for the 2004 robust and terabyte tracks demonstrate the increased efficiency , effectiveness , and scalability of our approach .
