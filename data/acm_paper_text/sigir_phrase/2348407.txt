rhetorical-relations for information-retrieval typically , every part in most coherent text has some plausible reason for its presence , some function that it performs to the overall semantics of the text . rhetorical-relations , e.g. contrast , cause , explanation , describe how the parts of a text are linked to each other . knowledge about this so-called discourse-structure has been applied successfully to several natural-language-processing-tasks . this work studies the use of rhetorical-relations for information-retrieval (ir) : is there a correlation between certain rhetorical-relations and retrieval-performance ? can knowledge about a document 's rhetorical-relations be useful to ir ? we present a language-model-modification that considers rhetorical-relations when estimating the relevance of a document to a query . empirical-evaluation of different versions of our model on trec settings shows that certain rhetorical-relations can benefit retrieval-effectiveness notably (> 10 % in mean-average-precision over a state-of-the-art baseline) .
