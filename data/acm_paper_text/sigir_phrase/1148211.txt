answering complex questions with random-walk models we present a novel framework for answering complex questions that relies on question-decomposition . complex questions are decomposed by a procedure that operates on a markov-chain , by following a random-walk on a bipartite-graph of relations established between concepts related to the topic of a complex question and subquestions derived from topic-relevant passages that manifest these relations . decomposed questions discovered during this random-walk are then submitted to a state-of-the-art question-answering (q/a) system in order to retrieve a set of passages that can later be merged into a comprehensive answer by a multi-document-summarization (mds) system . in our evaluations , we show that access to the decompositions generated using this method can significantly enhance the relevance and comprehensiveness of summary-length answers to complex questions .
