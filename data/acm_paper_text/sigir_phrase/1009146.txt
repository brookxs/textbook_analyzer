supporting federated information sharing communities (abstract only) increasingly , the world-wide-web is being viewed as a means of creating web-communities rather than simply as a means of publishing and delivering documents and services . in this research we develop the concept of federated information sharing communities (fisc) , and associated architecture , that enables community-centred information-systems to be constructed . such systems provide a way for organisations , distributed-workgroups and individuals to build up a federated community based on their common interests over the world-wide-web . to support communities , we develop capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people , their interests and inter-relationships . we focus on providing social-awareness `` in the large '' to help users understand the members within a-community and the relationships between them : who is working on what topic , and who is working with whom . within the fisc framework , we provide a viewpoint-retrieval service to enable a user to construct visual contextual-views of the community from the perspective of any community member . to evaluate these ideas we develop test beds to compare individual component-technologies such as user and group profile construction and similarity-matching , and we develop prototypes (web network and `` citeseer community '') to explore the broader architecture and usage issues .
