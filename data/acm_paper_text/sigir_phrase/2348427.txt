a visual tool for bayesian-data-analysis : the impact of smoothing on naive-bayes text classifiers naive-bayes (nb) classifiers are simple probabilistic classifiers still widely used in supervised-learning due to their tradeoff between efficient model-training and good empirical-results . one of the drawbacks of these classifiers is that in situations of data-sparsity (i.e. when the size of training-set is small) the maximum-likelihood-estimation of the probability of unseen features in these situations is equal to zero causing arithmetic anomalies . to prevent this undesirable behavior , a number of smoothing-techniques have been proposed . among these , the bayesian-approach incorporates smoothing in terms of prior-knowledge about the parameters of the model usually called hyper-parameters . our research question is : can a visualization-tool help researchers to quickly assess the goodness of the performance of nb classifiers by setting optimal smoothing parameters ?
