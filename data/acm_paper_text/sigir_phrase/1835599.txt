entropy descriptor for image-classification this paper presents a novel entropy descriptor in the sense of geometric manifolds . with this descriptor , entropy cycles can be easily designed for image-classification . minimizing this entropy leads to an optimal entropy cycle where images are connected in the semantic order . during classification , the training step is to find an optimal entropy cycle in each class . in the test step , an unknown image is grouped into a class if the entropy increase as the result of inserting the image into the cycle of this class is relatively least . the proposed approach can generalize well on difficult image-classification problems where images with same objects are taken in multiple-views . experimental-results show that this entropy descriptor performs well in image-classification and has potential in the image-based-modeling retrieval .
