random-walk term-weighting for information-retrieval we present a way of estimating term-weights for information-retrieval (ir) , using term-co-occurrence as a measure of dependency between terms.we use the random-walk graph-based-ranking algorithm on a graph that encodes terms and co-occurrence dependencies in text , from which we derive term-weights that represent a quantification of how a term contributes to its context . evaluation on two trec collections and 350 topics shows that the random walk-based term-weights perform at least comparably to the traditional tf-idf term-weighting , while they outperform it when the distance between co-occurring terms is between 6 and 30 terms .
