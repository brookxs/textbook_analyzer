infoland : information lay-of-land for session search search-result-clustering (src) is a post-retrieval process that hierarchically organizes search-results . the hierarchical-structure offers overview for the search-results and displays an `` information lay-of-land '' that intents to guide the users throughout a search-session . however , src hierarchies are sensitive to query changes , which are common among queries in the same session . this instability may leave users seemly random overviews throughout the session . we present a new tool called infoland that integrates external-knowledge from wikipedia when building src hierarchies and increase their stability . evaluation on trec 2010-2011 session tracks shows that infoland produces more stable results organization than a commercial-search-engine .
