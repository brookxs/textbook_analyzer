one-button search extracts wider interests : an empirical-study with video bookmarking search this poster presents an overview of the characteristics of a one-button information-retrieval interface with closed-captions from tv-watching activities , which is intended to lighten the burden of remembering and entering query terms while watching tv . we investigated this interface with an experimental-system named video bookmarking search , which estimates query terms from closed-captions with named-entity-recognition and sentence labeling techniques . according to an empirical-evaluation for 1,138 search queries from 206 bookmarks using seven actual tv shows on city life , travel , health , and cuisine , we found wider queries and search-results are acceptable through the query-input-free interface , despite the fact that the number of queries and search-results that are directly relevant to the users ' original intentions is not high . the main reason is a watching user 's interest is wider than what is expressed with query terms .
