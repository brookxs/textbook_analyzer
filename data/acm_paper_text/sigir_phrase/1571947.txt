dynamicity vs. effectiveness : studying online-clustering for scatter/gather we proposed and implemented a novel clustering-algorithm called lair2 , which has constant running-time average for on-the-fly scatter/gather browsing [4] . our experiments showed that when running on a single processor , the lair2 on-line clustering-algorithm was several hundred times faster than a parallel buckshot algorithm running on multiple processors [11] . this paper reports on a study that examined the effectiveness of the lair2 algorithm in terms of clustering-quality and its impact on retrieval-performance . we conducted a user-study on 24 subjects to evaluate on-the-fly lair2 clustering in scatter/gather search-tasks by comparing its performance to the buckshot algorithm , a classic method for scatter/gather browsing [4] . results showed significant differences in terms of subjective perceptions of clustering-quality . subjects perceived that the lair2 algorithm produced significantly better quality clusters than the buckshot method did . subjects felt that it took less effort to complete the tasks with the lair2 system , which was more effective in helping them in the tasks . interesting patterns also emerged from subjects ' comments in the final open-ended questionnaire . we discuss implications and future-research .
