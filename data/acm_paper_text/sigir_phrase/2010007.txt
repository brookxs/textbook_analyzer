clickthrough-based latent-semantic models for web-search this paper presents two new document-ranking models for web-search based upon the methods of semantic-representation and the statistical translation-based approach to information-retrieval (ir) . assuming that a query is parallel to the titles of the documents clicked on for that query , large amounts of query-title pairs are constructed from clickthrough-data ; two latent-semantic models are learned from this data . one is a bilingual topic-model within the language-modeling framework . it ranks documents for a query by the likelihood of the query being a semantics-based translation of the documents . the semantic representation is language-independent and learned from query-title pairs , with the assumption that a query and its paired titles share the same distribution over semantic topics . the other is a discriminative projection model within the vector-space-modeling framework . unlike latent-semantic-analysis and its variants , the projection matrix in our model , which is used to map from term vectors into sematic space , is learned discriminatively such that the distance between a query and its paired title , both represented as vectors in the projected semantic-space , is smaller than that between the query and the titles of other documents which have no clicks for that query . these models are evaluated on the web-search-task using a real-world data-set . results show that they significantly outperform their corresponding baseline models , which are state-of-the-art .
