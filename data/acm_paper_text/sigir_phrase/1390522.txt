exploiting proximity feature in bigram-language-model for information-retrieval language-modeling approaches have been effectively dealing with the dependency among query terms based on n-gram such as bigram or trigram models . however , bigram language models suffer from adjacency-sparseness problem which means that dependent terms are not always adjacent in documents , but can be far from each other , sometimes with distance of a few sentences in a document . to resolve the adjacency-sparseness problem , this paper proposes a new type of bigram-language-model by explicitly incorporating the proximity feature between two adjacent terms in a query . experimental-results on three test-collections show that the proposed bigram-language-model significantly improves previous bigram-model as well as tao 's approach , the state-of-art method for proximity-based method .
