preliminary study of technical-terminology for the retrieval of scientific book metadata records books only represented by brief metadata (book records) are particularly hard to retrieve . one way of improving their retrieval is by extracting retrieval enhancing features from them . this work focusses on scientific (physics) book records . we ask if their technical-terminology can be used as a retrieval enhancing feature . a study of 18,443 book records shows a strong correlation between their technical-terminology and their likelihood of relevance . using this finding for retrieval yields &#62; +5 % precision-and-recall gains .
