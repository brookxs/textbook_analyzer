sets : search enhanced by topic-segmentation we present sets , an architecture for efficient search in peer-to-peer-networks , building upon ideas drawn from machine-learning and social-network-theory . the key idea is to arrange participating sites in a topic-segmented overlay-topology in which most connections are short-distance , connecting pairs of sites with similar-content . topically focused sets of sites are then joined together into a single network by long-distance links . queries are matched and routed to only the topically closest regions . we discuss a variety of design-issues and tradeoffs that an implementor of sets would face . we show that sets is efficient in network-traffic and query-processing load .
