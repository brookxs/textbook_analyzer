a cluster-based approach to thesaurus-construction the importance of a thesaurus in the successful operation of an information-retrieval-system is well recognized . yet techniques which support the automatic-generation of thesauri remain largely undiscovered . this paper describes one approach to the automatic-generation of global thesauri , based on the discrimination value-model of salton , yang , and yu and on an appropriate clustering-algorithm . this method has been implemented and applied to two document-collections . preliminary results indicate that this method , which produces improvements in retrieval-performance in excess of 10 and 15 percent in the test-collections , is viable and worthy of continued investigation .
