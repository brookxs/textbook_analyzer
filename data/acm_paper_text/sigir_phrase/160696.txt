the identification of important concepts in highly structured technical papers automatic-abstracting , typically based on extraction of important sentences from a text , has been treated as a largely separate task from automatic-indexing . this paper describes an approach in which the indexing and abstracting tasks are effectively combined . it is applicable to highly structured empirical-research papers , whose content can be organised using a semantic-frame . during a scan of a source-text , stylistic clues and constructs are used for extracting candidate fillers for the various slots in the frame . subsequently , an actual concept name is chosen for each slot by comparing the various candidates and their weights .
