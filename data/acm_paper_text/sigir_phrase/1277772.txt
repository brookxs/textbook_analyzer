neighborhood restrictions in geographic-ir geographic-information-retrieval (gir) systems allow users to specify a geographic-context , in addition to a more traditional query , enabling the system to pinpoint interesting search-results whose relevancy is location-dependent . in particular local-search services have become a widely used mechanism to find businesses , such as hotels , restaurants , and shops , which satisfy a geographical restriction . unfortunately , many useful types of geographic restrictions are currently not supported in these systems , including restrictions that specify the neighborhood in which the business should be located . as the boundaries of city neighborhoods are not readily available , automated techniques to construct representations of the spatial extent of neighborhoods are required to support this kind of restrictions . in this paper , we propose such a technique , using fuzzy-footprints to cope with the inherent vagueness of most neighborhood boundaries , and we provide experimental-results that demonstrate the potential of our technique in a local-search setting .
