learning to personalize query-auto-completion query-auto-completion (qac) is one of the most prominent features of modern search-engines . the list of query candidates is generated according to the prefix entered by the user in the search box and is updated on each new key-stroke . query prefixes tend to be short and ambiguous , and existing models mostly rely on the past popularity of matching candidates for ranking . however , the popularity of certain queries may vary drastically across different demographics and users . for instance , while instagram and imdb have comparable popularities overall and are both legitimate candidates to show for prefix i , the former is noticeably more popular among young female users , and the latter is more likely to be issued by men . in this paper , we present a supervised framework for personalizing auto-completion ranking . we introduce a novel labelling strategy for generating offline training labels that can be used for learning personalized rankers . we compare the effectiveness of several user-specific and demographic-based features and show that among them , the user 's long-term search-history and location are the most effective for personalizing auto-completion rankers . we perform our experiments on the publicly available aol query-logs , and also on the larger-scale logs of bing . the results suggest that supervised rankers enhanced by personalization features can significantly outperform the existing popularity-based base-lines , in terms of mean reciprocal rank (mrr) by up to 9 % .
