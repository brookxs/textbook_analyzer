leveraging sources of collective-wisdom on the web for discovering technology synergies one of the central tasks of r&d strategy and portfolio-management at large technology companies and research institutions refers to the identification of technological synergies throughout the organization . these efforts are geared towards saving-resources by consolidating scattered expertise , sharing best-practices , and reusing available technologies across multiple product-lines . in the past , this task has been done in a manual-evaluation process by technical-domain experts . while feasible , the major drawback of this approach is the enormous effort in terms of availability and time : for a structured and complete analysis every combination of any two technologies has to be rated explicitly . we present a novel approach that recommends technological synergies in an automated fashion , making use of abundant collective-wisdom from the-web , both in pure textual form as well as classification ontologies . our method has been deployed for practical support of the synergy evaluation-process within our company . we have also conducted empirical evaluations based on randomly selected technology pairs so as to benchmark the accuracy of our approach , as compared to a group of general computer-science technologists as well as a control group of domain-experts .
