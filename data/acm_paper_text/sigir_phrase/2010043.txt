an event-centric model for multilingual-document similarity document-similarity measures play an important role in many document-retrieval and exploration tasks . over the past decades , several models and techniques have been developed to determine a ranked list of documents similar to a given query document . interestingly , the proposed approaches typically rely on extensions to the vector-space-model and are rarely suited for multilingual-corpora . in this paper , we present a novel document-similarity measure that is based on events extracted from documents . an event is solely described by nearby occurrences of temporal and geographic expressions in a document 's text . thus , a document is modeled as a set of events that can be compared and ranked using temporal and geographic hierarchies . a key feature of our model is that it is term - and language-independent as temporal and geographic expressions mentioned in texts are normalized to a-standard-format . this also allows to determine similar documents across languages , an important feature in the context of document-exploration . our approach proves to be quite effective , including the discovery of new similarities , as our experiments using different (multilingual) corpora demonstrate .
