a fact/opinion classifier for news-articles many online news/blog aggregators like google , yahoo and msn allow users to browse/search many hundreds of news sources . this results in dozens , often hundreds , of stories about the same event . while the news-aggregators cluster these stories , allowing the user to efficiently scan the major news-items at any given time , they do not currently allow alternative browsing mechanisms within the clusters . furthermore , their intra-cluster ranking-mechanisms are often based on a notion of authority/popularity of the source . in many cases , this leads to the classic power-law phenomenon -- the popular stories/sources are the ones that are already popular/authoritative , thus reinforcing one dominant viewpoint . ideally , these aggregators would exploit the availability of the tremendous number of sources to identify the various dominant threads or viewpoints about a story and highlight these threads for the users . this paper presents an initial limited approach to such an-interface : it classifies articles into two categories : fact and opinion . we show that the combination of (i) a classifier trained on a small (140k) training-set of editorials/reports and (ii) an interactive-user-interface that ameliorates classification errors by re-ordering the presentation can be effective in highlighting different underlying viewpoints in a story-cluster . we briefly discuss the classifier used here , the training-set and the ui and report on some initial anecdotal user-feedback and evaluation .
