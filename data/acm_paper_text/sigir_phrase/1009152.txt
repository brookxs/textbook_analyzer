discovering and representing the contextual and narrative-structure of e-books to support reading and comprehension (abstract only) a person reading a book needs to build an understanding based on the available textual materials . as a result of a survey of users ' reading behaviours and of existing e-book user-interfaces , we found that most of these interfaces provide poor support for the actual processes of reading and comprehension . in particular , there is generally minimal support for understanding the overall structure (or contextual structure) and the narrative-structure of a book . we propose adapting topic-tracking and detection techniques to discover the narrative threads within a book , and hence its narrative-structure . the contextual and narrative-structures will be presented to the user through purpose-designed visualisations , which will be integrated and linked within a newly developed e-book browser . we have chosen to use the bible as our test-corpus , as it has a rich narrative-structure , and relatively complex contextual structure . evaluation of the interface , and its components , will be done through field-studies involving actual readers of the bible , to assess the effectiveness of the user-interface in enhancing a user 's experience .
