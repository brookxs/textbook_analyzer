mssf : a multi-document-summarization framework based on submodularity multi-document-summarization aims to distill the most representative information from a set of documents to generate a summary . given a set of documents as input , most of existing multi-document-summarization approaches utilize different sentence-selection techniques to extract a set of sentences from the document set as the summary . the submodularity hidden in textual-unit similarity motivates us to incorporate this property into our solution to multi-document-summarization tasks . in this poster , we propose a new principled and versatile framework for different multi-document-summarization tasks using the submodular function [8] .
