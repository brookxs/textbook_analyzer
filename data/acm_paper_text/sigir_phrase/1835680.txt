information-retrieval challenges in computational-advertising computational-advertising is an emerging scientific sub-discipline , at the intersection of large-scale search and text-analysis , information-retrieval , statistical-modeling , machine-learning , classification , optimization , and microeconomics . the central challenge of computational-advertising is to find the `` best match '' between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement . the aim of this tutorial is to present the-state-of-the-art in computational-advertising , in particular in its ir-related aspects , and to expose the participants to the current-research challenges in this field . the tutorial does not assume any prior-knowledge of web-advertising , and will begin with a comprehensive background survey . going deeper , our focus will be on using a textual representation of the user-context to retrieve relevant ads . at first approximation , this process can be reduced to a conventional setup by constructing a query that describes the user-context and executing the query against a large inverted-index of ads . we show how to augment this approach using query-expansion and text-classification-techniques tuned for the ad-retrieval problem . in particular , we show how to use the-web as a repository of query-specific knowledge and use the-web search-results retrieved by the query as a form of a relevance-feedback and query-expansion . we also present solutions that go beyond the conventional bag-of-words indexing by constructing additional features using a large external taxonomy and a lexicon of named-entities obtained by analyzing the entire web as a corpus . the last part of the tutorial will be devoted to a potpourri of recent research results and open problems inspired by computational-advertising challenges in text-summarization , natural-language-generation , named-entity-recognition , computer-human-interaction , and other sigir-relevant areas .
