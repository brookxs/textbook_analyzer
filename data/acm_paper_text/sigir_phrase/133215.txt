bead : explorations in information-visualization we describe work on the visualization of bibliographic-data and , to aid in this task , the application of numerical-techniques for multidimensional-scaling . many areas of scientific-research involve complex multivariate-data . one example of this is information-retrieval . document comparisons may be done using a large number of variables . such conditions do not favour the more well-known methods of visualization and graphical-analysis , as it is rarely feasible to map each variable onto one aspect of even a three-dimensional , coloured and textured space . bead is a prototype-system for the graphically-based exploration of information . in this system , articles in a bibliography are represented by particles in 3-space . by using physically-based modelling techniques to take advantage of fast methods for the approximation of potential fields , we represent the relationships between articles by their relative spatial positions . inter-particle forces tend to make similar articles move closer to one another and dissimilar ones move apart . the result is a 3d-scene which can be used to visualize patterns in the high-d information-space .
