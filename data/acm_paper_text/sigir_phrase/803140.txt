experiments on the determination of the relationships between terms the retrieval-effectiveness of an automatic-method that uses relevance-judgements for the determination of positive as well as negative relationships between terms is evaluated . the term-relationships are incorporated into the retrieval-process by using a generalized similarity-function that has a term match component , a positive term-relationship component , and a negative term-relationship component . two strategies , query partitioning and query-clustering , for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the term-relationships are investigated . the latter appears to be more attractive from linguistic as well as economic points of view . the positive and the negative relationships are verified to be effective both when used individually , and in combination . the importance attached to the term-relationship components relative to that of term match component is found to have a substantial effect on the retrieval-performance . the usefulness of discriminant-analysis as a technique for determining the relative-importance of these components is investigated .
