frank : a ranking-method with fidelity-loss ranking problem is becoming important in many fields , especially in information-retrieval (ir) . many machine-learning-techniques have been proposed for ranking problem , such as ranksvm , rankboost , and ranknet . among them , ranknet , which is based on a probabilistic-ranking framework , is leading to promising results and has been applied to a commercial web-search-engine . in this paper we conduct further study on the probabilistic-ranking framework and provide a novel loss-function named fidelity-loss for measuring loss of ranking . the fidelity-loss notonly inherits effective properties of the probabilistic-ranking framework in ranknet , but possesses new properties that are helpful for ranking . this includes the fidelity-loss obtaining zero for each document pair , and having a finite upper-bound that is necessary for conducting query-level normalization . we also propose an algorithm named frank based on a generalized additive model for the sake of minimizing the fedelity loss and learning an effective ranking-function . we evaluated the proposed algorithm for two datasets : trec dataset and real web-search dataset . the experimental-results show that the proposed frank algorithm outperforms other learning-based ranking methods on both conventional ir problem and web-search .
