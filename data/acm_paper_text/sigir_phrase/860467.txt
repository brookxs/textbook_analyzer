probabilistic term variant generator for biomedical terms this paper presents an algorithm to generate possible variants for biomedical terms . the algorithm gives each variant its generation probability representing its plausibility , which is potentially useful for query and dictionary expansions . the probabilistic rules for generating variants are automatically learned from raw texts using an existing abbreviation-extraction technique . our method , therefore , requires no linguistic-knowledge or labor-intensive natural-language resource . we conducted an experiment using 83,142 medline abstracts for rule-induction and 18,930 abstracts for testing . the results indicate that our method will significantly increase the number of retrieved documents for long biomedical terms .
