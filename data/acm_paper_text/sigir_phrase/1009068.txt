block-level link-analysis link-analysis has shown great potential in improving the performance of web-search . pagerank and hits are two of the most popular algorithms . most of the existing link-analysis-algorithms treat a web-page as a single node in the web-graph . however , in most cases , a web-page contains multiple semantics and hence the-web page might not be considered as the atomic node . in this paper , the-web page is partitioned into blocks using the vision-based-page-segmentation algorithm . by extracting the page-to-block , block-to-page relationships from link-structure and page-layout analysis , we can construct a semantic-graph over the www such that each node exactly represents a single semantic topic . this graph can better describe the semantic structure of the web . based on block-level link-analysis , we proposed two new algorithms , block level pagerank and block level hits , whose performances we study extensively using web-data .
