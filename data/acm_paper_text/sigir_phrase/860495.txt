a system for new-event-detection we present a new method and system for performing the new-event-detection task , i.e. , in one or multiple-streams of news stories , all stories on a previously unseen (new) event are marked . the method is based on an incremental tf-idf model . our extensions include : generation of source-specific models , similarity-score normalization based on document-specific averages , similarity-score normalization based on source-pair specific averages , term reweighting based on inverse event frequencies , and segmentation of the documents . we also report on extensions that did not improve results . the system performs very well on tdt3 and tdt4 test-data and scored second in the tdt-2002 evaluation .
