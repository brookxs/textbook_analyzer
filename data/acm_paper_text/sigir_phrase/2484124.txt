mining web-search topics with diverse spatiotemporal-patterns mining the latent topics from web-search data and capturing their spatiotemporal-patterns have many applications in information-retrieval . as web-search is heavily influenced by the spatial and temporal factors , the latent topics usually demonstrate a variety of spatiotemporal-patterns . in the face of the diversity of these patterns , existing models are increasingly ineffective , since they capture only one dimension of the spatiotemporal-patterns (either the spatial or temporal-dimension) or simply assume that there exists only one kind of spatiotemporal-patterns . such oversimplification risks distorting the latent data-structure and hindering the downstream usage of the discovered topics . in this paper , we introduce the spatiotemporal search topic-model (sstm) to discover the latent topics from web-search data with capturing their diverse spatiotemporal-patterns simultaneously . the sstm can flexibly support diverse spatiotemporal-patterns and seamlessly integrate the unique features in web-search such as query words , urls , timestamps and search-sessions . the sstm is demonstrated as an effective exploratory tool for large-scale web search data and it performs superiorly in quantitative comparisons to several state-of-the-art topic-models .
