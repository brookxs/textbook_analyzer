a web-page topic-segmentation algorithm based on visual criteria and content layout this paper presents experiments using an algorithm of web-page topic-segmentation that show significant precision improvement in the retrieval of documents issued from the-web track corpus of trec 2001 . instead of processing the whole document , a web-page is segmented into different semantic-blocks according to visual criteria (such as horizontal lines , colors) and structural tags (such as headings <h1> ~ <h6> , paragraph <p>) . we conclude that combining visual and content layout criteria gives the best results for increasing the precision : the ranking of the page is calculated for relevant segments of pages resulting from the segmentation-algorithm .
