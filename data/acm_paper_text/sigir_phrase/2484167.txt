exploiting semantics for improving clinical-information retrieval clinical-information retrieval (ir) presents several challenges including terminology mismatch and granularity mismatch . one of the main objectives in clinical ir is to fill the semantic gap among the queries and documents and go beyond keywords matching . to address these issues , in this paper we attempt to use semantic-information to improve the performance of clinical ir systems by representing queries in an expressive and meaningful context . to model a query-context initially we model and develop query domain-ontology . the query domain-ontology represents concepts closely related with query concepts . query-context represents concepts extracted from query domain-ontology and weighted according to their semantic-relatedness to query-concept (s) . the query-context is then exploited in query-expansion and patients records re-ranking for improving clinical retrieval-performance . we evaluate our approach on the trec medical-records dataset . results show that our proposed approach significantly improves the retrieval-performance compare to classic keyword-based ir model .
