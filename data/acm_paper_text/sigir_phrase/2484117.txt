report from the ntcir-10 1click-2 japanese subtask : baselines , upperbounds and evaluation robustness the one click access task (1click) of ntcir requires systems to return a concise multi-document-summary of web-pages in response to a query which is assumed to have been submitted in a mobile-context . systems are evaluated based on information units (or iunits) , and are required to present important pieces of information first and to minimise the amount of text the user has to read . using the official japanese results of the second round of the 1click task from ntcir-10 , we discuss our task setting and evaluation-framework . our analyses show that : (1) simple baseline methods that leverage search-engine snippets or wikipedia are effective for ` lookup ' type queries but not necessarily for other query-types ; (2) there is still a substantial gap between manual and automatic runs ; and (3) our evaluation-metrics are relatively robust to the incompleteness of iunits .
