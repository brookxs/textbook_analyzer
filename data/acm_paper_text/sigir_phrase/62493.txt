an outline of a general-model for information-retrieval-systems this paper is a contribution to the construction of a general-model for information-retrieval . as in the paper of van rijsbergen ([rij86]) , the implicit base in all information-retrieval-systems is considered as a logical implication . the measure of correspondence between a document and a query is transformed into the estimation of the strength (or certainty) of logical implication . the modal-logics will show its suitability for representing the behavior of information-retrieval-systems . in existing information-retrieval-models , several aspects are often mixed . a part of this paper is contributed to separate these aspects to give a clearer view of information-retrieval-systems . this general-model is also compared with some existing models to show its generality .
