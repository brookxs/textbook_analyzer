term-position ranking : some new test results presents seven sets of laboratory results testing variables in term-position ranking which produce a phrase effect by weighting the distance between proximate terms . results of the 73 tests conducted by this project are included , covering variant term-position algorithms , sentence-boundaries , stopword counting , every pairs testing , field selection , and combinations of algorithm including collection frequency , record frequency and searcher weighted . the discussion includes the results of tests by fagan and by croft , the need for term stemming , proximity as a precision device , comparisons with boolean , and the quality of test-collections .
