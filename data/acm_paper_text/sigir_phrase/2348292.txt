privacy-aware image-classification and search modern content-sharing environments such as flickr or youtube contain a large amount of private resources such as photos showing weddings , family holidays , and private parties . these resources can be of a highly sensitive nature , disclosing many details of the users ' private sphere . in order to support users in making privacy decisions in the context of image sharing and to provide them with a better overview on privacy related visual-content available on the web , we propose techniques to automatically detect private images , and to enable privacy-oriented image-search . to this end , we learn privacy classifiers trained on a large set of manually assessed flickr photos , combining textual-metadata of images with a variety of visual-features . we employ the resulting classification-models for specifically searching for private photos , and for diversifying query results to provide users with a better coverage of private and public content . large-scale-classification experiments reveal insights into the predictive performance of different visual and textual-features , and a user-evaluation of query result rankings demonstrates the viability of our approach .
