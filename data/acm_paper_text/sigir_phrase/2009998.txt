parameterized-concept-weighting in verbose-queries the majority of the current information-retrieval-models weight the query concepts (e.g. , terms or phrases) in an unsupervised manner , based solely on the collection statistics . in this paper , we go beyond the unsupervised-estimation of concept weights , and propose a parameterized-concept-weighting model . in our model , the weight of each query-concept is determined using a parameterized combination of diverse importance features . unlike the existing supervised-ranking methods , our model learns importance weights not only for the explicit query concepts , but also for the latent concepts that are associated with the query through pseudo-relevance-feedback . the experimental-results on both newswire and web trec corpora show that our model consistently and significantly outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art retrieval-models . in addition , our model significantly reduces the number of latent concepts used for query-expansion compared to the non-parameterized pseudo-relevance-feedback_based models .
