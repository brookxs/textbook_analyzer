using local precision to compare search-engines in consumer-health-information retrieval we have conducted a user-study to evaluate several generalist and health-specific search-engines on health-information-retrieval . users evaluated the relevance of the top 30 documents of 4 search-engines in two different health-information needs . we introduce the concepts of local and global precision and analyze how they affect the evaluation . results show that google surpasses the precision of all other engines , including the health-specific ones , and that precision differs with the type of clinical question and its medical specialty .
