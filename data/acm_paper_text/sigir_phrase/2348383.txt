structural-relationships for large-scale-learning of answer-re-ranking supervised-learning applied to answer-re-ranking can highly improve on the overall accuracy of question-answering (qa) systems . the key aspect is that the relationships and properties of the question/answer pair composed of a question and the supporting passage of an answer candidate , can be efficiently compared with those captured by the learnt model . in this paper , we define novel supervised approaches that exploit structural-relationships between a question and their candidate-answer passages to learn a re-ranking model . we model structural representations of both questions-and-answers and their mutual relationships by just using an off-the-shelf shallow syntactic parser . we encode structures in support-vector-machines (svms) by means of sequence and-tree kernels , which can implicitly represent question-and-answer pairs in huge feature spaces . such models together with the latest approach to fast kernel-based-learning enabled the training of our rerankers on hundreds of thousands of instances , which previously rendered intractable for kernelized svms . the results on two different qa datasets , e.g. , answerbag and jeopardy! data , show that our models deliver large improvement on passage re-ranking tasks , reducing the error in recall of bm25 baseline by about 18 % . one of the key findings of this work is that , despite its simplicity , shallow syntactic trees allow for learning complex relational structures , which exhibits a steep learning-curve with the increase in the training-size .
