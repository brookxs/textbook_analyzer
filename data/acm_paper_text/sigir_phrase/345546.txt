automatic-generation of overview timelines we present a statistical model of feature occurrence over time , and develop tests based on classical hypothesis-testing for significance of term appearance on a given date . using additional classical hypothesis-testing we are able to combine these terms to generate topics as defined by the topic-detection-and-tracking study . the groupings of terms obtained can be used to automatically generate an interactive-timeline displaying the major events and topics covered by the corpus . to test the validity of our technique we extracted a large number of these topics from a test-corpus and had human evaluators judge how well the selected features captured the gist of the topics , and how they overlapped with a set of known topics from the corpus . the resulting topics were highly rated by evaluators who compared them to known topics .
