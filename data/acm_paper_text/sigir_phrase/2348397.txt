combining implicit and explicit topic representations for result-diversification result-diversification deals with ambiguous or multi-faceted queries by providing documents that cover as many subtopics of a query as possible . various approaches to subtopic modeling have been proposed . subtopics have been extracted internally , e.g. , from retrieved documents , and externally , e.g. , from web-resources such as query-logs . internally modeled subtopics are often implicitly represented , e.g. , as latent topics , while externally modeled subtopics are often explicitly represented , e.g. , as reformulated queries . we propose a framework that : i) combines both implicitly and explicitly represented subtopics ; and ii) allows flexible combination of multiple external resources in a transparent and unified manner . specifically , we use a random-walk_based approach to estimate the similarities of the explicit subtopics mined from a number of heterogeneous-resources : click-logs , anchor-text , and web-n-grams . we then use these similarities to regularize the latent topics extracted from the top-ranked documents , i.e. , the internal (implicit) subtopics . empirical-results show that regularization with explicit subtopics extracted from the right resource leads to improved diversification results , indicating that the proposed regularization with (explicit) external resources forms better (implicit) topic-models . click-logs and anchor-text are shown to be more effective resources than web-n-grams under current experimental settings . combining resources does not always lead to better results , but achieves a robust-performance . this robustness is important for two reasons : it can not be predicted which resources will be most effective for a given query , and it is not yet known how to reliably determine the optimal model-parameters for building implicit topic-models .
