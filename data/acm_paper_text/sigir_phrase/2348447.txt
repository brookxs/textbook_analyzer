putting context into search and search into context it is very challenging task to understand a short query , especially if that query is considered in isolation . luckily , queries do magically appear in a search box -- rather , they are issued by real people , trying to accomplish a task , at a given point in time and space , and this `` context '' can be used to aid query understanding . traditionally search-engines have returned the same results to everyone who asks the same question . however , using a single ranking for everyone , in every context limits how well a search-engine can do . in this talk i outline a framework to quantify the `` potential-for-personalization '' , that can be used to characterize the extent to which different people have the same (or different) intents for a query . i then describe several examples of how we represent and use different kinds of context to improve search-quality . finally i conclude by highlighting some important challenges in developing such systems at web-scale including system-optimization , evaluation , transparency and serendipity .
