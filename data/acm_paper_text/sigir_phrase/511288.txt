the function of semantics in automated-language-processing this paper is a survey of some of the major semantic-models that have been developed for automated semantic analysis of natural-language . current approaches to semantic-analysis and logical-inference are based mainly on models of human cognitive processes such as quillian 's semantic-memory , simmon 's protosynthex iii and others . all existing systems and/or models , more or less experimental , were applied to a small subset of english . they are highly tentative because the definitions of semantic processes and semantically structured lexicons are not formulated rigorously . this is due mainly to the fact that it is unknown whether a unique , consistent hierarchization of the semantic features of language is possible.however , the models described are significant contributions to an unexplored field called semantics . the progressive-development of a sophisticated , semantically based system for automated-processing of natural-language is a realistic goal . it should not be neglected , despite the fact that it is difficult to predict when this goal will be achieved .
