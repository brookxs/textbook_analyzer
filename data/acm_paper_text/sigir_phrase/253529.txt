a testbed for information-retrieval-research : the utah retrieval-system architecture the utah retrieval-system architecture provides an excellent testbed for the development-and-testing of new algorithms or techniques for information-retrieval . ursa is a message-based structure capable of running on a variety of system configurations , ranging from a single mainframe processor to a system distributed across a number of dissimilar processors . it can readily support a variety of specialized backend processors , such as high-speed search-engines . the architecture divides the components of a text-retrieval-system into two classes : servers and clients . a triple of servers (index , search , and document access) for each database provide the capabilities normally associated with a retrieval-system . possible clients for these servers include a window-based user-interface , whose query-language can be easily modified , a connection to a mainframe host processor , or al-based query-modification programs that wish to use the database . any module in the system can be replaced by a new module using a different algorithm as long as the new module complies with the message formats for that function . in fact , with some care this module switch can occur while the system is running , without affecting the users . a monitor program collects statistics on all system messages , giving information regarding query-complexity , processing-time for each module , queueing times , and bandwidths between every module . this paper discusses the background of ursa and its structure , with particular emphasis on the features that make it a good testbed for information-retrieval-techniques .
