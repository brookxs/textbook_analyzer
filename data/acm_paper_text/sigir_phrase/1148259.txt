analysis of a low-dimensional linear-model under recommendation attacks collaborative-filtering techniques have become popular in the past decade as an effective way to help people deal with information-overload . recent research has identified significant vulnerabilities in collaborative-filtering techniques . shilling-attacks , in which attackers introduce biased ratings to influence recommendation-systems , have been shown to be effective against memory-based collaborative-filtering algorithms . we examine the effectiveness of two popular shilling-attacks (the random attack and the average attack) on a model-based algorithm that uses singular-value-decomposition (svd) to learn a low-dimensional linear-model . our results show that the svd-based algorithm is much more resistant to shilling-attacks than memory-based algorithms . furthermore , we develop an attack-detection method directly built on the svd-based algorithm and show that this method detects random shilling-attacks with high detection rates and very low false-alarm rates .
