usefulness of hyperlink-structure for query-biased topic-distillation in this paper , we introduce an information-theoretic method for estimating the usefulness of the hyperlink-structure induced from the set of retrieved documents . we evaluate the effectiveness of this method in the context of an optimal bayesian decision mechanism , which selects the most appropriate retrieval approaches on a per-query basis for two trec tasks . the estimation of the hyperlink-structure 's usefulness is stable when we use different weighting-schemes , or when we employ sampling of documents to reduce the computational-overhead . next , we evaluate the effectiveness of the hyperlink-structure 's usefulness in a realistic setting , by setting the thresholds of a decision mechanism automatically . our results show that improvements over the baselines are obtained .
