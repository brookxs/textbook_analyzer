getting work done on the web : supporting transactional queries many searches on the web have a transactional intent . we argue that pages satisfying transactional needs can be distinguished from the more common pages that have some information and links , but can not be used to execute a transaction . based on this hypothesis , we provide a recipe for constructing a transaction annotator . by constructing an annotator with one corpus and then demonstrating its classification-performance on another , we establish its robustness . finally , we show experimentally that a search-procedure that exploits such pre-annotation greatly outperforms traditional search for retrieving transactional pages .
