computing text constituency : an algorithmic approach to the generation of text graphs an algorithm for text-summarization (automatic-abstracting) is presented which constitutes the text condensation component of topic , a knowledge-based text information-system . based on the results of text-parsing knowledge-representation structures of text-segments are evaluated in order to determine dominant concepts . by means of an interpretation-schema dominant concepts are related in terms of thematic units indicative of the topic (s) of the text-segment under consideration . the mutual compatibility of topics of adjacent text-segments is determined and corresponding text constituents are constructed . finally , a text graph is generated linking appropriate text constituents on various levels of text constituency . accordingly , facilities for text-oriented information-retrieval will be based on the manipulation of these text graphs .
