synthesizing high utility suggestions for rare web-search-queries search-engines are continuously looking into methods to alleviate users ' effort in finding desired information . for this , all major search-engines employ query-suggestions methods to facilitate effective query-formulation and reformulation . providing high quality query-suggestions is a critical task for search-engines and so far most research efforts have focused on tapping various information available in search-query-logs to identify potential suggestions . by relying on this single-source of information , suggestion providing systems often restrict themselves to only previously observed query sessions . therefore , a critical challenge faced by query-suggestions provision mechanism is that of coverage , i.e. , the number of unique queries for which users are provided with suggestions , while keeping the suggestion quality high . to address this problem , we propose a novel way of generating suggestions for user-search queries by moving beyond the dependency on search-query-logs and providing synthetic suggestions for web-search-queries . the key challenges in providing synthetic suggestions include identifying important concepts in a query and systematically exploring related concepts while ensuring that the resulting suggestions are relevant to the user-query and of high utility . we present an end-to-end system to generate synthetic suggestions that builds upon novel query-level operations and combines information available from various textual sources . we evaluate our suggestion system over a large-scale real-world dataset of query-logs and show that our methods increase the coverage of query-suggestion pairs by up to 39 \ % without compromising the quality or the utility of the suggestions .
