a unified inverted-index for an efficient image-and-text retrieval we present an efficient method for approximate-search in a combination of several metric-spaces -- which are a generalization of low level image-features -- using an inverted-index . our approximation gives very high recall with subsecond response-time on a real-data set of one million images extracted from flickr . we further exploit the inverted-index to improve efficiency of the query-processing by combining our search in metric features with search in associated textual-metadata .
