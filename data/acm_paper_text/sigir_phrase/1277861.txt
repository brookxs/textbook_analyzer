management of keyword variation with frequency_based generation of word forms in ir this paper presents a new management method for morphological-variation of keywords . the method is called fcg , frequent case generation . it is based on the skewed distributions of word forms in natural-languages and is suitable for languages that have either fair amount of morphological-variation or are morphologically very rich . the proposed method has been evaluated so far with four languages , finnish , swedish , german and russian , which show varying degrees of morphological complexity .
