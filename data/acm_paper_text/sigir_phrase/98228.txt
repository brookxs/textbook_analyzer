construction of a dynamic thesaurus and its use for associated information-retrieval an information-retrieval-system based on a dynamic thesaurus was developed utilizing the connectionist approach . the dynamic thesaurus consists of nodes , which represent each term of a thesaurus , and links , which represent the connections between nodes . term information that is automatically extracted from user 's relevant documents is used to change node weights and generate links . node weights and links reflect a user 's particular interest . a document-retrieval experiment was conducted in which both a high recall rate and a high precision rate were achieved . the topics discussed in this paper : connectionist model , automatic-indexing , information-retrieval , and thesaurus .
