intent-oriented diversity in recommender-systems diversity as a relevant dimension of retrieval quality is receiving increasing attention in the information-retrieval and recommender-systems (rs) fields . the problem has nonetheless been approached under different views and formulations in ir and rs respectively , giving rise to different models , methodologies , and metrics , with little convergence between both fields . in this poster we explore the adaptation of diversity-metrics , techniques , and principles from ad-hoc ir to the recommendation task , by introducing the notion of user-profile aspect as an analogue of query-intent . as a particular approach , user aspects are automatically extracted from latent item features . empirical-results support the proposed approach and provide further insights .
