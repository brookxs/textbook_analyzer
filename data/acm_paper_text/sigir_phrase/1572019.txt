towards methods for the collective gathering and-quality control of relevance-assessments growing interest in online collections of digital-books and video-content motivates the development and optimization of adequate retrieval-systems . however , traditional methods for collecting relevance-assessments to tune system-performance are challenged by the nature of digital-items in such collections , where assessors are faced with a considerable effort to review and assess content by extensive reading , browsing , and within-document-searching . the extra strain is caused by the length and cohesion of the digital item and the dispersion of topics within it . we propose a method for the collective gathering of relevance-assessments using a social-game model to instigate participants ' engagement . the game provides incentives for assessors to follow a predefined review procedure and makes provisions for the quality-control of the collected relevance-judgments . we discuss the approach in detail , and present the results of a pilot-study conducted on a book-corpus to validate the approach . our analysis reveals intricate relationships between the affordances of the system , the incentives of the social-game , and the behavior of the assessors . we show that the proposed game-design achieves two designated goals : the incentive structure motivates endurance in assessors and the review-process encourages truthful assessment .
