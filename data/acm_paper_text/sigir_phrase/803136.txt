a file-organization for cluster-based-retrieval a file-organization for cluster-based-retrieval is presented and tested . this file-organization is based on the bottom-up search which , in contrast to the more usual top-down search , starts at the lowest level of a cluster hierarchy (the documents) and looks at progressively larger clusters . this approach enables most of the efficiency problems previously associated with clustered file organizations to be avoided . there are two parts to this file-organization - a compact cluster hierarchy representation which does not store cluster representatives and a compact inverted-file which is used to provide a starting point for the bottom-up search . retrieval experiments show that the bottom-up search using this file-organization can be more effective than a serial-search , especially if high precision results are required .
