question-classification with semantic-tree kernel question-classification plays an important role in most question-answering-systems . in this paper , we exploit semantic-features in support-vector-machines (svms) for question-classification . we propose a semantic-tree kernel to incorporate semantic-similarity information . a diverse set of semantic-features is evaluated . experimental-results show that svms with semantic-features , especially semantic-classes , can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art systems .
