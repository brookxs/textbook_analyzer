modeling the impact of short - and long-term behavior on search-personalization user-behavior provides many cues to improve the relevance of search-results through personalization . one aspect of user-behavior that provides especially strong signals for delivering better relevance is an individual 's history of queries and clicked documents . previous studies have explored how short-term behavior or long-term behavior can be predictive of relevance . ours is the first study to assess how short-term (session) behavior and long-term (historic) behavior interact , and how each may be used in isolation or in combination to optimally contribute to gains in relevance through search-personalization . our key findings include : historic behavior provides substantial benefits at the start of a search-session ; short-term session behavior contributes the majority of gains in an extended search-session ; and the combination of session and historic behavior out-performs using either alone . we also characterize how the relative contribution of each model changes throughout the duration of a session . our findings have implications for the design of search systems that leverage user-behavior to personalize the search experience .
