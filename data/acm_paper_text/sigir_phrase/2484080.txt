news vertical-search : when and what to display to users news-reporting has seen a shift toward fast-paced online reporting in new sources such as social-media . web-search-engines that support a news vertical have historically relied upon articles published by major newswire providers when serving news-related queries . in this paper , we investigate to what extent real-time content from newswire , blogs , twitter-and-wikipedia sources are useful to return to the user in the current fast-paced news-search setting . in particular , we perform a detailed user-study using the emerging medium of crowdsourcing to determine when and where integrating news-related content from these various sources can better serve the user 's news need . we sampled approximately 300 news-related search queries using google-trends and bitly data in real-time for two time periods . for these queries , we have crowdsourced workers compare web-search-rankings for each , with similar rankings integrating real-time news content from sources such as twitter or the blogosphere . our results show that users exhibited a preference for rankings integrating newswire articles for only half of our queries , indicating that relying solely on newswire providers for news-related content is now insufficient . moreover , our results show that users preferred rankings that integrate tweets more often than those that integrate newswire articles , showing the potential of using social-media to better serve news-queries .
