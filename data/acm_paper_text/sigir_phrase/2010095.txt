collaborative-cyberporn-filtering with collective-intelligence this paper presents a user-intent method to generate blacklists for collaborative-cyberporn-filtering . a novel porn detection-framework that finds new pornographic web-pages by mining user search-behaviors is proposed . it employs users ' clicks in search-query-logs to select the suspected web-pages without extra human efforts to label data for training , and determines their categories with the help of url host-name and path-information , but without web-page-content . we adopt an msn porn data-set to explore the effectiveness of our method . this user-intent approach achieves high precision , while maintaining favorably low false positive rate . in addition , real-life filtering simulation reveals that our user-intent method with its accumulative update strategy achieves 43.36 \ % of blocking rate , while maintaining a steadily less than 7 \ % of over-blocking rate .
