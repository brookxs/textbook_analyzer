mining employment market via text-block-detection and adaptive cross-domain information-extraction we have developed an approach for analyzing online job advertisements in different domains (industries) from different regions worldwide . our approach is able to extract precise information from the text-content supporting useful employment market-analysis locally and globally . a major component in our approach is an information-extraction framework which is composed of two challenging tasks . the first task is to detect unformatted text blocks automatically based on an unsupervised-learning model . identifying these useful text blocks through this learning-model allows the generation of highly effective features for the next task which is text fragment-extraction learning . the task of text fragment-extraction learning is formulated as a domain-adaptation model for text fragment classification . one advantage of our approach is that it can easily adapt to a large number of online job advertisements in different and new domains . extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach .
