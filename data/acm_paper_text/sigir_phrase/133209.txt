a faster algorithm for constructing minimal-perfect-hash-functions our previous research on one-probe access to large-collections of data indexed by alphanumeric keys has produced the first practical minimal-perfect-hash-functions for this problem . here , a new algorithm is described for quickly finding minimal-perfect-hash-functions whose specification space is very close to the theoretical lower-bound , i.e. , around 2 bits per key . the various stages of processing are detailed , along with analytical and empirical results , including timing for a set of over 3.8 million keys that was processed on a nextstation in about 6 hours .
