automatic-assignment of soft boolean-operators the conventional bibliographic retrieval-systems are based on boolean-query formulations and inverted-file implementations . such systems provide rapid responses in answer to search queries but they are not easy to use by uninitiated patrons . an extended boolean-retrieval strategy has been devised in which the boolean-operators are treated more or less strictly , depending on the setting of a special parameter , known as the p-value . the extended system is much more forgiving than the conventional system , and provides better retrieval-effectiveness . in this study various problems associated with the determination of appropriate p-values are discussed , and suggestions are made for an automatic-assignment of p-values . evaluation output is included to illustrate the operations of the suggested procedures .
