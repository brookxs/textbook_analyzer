adapting a data-organization to the structure of stored information a data-organization for information-retrieval (ir) systems is described which uses the structures imposed on the stored information . trees are used as the main structure of data as information contents are often hierarchically structured (e.g. classifications , thesauri) . however , these trees have been expanded to pseudo networks by so-called cross connecting paths . so-called data connecting paths link the information-structures and the main data file . terms occurring in the query-formulation may be weighted . these weights are interpreted and then used by both the retrieval and ranking-algorithm . one of the paramount problems is how to combine weighted query terms . since the well-known ir schemes (boolean-retrieval , fuzzy retrieval etc.) do not work in our environment , a specific ir model was developed which allows to deduct suitable query and ranking-evaluation algorithms .
