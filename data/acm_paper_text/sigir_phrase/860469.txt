a maximal-figure-of-merit learning-approach to text-categorization a novel maximal-figure-of-merit (mfom) learning-approach to text-categorization is proposed . different from the conventional techniques , the proposed mfom method attempts to integrate any performance-metric of interest (e.g. accuracy , recall , precision , or f1 measure) into the design of any classifier . the corresponding classifier parameters are learned by optimizing an overall objective-function of interest . to solve this highly nonlinear-optimization problem , we use a generalized probabilistic descent algorithm . the mfom learning-framework is evaluated on the reuters-21578 task with lsi-based feature-extraction and a binary-tree classifier . experimental-results indicate that the mfom classifier gives improved f1 and enhanced robustness over the conventional one . it also outperforms the popular svm method in micro-averaging f1 . other extensions to design discriminative multiple-category mfom classifiers for application-scenarios with new performance-metrics could be envisioned too .
