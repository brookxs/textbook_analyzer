an evaluation of query-processing strategies using the tipster-collection the tipster-collection is unusual because of both its size and detail . in particular , it describes a set of information-needs , as opposed to traditional queries . these detailed representations of information-need are an opportunity for research on different methods of formulating queries . this paper describes several methods of constructing queries for the inquery information-retrieval-system , and then evaluates those methods on the tipster document-collection . both adhoc and routing query-processing-methods are evaluated .
