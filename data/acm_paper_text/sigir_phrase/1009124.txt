a study of methods for normalizing user-ratings in collaborative-filtering the goal of collaborative-filtering is to make recommendations for a test user by utilizing the rating information of users who share interests similar to the test user . because ratings are determined not only by user-interests but also the rating habits of users , it is important to normalize ratings of different users to the same scale . in this paper , we compare two different normalization strategies for user-ratings , namely the gaussian normalization method and the decoupling normalization method . particularly , we incorporated these two rating-normalization methods into two collaborative-filtering algorithms , and evaluated their effectiveness on the eachmovie dataset . the experiment results have shown that the decoupling method for rating-normalization is more effective than the gaussian normalization method in improving the performance of collaborative-filtering algorithms .
