principles of hash-based text-retrieval hash-based-similarity-search reduces a continuous similarity relation to the binary concept `` similar or not similar '' : two feature-vectors are considered as similar if they are mapped on the same hash key . from its runtime-performance this principle is unequaled -- while being unaffected by dimensionality concerns at the same time . similarity hashing is applied with great success for near similarity-search in large document collections , and it is considered as a key technology for near-duplicate-detection and plagiarism-analysis . this papers reveals the design principles behind hash-based search-methods and presents them in a unified way . we introduce new stress statistics that are suited to analyze the performance of hash-based search-methods , and we explain the rationale of their effectiveness . based on these insights , we show how optimum hash-functions for similarity-search can be derived . we also present new results of a comparative-study between different hash-based search-methods .
