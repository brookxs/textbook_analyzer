annotation of urls : more than the sum of parts recently a number of studies have demonstrated that search-engine logfiles are an important resource to determine the relevance relation between urls and query terms . we hypothesized that the queries associated with a url could also be presented as useful url metadata in a search-engine result list , e.g. for helping to determine the semantic category of a url . we evaluated this hypothesis by a classification experiment based on the dmoz dataset . our method can also annotate urls that have no associated queries .
