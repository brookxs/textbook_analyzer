lexical-analysis for modeling web-query reformulation modeling web-query reformulation processes is still an unsolved problem . in this paper we argue that lexical-analysis is highly beneficial for this purpose . we propose to use the variation in query-clarity , as well as the part-of-speech pattern transitions as indicators of user 's search actions . experiments with a log of 2.4 million queries showed our techniques to be more flexible than the current approaches , while also providing us with interesting insights into user 's web behavioral-patterns .
