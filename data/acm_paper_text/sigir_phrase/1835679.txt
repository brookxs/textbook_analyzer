web-retrieval : the role of users web-retrieval methods have evolved through three major steps in the last decade or so . they started from standard document-centric ir in the early days of the-web , then made a major step forward by leveraging the structure of the web , using link-analysis techniques in both crawling and ranking challenges . a more recent , no less important but maybe more discrete step forward , has been to enter the user in this equation in two ways : (1) implicitly , through the analysis of usage-data captured by query-logs , and session and click information in general , the goal being to improve ranking as well as to measure user 's happiness and engagement ; (2) explicitly , by offering novel interactive features ; the goal here being to better answer users ' needs . in this tutorial , we will cover the user-related challenges associated with the implicit and explicit role of users in web-retrieval . we will review and discuss challenges associated with two types of activities , namely : usage-data analysis and metrics and user-interaction . the goal of this tutorial is to teach the key principles and technologies behind the activities and challenges briefly outlined above , bring new understanding and insights to the attendees , and hopefully foster future-research .
