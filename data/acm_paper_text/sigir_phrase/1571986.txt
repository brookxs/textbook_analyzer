learning in a pairwise term-term proximity framework for information-retrieval traditional ad-hoc-retrieval models do not take into account the closeness or proximity of terms . document scores in these models are primarily based on the occurrences or non-occurrences of query-terms considered independently of each other . intuitively , documents in which query-terms occur closer together should be ranked higher than documents in which the query-terms appear far apart . this paper outlines several term-term proximity measures and develops an intuitive framework in which they can be used to fully model the proximity of all query-terms for a particular topic . as useful proximity functions may be constructed from many proximity measures , we use a learning-approach to combine proximity measures to develop a useful proximity function in the framework . an evaluation of the best proximity functions show that there is a significant improvement over the baseline ad-hoc-retrieval model and over other more recent methods that employ the use of single proximity measures .
