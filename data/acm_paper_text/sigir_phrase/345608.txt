document-classification on neural-networks using only positive examples (poster session) in this paper , we show how a simple feed-forward neural-network can be trained to filter documents when only positive information is available , and that this method seems to be superior to more standard methods , such as tf-idf retrieval based on an average vector . a novel experimental finding that retrieval is enhanced substantially in this context by carrying out a certain kind of uniform transformation (hadamard) of the information prior to the training of the network .
