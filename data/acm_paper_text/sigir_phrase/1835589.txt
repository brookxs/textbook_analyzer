query recovery of short user queries : on query-expansion with stopwords user queries to search-engines are observed to predominantly contain inflected content-words but lack stopwords and capitalization . thus , they often resemble natural-language queries after case folding and stopword-removal . query recovery aims to generate a linguistically well-formed query from a given user-query as input to provide natural-language-processing-tasks and cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) . the evaluation of query-translation shows that translation scores (nist and bleu) decrease after case folding , stopword-removal , and stemming . a baseline method for query recovery reconstructs capitalization and stopwords , which considerably increases translation scores and significantly increases mean-average-precision for a standard clir task .
