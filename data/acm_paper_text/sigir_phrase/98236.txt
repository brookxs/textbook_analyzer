construction of optimal graphs for bit-vector compression bitmaps are data-structures occurring often in information-retrieval . they are useful ; they are also large and expensive to store . for this reason , considerable effort has been devoted to finding techniques for compressing them . these techniques are most effective for sparse bitmaps . we propose a preprocessing stage , in which bitmaps are first clustered and the clusters used to transform their member bitmaps into sparser ones , that can be more effectively compressed . the clustering method efficiently generates a graph-structure on the bitmaps . the results of applying our algorithm to the bible is presented : for some sets of bitmaps , our method almost doubled the compression savings .
