effect of dynamic-pruning safety on learning-to-rank effectiveness a dynamic-pruning strategy , such as wand , enhances retrieval-efficiency without degrading effectiveness to a given rank k , known as safe-to-rank-k . however , it is also possible for wand to obtain more efficient but unsafe retrieval without actually significantly degrading effectiveness . on the other hand , in a modern search-engine setting , dynamic-pruning strategies can be used to efficiently obtain the set of documents to be re-ranked by the application of a learned model in a learning-to-rank setting . no work has examined the impact of safeness on the effectiveness of the learned model . in this work , we investigate the impact of wand safeness through experiments using 150 trec web track topics . we find that unsafe wand is biased towards documents with lower docids , thereby impacting effectiveness .
