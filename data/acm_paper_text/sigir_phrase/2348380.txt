twiner : named-entity-recognition in targeted twitter stream many private and/or public organizations have been reported to create and monitor targeted twitter streams to collect and understand users ' opinions about the organizations . targeted twitter stream is usually constructed by filtering tweets with user-defined selection-criteria e.g. tweets published by users from a selected region , or tweets that match one or more predefined keywords . targeted twitter stream is then monitored to collect and understand users ' opinions about the organizations . there is an emerging need for early crisis detection and response with such target stream . such applications require a good named-entity-recognition (ner) system for twitter , which is able to automatically discover emerging named-entities that is potentially linked to the crisis . in this paper , we present a novel 2-step unsupervised ner system for targeted twitter stream , called twiner . in the first step , it leverages on the global context obtained from wikipedia and web-n-gram corpus to partition tweets into valid segments (phrases) using a dynamic-programming-algorithm . each such tweet segment is a candidate named-entity . it is observed that the named-entities in the targeted stream usually exhibit a gregarious property , due to the way the targeted stream is constructed . in the second step , twiner constructs a random-walk-model to exploit the gregarious property in the local-context derived from the twitter stream . the highly-ranked segments have a higher chance of being true named-entities . we evaluated twiner on two sets of real-life tweets simulating two targeted streams . evaluated using labeled ground-truth , twiner achieves comparable performance as with conventional approaches in both streams . various settings of twiner have also been examined to verify our global context + local-context combo idea .
