efficient top-k querying over social-tagging networks online-communities have become popular for publishing and searching content , as well as for finding and connecting to other users . user-generated-content includes , for example , personal blogs , bookmarks , and digital-photos . these items can be annotated and rated by different users , and these social-tags and derived user-specific scores can be leveraged for searching relevant content and discovering subjectively interesting items . moreover , the relationships among users can also be taken into consideration for ranking search-results , the intuition being that you trust the recommendations of your close friends more than those of your casual acquaintances . queries for tag or keyword combinations that compute and rank the top-k-results thus face a large variety of options that complicate the query-processing and pose efficiency challenges . this paper addresses these issues by developing an incremental top-k algorithm with two-dimensional expansions : social expansion considers the strength of relations among users , and semantic-expansion considers the relatedness of different tags . it presents a new algorithm , based on principles of threshold algorithms , by folding friends and related tags into the search-space in an incremental on-demand manner . the excellent performance of the method is demonstrated by an experimental-evaluation on three real-world datasets , crawled from deli.cio.us , flickr , and librarything .
