an effective implicit-relevance-feedback technique using affective , physiological and behavioural features the effectiveness of various behavioural signals for implicit-relevance-feedback models has been exhaustively studied . despite the advantages of such techniques for a real-time information-retrieval-system , most of the behavioural signals are noisy and therefore not reliable enough to be employed . among many , a combination of dwell-time and task information has been shown to be effective for relevance-judgement prediction . however , the task information might not be available to the system at all times . thus , there is a need for other sources-of-information which can be used as a substitute for task information . recently , affective and physiological-signals have shown promise as a potential source of information for relevance-judgement prediction . however , their accuracy is not high enough to be applicable on their own . this paper investigates whether affective and physiological-signals can be used as a complementary source of information for behavioural signals (i.e. dwell-time) to create a reliable signal for relevance-judgement prediction . using a video-retrieval-system as a use-case , we study and compare the effectiveness of the affective and physiological-signals on their own , as well as in combination with behavioural signals for the relevance-judgment prediction-task across four different search intentions : seeking information , re-finding a particular information-object , and two different entertainment intentions (i.e. entertainment by adjusting arousal level , and entertainment by adjusting mood) . our experimental-results show that the effectiveness of studied signals varies across different search intentions , and when affective and physiological-signals are combined with dwell-time , a significant improvement can be achieved . overall , these findings will help to implement better search-engines in the future .
