question-classification with log-linear-models question-classification has become a crucial step in modern question-answering-systems . previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of statistical-machine-learning approaches to this problem . this paper presents a new approach to building a question-classifier using log-linear-models . evidence from a rich and diverse set of syntactic and semantic features is evaluated , as well as approaches which exploit the hierarchical-structure of the question classes .
