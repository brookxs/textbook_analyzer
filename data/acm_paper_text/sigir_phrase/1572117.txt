a relevance-based topic-model for news event-tracking event-tracking is the task of discovering temporal-patterns of popular events from text-streams . existing approaches for event-tracking have two limitations : scalability and inability to rule out non-relevant portions in text-streams . in this study , we propose a novel approach to tackle these limitations . to demonstrate the approach , we track news events across a collection of weblogs spanning a two-month time period .
