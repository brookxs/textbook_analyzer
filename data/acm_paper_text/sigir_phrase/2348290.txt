learning to suggest : a machine-learning framework for ranking query suggestions we consider the task of suggesting related queries to users after they issue their initial query to a web-search-engine . we propose a machine-learning-approach to learn the probability that a user may find a follow-up query both useful and relevant , given his initial query . our approach is based on a machine-learning-model which enables us to generalize to queries that have never occurred in the logs as well . the model is trained on co-occurrences mined from the search-logs , with novel utility and relevance-models , and the machine-learning step is done without any labeled-data by human judges . the learning step allows us to generalize from the past observations and generate query-suggestions that are beyond the past co-occurred queries . this brings significant gains in coverage while yielding modest gains in relevance . both offline (based on human judges) and online (based on millions of user-interactions) evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines .
