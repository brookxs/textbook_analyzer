optimal classification and its consequences a particular classification and retrieval-model are considered . a notion is introduced which indicates the extent to which retrieval-performance may be improved by a suitable choice of classification within the model . a method for determining the optimal-performance for the model is outlined together with an algorithm for constructing the classification which allows this limit to be attained . a treatment of the mathematical preliminaries for a particular class of match-function is given . the relevance of the analysis in research on information-retrieval-systems is discussed .
