the esa retrieval-model revisited among the retrieval-models that have been proposed in the last years , the esa model of gabrilovich and markovitch received much attention . the authors report on a significant improvement in the retrieval-performance , which is explained with the semantic concepts introduced by the document collection underlying esa . their explanation appears plausible but our analysis shows that the connections are more involved and that the `` concept hypothesis '' does not hold . in our contribution we analyze several properties that in fact affect the retrieval-performance . moreover , we introduce a formalization of esa , which reveals its close connection to existing retrieval-models .
