document-clustering by concept-factorization in this paper , we propose a new data-clustering method called concept-factorization that models each concept as a linear combination of the data points , and each data point as a linear combination of the concepts . with this model , the data-clustering task is accomplished by computing the two sets of linear coefficients , and this linear coefficients computation is carried out by finding the non-negative solution that minimizes the reconstruction error of the data points . the cluster label of each data point can be easily derived from the obtained linear coefficients . this method differs from the method of clustering based on non-negative-matrix-factorization (nmf) \ citexu03 in that it can be applied to data containing negative values and the method can be implemented in the kernel-space . our experimental-results show that the proposed data-clustering method and its variations performs best among 11 algorithms and their variations that we have evaluated on both tdt2 and reuters-21578 corpus . in addition to its good performance , the new method also has the merit in its easy and reliable derivation of the clustering results .
