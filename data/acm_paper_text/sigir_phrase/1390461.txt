talking the talk vs. walking the walk : salience of information-needs in querying vs. browsing traditional information-retrieval-models assume that users express their information-needs via text queries (i.e. , their `` talk '') . in this poster , we consider web-browsing-behavior outside of interactions with retrieval-systems (i.e. , users ' `` walk '') as an alternative source of signal describing users ' information-needs , and compare it to the query-expressed information-needs on a large dataset . our findings demonstrate that information-needs expressed in different behavior modalities are largely non-overlapping , and that past behavior in each modality is the most accurate predictor of future behavior in that modality . results also show that browsing data provides a stronger source of signal than search queries due to its greater volume , which explains previous work that has found implicit behavioral data to be a valuable source of information for user-modeling and personalization .
