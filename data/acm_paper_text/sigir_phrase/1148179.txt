contextual-search and name-disambiguation in email using graphs similarity-measures for text have historically been an important tool for solving information-retrieval problems . in many interesting settings , however , documents are often closely connected to other documents , as well as other non-textual objects : for instance , email-messages are connected to other messages via header information . in this paper we consider extended similarity-metrics for documents and other objects embedded in graphs , facilitated via a lazy graph walk . we provide a detailed instantiation of this framework for email data , where content , social-networks and a timeline are integrated in a structural graph . the suggested framework is evaluated for two email-related problems : disambiguating names in email documents , and threading . we show that reranking schemes based on the graph-walk similarity-measures often outperform baseline methods , and that further improvements can be obtained by use of appropriate learning-methods .
