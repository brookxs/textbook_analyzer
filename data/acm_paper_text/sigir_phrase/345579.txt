latent-semantic-space : iterative-scaling improves precision of inter-document-similarity measurement we present a novel algorithm that creates document-vectors with reduced dimensionality . this work was motivated by an application characterizing relationships among documents in a collection . our algorithm yielded inter-document similarities with an average-precision up to 17.8 \ % higher than that of singular-value-decomposition (svd) used for latent-semantic-indexing . the best performance was achieved with dimensional-reduction rates that were 43 \ % higher than svd on average . our algorithm creates basis vectors for a reduced space by iteratively scaling vectors and computing eigenvectors . unlike svd , it breaks the symmetry of documents and terms to capture information more evenly across documents . we also discuss correlation with a probabilistic-model and evaluate a method for selecting the dimensionality using log-likelihood estimation .
