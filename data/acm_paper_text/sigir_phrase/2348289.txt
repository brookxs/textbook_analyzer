adaptive query suggestion for difficult-queries query-suggestion is a useful tool to help users formulate better queries . although this has been found highly useful globally , its effect on different queries may vary . in this paper , we examine the impact of query-suggestion on queries of different degrees of difficulty . it turns out that query-suggestion is much more useful for difficult-queries than easy queries . in addition , the suggestions for difficult-queries should rely less on their similarity to the original query . in this paper , we use a learning-to-rank approach to select query-suggestions , based on several types of features including a query-performance-prediction . as query-suggestion has different impacts on different queries , we propose an adaptive suggestion approach that makes suggestions only for difficult-queries . we carry out experiments on real-data from a search-engine . our results clearly indicate that an approach targeting difficult-queries can bring higher gain than a uniform suggestion approach .
