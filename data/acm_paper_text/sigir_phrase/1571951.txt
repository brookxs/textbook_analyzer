good-abandonment in mobile and pc internet-search query-abandonment by search-engine users is generally considered to be a negative signal . in this paper , we explore the concept of good-abandonment . we define a good-abandonment as an abandoned query for which the user 's information-need was successfully addressed by the search-results page , with no need to click on a result or refine the query . we present an analysis of abandoned internet-search queries across two modalities (pc and mobile) in three locales . the goal is to approximate the prevalence of good-abandonment , and to identify types-of-information-needs that may lead to good-abandonment , across different locales and modalities . our study has three key findings : first , queries potentially indicating good-abandonment make up a significant portion of all abandoned queries . second , the good-abandonment rate from mobile-search is significantly higher than that from pc search , across all locales tested . third , classified by type of information-need , the major classes of good-abandonment vary dramatically by both locale and modality . our findings imply that it is a mistake to uniformly consider query-abandonment as a negative signal . further , there is a potential opportunity for search-engines to drive additional good-abandonment , especially for mobile-search users , by improving search features and result snippets .
