language-specific models in multilingual topic-tracking topic-tracking is complicated when the stories in the stream occur in multiple languages . typically , researchers have trained only english topic-models because the training stories have been provided in english . in tracking , non-english test stories are then machine translated into english to compare them with the topic-models . we propose a native-language hypothesis stating that comparisons would be more effective in the original language of the story . we first test and support the hypothesis for story-link-detection . for topic-tracking the hypothesis implies that it should be preferable to build separate language-specific topic-models for each language in the stream . we compare different methods of incrementally building such native-language topic-models .
