information-extraction using two-phase pattern-discovery this paper presents a new two-phase pattern (2pp) discovery technique for information-extraction . 2pp consists of orthographic pattern-discovery (opd) and semantic-pattern discovery (spd) where the opd determines the structural-features from an identified region of a document and the spd discovers a dominant semantic-pattern for the region via inference , apposition and analogy . then the discovered pattern is applied back into the region to extract required data items through pattern-matching . we evaluated 2pp using 6500 data items and obtained effective result .
