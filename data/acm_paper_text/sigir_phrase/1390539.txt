re-ranking search results using document-passage graphs we present a novel passage - based approach to re-ranking documents in an initially retrieved list so as to improve precision-at-top-ranks . while most work on passage-based-document-retrieval ranks a document based on the query-similarity of its constituent passages , our approach leverages information about the centrality of the document passages with respect to the initial document list . passage centrality is induced over a bipartite document-passage graph , wherein edge weights represent document-passage similarities . empirical-evaluation shows that our approach yields effective re-ranking-performance . furthermore , the performance is superior to that of previously proposed passage-based document ranking methods .
