emerging topic-detection for organizations from microblogs microblog services have emerged as an essential way to strengthen the communications among individuals and organizations . these services promote timely and active discussions and comments towards products , markets as well as public events , and have attracted a lot of attentions from organizations . in particular , emerging topics are of immediate concerns to organizations since they signal current concerns of , and feedback by their users . two challenges must be tackled for effective emerging topic-detection . one is the problem of real-time relevant data-collection and the other is the ability to model the emerging characteristics of detected topics and identify them before they become hot-topics . to tackle these challenges , we first design a novel scheme to crawl the relevant messages related to the designated organization by monitoring multi-aspects of microblog content , including users , the evolving keywords and their temporal sequence . we then develop an incremental-clustering framework to detect new topics , and employ a range of content and temporal-features to help in promptly detecting hot emerging topics . extensive evaluations on a representative real-world dataset based on twitter data demonstrate that our scheme is able to characterize emerging topics well and detect them before they become hot-topics .
