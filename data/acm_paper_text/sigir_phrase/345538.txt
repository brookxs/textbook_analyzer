relevance-feedback with a small number of relevance-judgements : incremental relevance-feedback vs. document-clustering the use of incremental relevance-feedback and document-clustering were investigated in an relevance-feedback environment in which the number of relevance-judgements was quite small . through experiments on the trec collection , the incremental relevance-feedback approach was found not to improve the overall search-effectiveness . the clustering approach was found to be promising , although it sometimes over-focuses on a particular topic in a query and ignores the others . to overcome this problem , a query-biased clustering-algorithm was developed and shown to be effective .
