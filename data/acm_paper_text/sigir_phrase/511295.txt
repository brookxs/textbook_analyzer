quantification in query systems questions which involve ` all ' , ` every ' , ` some ' , or the indefinite article , pose some peculiar problems when presented to a computerized question-answering-system where ambiguities can not be tolerated . these problems vary from the nature of the correct answer in special cases to the very admissibility of the question itself . to deal with these problems it is convenient to divide questions into two classes -- extensional questions whose answers are to name things or truth values , intensional questions whose answers are to give meanings . this paper examines extensional questions . for these , the interpretative problems arising with ` all ' and ` every ' can be solved by introducing a new kind of quantification , extensional universal-quantification , that has the meaning of ` all f ' together with a secondary meaning that the class f is not empty . formal rules for this quantification are given , and it is shown that the so-called definite-formulas (which explicate permissible queries) are closed under the new operator .
