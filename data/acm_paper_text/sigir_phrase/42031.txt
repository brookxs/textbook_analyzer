predictive test-compression by hashing the knowledge of a short substring constitutes a good basis for guessing the next character in a natural-language-text . this observation , i.e. repeated guessing and encoding of subsequent characters , is very fundamental for the predictive-text compression . the paper describes a family of such compression methods , using a hash-table for searching the prediction information . the experiments show that the methods produce good compression gains and , moreover , are very fast . the one-pass versions are especially apt for on-the-fly compression of transmitted data , and could be a basis for specialized-hardware .
