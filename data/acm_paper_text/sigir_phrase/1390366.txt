the opposite of smoothing : a language-model-approach to ranking query-specific document clusters exploiting information induced from (query-specific) clustering of top-retrieved documents has long been proposed as means for improving precision at the very top ranks of the returned results . we present a novel language-model-approach to ranking query-specific-clusters by the presumed percentage of relevant documents that they contain . while most previous cluster ranking approaches focus on the cluster as a whole , our model also exploits information induced from documents associated with the cluster . our model substantially outperforms previous approaches for identifying clusters containing a high relevant-document percentage . furthermore , using the model to produce document-ranking yields precision-at-top-ranks performance that is consistently better than that of the initial ranking upon which clustering is performed ; the performance also favorably compares with that of a state-of-the-art pseudo-feedback retrieval-method .
