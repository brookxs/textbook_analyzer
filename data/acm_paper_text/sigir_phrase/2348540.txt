query-performance-prediction for ir the goal of this tutorial is to expose participants to current-research on query-performance-prediction . participants will become familiar with state-of-the-art performance-prediction methods , with common evaluation-methodologies of prediction-quality , and with potential applications that can utilize performance predictors . in addition , some open issues and challenges in the field will be discussed . this tutorial is an updated version of the sigir 2010 tutorial presented by david carmel and elad yom-tov on the same subject . this year we intend to expand on new results in the field , in particular focusing on recently developed frameworks that provide a unified-model for performance-prediction .
