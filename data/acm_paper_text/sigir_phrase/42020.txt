non-hierarchical document-clustering using the icl distribution array-processor this paper considers the suitability and efficiency of a highly parallel-computer , the icl distributed array-processor (dap) , for document-clustering . algorithms are described for the implementation of the single-pass and reallocation clustering-methods on the dap and on a conventional mainframe-computer . these methods are used to classify the cranfield , vaswani and ukcis document test-collections . the results suggest that the parallel-architecture of the dap is not well suited to the variable-length records which characterise bibliographic-data .
