information-retrieval for e-discovery discovery , the process under which parties to legal-cases must reveal documents relevant to the disputed issues is a core aspect of trials in the united-states , and a lesser but important-factor in other countries . discovery on documents stored in computerized systems (known variously as electronic-discovery , e-discovery , e-disco , edd , and ed) is increasingly the major factor in discovery , and has become a multi-billion dollar industry . i will discuss the basics of e-discovery , the scale and diversity of the materials involved , and the economics of identifying and reviewing potentially responsive material . i will then focus on three major ir areas-of-interest : search , supervised-machine-learning (including text-classification and relevance-feedback) , and interface-support for manual relevance-assessment . for each , i will discuss technologies currently used in e-discovery , the evaluation-methods applicable to measuring effectiveness , and existing research results not yet seeing commercial practice . i will also outline research-directions that , if successfully pursued , would potentially be of great interest in e-discovery applications . a particular focus will be on areas where researchers can make progress without access to operational e-discovery environments or `` realistic '' test-collections . connections will be drawn with the use of ir in related tasks , such as enterprise-search , criminal-investigations , intelligence-analysis , historical-research , truth and reconciliation commissions , and freedom-of-information (open records or sunshine law) requests .
