a weighted curve-fitting method for result-merging in federated-search result-merging is an important step in federated-search to merge the documents returned from multiple source-specific ranked-lists for a user-query . previous result-merging methods such as semi-supervised-learning (ssl) and sample - agglomerate fitting estimate (safe) use regression methods to estimate global document scores from document ranks in individual ranked-lists . ssl relies on overlapping documents that exist in both individual ranked-lists and a centralized sample database . safe goes a step further by using both overlapping documents with accurate rank information and documents with estimated rank information for regression . however , existing methods do not distinguish the accurate rank information from the estimated information . furthermore , all documents are assigned equal weights in regression while intuitively , documents in the top should carry higher weights . this paper proposes a weighted curve-fitting method for result-merging in federated-search . the new method explicitly models the importance of information from overlapping documents over non-overlapping ones . it also weights documents at different positions differently . empirically results on two datasets clearly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm .
