a relational-model for unstructured documents the logical-structure of a document is usually a tree in which the order of the nodes is important at least at some level of the tree . we call a document unstructured if its structure is a single-level ordered-tree . the purpose of this paper is to present a many-sorted algebra for handling unstructured documents . the documents in the model are represented by relations . an algebra for handling documents of one type can be extended to an algebra for handling documents of several types . further , an algebra for handling documents can be extended by the relational-algebra for handling documents and relations in a common algebra . the model of this paper can be regarded as a part of a general document-model . on the other hand , unstructured documents themselves are an important group of documents . we will show by examples that the simple model covers a wide range of document-handling and information retrieval problems .
