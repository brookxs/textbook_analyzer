a two-stage mixture-model for pseudo-feedback pseudo-feedback is a commonly used technique to improve information-retrieval performance . it assumes a few top-ranked documents to be relevant , and learns from them to improve the retrieval-accuracy . a serious problem is that the performance is often very sensitive to the number of pseudo-feedback documents . in this poster , we address this problem in a language-modeling framework . we propose a novel two-stage mixture-model , which is less sensitive to the number of pseudo-feedback documents than an effective existing feedback-model . the new model can tolerate a more flexible setting of the number of pseudo-feedback documents without the danger of losing much retrieval-accuracy .
