search and browse log-mining for web-information-retrieval : challenges , methods , and applications huge amounts of search-log data have been accumulated in various search-engines . currently , a commercial-search-engine receives billions of queries and collects tera-bytes of log-data on any single day . other than search-log data , browse logs can be collected by client-side browser plug-ins , which record the browse information if users ' permissions are granted . such massive amounts of search/browse log-data , on the one hand , provide great opportunities to mine the wisdom-of-crowds and improve search-results as well as online-advertisement . on the other hand , designing effective and efficient methods to clean , model , and process large-scale log-data also presents great challenges . in this tutorial , we focus on mining search and browse log-data for web-information-retrieval . we consider a web-information-retrieval system consisting of four components , namely , query understanding , document-understanding , query-document-matching , and user-understanding . accordingly , we organize the tutorial materials along these four aspects . for each aspect , we will survey the major tasks , challenges , fundamental principles , and state-of-the-art methods . the goal of this tutorial is to provide a systematic survey on large-scale search/browse log-mining to the ir community . it will help ir researchers to get familiar with the core challenges and promising directions in log-mining . at the same time , this tutorial may also serve the developers of web-information-retrieval systems as a comprehensive and in-depth reference to the advanced log-mining techniques .
