relevance information : a loss of entropy but a gain for idf ? when investigating alternative estimates for term discriminativeness , we discovered that relevance information and idf are much closer related than formulated in classical literature . therefore , we revisited the justification of idf as it follows from the binary independent retrieval (bir) model . the main result is a formal-framework uncovering the close relationship of a generalised idf and the bir model . the framework makes explicit how to incorporate relevance information into any retrieval-function that involves an idf - component.in addition to the idf - based formulation of the bir model , we propose poisson-based estimates as an alternative to the classical estimates , this being motivated by the superiority of poisson-based estimates for the within-document term frequencies . the main experimental finding is that a poisson-based idf is superior to the classical idf , where the superiority is particularly evident for long-queries .
