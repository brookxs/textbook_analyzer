an interpretation of index-term-weighting schemes based on document-components a theory of indexing is presented and is based on viewing a document as constituted of components . a component may be chosen as any run of text unit that can be : (a) judged as to its relevancy property ; and (b) considered as independent within the document . by looking at the constituent components of a document in relation to the universe of all components from the collection , we have been able to apply bayes ' decision-theory to derive the index term representation for the document , as well as attaching an initial probabilistic weight for each term based on a principle of document self-recovery . it turns out that different choices of document-components , such as a word or a whole abstract , can lead to different term-weighting-schemes that have been introduced before and are based on probability considerations ; specifically , edmundson and wyllys ' term significance formula , sparck jones ' inverse-document-frequency , and later modified by croft and harper into the ` combination match ' formula . thus , a unified interpretation of various probabilistic term weighting-schemes appears possible .
