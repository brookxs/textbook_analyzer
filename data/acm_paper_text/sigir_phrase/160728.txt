a comparison of indexing-techniques for japanese-text-retrieval a series of japanese full-text-retrieval experiments were conducted using an inference-network document-retrieval model . the retrieval-performance of two major indexing-methods , character-based and word-based , were evaluated . using structured-queries , the character-based-indexing performed retrieval as well as , or slightly better , than the word-based system . this result has practical significance since the character-based-indexing speed is considerably faster than the traditional word-based-indexing . all the queries in this experiment were automatically formulated from natural-language-input .
