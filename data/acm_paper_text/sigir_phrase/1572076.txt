experiments in clir using fuzzy string search-based on surface-similarity cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) between languages of the same origin is an interesting topic of research . the similarity of the writing systems used for these languages can be used effectively to not only improve clir , but to overcome the problems of textual variations , textual-errors , and even the lack of linguistic-resources like stemmers to an extent . we have conducted clir experiments between three languages which use writing systems (scripts) of brahmi-origin , namely hindi , bengali and marathi . we found significant improvements for all the six language-pairs using a method for fuzzy-text-search based on surface-similarity . in this paper we report these results and compare them with a baseline clir system and a clir system that uses scaled edit-distance (sed) for fuzzy string-matching .
