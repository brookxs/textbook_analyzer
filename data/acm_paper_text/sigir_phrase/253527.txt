the live-project : retrieval experiments based on evaluation viewpoints besides the operators ` and ' , ` or ' and ` not ' the grips retrieval language contains thesaurus operators to extend the query and truncation and context-operators for freetext and boolean searching . in a similar way several other viewpoints and evaluation-measures were defined and applied in the retrieval-experiment . under the assumption that the evaluation-measure is an interval scale averaging is done by calculating the arithmetic-mean . as levels of the experimental factor / 8 / the following similarity-measures were used : inner-product measure , cosine-measure , overlap-measure , coefficient of jaccard and euclidean-distance . as situative factors / 8 / the number of documents retrieved by grips , the number of descriptiors of the queries , generality and topic of documents were used . the retrieval-experiment is not yet finished completely but several results have already been obtained . for example in the average (over 81 queries) for the above defined viewpoint the ranking with the inner-product measure does not indicate a significant improvement compared with the grips-output . in the case of the euclidean-distance measure it seems that in the average the user has to inspect less nonrelevant documents . this means an improvement compared with the unordered retrieved set from the grips-output . for more details of the so called ` two-level retrieval-process ' and further experimental-results we refer to the long version of this paper .
