knowledge-transformation for cross-domain sentiment-classification with the explosion of user-generated web2 .0 content in the form of blogs , wikis and discussion-forums , the-internet has rapidly become a massive dynamic repository of public-opinion on an unbounded range of topics . a key enabler of opinion-extraction and summarization is sentiment-classification : the task of automatically identifying whether a given piece of text expresses positive or negative opinion towards a topic of interest . building high-quality sentiment classifiers using standard text-categorization methods is challenging due to the lack of labeled-data in a target-domain . in this paper , we consider the problem of cross-domain sentiment-analysis : can one , for instance , download rated movie-reviews from rottentomatoes.com or imbd discussion-forums , learn linguistic-expressions and sentiment-laden terms that generally characterize opinionated reviews and then successfully transfer this knowledge to the target-domain , thereby building high-quality sentiment models without manual effort ? we outline a novel sentiment transfer mechanism based on constrained non-negative matrix tri-factorizations of term-document matrices in the source and target domains . we report some preliminary results with this approach .
