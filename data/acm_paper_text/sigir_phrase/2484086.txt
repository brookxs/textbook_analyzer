incorporating popularity in topic-models for social-network-analysis topic-models are used to group words in a text dataset into a set of relevant topics . unfortunately , when a few words frequently appear in a dataset , the topic groups identified by topic-models become noisy because these frequent words repeatedly appear in `` irrelevant '' topic groups . this noise has not been a serious problem in a text dataset because the frequent words (e.g. , the and is) do not have much meaning and have been simply removed before a topic-model analysis . however , in a social-network dataset we are interested in , they correspond to popular persons (e.g. , barack obama and justin bieber) and can not be simply removed because most people are interested in them . to solve this `` popularity problem '' , we explicitly model the popularity of nodes (words) in topic-models . for this purpose , we first introduce a notion of a `` popularity component '' and propose topic-model extensions that effectively accommodate the popularity component . we evaluate the effectiveness of our models with a real-world twitter dataset . our proposed models achieve significantly lower perplexity (i.e. , better prediction power) compared to the state-of-the-art baselines . in addition to the popularity problem caused by the nodes with high incoming edge degree , we also investigate the effect of the outgoing edge degree with another topic-model extensions . we show that considering outgoing edge degree does not help much in achieving lower perplexity .
