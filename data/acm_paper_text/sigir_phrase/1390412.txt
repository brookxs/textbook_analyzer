browserank : letting web users vote for page-importance this paper proposes a new method for computing page-importance , referred to as browserank . the conventional approach to compute page-importance is to exploit the link-graph of the-web and to build a model based on that graph . for instance , pagerank is such an algorithm , which employs a discrete-time markov-process as the model . unfortunately , the link-graph might be incomplete and inaccurate with respect to data for determining page-importance , because links can be easily added and deleted by web-content creators . in this paper , we propose computing page-importance by using a ` user-browsing-graph ' created from user-behavior-data . in this graph , vertices represent pages and directed-edges represent transitions between pages in the users ' web-browsing history . furthermore , the lengths of staying time spent on the pages by users are also included . the user-browsing-graph is more reliable than the link-graph for inferring page-importance . this paper further proposes using the continuous-time-markov-process on the user-browsing-graph as a model and computing the stationary-probability-distribution of the process as page-importance . an efficient-algorithm for this computation has also been devised . in this way , we can leverage hundreds of millions of users ' implicit voting on page-importance . experimental-results show that browserank indeed outperforms the baseline methods such as pagerank and trustrank in several tasks .
