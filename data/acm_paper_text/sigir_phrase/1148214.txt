latent-semantic-analysis for multiple-type interrelated-data objects co-occurrence data is quite common in many real applications . latent-semantic-analysis (lsa) has been successfully used to identify semantic-relations in such data . however , lsa can only handle a single co-occurrence relationship between two types of objects . in practical applications , there are many cases where multiple-types of objects exist and any pair of these objects could have a pairwise co-occurrence-relation . all these co-occurrence-relations can be exploited to alleviate data-sparseness or to represent objects more meaningfully . in this paper , we propose a novel algorithm , m-lsa , which conducts latent-semantic-analysis by incorporating all pairwise co-occurrences among multiple-types of objects . based on the mutual-reinforcement-principle , m-lsa identifies the most salient concepts among the co-occurrence data and represents all the objects in a unified semantic-space . m-lsa is general and we show that several variants of lsa are special cases of our algorithm . experiment results show that m-lsa outperforms lsa on multiple-applications , including collaborative-filtering , text-clustering , and text-categorization .
