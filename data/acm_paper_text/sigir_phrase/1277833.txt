compressed permuterm index recently [manning et al. , 2007] resorted the permuterm indexof garfield (1976) as a time-efficient and elegant solution to the string dictionary problem in which pattern queries may possibly include one wild-card symbol (called , tolerant retrieval problem) . unfortunately the permuterm index is space inefficient because its quadruples the dictionary size . in this paper we propose the compressed permuterm index which solves the tolerant retrieval problem in optimal query time , i.e. time proportional to the length of the searched pattern , and space close to the k-th order empirical-entropy of the indexed dictionary . our index can be used to solve also more sophisticated queries which involve several wild-card symbols , or require to prefix-match multiple fields in a database of records.the result is based on an elegant variant of the burrows-wheeler-transform defined on a dictionary of strings of variable-length , which allows to easily adapt known compressed indexes [makinen-navarro , 2007] to solve the tolerant retrieval problem . experiments show that our index supports fast queries within a space occupancy that is close to the one achievable by compressing the string dictionary via gzip , bzip or ppmdi . this improves known approaches based on front-coding by more than 50 \ % in absolute space occupancy , still guaranteeing comparable query time .
