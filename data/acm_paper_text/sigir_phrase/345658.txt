swami (poster session) : a framework for collaborative-filtering algorithm-development and evaluation we present a java-based framework , swami (shared wisdom through the amalgamation of many interpretations) for building and studying collaborative-filtering systems . swami consists of three components : a prediction engine , an evaluation-system , and a visualization component . the prediction engine provides a common interface for implementing different prediction algorithms . the evaluation-system provides a standardized testing-methodology and metrics for analyzing the accuracy and run-time-performance of prediction algorithms . the visualization component suggests how graphical-representations can inform the development and analysis of prediction algorithms . we demonstrate swami on the each movie data-set by comparing three prediction algorithms : a traditional pearson correlation-based method , support-vector-machines , and a new accurate and scalable correlation-based method based on clustering-techniques .
