learning to predict response-times for online query scheduling dynamic-pruning strategies permit efficient retrieval by not fully scoring all postings of the documents matching a query -- without degrading the retrieval-effectiveness of the top-ranked results . however , the amount of pruning achievable for a query can vary , resulting in queries taking different amounts of time to execute . knowing in advance the execution-time of queries would permit the exploitation of online-algorithms to schedule queries across replicated servers in order to minimise the average query waiting and completion times . in this work , we investigate the impact of dynamic-pruning strategies on query response-times , and propose a framework for predicting the efficiency of a query . within this framework , we analyse the accuracy of several query-efficiency predictors across 10,000 queries submitted to in-memory inverted-indices of a 50-million-document web-crawl . our results show that combining multiple efficiency predictors with regression can accurately predict the response-time of a query before it is executed . moreover , using the efficiency predictors to facilitate online-scheduling-algorithms can result in a 22 % reduction in the mean waiting-time experienced by queries before execution , and a 7 % reduction in the mean completion-time experienced by users .
