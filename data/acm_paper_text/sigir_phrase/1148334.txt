measuring similarity of semi-structured-documents with context weights in this work , we study similarity-measures for text-centric xml-documents based on an extended vector-space-model , which considers both document-content-and-structure . experimental-results based on a benchmark showed superior performance of the proposed measure over the baseline which ignores structural-knowledge of xml-documents .
