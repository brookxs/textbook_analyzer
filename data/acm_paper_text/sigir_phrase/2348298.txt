aspectiles : tile-based visualization of diversified web-search-results a diversified search result for an underspecified query generally contains web-pages in which there are answers that are relevant to different aspects of the query . in order to help the user locate such relevant answers , we propose a simple extension to the standard search-engine result page (serp) interface , called aspectiles . in addition to presenting a ranked list of urls with their titles and snippets , aspectiles visualizes the relevance degree of a document to each aspect by means of colored squares (`` tiles '') . to compare aspectiles with the standard serp interface in terms of usefulness , we conducted a user-study involving 30 search-tasks designed based on the trec web diversity task topics as well as 32 participants . our results show that aspectiles has some advantages in terms of search-performance , user-behavior , and user-satisfaction . first , aspectiles enables the user to gather relevant-information significantly more efficiently than the standard serp interface for tasks where the user considers several different aspects of the query to be important at the same time (multi-aspect tasks) . second , aspectiles affects the user 's information-seeking-behavior : with this interface , we observed significantly fewer query-reformulations , shorter queries and deeper examinations of ranked-lists in multi-aspect tasks . third , participants of our user-study found aspectiles significantly more useful for finding relevant-information and easy to use than the standard serp interface . these results suggest that simple interfaces like aspectiles can enhance the search-performance and search experience of the user when their queries are underspecified .
