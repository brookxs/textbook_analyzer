rough-sets and information retrieval the theory of rough-sets was introduced [pawlak82] . it allows us to classify objects into sets of equivalent members based on their attributes . we may then examine any combination of the same objects (or even their attributes) using the resultant classification . the theory has direct applications in the design-and-evaluation of classification-schemes and the selection of discriminating attributes . pawlak 's papers discuss its application in the domain of medical diagnostic systems . here we apply it to the design of information-retrieval-systems accessing collections of documents . advantages offered by the theory are : the implicit inclusion of boolean-logic ; term-weighting ; and the ability to rank retrieved documents . in the first section we describe the theory . this is derived from the work by [pawlak84 , pawlak82] and includes only the most relevant aspects of the theory . in the second we apply it to information-retrieval . specifically , we design the approximation space , search-strategies as well as illustrate the application of relevance-feedback to improve document-indexing . following this in section three we compare the rough-set formalism to the boolean , vector and fuzzy-models of information-retrieval . finally we present a small scale evaluation of rough-sets which indicates its potential in information-retrieval .
