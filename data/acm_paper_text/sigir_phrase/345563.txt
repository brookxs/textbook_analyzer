automatic-adaptation of proper-noun dictionaries through cooperation of machine-learning and probabilistic-methods the recognition of proper nouns (pns) is considered an important task in the area of information-retrieval-and-extraction . however the high-performance of most existing pn classifiers heavily depends upon the availability of large dictionaries of domain-specific proper nouns , and a certain amount of manual work for rule-writing or manual-tagging . though it is not a heavy requirement to rely on some existing pn dictionary (often these resources are available on the web) , its coverage of a domain-corpus may be rather low , in absence of manual updating . in this paper we propose a technique for the automatic updating of an pn dictionary through the cooperation of an inductive and a probabilistic-classifier . in our experiments we show that , whenever an existing pn dictionary allows the identification of 50 \ % of the proper nouns within a corpus , our technique allows , without additional manual effort , the successful recognition of about 90 \ % of the remaining 50 \ % .
