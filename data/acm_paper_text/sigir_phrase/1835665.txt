achieving high-accuracy-retrieval using intra-document term-ranking most traditional ranking-models roughly score the relevance of a given document by observing simple term statistics , such as the occurrence of query terms within the document or within the collection . intuitively , the relative-importance of query terms with regard to other individual non-query terms in a document can also be exploited to promote the ranks of documents in which the query is dedicated as the main topic . in this paper , we introduce a simple technique named intra-document term-ranking , which involves ranking all the terms in a document according to their relative-importance within that particular document . we demonstrate that the information regarding the rank positions of given query terms within the intra-document term-ranking can be useful for enhancing the precision of top-retrieved results by traditional ranking-models . experiments are conducted on three standard trec test-collections .
