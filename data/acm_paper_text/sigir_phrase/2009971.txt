scalable multi-dimensional user-intent identification using tree structured distributions the problem of identifying user-intent has received considerable attention in recent years , particularly in the context of improving the search experience via query contextualization . intent can be characterized by multiple dimensions , which are often not observed from query words alone . accurate identification of intent from query words remains a challenging problem primarily because it is extremely difficult to discover these dimensions . the problem is often significantly compounded due to lack of representative training sample . we present a generic , extensible-framework for learning the multi-dimensional representation of user-intent from the query words . the approach models the latent relationships between facets using tree structured distribution which leads to an efficient and convergent algorithm , fastq , for identifying the multi-faceted intent of users based on just the query words . we also incorporated wordnet to extend the system capabilities to queries which contain words that do not appear in the training-data . empirical-results show that fastq yields accurate identification of intent when compared to a gold-standard .
