combining bidirectional-translation and synonymy for cross-language-information-retrieval this paper introduces a general-framework for the use of translation-probabilities in cross-language-information-retrieval based on the notion that information-retrieval fundamentally requires matching what the searcher means with what the author of a document meant . that perspective yields a computational formulation that provides a natural way of combining what have been known as query and document translation . two well-recognized techniques are shown to be a special case of this model under restrictive assumptions . cross-language search-results are reported that are statistically indistinguishable from strong monolingual baselines for both french and chinese documents .
