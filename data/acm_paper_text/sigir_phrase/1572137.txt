topic prerogative feature-selection using multiple-query-examples for automatic-video-retrieval well acceptance of relevance-feedback and collaborative-systems has given the users to express their preferences in terms of multiple-query-examples . the-technology devised to utilize these user-preferences , is expected to mine the semantic knowledge embedded within these query examples . in this paper , we propose a video-mining framework based on dynamic learning from queries , using a statistical model for topic prerogative feature-selection . the proposed method is specifically designed for multiple query example scenarios . the effectiveness of the proposed framework has been established with an extensive experimentation on trecvid2007 data-collection . the results reveal that our approach achieves a performance that is in par with the best results for this corpus without the requirement of any textual data .
