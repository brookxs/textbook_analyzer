effects of highly-agreed-documents in relevancy prediction finding significant contextual-features is a challenging task in the development of interactive-information-retrieval (ir) systems . this paper investigated a simple method to facilitate such a task by looking at aggregated relevance-judgements of retrieved documents . our study suggested that the agreement on relevance-judgements can indicate the effectiveness of retrieved documents as the source of significant features . the effect of highly-agreed-documents gives us practical implication for the design of adaptive-search models in interactive-ir systems .
