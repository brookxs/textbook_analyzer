retrieval and novelty-detection at the sentence-level previous research in novelty-detection has focused on the task of finding novel material , given a set or stream of documents on a certain topic . this study investigates the more difficult two-part task defined by the trec 2002 novelty track : given a topic and a group of documents relevant to that topic , 1) find the relevant-sentences from the documents , and 2) find the novel sentences from the collection of relevant-sentences . our research shows that the former step appears to be the more difficult part of this task , and that the performance of novelty measures is very sensitive to the presence of non-relevant sentences .
