viewser : enabling large-scale remote-user-studies of web-search examination and interaction web-search behaviour studies , including eye-tracking studies of search result examination , have resulted in numerous insights to improve search result quality and presentation . yet , eye-tracking studies have been restricted in scale , due to the expense and the effort required . furthermore , as the reach of the-web expands , it becomes increasingly important to understand how searchers around the world see and interact with the search-results . to address both challenges , we introduce viewser , a novel methodology for performing web-search examination studies remotely , at scale , and without requiring eye-tracking equipment . viewser operates by automatically modifying the appearance of a search-engine result page , to clearly show one search result at a time as if through a `` viewport '' , while partially blurring the rest and allowing the participant to move the viewport naturally with a computer mouse or trackpad . remarkably , the resulting result viewing and clickthrough patterns agree closely with unrestricted viewing of results , as measured by eye-tracking equipment , validated by a study with over 100 participants . we also explore applications of viewser to practical search tasks , such as analyzing the search result summary (snip - pet) attractiveness , result re-ranking , and evaluating snippet quality . these experiments could have only be done previously by tracking the eye-movements for a small number of subjects in the lab . in contrast , our study was performed with over 100 participants , allowing us to reproduce and extend previous findings , establishing viewser as a valuable tool for large-scale search-behavior experiments .
