here and there : goals , activities , and predictions about location from geotagged queries a significant portion of web-search is performed in mobile settings . we explore the links between users ' queries on mobile-devices and their locations and movement , with a focus on interpreting queries about addresses . we find that users tend to have a primary location , likely corresponding to home or workplace , and that a user 's location relative to this primary location systematically influences the patterns of address searches . we apply our findings to construct a statistical model that can predict with high accuracy whether a user will be soon observed at an address that had been recently retrieved via search . such an ability to predict that a user will transition to a location can be harnessed for multiple uses including provision of directions and traffic-information , the rendering of competitive advertising , and guiding the opportunistic completion of pending tasks that can be accomplished en route to a target location .
