the loquacious user : a document-independent source of terms for query-expansion in this paper we investigate the effectiveness of a document-independent technique for eliciting feedback from users about their information problems . we propose that such a technique can be used to elicit terms from users for use in query-expansion and as a follow-up when ambiguous-queries are initially posed by users . we design a feedback form to obtain additional-information from users , administer the form to users after initial querying , and create a series of experimental runs based on the information that we obtained from the form . results demonstrate that the form was successful at eliciting more information from users and that this additional-information significantly improved retrieval-performance . our results further demonstrate a strong relationship between query-length and performance .
