rewarding term location-information to enhance probabilistic-information-retrieval we investigate the effect of rewarding terms according to their locations in documents for probabilistic-information-retrieval . the intuition behind our approach is that a large amount of authors would summarize their ideas in some particular parts of documents . in this paper , we focus on the beginning part of documents . several shape-functions are defined to simulate the influence of term location-information . we propose a reward term retrieval-model that combines the reward terms ' information with bm25 to enhance probabilistic-information-retrieval performance .
