arsa : a sentiment-aware model for predicting sales performance using blogs due to its high popularity , weblogs (or blogs in short) present a wealth of information that can be very helpful in assessing the general public 's sentiments and opinions . in this paper , we study the problem of mining sentiment information from blogs and investigate ways to use such information for predicting product sales performance . based on an analysis of the complex nature of sentiments , we propose sentiment plsa (s-plsa) , in which a blog entry is viewed as a document generated by a number of hidden sentiment factors . training an s-plsa model on the blog-data enables us to obtain a succinct summary of the sentiment information embedded in the blogs . we then present arsa , an autoregressive sentiment-aware model , to utilize the sentiment information captured by s-plsa for predicting product sales performance . extensive experiments were conducted on a movie data-set . we compare arsa with alternative models that do not take into account the sentiment information , as well as a model with a different feature-selection-method . experiments confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach .
