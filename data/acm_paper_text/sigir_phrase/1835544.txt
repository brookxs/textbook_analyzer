estimating advertisability of tail-queries for sponsored-search sponsored-search is one of the major sources of revenue for search-engines on the world-wide-web . it has been observed that while showing ads for every query maximizes short-term revenue , irrelevant ads lead to poor user-experience and less revenue in the long-term . hence , it is in search-engines ' interest to place ads only for queries that are likely to attract ad-clicks . many algorithms for estimating query advertisability exist in literature , but most of these methods have been proposed for and tested on the frequent or `` head '' queries . since query frequencies on search-engine are known to be distributed as a power-law , this leaves a huge fraction of the queries uncovered . in this paper we focus on the more challenging problem of estimating query advertisability for infrequent or `` tail '' queries . these require fundamentally different methods than head queries : for e.g. , tail-queries are almost all unique and require the estimation-method to be online and inexpensive . we show that previously proposed methods do not apply to tail-queries , and when modified for our scenario they do not work well . further , we give a simple , yet effective , approach , which estimates query advertisability using only the words present in the queries . we evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset consisting of search-engine-queries and user-clicks . our results show that our simple approach outperforms a more complex one based on regularized regression .
