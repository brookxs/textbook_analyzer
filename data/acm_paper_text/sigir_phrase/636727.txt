a decision-theory approach to optimal automatic-indexing a decision-theory approach to the development of retrieval-systems is presented . within this framework , optimalindexing is defined . both the searching and the indexing problem turn out to have a common structure which is described using the concept of a ` recognition problem ' . a knowledge_based approach to an approximately optimalindexing , strictly related to the information-need of user is outlined . the theory and the used approximation-methods are illustrated by a brief description of wai/air projects and some of their results .
