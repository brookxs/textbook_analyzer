clusteringwiki : personalized and collaborative clustering of search-results how to organize and present search-results plays a critical role in the utility of search-engines . due to the unprecedented scale of the-web and diversity of search-results , the common strategy of ranked-lists has become increasingly inadequate , and clustering has been considered as a promising alternative . clustering divides a long list of disparate search-results into a few topic-coherent clusters , allowing the user to quickly locate relevant results by topic navigation . while many clustering-algorithms have been proposed that innovate on the automatic-clustering procedure , we introduce clusteringwiki , the first prototype and framework for personalized-clustering that allows direct user editing of clustering results . through a wiki interface , the user can edit and annotate the membership , structure and labels of clusters for a personalized presentation . in addition , the edits and annotations can be shared among users as a mass collaborative way of improving search-result-organization and search-engine utility .
