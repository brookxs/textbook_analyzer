the interactive-prp for diversifying document rankings the assumptions underlying the-probability-ranking-principle (prp) have led to a number of alternative approaches that cater or compensate for the prp 's limitations . in this poster we focus on the interactive-prp (iprp) , which rejects the assumption of independence between documents made by the prp . although the theoretical-framework of the iprp is appealing , no instantiation has been proposed and investigated . in this poster , we propose a possible instantiation of the principle , performing the first empirical-comparison of the iprp against the prp . for document diversification , our results show that the iprp is significantly better than the prp , and comparable to or better than other methods such as modern-portfolio-theory .
