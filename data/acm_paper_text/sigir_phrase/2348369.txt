online result-cache invalidation for real-time-web search caches of results are critical components of modern web-search-engines , since they enable lower response-time to frequent-queries and reduce the load to the search-engine backend . results in long-lived cache entries may become stale , however , as search-engines continuously update their index to incorporate changes to the-web . consequently , it is important to provide mechanisms that control the degree of staleness of cached results , ideally enabling the search-engine to always return fresh results . in this paper , we present a new mechanism that identifies and invalidates query results that have become stale in the cache online . the basic idea is to evaluate at query time and against recent changes if cache hits have had their results have changed . for enhancing invalidation efficiency , the generation time of cached queries and their chronological order with respect to the latest index update are used to early prune unaffected queries . we evaluate the proposed approach using documents that change over time and query-logs of the yahoo! search-engine . we show that the proposed approach ensures good query results (50 % fewer stale results) and high invalidation accuracy (90 % fewer unnecessary invalidations) compared to a baseline approach that makes invalidation decisions off-line . more importantly , the proposed approach induces less processing overhead , ensuring an average throughput 73 % higher than that of the baseline approach .
