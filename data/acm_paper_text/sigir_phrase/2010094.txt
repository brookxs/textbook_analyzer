product-comparison using comparative relations this paper proposes a novel product-comparison approach . the comparative relations between products are first mined from both user reviews on multiple review websites and community-based-question-answering pairs containing product-comparison information . a unified graph-model is then developed to integrate the resultant comparative relations for product-comparison . experiments on popular electronic products show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods .
