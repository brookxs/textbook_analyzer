topic-hierarchy construction for the organization of multi-source user-generated-contents user-generated-contents (ugcs) carry a huge amount of high quality information . however , the information-overload and diversity of ugc sources limit their potential uses . in this research , we propose a framework to organize information from multiple ugc sources by a topic-hierarchy which is automatically generated and updated using the ugcs . we explore the unique characteristics of ugcs like blogs , cqas , microblogs , etc. , and introduce a novel scheme to combine them . we also propose a graph-based-method to enable incremental-update of the generated topic-hierarchy . using the hierarchy , users can easily obtain a comprehensive , in-depth and up-to-date picture of their topics of interests . the experiment results demonstrate how information from multiple heterogeneous sources improves the resultant topic-hierarchies . it also shows that the proposed method achieves better f1 scores in hierarchy-generation as compared to the state-of-the-art methods .
