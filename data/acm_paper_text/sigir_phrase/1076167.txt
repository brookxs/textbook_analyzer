information-sharing through rational links and viewpoint-retrieval in this paper we present the concept of federated information sharing communities (fisc) , which leverages organisational and social-relationships with document-content to provide community-centred information-sharing and communication environments . prominence is given to capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people , their interests and inter-relationships . we focus on providing social-awareness `` in the large '' to help users understand the members within community and the relationships between them . within the fisc framework , we provide viewpoint-retrieval to enable a user to construct member-specific view (s) of the community , based on their various topic interests . as proof-of-concept , we present the first fisc prototype based on the twenty-five year sigir collection and examples of operational results .
