global resources for peer-to-peer text-retrieval the thesis presented in this paper tackles selected issues in unstructured peer-to-peer information-retrieval (p2pir) systems , using world-knowledge for solving p2pir problems . a first part uses so-called reference corpora for estimating global term-weights such as idf instead of sampling them from the distributed-collection . a second part of the work will be dedicated to the question of query-routing in unstructured p2pir systems using peer resource descriptions and world-knowledge for query-expansion .
