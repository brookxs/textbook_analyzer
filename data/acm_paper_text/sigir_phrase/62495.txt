an information-structure dealing with term dependance and polysemy an information-structure (is) that is regarded as a formal-description of a domain of discourse is proposed . this is is aimed at increasing the effectiveness of an information-retrieval-system . it is shown how the retrieval algorithm can take into account the term dependencies that are provided by the is . moreover , these term dependencies can be used by an automatic-indexing procedure in order to interpret polysemic terms . the theoretical-framework of our is has some favorable properties . as a consequence , the construction and maintenance of such an is is simpler than that of a thesaurus .
