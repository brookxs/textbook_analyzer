a scalability-analysis of classifiers in text-categorization real-world-applications of text-categorization often require a system to deal with tens of thousands of categories defined over a large taxonomy . this paper addresses the problem with respect to a set of popular algorithms in text-categorization , including support-vector-machines , k-nearest-neighbor , ridge-regression , linear-least-square fit and logistic-regression . by providing a formal-analysis of the computational-complexity of each classification-method , followed by an investigation on the usage of different classifiers in a hierarchical setting of categorization , we show how the scalability of a method depends on the topology of the hierarchy and the category distributions . in addition , we are able to obtain tight-bounds for the complexities by using the power-law to approximate category distributions over a hierarchy . experiments with knn and svm classifiers on the ohsumed corpus are reported on , as concrete examples .
