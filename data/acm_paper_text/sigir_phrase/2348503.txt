predicting lifespans of popular tweets in microblog in microblog like twitter , popular tweets are usually retweeted by many users . for different tweets , their lifespans (i.e. , how long they will stay popular) vary . this paper presents a simple yet effective approach to predict the lifespans of popular tweets based on their static characteristics and dynamic retweeting patterns . for a potentially popular tweet , we generate a time-series based on its first-hour retweeting information , and compare it with those of historic tweets of the same author and post time (at the granularity of hour) . the top-k historic tweets are identified , whose mean lifespan is estimated as the lifespan of the new tweet . our experiments on a three-month real-data set from tencent microblog demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach .
