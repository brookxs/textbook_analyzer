what-you-retrieve-is-what-you-see : a preliminary cyber-physical search-engine the cyber-physical-systems (cps) are envisioned as a class of real-time-systems integrating the computing , communication and storage facilities with monitoring and control of the physical-world . one interesting cps application in the mobile-internet is to provide web-search `` on the spot '' regarding the physical world that a user sees , or literally wyriwys (what-you-retrieve-is-what-you-see) . the objective of our work is to develop server/browser software for supporting wyriwys search in our prototype cyber-physical search-engine . a wyriwys search retrieves visible-web objects and ranks them by their cyber-physical relevances (term , visual , spatial , temporal etc.) . this work is distinguished from previous lws as it provides quality web-search geared with the physical world . therefore it suggests a very promising solution to cyber-physical web-search .
