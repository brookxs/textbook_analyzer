combining lvcsr and vocabulary-independent ranked-utterance-retrieval for robust speech search well tuned large-vocabulary-continuous-speech-recognition (lvcsr) has been shown to generally be more effective than vocabulary-independent techniques for ranked-retrieval of spoken-content when one or the other approach is used alone . tuning lvcsr systems to a topic domain can be costly , however , and the experiments in this paper show that out-of-vocabulary (oov) query terms can significantly reduce retrieval-effectiveness when that tuning is not performed . further experiments demonstrate , however , that retrieval-effectiveness for queries with oov-terms can be substantially improved by combining evidence from lvcsr with additional evidence from vocabulary-independent ranked-utterance-retrieval (rur) . the combination is performed by using relevance-judgments from held-out topics to learn generic (i.e. , topic-independent) , smooth , non-decreasing transformations from lvcsr and rur system scores to probabilities of topical-relevance . evaluated using a clef collection that includes topics , spontaneous-conversational-speech audio , and relevance-judgments , the system recovers 57 \ % of the mean uninterpolated average-precision that could have been obtained through lvcsr domain tuning for very short queries (or 41 \ % for longer queries) .
