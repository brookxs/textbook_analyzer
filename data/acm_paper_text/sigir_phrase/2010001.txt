handling data-sparsity in collaborative-filtering using emotion and semantic based features collaborative-filtering (cf) aims to recommend items based on prior user-interaction . despite their success , cf techniques do not handle data-sparsity well , especially in the case of the cold-start-problem where there is no past rating for an item . in this paper , we provide a framework , which is able to tackle such issues by considering item-related emotions and semantic data . in order to predict the rating of an item for a given user , this framework relies on an extension of latent-dirichlet-allocation , and on gradient boosted trees for the final prediction . we apply this framework to movie-recommendation and consider two emotion spaces extracted from the movie plot summary and the reviews , and three semantic-spaces : actor , director , and genre . experiments with the 100k and 1m movielens datasets show that including emotion and semantic-information significantly improves the accuracy of prediction and improves upon the state-of-the-art cf techniques . we also analyse the importance of each feature-space and describe some uncovered latent groups .
