an aspectual interface for supporting complex-search-tasks with the increasing importance of search systems on the-web , there is a continuing push to design interfaces which are a better match with the kinds of real-world tasks in which users are engaged . in this paper , we consider how broad , complex-search-tasks may be supported via the search-interface . in particular , we consider search-tasks which may be composed of multiple aspects , or multiple related subtasks . for example , in decision-making tasks the user may investigate multiple possible solutions before settling on a single , final solution , while other tasks , such as report writing , may involve searching on multiple interrelated topics . a search-interface is presented which is designed to support such broad search-tasks , allowing a user to create search aspects , each of which models an independent subtask of some larger task . the interface is built on the intuition that users should be able to structure their searching environment when engaged on complex-search-tasks , where the act of structuring and organization may aid the user in understanding his or her task . a user-study was carried out which compared our aspectual interface to a standard web-search interface . the results suggest that an aspectual interface can aid users when engaged in broad search-tasks where the search aspects must be identified during searching ; for a task where search aspects were pre-defined , no advantage over the baseline was found . results for a decision-making task were less clear cut , but show some evidence for improved task-performance .
