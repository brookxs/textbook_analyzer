on building a reusable twitter corpus the twitter real-time-information network is the subject of research for information-retrieval-tasks such as real-time-search . however , so far , reproducible experimentation on twitter data has been impeded by restrictions imposed by the twitter terms-of-service . in this paper , we detail a new methodology for legally building and distributing twitter corpora , developed through collaboration between the text-retrieval-conference (trec) and twitter . in particular , we detail how the first publicly available twitter corpus - referred to as tweets2011 - was distributed via lists of tweet identifiers and specialist tweet crawling software . furthermore , we analyse whether this distribution approach remains robust over time , as tweets in the corpus are removed either by users or twitter itself . tweets2011 was successfully used by 58 participating groups for the trec 2011 microblog track , while our results attest to the robustness of the crawling methodology over time .
