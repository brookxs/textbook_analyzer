swordfish : an unsupervised ngram_based approach to morphological-analysis extracting morphemes from words is a nontrivial task . rule-based stemming approaches such as porter 's algorithm have encountered some success , however they are restricted by their ability to identify a limited number of affixes and are language dependent . when dealing with languages with many affixes , rule-based approaches generally require many more rules to deal with all the possible word forms . deriving these rules requires a larger effort on the part of linguists and in some instances can be simply impractical . we propose an unsupervised ngram_based approach , named swordfish . using ngram probabilities in the corpus , possible morphemes are identified . we look at two possible methods for identifying candidate morphemes , one using joint probabilities between two ngrams , and the second based on log odds between prefix probabilities . initial results indicate the joint-probability approach to be better for english while the prefix ratio approach is better for finnish and turkish .
