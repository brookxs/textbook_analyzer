large-scale-graph-mining and learning for information-retrieval for many information-retrieval applications , we need to deal with the ranking problem on very-large scale graphs . however , it is non-trivial to perform efficient and effective ranking on them . on one aspect , we need to design scalable-algorithms . on another aspect , we also need to develop powerful computational infrastructure to support these algorithms . this tutorial aims at giving a timely introduction to the promising advances in the aforementioned aspects in recent years , and providing the audiences with a comprehensive view on the related literature .
