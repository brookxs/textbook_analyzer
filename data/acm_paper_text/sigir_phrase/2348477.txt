finding web appearances of social-network users via latent-factor-model with the rapid growing of web-2.0 , people spend more time on social-networks such as facebook and twitter . in order to know the people they are interacting with , finding the-web appearances of them will help the social-network users to a great extent . we propose a novel and effective latent-factor-model to find web appearances of target social-network users . our method solves the name-ambiguity problem by simultaneously exploring the link-structure of social-networks and the-web . experiments on real-world-data show the superiority of our method over several baselines .
