pruned query-evaluation using pre-computed impacts exhaustive evaluation of ranked-queries can be expensive , particularly when only a small subset of the overall ranking is required , or when queries contain common terms . this concern gives rise to techniques for dynamic-query-pruning , that is , methods for eliminating redundant parts of the usual exhaustive evaluation , yet still generating a demonstrably `` good enough '' set of answers to the query . in this work we propose new pruning methods that make use of impact-sorted-indexes . compared to exhaustive evaluation , the new methods reduce the amount of computation performed , reduce the amount of memory required for accumulators , reduce the amount of data transferred from disk , and at the same time allow performance-guarantees in terms of precision and mean-average-precision . these strong claims are backed by experiments using the trec terabyte collection and queries .
