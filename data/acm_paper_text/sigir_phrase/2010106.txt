a novel hybrid-index-structure for efficient text-retrieval query-processing with precomputed term pair lists can improve efficiency for some queries , but suffers from the quadratic number of index lists that need to be read . we present a novel hybrid-index-structure that aims at decreasing the number of index lists retrieved at query-processing time , trading-off a reduced number of index lists for an increased number of bytes to read . our experiments demonstrate significant cold-cache performance gains of almost 25 \ % on standard-benchmark queries .
