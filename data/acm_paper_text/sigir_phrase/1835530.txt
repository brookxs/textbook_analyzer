towards subjectifying text-clustering although it is common practice to produce only a single-clustering of a dataset , in many cases text-documents can be clustered along different dimensions . unfortunately , not only do traditional text-clustering algorithms fail to produce multiple-clusterings of a dataset , the only clustering they produce may not be the one that the user desires . in this paper , we propose a simple active-clustering algorithm that is capable of producing multiple-clusterings of the same data according to user-interest . in comparison to previous work on feedback-oriented clustering , the amount of user-feedback required by our algorithm is minimal . in fact , the feedback turns out to be as simple as a cursory look at a list of words . experimental-results are very promising : our system is able to generate clusterings along the user-specified dimensions with reasonable accuracies on several challenging text-classification tasks , thus providing suggestive evidence that our approach is viable .
