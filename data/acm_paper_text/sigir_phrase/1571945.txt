context-aware query-classification understanding users ` search-intent expressed through their search queries is crucial to web-search and online-advertisement . web-query-classification (qc) has been widely studied for this purpose . most previous qc algorithms classify individual queries without considering their context-information . however , as exemplified by the well-known example on query `` jaguar '' , many web-queries are short and ambiguous , whose real meanings are uncertain without the context-information . in this paper , we incorporate context-information into the problem of query-classification by using conditional-random-field (crf) models . in our approach , we use neighboring queries and their corresponding clicked urls (web-pages) in search-sessions as the context-information . we perform extensive experiments on real-world search-logs and validate the effectiveness and effciency of our approach . we show that we can improve the f1 score by 52 \ % as compared to other state-of-the-art baselines .
