to translate or not to translate ? query-translation is an important task in cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) aiming to translate queries into languages used in documents . the purpose of this paper is to investigate the necessity of translating query terms , which might differ from one term to another . some untranslated terms cause irreparable performance drop while others do not . we propose an approach to estimate the translation-probability of a query-term , which helps decide if it should be translated or not . the approach learns regression and classification-models based on a rich set of linguistic and statistical-properties of the term . experiments on ntcir-4 and ntcir-5 english-chinese clir tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve clir performance . an in-depth analysis is also provided for discussing the impact of untranslated out-of-vocabulary (oov) query terms and translation-quality of non-oov query terms on clir performance .
