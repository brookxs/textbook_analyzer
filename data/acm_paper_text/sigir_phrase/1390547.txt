an algorithm for text-categorization a novel and efficient-learning algorithm is proposed for the binary linear-classification problem . the algorithm is trained using the rocchio 's relevance-feedback technique and builds a classifier by the intermediate hyperplane of two common tangent hyperplanes for the given category and its complement . experimental-results presented are very encouraging and justify the need for further research .
