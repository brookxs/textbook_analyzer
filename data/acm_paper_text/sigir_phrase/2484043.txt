toward self-correcting search-engines : using underperforming queries to improve search search-engines receive queries with a broad range of different search-intents . however , they do not perform equally well for all queries . understanding where search-engines perform poorly is critical for improving their performance . in this paper , we present a method for automatically identifying poorly-performing query groups where a search-engine may not meet searcher needs . this allows us to create coherent query clusters that help-system design-ers generate actionable insights about necessary changes and helps learning-to-rank algorithms better learn relevance signals via spe-cialized rankers . the result is a framework capable of estimating dissatisfaction from web-search-logs and learning to improve per-formance for dissatisfied queries . through experimentation , we show that our method yields good quality groups that align with established retrieval-performance metrics . we also show that we can significantly improve retrieval-effectiveness via specialized rankers , and that coherent grouping of underperforming queries generated by our method is important in improving each group .
