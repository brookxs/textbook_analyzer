reciprocal rank fusion outperforms condorcet and individual rank learning-methods reciprocal rank fusion (rrf) , a simple method for combining the document rankings from multiple ir systems , consistently yields better results than any individual system , and better results than the standard method condorcet fuse . this result is demonstrated by using rrf to combine the results of several trec experiments , and to build a meta-learner that ranks the letor 3 dataset better than any previously reported method
