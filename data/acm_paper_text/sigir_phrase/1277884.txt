topic-segmentation using weighted lexical-links (wll) this paper presents two new approaches of lexical-chains for topic-segmentation using weighted lexical-chains (wlc) or weighted lexical-links (wll) between repeated occurrences of lemmas along the text . the main advantage of using these new approaches is the suppression of the empirical parameter called hiatus in lexical-chain processing . an evaluation according to the windowdiff measure on a large automatically built corpus shows slight improvements in wll compared to state-of-the-art methods based on lexical-chains .
