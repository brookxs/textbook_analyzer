domain-specific-information-retrieval using rcommenders the continuing increase in the volume of information available in our daily lives is creating ever greater challenges for people to find personally useful information . one approach used to addressing this problem is personalized-information-retrieval (pir) . pir systems collect a user 's personal-information from both implicit and explicit sources to build a user-profile with the objective of giving retrieval results which better meet their individual user-information-needs than a standard information-retrieval (ir) system . however , in many situations there may be no opportunity to learn about the specific interests of a user and build a personal model when this user is querying on a new topic , e.g. when a user-visits a museum or exhibition which is unrelated to their normal search-interests . under this condition , the experiences and behaviours of other previous users , who have made similar queries , could be used to build a model of user-behavior in this domain . my phd proposes to focus on the development of new and innovative methods of domain-specific-ir . my work seeks to combine recommender-algorithms trained using previous search behaviours from different searchers with a standard ranked ir method to form a domain-specific-ir model to improve the search-effectiveness for a user entering a query without personal prior search-history on this topic . the challenges for my work are : how to provide users better results ; how to train and evaluate the methods proposed in my work .
