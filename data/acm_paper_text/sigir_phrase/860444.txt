structured use of external-knowledge for event-based open-domain-question-answering one of the major problems in question-answering (qa) is that the queries are either too brief or often do not contain most relevant terms in the target corpus . in order to overcome this problem , our earlier work integrates external-knowledge extracted from the-web and wordnet to perform event-based-qa on the trec-11 task . this paper extends our approach to perform event-based-qa by uncovering the structure within the external-knowledge . the knowledge-structure loosely models different facets of qa events , and is used in conjunction with successive constraint-relaxation algorithm to achieve effective qa . our results obtained on trec-11 qa corpus indicate that the new approach is more effective and able to attain a confidence-weighted score of above 80 \ % .
