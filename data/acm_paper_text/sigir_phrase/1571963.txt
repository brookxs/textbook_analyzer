portfolio-theory of information-retrieval this paper studies document-ranking-under-uncertainty . it is tackled in a general situation where the relevance predictions of individual documents have uncertainty , and are dependent between each other . inspired by the modern-portfolio-theory , an economic-theory dealing with investment in financial-markets , we argue that ranking-under-uncertainty is not just about picking individual relevant documents , but about choosing the right combination of relevant documents . this motivates us to quantify a ranked list of documents on the basis of its expected overall relevance (mean) and its variance ; the latter serves as a measure of risk , which was rarely studied for document-ranking in the past . through the analysis of the mean and variance , we show that an optimal rank-order is the one that balancing the overall relevance (mean) of the ranked list against its risk level (variance) . based on this principle , we then derive an efficient document-ranking algorithm . it generalizes the well-known probability-ranking-principle (prp) by considering both the uncertainty of relevance predictions and correlations between retrieved documents . moreover , the benefit of diversification is mathematically quantified ; we show that diversifying documents is an effective way to reduce the risk of document-ranking . experimental-results in text-retrieval confirm performance .
