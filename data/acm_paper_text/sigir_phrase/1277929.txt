generative-modeling of persons and documents for expert-search in this paper we address the task of automatically finding an expert within the organization , known as the expert-search problem . we present the theoretically-based probabilistic-algorithm which models retrieved documents as mixtures of expert candidate language-models . experiments show that our approach outperforms existing theoretically sound solutions .
