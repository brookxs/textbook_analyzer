query-sampling for ranking-learning in web-search learning-to-rank has become a popular approach to build a ranking-model for web-search recently . based on our observation , the constitution of the training-set will greatly influence the performance of the learned ranking-model . meanwhile , the number of queries in web-search is nearly infinite and the human labeling-cost is expensive , hence a subset of queries need to be carefully selected for training . in this paper , we develop a greedy-algorithm to sample the queries , by simultaneously taking the query density , difficulty and diversity into consideration . the experimental-results on a collected web-search dataset comprising 2024 queries show that the proposed method can lead to a more informative training-set for building an effective model .
