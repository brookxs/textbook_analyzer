towards a probabilistic modal-logic for semantic-based-information-retrieval semantic-based approaches to information-retrieval make a query-evaluation similar to an inference-process based on semantic-relations . semantic-based approaches find out hidden semantic-relationships between a document and a query , but quantitative estimation of the correspondence between them is often empiric . on the other hand , probabilistic-approaches usually consider only statistical relationships between terms . it is expected that improvement may be brought by integrating these two approaches . this paper demonstrates , using some particular probabilistic-models which are strongly related to modal-logic , that such an integration is feasible and natural . a new model is developed on the basis of an extended modal-logic . it has the advantages of : (1) augmenting a semantic-based approach with a probabilistic measurement , and (2) augmenting a probabilistic-approach with finer semantic-relations than just statistical ones . it is shown that this model verifies most of the conditions for an absolute probability-function .
