classification of source-code archives the world-wide-web contains a number of source-code archives . programs are usually classified into various categories within the archive by hand . we report on experiments for automatic-classification of source-code into these categories . we examined a number of factors that affect classification-accuracy . weighting features by expected entropy-loss makes a significant improvement in classification-accuracy . we show a support-vector-machine can be trained to classify source-code with a high degree of accuracy . we feel these results show promise for software-reuse .
