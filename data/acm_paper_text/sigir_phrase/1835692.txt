leveraging user-generated-content for news-search over the last few years both availability and accessibility of current news stories on the web have dramatically improved . in particular , users can now access news from a variety of sources hosted on the web , from newswire presences such as the new york times , to integrated news-search within web-search-engines . however , of central interest is the emerging impact that user-generated-content (ugc) is having on this online-news landscape . indeed , the emergence of web-2.0 has turned a static news consumer base into a dynamic news machine , where news stories are summarised and commented upon . in summary , value is being added to each news story in terms of additional-content . importantly , however , while there has been movement in commercial circles to exploit this extra value to enrich online-news , there has been little research from the academic community on how can be achieved . indeed , the main purpose of this thesis is to research practical-techniques for the integration of ugc to improve the news-search component of the most ubiquitous of web tools , i.e the-web search-engine .
