unity : relevance-feedback using user-query-logs the exponential growth of the-web and the increasing ability of web-search-engines to index data have led to a problem of plenty . the number of results returned per query is typically in the order of millions of documents for many common queries . although there is the benefit of added coverage for every query , the problem of ranking these documents and giving the best results gets worse . the problem is even more difficult in case of temporal and ambiguous-queries . we try to address this problem using feedback from user-query-logs . we leverage a technology called units for generating query-refinements which are shown as also try queries on yahoo! search . we consider these refinements as sub-concepts which help define user-intent and use them to improve search-relevance . the results obtained via live testing on yahoo! search are encouraging .
