faster and smaller inverted-indices with treaps we introduce a new representation of the inverted-index that performs faster ranked unions and intersections while using less space . our index is based on the treap data-structure , which allows us to intersect/merge the document identifiers while simultaneously thresholding by frequency , instead of the costlier two-step classical processing methods . to achieve compression we represent the treap topology using compact-data-structures . further , the treap invariants allow us to elegantly encode differentially both document identifiers and frequencies . results show that our index uses about 20 % less space , and performs queries up to three times faster , than state-of-the-art compact representations .
