predicting users ' domain-knowledge from search-behaviors this study uses regression-modeling to predict a user 's domain-knowledge level (dk) from implicit evidence provided by certain search-behaviors . a user-study (n = 35) with recall-oriented search-tasks in the genomic domain was conducted . a number of regression-models of a person 's dk , were generated using different behavior variable-selection methods . the best model highlights three behavior variables as dk predictors : the number of documents saved , the average query-length , and the average ranking position of documents opened . the model is validated using the split sampling-method . limitations and future-research directions are discussed .
