full-text-indexing based on lexical-relations an application : software-libraries in contrast to other kinds of libraries , software-libraries need to be conceptually organized . when looking for a component , the main concern of users is the functionality of the desired component ; implementation details are secondary . software-reuse would be enhanced with conceptually organized large libraries of software-components . in this paper , we present guru , a tool that allows automatical building of such large software libraries from documented software-components . we focus here on guru 's indexing component which extracts conceptual attributes from natural-language documentation . this indexing-method is based on words ' co-occurrences . it first uses extract , a co-occurrence knowledge compiler for extracting potential attributes from textual-documents . conceptually relevant collocations are then selected according to their resolving power , which scales down the noise due to context-words . this fully automated-indexing tool thus goes further than keyword-based tools in the understanding of a document without the brittleness of knowledge_based tools . the indexing component of guru is fully implemented , and some results are given in the paper .
