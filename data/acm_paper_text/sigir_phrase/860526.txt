discovering and structuring information-flow among bioinformatics resources in this poster , we present a model of the flow of information among bioinformatics resources in the context of a specific scientific problem . combining task-analysis with traditional , qualitative-research , we determined the extent to which the bioinformatics analysis-process could be automated . the model represents a semi-automated process , involving fourteen distinct data-processing steps , and forms the framework for an-interface to bioinformatics information .
