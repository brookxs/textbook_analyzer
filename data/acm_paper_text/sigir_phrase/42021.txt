optimal determination of user-oriented clusters user-oriented clustering schemes enable the classification of documents based upon the user-perception of the similarity between documents , rather than on some similarity-function presumed by the designer to represent the user criteria . in this paper , an enhancement of such a clustering scheme is presented . this is accomplished by the formulation of the user-oriented clustering as a function-optimization problem . the problem formulated is termed the boundary selection-problem (bsp) . heuristic approaches to solve the bsp are proposed and a preliminary for evaluation of these approaches is provided .
