language-model-based pro/con classification of political text given a controversial political topic , our aim is to classify documents debating the topic into pro or con . our approach extracts topic related terms , pro/con related terms , and pairs of topic related and pro/con related terms and uses them as the basis for constructing a pro query and a con query . following standard lm techniques , a document is classified as pro or con depending on which of the query likelihoods is higher for the document . our experiments show that our approach is promising .
