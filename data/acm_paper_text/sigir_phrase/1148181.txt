formal-models for expert-finding in enterprise corpora searching an organization 's document-repositories for experts provides a cost effective solution for the task of expert-finding . we present two general strategies to expert-searching given a document-collection which are formalized using generative probabilistic models . the first of these directly models an expert 's knowledge based on the documents that they are associated with , whilst the second locates documents on topic , and then finds the associated expert . forming reliable associations is crucial to the performance of expert-finding systems . consequently , in our evaluation we compare the different approaches , exploring a variety of associations along with other operational parameters (such as topicality) . using the trec enterprise corpora , we show that the second strategy consistently outperforms the first . a comparison against other unsupervised techniques , reveals that our second model delivers excellent performance .
