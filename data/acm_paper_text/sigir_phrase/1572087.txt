incorporating-prior-knowledge into a transductive ranking-algorithm for multi-document-summarization this paper presents a transductive approach to learn ranking-functions for extractive multi-document-summarization . at the first stage , the proposed approach identifies topic-themes within a document-collection , which help to identify two sets of relevant and irrelevant sentences to a question . it then iteratively trains a ranking-function over these two sets of sentences by optimizing a ranking loss and fitting a prior model built on keywords . the output of the function is used to find further relevant and irrelevant sentences . this process is repeated until a desired stopping-criterion is met .
