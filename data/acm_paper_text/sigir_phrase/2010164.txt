the trec-files : the (ground) truth is out there traditional tools for information-retrieval (ir) evaluation , such as trec 's trec_eval , have outdated command-line-interfaces with many unused features , or ` switches ' , accumulated over the years . they are usually seen as cumbersome applications by new ir researchers , steepening the learning-curve . we introduce a platform-independent application for ir-evaluation with a graphical easy-to-use interface : the trec_files evaluator . the application supports most of the standard measures used for evaluation in trec , clef , and elsewhere , such as map , p10 , p20 , and bpref , as well as the averaged normalized modified retrieval rank (anmrr) proposed by mpeg for image-retrieval evaluation . additional features include a batch mode and statistical-significance-testing of the results against a pre-selected baseline .
