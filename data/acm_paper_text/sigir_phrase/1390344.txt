enhancing web-search by promoting multiple search-engine use any given web-search-engine may provide higher quality results than others for certain queries . therefore , it is in users ' best interest to utilize multiple search-engines . in this paper , we propose and evaluate a framework that maximizes users ' search effective-ness by directing them to the engine that yields the best results for the current query . in contrast to prior work on meta-search , we do not advocate for replacement of multiple engines with an aggregate one , but rather facilitate simultaneous use of individual engines . we describe a machine-learning-approach to supporting switching between search-engines and demonstrate its viability at tolerable interruption levels . our findings have implications for fluid competition between search-engines .
