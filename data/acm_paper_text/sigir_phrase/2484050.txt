aggregated-search interface preferences in multi-session search-tasks aggregated-search interfaces provide users with an overview of results from various sources . two general types of display exist : tabbed , with access to each source in a separate tab , and blended , which combines multiple sources into a single result page . multi-session search-tasks , e.g. , a research project , consist of multiple stages , each with its own sub-tasks . several factors involved in multi-session search-tasks have been found to influence user-search-behavior . we investigate whether user-preference for source presentation changes during a multi-session search-task . the dynamic nature of multi-session search-tasks makes the design of a controlled-experiment a non-trivial challenge . we adopt a methodology based on triangulation and conduct two types of observational-study : a longitudinal-study and a laboratory study . in the longitudinal-study we follow the use of tabbed and blended displays by 25 students during a project . we find that while a tabbed display is used more than a blended display , subjects repeatedly switch between displays during the project . use of the tabbed display is motivated by a need to zoom in on a specific source , while the blended display is used to explore available material across sources whenever the information-need changes . in a laboratory study 44 students completed a multi-session search-task composed of three sub-tasks , the first with a tabbed display , the second and third with blended displays . the tasks were manipulated by either providing three task about the same topic or about three different topics . we find that a stable information-need over multiple sub-tasks negatively influences perceived-usability of the blended displays , while we do not find an influence when the information-need changes .
