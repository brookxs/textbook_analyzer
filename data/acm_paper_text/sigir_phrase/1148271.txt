news to go : hierarchical-text-summarization for mobile-devices we present an evaluation of a novel hierarchical-text-summarization method that allows users to view summaries of web-documents from small , mobile-devices . unlike previous approaches , ours does not require the documents to be in html since it infers a hierarchical-structure automatically . currently , the method is used to summarize news-articles sent to a web mail account in plain-text format . subjects used a web-enabled mobile-phone emulator to access the account 's inbox and view the summarized news-articles . they then used the summaries to complete several information-seeking tasks , which involved answering factual questions about the stories . in comparing the hierarchical text summary setting to that in which subjects were given the full text articles , there was no significant difference in task accuracy or the time taken to complete the task . however , in the hierarchical-summarization setting , the number of bytes transferred per user request is less than half that of the full text case . finally , in comparing the new method to three other summarization methods , subjects achieved significantly better accuracy on the tasks when using hierarchical summaries .
