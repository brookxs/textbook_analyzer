topic (query) selection for ir-evaluation the need for evaluating large amounts of topics (queries) makes ir-evaluation an uneasy task . in this paper , we study a topic-selection problem for ir-evaluation . the selection criterion is based on the overall difficulty of the chosen set , as well as the uncertainty of the final ir metric applied to the systems . our preliminary experiments demonstrate that our approach helps to identify a set of topics that provides confident estimates of systems ' performance while keeping the requirement of the query-difficulty .
