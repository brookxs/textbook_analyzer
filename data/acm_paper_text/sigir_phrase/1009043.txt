learning phonetic similarity for matching named-entity translations and mining new translations we propose a novel named-entity matching model which considers both semantic and phonetic clues . the matching is formulated as an optimization-problem . one major component is a phonetic-matching model which exploits similarity at the phoneme level . we investigate three learning-algorithms for obtaining the similarity information of basic phoneme units based on training-examples . by applying this proposed named-entity matching model , we also develop a mining framework for discovering new , unseen named-entity translations from online daily web-news . this framework harvests comparable news in different languages using an existing bilingual-dictionary . it is able to discover new name translations not found in the dictionary .
