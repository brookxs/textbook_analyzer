see-to-retrieve : efficient processing of spatio-visual keyword-queries the wide proliferation of powerful smart-phones equipped with multiple-sensors , 3d graphical engine , and 3g connection has nurtured the creation of a new spectrum of visual mobile-applications . these applications require novel data retrieval techniques which we call what-you-retrieve-is-what-you-see (wyriwys) . however , state-of-the-art spatial retrieval-methods are mostly distance-based and thus inapplicable for supporting wyriwys . motivated by this problem , we propose a novel query called spatio-visual keyword (svk) query , to support retrieving spatial web objects that are both visually conspicuous and semantically relevant to the user . to capture the visual-features of spatial web objects with extents , we introduce a novel visibility metric which computes object visibility in a cumulative manner . we propose an incremental method called complete occlusion-map_based retrieval (cor) to answer svk queries . this method exploits effective heuristics to prune the search-space and construct a data-structure called occlusion-map . then the method adopts the best-first-strategy to return relevant objects incrementally . extensive experiments on real and synthetic-data sets suggest that our method is effective and efficient when processing svk queries .
