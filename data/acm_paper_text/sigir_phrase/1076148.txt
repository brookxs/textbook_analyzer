relation between plsa and nmf and implications non-negative-matrix-factorization (nmf , [5]) and probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis (plsa , [4]) have been successfully applied to a number of text-analysis tasks such as document-clustering . despite their different inspirations , both methods are instances of multinomial pca [1] . we further explore this relationship and first show that plsa solves the problem of nmf with kl-divergence , and then explore the implications of this relationship .
