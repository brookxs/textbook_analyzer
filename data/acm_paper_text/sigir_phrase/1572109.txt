personalized music emotion-recognition in recent years , there has been a dramatic proliferation of research on information-retrieval based on highly subjective concepts such as emotion , preference and aesthetic . such retrieval-methods are fascinating but challenging since it is difficult to built a general retrieval-model that performs equally well to everyone . in this paper , we propose two novel methods , bag-of-users model and residual modeling , to accommodate the individual-differences for emotion-based music-retrieval . the proposed methods are intuitive and generally applicable to other information-retrieval-tasks that involve subjective-perception . evaluation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods .
