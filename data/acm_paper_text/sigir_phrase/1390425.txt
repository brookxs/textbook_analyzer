social-tag prediction in this paper , we look at the `` social-tag prediction '' problem . given a set of objects , and a set of tags applied to those objects by users , can we predict whether a given tag could/should be applied to a particular object ? we investigated this question using one of the largest crawls of the social-bookmarking-system del.icio.us gathered to date . for urls in del.icio.us , we predicted tags based on page text , anchor-text , surrounding hosts , and other tags applied to the url . we found an entropy-based metric which captures the generality of a particular tag and informs an analysis of how well that tag can be predicted . we also found that tag-based association-rules can produce very high-precision predictions as well as giving deeper understanding into the relationships between tags . our results have implications for both the study of tagging-systems as potential information-retrieval tools , and for the design of such systems .
