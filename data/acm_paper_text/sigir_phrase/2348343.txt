task-complexity , vertical-display and user-interaction in aggregated-search aggregated-search is the task of blending results from specialized-search services or verticals into the-web search-results . while many studies have focused on aggregated-search techniques , few studies have tried to better understand how users interact with aggregated-search results . this study investigates how task-complexity and vertical-display (the blending of vertical results into the-web results) affect the use of vertical content . twenty-nine subjects completed six search-tasks of varying levels of task-complexity using two aggregated-search interfaces : one that blended vertical results into the-web results and one that only provided indirect vertical access . our results show that more complex-tasks required significantly more interaction and that subjects completing these tasks examined more vertical results . while the amount of interaction was the same between interfaces , subjects clicked on more vertical results when these were blended into the-web results . our results also show an interaction between task-complexity and vertical-display ; subjects clicked on more verticals when completing the more complex-tasks with the interface that blended vertical results . subjects ' evaluations of the two interfaces were nearly identical , but when analyzed with respect to their interface preferences , we found a positive relationship between system evaluations and individual preferences . subjects justified their preference using similar rationales and their comments illustrate how the display itself can influence judgments of information-quality , especially in cases when the vertical results might not be relevant to the search-task .
