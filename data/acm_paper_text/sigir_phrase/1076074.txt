optimization strategies for complex-queries previous research into the efficiency of text-retrieval-systems has dealt primarily with methods that consider inverted-lists in sequence ; these methods are known as term-at-a-time methods . however , the literature for optimizing document-at-a-time systems remains sparse.we present an improvement to the max_score optimization , which is the most efficient known document-at-a-time scoring-method . like max_score , our technique , called term bounded max_score , is guaranteed to return exactly the same scores and documents as an unoptimized evaluation , which is particularly useful for query-model research . we simulated our technique to explore the problem-space , then implemented it in indri , our large-scale language-modeling search-engine . tests with the gov2 corpus on title queries show our method to be 23 \ % faster than max_score alone , and 61 \ % faster than our document-at-a-time baseline . our optimized query times are competitive with conventional term-at-a-time systems on this year 's trec terabyte task .
