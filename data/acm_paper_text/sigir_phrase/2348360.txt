social-network-analysis using topic-models in this paper , we discuss how we can extend probabilistic-topic-models to analyze the relationship-graph of popular social-network data , so that we can group or label the edges and nodes in the graph-based on their topic similarity . in particular , we first apply the well-known latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) model and its existing variants to the graph-labeling task and argue that the existing models do not handle popular nodes (nodes with many incoming edges) in the graph very well . we then propose possible extensions to this model to deal with popular nodes . our experiments show that the proposed extensions are very effective in labeling popular nodes , showing significant improvements over the existing methods . our proposed methods can be used for providing , for instance , more relevant friend-recommendations within a social-network .
