on evaluating web-search with very few relevant documents many common web-searches by their nature have a very small number of relevant documents . homepage and `` namedpage '' searching are known-item searches where there is only a single relevant-document . topic-distillation is a special kind of topical-relevance search where the user wishes to find a few key web-sites rather than every relevant-web page . because these types of searches are so common , web-search evaluations have come to focus on tasks where there are very few relevant documents . evaluations with few relevant documents pose special challenges for current metrics . in particular , the trec 2003 topic-distillation evaluation is unable to distinguish most submitted runs from each other .
