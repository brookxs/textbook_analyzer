adaptation of offline vertical-selection predictions in the presence of user-feedback web-search-results often integrate content from specialized-corpora known as verticals . given a query , one important aspect of aggregated-search is the selection of relevant verticals from a set of candidate verticals . one drawback to previous approaches to vertical-selection is that methods have not explicitly modeled user-feedback . however , production search systems often record a variety of feedback information . in this paper , we present algorithms for vertical-selection which adapt to user-feedback . we evaluate algorithms using a novel simulator which models performance of a vertical selector situated in realistic query traffic .
