local-approximation of pagerank and reverse-pagerank we consider the problem of approximating the pagerank of a target node using only local-information provided by a link-server . we prove that local-approximation of pagerank is feasible if-and-only-if the graph has low in-degree and admits fast pagerank convergence . while natural graphs , such as the-web graph , are abundant with high in-degree nodes , making local pagerank approximation too costly , we show that reverse natural graphs tend to have low indegree while maintaining fast pagerank convergence . it follows that calculating reverse-pagerank locally is frequently more feasible than computing pagerank locally . finally , we demonstrate the usefulness of reverse-pagerank in five different applications .
