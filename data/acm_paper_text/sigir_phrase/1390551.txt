relational distance-based collaborative-filtering in this paper , we present a novel hybrid-recommender-system called relationalcf , which integrate content and demographic information into a collaborative-filtering framework by using relational-distance computation approaches without the effort of form transformation and feature-construction . our experiments suggest that the effective combination of various kinds of information based on relational-distance approaches provides improved accurate recommendations than other approaches .
