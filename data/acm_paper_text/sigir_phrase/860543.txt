rule-based word clustering for text-classification this paper introduces a rule-based , context-dependent word clustering-method , with the rules derived from various domain databases and the word text orthographic properties . besides significant dimensionality-reduction , our experiments show that such rule-based word clustering improves by 8 the overall accuracy of extracting bibliographic fields from references , and by 18.32 on average the class-specific performance on the line classification of document headers .
