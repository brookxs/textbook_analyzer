do user-preferences and evaluation-measures line up ? this paper presents results comparing user-preference for search-engine rankings with measures-of-effectiveness computed from a test-collection . it establishes that preferences and evaluation-measures correlate : systems measured as better on a test-collection are preferred by users . this correlation is established for both `` conventional web-retrieval '' and for retrieval that emphasizes diverse results . the ndcg measure is found to correlate best with user-preferences compared to a selection of other well known measures . unlike previous studies in this area , this examination involved a large population of users , gathered through crowd-sourcing , exposed to a wide range of retrieval-systems , test-collections and search-tasks . reasons for user-preferences were also gathered and analyzed . the work revealed a number of new results , but also showed that there is much scope for future work refining effectiveness-measures to better capture user-preferences .
