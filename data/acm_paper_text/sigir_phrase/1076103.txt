question-answering passage-retrieval using dependency-relations state-of-the-art question-answering (qa) systems employ term-density ranking to retrieve answer passages . such methods often retrieve incorrect passages as-relationships among question terms are not considered . previous studies attempted to address this problem by matching-dependency relations between questions-and-answers . they used strict matching , which fails when semantically equivalent relationships are phrased differently . we propose fuzzy relation-matching based on statistical-models . we present two methods for learning relation-mapping scores from past qa-pairs : one based on mutual-information and the other on expectation-maximization . experimental-results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art density-based passage-retrieval methods by up to 78 \ % in mean reciprocal rank . relation-matching also brings about a 50 \ % improvement in a system enhanced by query-expansion .
