generalizing pagerank : damping functions for link-based-ranking algorithms this paper introduces a family of link-based-ranking algorithms that propagate page-importance through links . in these algorithms there is a damping function that decreases with distance , so a direct link implies more endorsement than a link through a long path . pagerank is the most widely known ranking-function of this family.the main objective of this paper is to determine whether this family of ranking-techniques has some interest per se , and how different choices for the damping function impact on rank quality and on convergence-speed . even though our results suggest that pagerank can be approximated with other simpler forms of rankings that may be computed more efficiently , our focus is of more speculative nature , in that it aims at separating the kernel of pagerank , that is , link-based importance propagation , from the way propagation decays over paths.we focus on three damping functions , having linear , exponential , and hyperbolic decay on the lengths of the paths . the exponential decay corresponds to pagerank , and the other functions are new . our presentation includes algorithms , analysis , comparisons and experiments that study their behavior under different parameters in real web-graph data.among other results , we show how to calculate a linear approximation that induces a page ordering that is almost identical to pagerank 's using a fixed small number of iterations ; comparisons were performed using kendall 's ? on large domain datasets .
