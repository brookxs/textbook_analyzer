bloggers as experts : feed-distillation using expert-retrieval models we address the task of (blog) feed-distillation : to find blogs that are principally devoted to a given topic . the task may be viewed as an association finding task , between topics and bloggers . under this view , it resembles the expert-finding task , for which a range of models have been proposed . we adopt two language modeling-based approaches to expert-finding , and determine their effectiveness as feed-distillation strategies . the two models capture the idea that a human will often search for key blogs by spotting highly relevant posts (the posting model) or by taking global aspects of the blog into account (the blogger model) . results show the blogger model outperforms the posting model and delivers state-of-the art performance , out-of-the-box .
