exploration of a heuristic-approach to threshold learning in adaptive-filtering (poster session) in this paper we examine the learning behavior of a heuristic threshold setting approach to information-filtering . in particular , we study how different initial threshold settings and different updating parameter-settings affect threshold learning . the results on one of the trec news databases indicate that (1) learning allows recovery from the inevitable non-optimality of the initial conditions , and (2) a greater willingness to learn (expressed by a deliberate lowering of the score threshold in the learning stage) does eventually lead to a higher performance in spite of the expected initial performance penalty .
