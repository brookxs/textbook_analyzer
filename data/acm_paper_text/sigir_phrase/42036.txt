towards an expert-system for bibliographical retrieval : a prolog prototype a prototype prolog system has been developed for online bibliographic retrieval . most online bibliographic retrieval-systems may be characterized by queries based on the occurrence of keywords and by databases consisting of possibly millions of records . such systems have very fast response-times but generally lack any deductive-reasoning capability . an expert-system for online bibliographic retrieval , developed in prolog , would provide enhanced retrieval capabilities through the application of deductive-reasoning . such a system would permit knowledge-type queries to be asked in addition to the traditional keyword-type of queries . a concern with using prolog to perform an online-search of a million-record data-base is that the response-time would be unacceptable . in order to overcome this drawback two alternatives are examined : a special-purpose-hardware device and an extended prolog capability .
