mining multimedia salient concepts for incremental information-extraction we propose a novel algorithm for extracting information by mining the feature-space clusters and then assigning salient concepts to them . bayesian techniques for extracting concepts from multimedia usually suffer either from lack of data or from too complex concepts to be represented by a single statistical-model . an incremental information-extraction approach , working at different levels-of-abstraction , would be able to handle concepts of varying complexities . we present the results of our research on the initial part of an incremental-approach , the extraction of the most salient concepts from multimedia-information .
