multi-label informed latent-semantic-indexing latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) is a well-known unsupervised-approach for dimensionality-reduction in information-retrieval . however if the output information (i.e. category labels) is available , it is often beneficial to derive the indexing not only based on the inputs but also on the target values in the training-data-set . this is of particular importance in applications with multiple labels , in which each document can belong to several categories simultaneously . in this paper we introduce the multi-label informed latent-semantic-indexing (mlsi) algorithm which preserves the information of inputs and meanwhile captures the correlations between the multiple outputs . the recovered `` latent semantics '' thus incorporate the human-annotated category-information and can be used to greatly improve the prediction-accuracy . empirical-study based on two data-sets , reuters-21578 and rcv1 , demonstrates very encouraging results .
