where to start reading a textual xml-document ? in structured-information-retrieval , the aim is to exploit document-structure to retrieve relevant components , allowing the user to go straight to the relevant material . this paper looks at the so-called best-entry-points (beps) , which are intended to give the user the best starting point to access the relevant-information in the document . we examine the relationship between beps and relevant components in the inex 2006 ad-hoc assessments . our main findings are the following : first , although documents are short , assessors often choose the best-entry-point some distance from the start of the document . second , many of the best-entry-points coincide with the first relevant character in relevant documents , showing a strong relation between the bep and relevant text . third , we find browsing beps in articles with a single relevant passages , and container beps or context beps in articles with more relevant passages .
