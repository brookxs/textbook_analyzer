modeling click-through based word-pairs for web-search statistical-translation models and latent-semantic-analysis (lsa) are two effective approaches to exploiting click-through-data for web-search-ranking . while the former learns semantic-relationships between query terms and document terms directly , the latter maps a document and the queries for which it has been clicked to vectors in a lower dimensional semantic-space . this paper presents two document-ranking models that combine the strengths of both the approaches by explicitly modeling word-pairs . the first model , called pairmodel , is a monolingual ranking-model based on word-pairs derived from click-through-data . it maps queries and documents into a concept-space spanned by these word-pairs . the second model , called bilingual paired topic-model (bptm) , uses bilingual word translations and can jointly model query-document collections written in multiple languages . this model uses topics to capture term dependencies and maps queries and documents in multiple languages into a lower dimensional semantic sub-space spanned by the topics . these models are evaluated on the web-search-task using real-world data-sets in three different languages . results show that they consistently outperform various state-of-the-art baseline models , and the best result is obtained by interpolating pairmodel and bptm .
