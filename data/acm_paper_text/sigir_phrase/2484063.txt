pseudo test-collections for training and tuning microblog rankers recent years have witnessed a persistent interest in generating pseudo test-collections , both for training and evaluation purposes . we describe a method for generating queries and relevance-judgments for microblog search in an unsupervised way . our starting point is this intuition : tweets with a hashtag are relevant to the topic covered by the hashtag and hence to a suitable query derived from the hashtag . our baseline method selects all commonly used hashtags , and all associated tweets as relevance-judgments ; we then generate a query from these tweets . next , we generate a timestamp for each query , allowing us to use temporal-information in the training-process . we then enrich the generation-process with knowledge derived from an editorial test-collection for microblog search . we use our pseudo test-collections in two ways . first , we tune parameters of a variety of well known retrieval-methods on them . correlations with parameter-sweeps on an editorial test-collection are high on average , with a large variance over retrieval algorithms . second , we use the pseudo test-collections as training-sets in a learning-to-rank scenario . performance close to training on an editorial test-collection is achieved in many cases . our results demonstrate the utility of tuning and training microblog search-algorithms on automatically generated training-material .
