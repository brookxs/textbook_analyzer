mining the blogosphere for top-news-stories-identification the analysis of query-logs from blog-search engines show that news-related queries occupy a significant portion of the logs . this raises a interesting research question on whether the blogosphere can be used to identify important news stories . in this paper , we present novel approaches to identify important news story headlines from the blogosphere for a given day . the proposed system consists of two components based on the language-model framework , the query likelihood and the news headline prior . for the query likelihood , we propose several approaches to estimate the query-language-model and the news headline language-model . we also suggest several criteria to evaluate the news headline prior that is the prior belief about the importance or newsworthiness of the news headline for a given day . experimental-results show that our system significantly outperforms a baseline system . specifically , the proposed approach gives 2.62 \ % and 10.19 \ % further increases in map and p@5 over the best performing result of the trec '09 top stories identification-task .
