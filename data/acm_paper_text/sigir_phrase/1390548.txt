hypergraph-partitioning for document-clustering : a unified clique perspective hypergraph-partitioning has been considered as a promising method to address the challenges of high-dimensionality in document-clustering . with documents modeled as vertices and the relationship among documents captured by the hyperedges , the goal of graph-partitioning is to minimize the edge cut . therefore , the definition of hyperedges is vital to the clustering performance . while several definitions of hyperedges have been proposed , a systematic understanding of desired characteristics of hyperedges is still missing . to that end , in this paper , we first provide a unified clique perspective of the definition of hyperedges , which serves as a guide to define hyperedges . with this perspective , based on the concepts of hypercliques and shared (reverse) nearest-neighbors , we propose three new types of clique hyperedges and analyze their properties regarding purity and size issues . finally , we present an extensive evaluation using real-world document datasets . the experimental-results show that , with shared (reverse) nearest-neighbor_based hyperedges , the clustering performance can be improved significantly in terms of various external validation measures without the need for fine-tuning of parameters .
