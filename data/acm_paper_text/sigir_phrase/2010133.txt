detecting success in mobile-search from interaction predicting searcher success and satisfaction is a key problem in web-search , which is essential for automatic evaluating and improving search-engine-performance . this problem has been studied actively in the desktop-search setting , but not specifically for mobile-search , despite many known differences between the two modalities . as mobile-devices become increasingly popular for searching the-web , improving the searcher experience on such devices is becoming crucially important . in this paper , we explore the possibility of predicting searcher success and satisfaction in mobile-search with a smart-phone . specifically , we investigate client-side interaction signals , including the number of browsed pages , and touch screen-specific actions such as zooming and sliding . exploiting this information with machine-learning-techniques results in nearly 80 \ % accuracy for predicting searcher success -- significantly outperforming the previous models .
