high-accuracy-retrieval with multiple nested ranker high precision at the top ranks has become a new focus of research in information-retrieval . this paper presents the multiple nested ranker approach that improves the accuracy at the top ranks by iteratively re-ranking the top scoring documents . at each iteration , this approach uses the ranknet learning-algorithm to re-rank a subset of the results . this splits the problem into smaller and easier tasks and generates a new distribution of the results to be learned by the algorithm . we evaluate this approach using different settings on a data-set labeled with several degrees of relevance . we use the normalized-discounted-cumulative-gain (ndcg) to measure the performance because it depends not only on the position but also on the relevance score of the document in the ranked list . our experiments show that making the learning-algorithm concentrate on the top scoring results improves precision at the top ten documents in terms of the ndcg score .
