the importance of anchor-text for ad-hoc search revisited it is generally believed that propagated anchor-text is very important for effective web-search as offered by the commercial search engines . `` google bombs '' are a notable illustration of this . however , many years of trec web-retrieval research failed to establish the effectiveness of link-evidence for ad-hoc-retrieval on web collections . the ultimate resolution to this dilemma was that typical web-search is very different from the traditional ad-hoc methodology . so far , however , no one has established why link-information , like incoming link degree or anchor-text , does not help ad-hoc-retrieval effectiveness . several possible explanations were given , including the collections being too small for anchors to be effective , and the density of the link-graph being too low . the new trec 2009 web track collection is substantially larger than previous collections and has a dense link-graph . our main finding is that propagated anchor-text outperforms full-text-retrieval in terms of early-precision , and in combination with it , gives an improvement in overall precision . we then analyse the impact of link-density and collection-size by down-sampling the number of links and the number of pages respectively . other findings are that , contrary to expectations , (inter-server) link-density has little impact on effectiveness , while the size of the collection has a substantial impact on the quantity , quality and effectiveness of anchor-text . we also compare the diversity of the search-results of anchor-text and full-text approaches , which show that anchor-text performs significantly better than full-text-search and confirm our findings for the ad-hoc search-task .
