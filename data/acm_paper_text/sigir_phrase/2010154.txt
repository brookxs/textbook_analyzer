imecho : a context-aware desktop-search system in this demo , we present imecho , a context-aware desktop-search system to help users get more relevant results . different from other desktop-search engines , imecho ranks results not only by the content of the query , but also the context of the query . it employs an hidden-markov-model (hmm) - based user-model , which is learned from user 's activity logs , to estimate the query-context when he submits the query . the results from keyword-search are re-ranked by their relevances to the context with acceptable overhead .
