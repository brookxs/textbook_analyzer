information-retrieval using a hypertext-based-help system hypertext offers users a simple , flexible way to navigate through electronic-information systems but at the potential risk of becoming lost in the network of interconnected pieces of information . a study was conducted on information-retrieval using a commercial hypertext_based help-system . it was found that the predominant search-strategy was browsing (characterized by scanning tables of contents and paging through topics) , rather than employing the indexes (analytical search) . although subjects did not become lost , individuals with better spatial-visualization-ability , as measured by a standardized test , were faster at retrieving information and returned to the top of the information hierarchy less often than those with poorer spatial-visualization-ability . these results support previous studies that have found a strong preference by users to browse in hypertext-systems and extend those findings to a new domain (help) , a different type of user-interface , and a different information-architecture . in addition , the results demonstrate the importance of spatial-visualization-ability for efficient navigation and information-retrieval in a hierarchical hypertext system .
