collective entity linking in web-text : a graph-based-method entity-linking (el) is the task of linking name mentions in web-text with their referent entities in a knowledge-base . traditional el methods usually link name mentions in a document by assuming them to be independent . however , there is often additional interdependence between different el decisions , i.e. , the entities in the same document should be semantically related to each other . in these cases , collective entity linking , in which the name mentions in the same document are linked jointly by exploiting the interdependence between them , can improve the entity-linking accuracy . this paper proposes a graph-based collective el method , which can model and exploit the global interdependence between different el decisions . specifically , we first propose a graph-based representation , called referent-graph , which can model the global interdependence between different el decisions . then we propose a collective-inference algorithm , which can jointly infer the referent entities of all name mentions by exploiting the interdependence captured in referent-graph . the key benefit of our method comes from : 1) the global interdependence model of el decisions ; 2) the purely collective nature of the inference-algorithm , in which evidence for related el decisions can be reinforced into high-probability decisions . experimental-results show that our method can achieve significant performance-improvement over the traditional el methods .
