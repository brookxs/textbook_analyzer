utilizing query change for session search-session search is the information-retrieval (ir) task that performs document-retrieval for a search-session . during a session , a user constantly modifies queries in order to find relevant documents that fulfill the information-need . this paper proposes a novel query change retrieval-model (qcm) , which utilizes syntactic editing changes between adjacent queries as well as the relationship between query change and previously retrieved documents to enhance session search . we propose to model session search as a markov-decision-process (mdp) . we consider two agents in this mdp : the user-agent and the search-engine agent . the user-agent 's actions are query changes that we observe and the search agent 's actions are proposed in this paper . experiments show that our approach is highly effective and outperforms top session search systems in trec 2011 and 2012 .
