a site oriented method for segmenting web-pages information about how to segment a web-page can be used nowadays by applications such as segment aware web-search , classification and link-analysis . in this research , we propose a fully automatic method for page-segmentation and evaluate its application through experiments with four separate web-sites . while the method may be used in other applications , our main focus in this article is to use it as input to segment aware web-search systems . our results indicate that the proposed method produces better segmentation results when compared to the best segmentation-method we found in literature . further , when applied as input to a segment aware web-search method , it produces results close to those produced when using a manual page-segmentation method .
