integration of probabilistic fact and text-retrieval in this paper , a model for combining text and fact-retrieval is described . a query is a set of conditions , where a single condition is either a text or fact condition . fact conditions can be interpreted as being vague , thus leading to nonbinary weights for fact conditions with respect to database objects . for text conditions , we use descriptions of the occurence of terms in documents instead of precomputed indexing weights , thus treating terms similar to attributes . probabilistic indexing weights for conditions are computed by introducing the notion of correctness (or acceptability) of a condition w.r.t. an object . these indexing weights are used in retrieval for a probabilistic-ranking of objects based on the retrieval for a probabilistic-ranking of objects based on the retrieval-with-probabilistic-indexing (rpi) model , for which a new derivation is given here .
