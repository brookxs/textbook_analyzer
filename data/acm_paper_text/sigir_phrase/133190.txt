an analysis of vector-space-models based on computational-geometry this paper analyzes the properties , structures and limitations of vector-based models for information-retrieval from the computational-geometry point-of-view . it is shown that both the pseudo-cosine and the standard vector-space-models can be viewed as special cases of a generalized linear model . more importantly , both the necessary and sufficient-conditions have been identified , under which ranking-functions such as the inner-product , cosine , pseudo-cosine , dice , covariance and product-moment correlation measures can be used to rank the documents . the structure of the solution region for acceptable ranking is analyzed and an algorithm for finding all the solution vectors is suggested .
