tensor-space-model for document-analysis vector-space-model (vsm) has been at the core of information-retrieval for the past decades . vsm considers the documents as vectors in high-dimensional space.in such a vector-space , techniques like latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) , support-vector-machines (svm) , naive-bayes , etc. , can be then applied for indexing and classification . however , in some cases , the dimensionality of the document space might be extremely large , which makes these techniques infeasible due to the curse-of-dimensionality . in this paper , we propose a novel tensor-space-model for document-analysis . we represent documents as the second order tensors , or matrices . correspondingly , a novel indexing-algorithm called tensor-latent-semantic-indexing (tensorlsi) is developed in the tensor space . our theoretical-analysis shows that tensorlsi is much more computationally efficient than the conventional latent-semantic-indexing , which makes it applicable for extremely large-scale-data set . several experimental-results on standard document data-sets demonstrate the efficiency-and-effectiveness of our algorithm .
