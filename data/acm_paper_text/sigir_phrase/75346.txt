an optical-system for full-text-search in this paper we propose a full-text-search system based on optics . the storage and processing of the textual data are performed by an optical back-end system to an electronic computer . in this way we can take advantage of the speed and parallelism of digital optical-processing . using the proposed configuration we show how one might implement a set of text-processing operations using lasers , spatial light modulators and photodetectors .
