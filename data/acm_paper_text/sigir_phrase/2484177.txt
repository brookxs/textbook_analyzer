learning to combine representations for medical-records search the complexity of medical-terminology raises challenges when searching medical-records . for example , ` cancer ' , ` tumour ' , and ` neoplasms ' , which are synonyms , may prevent a traditional search-system from retrieving relevant records that contain only synonyms of the query terms . prior works use bag-of-concepts approaches , to deal with this by representing medical-terms sharing the same meanings using concepts from medical resources (e.g. mesh) . the relevance-scores are then combined with a traditional bag-of-words representation , when inferring the relevance of medical-records . even though the existing approaches are effective , the predicted retrieval-effectiveness of either the bag-of-words or bag-of-concepts representation , which may be used to effectively model the score-combination and hence improve retrieval-performance , is not taken into account . in this paper , we propose a novel learning-framework that models the importance of the bag-of-words and the bag-of-concepts representations , combining their scores on a per-query basis . our proposed framework leverages retrieval-performance predictors , such as the clarity score and avidf , calculated on both representations as learning features . we evaluate our proposed framework using the trec medical-records track 's test-collections . as our proposed framework can significantly outperform an existing approach that linearly merges the relevance-scores , we conclude that retrieval-performance predictors can be effectively leveraged when combining the relevance-scores .
