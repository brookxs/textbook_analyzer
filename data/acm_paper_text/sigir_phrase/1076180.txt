indexing emails and email threads for retrieval electronic-mail poses a number of unusual challenges for the design of information-retrieval-systems and test-collections , including informal expression , conversational-structure , variable document granularity (e.g. , messages , threads , or longer-term interactions) , a naturally occuring integration between free-text and structural-metadata , and incompletely characterized user-needs . this paper reports on initial experiments with a large-collection of public mailing-lists from the world-wide-web consortium that will be used for the trec 2005 enterprise-search track . automatic subject-line threading and removal of duplicated text were found to have little effect in a small pilot-study . those observations motivated development of a question-typology and more detailed analysis of collection characteristics ; preliminary results for both are reported .
