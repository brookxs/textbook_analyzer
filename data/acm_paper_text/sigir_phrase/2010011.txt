enhancing multi-label music-genre-classification through ensemble-techniques in the field of music-information-retrieval (mir) , multi-label genre-classification is the problem of assigning one or more genre labels to a music piece . in this work , we propose a set of ensemble-techniques , which are specific to the task of multi-label genre-classification . our goal is to enhance classification-performance by combining multiple classifiers . in addition , we also investigate some existing ensemble-techniques from machine-learning . the effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated through a set of empirical experiments and various related issues are discussed . to the best of our knowledge , there has been limited work on applying ensemble-techniques to multi-label genre-classification in the literature and we consider the results in this work as our initial efforts toward this end . the significance of our work has two folds : (1) proposing a set of ensemble-techniques specific to music-genre-classification and (2) shedding light on further research along this direction .
