an integrated hierarchical-file organization for data-selection-and-retrieval this paper presents an approach , the ihf approach , of organising data of a hierarchical-structure into one single file , maintaining adequate representation of the relationships among the data . the ihf approach requires each data item be stored in the basic form of name-value pair and consists in assigning each data item with identifier which provides not only the data item identification but also an implicit identification of the hierarchical structural-relationships among groups of data items . data-selection-and-retrieval operations are effectively implemented with the concept of masking of relevant identifier bits , without resorting to any linking devices . application of the ihf technique on cafs is examined .
