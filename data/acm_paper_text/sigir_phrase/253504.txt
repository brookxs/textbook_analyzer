graphical information-resources : maps and beyond the rise of computer-graphics offers a new challenge for information-retrieval : how to search and retrieve information which is partly or wholly graphical . as an example , procedures for handling geographical-information , such as street-maps and directories are explained . with this data , it is possible to find routes on maps , retrieve locations and names of people or businesses , and draw maps . but a comparison of these programs with programs for face processing or computer typesetting makes clear how far we are from general purpose routines . today successful graphics routines contain a great deal of local domain-knowledge . there is no analog of the simple keyword systems that handle textual-documents in any subject area . just as computational-linguists have found that subject matter expertise is necessary to do really sophisticated processing of english , it seems also necessary to sophisticated processing of pictures ; the difference is that we do n't know how to do unsophisticated processing of graphics .
