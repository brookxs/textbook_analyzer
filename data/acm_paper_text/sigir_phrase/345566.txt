extracting sentence segments for text-summarization : a machine-learning-approach with the proliferation of the-internet and the huge amount of data it transfers , text-summarization is becoming more important . we present an approach to the design of an automatic text summarizer that generates a summary by extracting sentence segments . first , sentences are broken into segments by special cue markers . each segment is represented by a set of predefined features (e.g. location of the segment , average term frequencies of the words occurring in the segment , number of title words in the segment , and the like) . then a supervised-learning-algorithm is used to train the summarizer to extract important sentence segments , based on the feature-vector . results of experiments on u.s. patents indicate that the performance of the proposed approach compares very favorably with other approaches (including microsoft-word summarizer) in terms of precision , recall , and classification-accuracy .
