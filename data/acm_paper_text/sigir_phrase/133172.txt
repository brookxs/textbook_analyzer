an evaluation of phrasal and clustered representations on a text-categorization task syntactic-phrase-indexing and term-clustering have been widely explored as text-representation techniques for text-retrieval . in this paper we study the properties of phrasal and clustered indexing languages on a text-categorization task , enabling us to study their properties in isolation from query-interpretation issues . we show that optimal effectiveness occurs when using only a small proportion of the indexing terms available , and that effectiveness peaks at a higher feature-set size and lower effectiveness level for a syntactic-phrase-indexing than for word-based-indexing . we also present results suggesting that traditional term-clustering method are unlikely to provide significantly improved text-representations . an improved probabilistic text categorization method is also presented .
