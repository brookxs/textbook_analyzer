personalized-recommendation driven by information-flow we propose that the information-access behavior of a group of people can be modeled as an information-flow issue , in which people intentionally or unintentionally influence and inspire each other , thus creating an interest in retrieving or getting a specific kind of information or product . information-flow models how information is propagated in a social-network . it can be a real social-network where interactions between people reside ; it can be , moreover , a virtual-social-network in that people only influence each other unintentionally , for instance , through collaborative-filtering . we leverage users ' access-patterns to model information-flow and generate effective personalized recommendations . first , an early adoption_based information-flow (eabif) network describes the influential relationships between people . second , based on the fact that adoption is typically category specific , we propose a topic-sensitive eabif (teabif) network , in which access-patterns are clustered with respect to the categories . once an item has been accessed by early adopters , personalized recommendations are achieved by estimating whom the information will be propagated to with high probabilities . in our experiments with an online document recommendation-system , the results demonstrate that the eabif and the teabif can respectively achieve an improved (precision , recall) of (91.0 \ % , 87.1 \ %) and (108.5 \ % , 112.8 \ %) compared to traditional collaborative-filtering , given an early adopter exists .
