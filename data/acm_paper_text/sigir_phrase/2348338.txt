fighting against web-spam : a novel propagation method based on click-through-data combating web-spam is one of the greatest challenges for web-search-engines . state-of-the-art anti-spam techniques focus mainly on detecting varieties of spam strategies , such as content spamming and link-based spamming . although these anti-spam approaches have had much success , they encounter problems when fighting against a continuous barrage of new types of spamming techniques . we attempt to solve the problem from a new perspective , by noticing that queries that are more likely to lead to spam pages/sites have the following characteristics : 1) they are popular or reflect heavy demands for search-engine users and 2) there are usually few key resources or authoritative results for them . from these observations , we propose a novel method that is based on click-through-data-analysis by propagating the spamicity score iteratively between queries and urls from a few seed pages/sites . once we obtain the seed pages/sites , we use the link-structure of the click-through bipartite-graph to discover other pages/sites that are likely to be spam . experiments show that our algorithm is both efficient and effective in detecting web-spam . moreover , combining our method with some popular anti-spam techniques such as trustrank achieves improvement compared with each technique taken individually .
