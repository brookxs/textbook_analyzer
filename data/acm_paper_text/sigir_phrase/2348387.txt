dual role-model for question-recommendation in community-question-answering question-recommendation that automatically recommends a new question to suitable users to answer is an appealing and challenging problem in the research area of community-question-answering (cqa) . unlike in general recommender-systems where a user has only a single role , each user in cqa can play two different roles (dual roles) simultaneously : as an asker and as an answerer . to the best of our knowledge , this paper is the first to systematically investigate the distinctions between the two roles and their different influences on the performance of question-recommendation in cqa . moreover , we propose a dual role-model (drm) to model the dual roles of users effectively . with different indepen-dence assumptions , two variants of drm are achieved . finally , we present the drm_based approach to question-recommendation which provides a mechanism for naturally integrating the user relation between the answerer and the asker with the content re-levance between the answerer and the question into a uni-fied probabilistic-framework . experiments using a real-world-data crawled from yahoo!-answers show that : (1) there are evident distinctions between the two roles of users in cqa . additionally , the answerer role is more effective than the asker role for modeling candidate users in question-recommendation ; (2) compared with baselines utilizing a single role or blended roles_based methods , our drm_based approach consistently and significantly improves the performance of question-recommendation , demonstrating that our approach can model the user in cqa more reasonably and precisely .
