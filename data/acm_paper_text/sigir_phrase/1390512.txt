summarization of compressed text images : an experience on indic-script documents automatic-summarization of jbig2 coded textual-images is discussed . compressed images are partially decompressed to compute relevant features . the feature-extraction method is free from using any character-recognition module . summary sentences are ranked . experiment considers documents in indic-scripts that lack in having any efficient ocr systems . script independent aspect of the approach is highlighted through use of two most popular indic-scripts . sentence-selection efficiency of about 61 \ % is achieved when judged against man-made summarization . a nonparametric (distribution-free) rank statistic shows a correlation-coefficient of 0.33 as a measure of the (minimum) strength of the associations between sentence-ranking by machine and human .
