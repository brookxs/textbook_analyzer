supporting multiple information-seeking strategies in a single system framework (abstract only) this research explores the relationship between information-seeking strategies (isss) and information retrieval (ir) system-design . when people seek information they engage in a variety of isss in order to search for specific items , learn about the contents of the database , evaluate retrieved information , and so on.the theoretical-foundations of the work are based on the information-seeking episode model developed by belkin (1996) , and the multi-facet classification-scheme of information-behaviors proposed by cool & belkin (2002) . the goal of this research is to construct and evaluate an interactive-retrieval system which uses different combinations of ir techniques to support different isss . example ir techniques include comparison using exact and probabilistic matching-algorithms ; summarization of information objects using titles , snippets or abstracts ; visualization-techniques such as lists or classified results ; and navigation-techniques such as scrolling or following links . by designing a retrieval-system with diverse strategies in mind , we can adaptively support multiple isss , permitting a user to move seamlessly from one strategy to another , choosing instantiations of each support technique tailored to the specific iss.the research will be conducted in a series of four steps . (1) develop an object-oriented-framework for representing basic ir techniques . (2) design , implement and evaluate systems which support individual isss such as browsing and searching . (3) specify an interaction structure for guiding and controlling sequences of different supporting techniques . (4) design , implement , and evaluate a dynamically adaptive-system supporting multiple isss in comparison to a non-adaptive baseline system .
