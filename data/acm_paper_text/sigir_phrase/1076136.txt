basic issues on the processing of web-queries in this paper we study three basic and key issues related to web-query processing : load-balance , broker behavior , and performance by individual index servers . our study , while preliminary , does reveal interesting tradeoffs : (1) load unbalance at low query arrival rates can be controlled with a simple measure of randomizing the distribution of documents among the index servers , (2) the broker is not a bottleneck , and (3) disk utilization is higher than cpu-utilization .
