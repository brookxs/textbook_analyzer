query-sensitive mutual-reinforcement-chain and its application in query-oriented multi-document-summarization sentence-ranking is the issue of most concern in document-summarization . early researchers have presented the mutual-reinforcement-principle (mr) between sentence and term for simultaneous key-phrase and salient sentence-extraction in generic single-document-summarization . in this work , we extend the mr to the mutual-reinforcement-chain (mrc) of three different text granularities , i.e. , document , sentence and terms . the aim is to provide a general reinforcement framework and a formal mathematical-modeling for the mrc . going one step further , we incorporate the query influence into the mrc to cope with the need for query-oriented multi-document-summarization . while the previous summarization approaches often calculate the similarity regardless of the query , we develop a query-sensitive-similarity to measure the affinity between the pair of texts . when evaluated on the duc 2005 dataset , the experimental-results suggest that the proposed query-sensitive mrc (qs-mrc) is a promising approach for summarization .
