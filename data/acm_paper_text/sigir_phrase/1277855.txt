heavy-tailed-distributions and multi-keyword queries intersecting inverted-indexes is a fundamental operation for many applications in information-retrieval-and-databases . efficient indexing for this operation is known to be a hard problem for arbitrary data distributions . however , text-corpora used in information-retrieval applications often have convenient power-law constraints (also known as zipf 's law and long tails) that allow us to materialize carefully chosen combinations of multi-keyword indexes , which significantly improve worst-case performance without requiring excessive storage . these multi-keyword indexes limit the number of postings accessed when computing arbitrary index intersections . our evaluation on an e-commerce collection of 20 million products shows that the indexes of up to four arbitrary keywords can be intersected while accessing less than 20 \ % of the postings in the largest single-keyword index .
