is uncertain logical-matching equivalent to conditional-probability ? logic-based information-retrieval (ir) models represent the retrieval decision as a logical implication d - &#62; q between a document d and a query q , where d and q are logical sentences . however , d - &#62; q is a binary-decision , we thus need a measure to estimate the degree to which d implies q , denoted p (d - &#62; q) . in this study , we revisit the van rijsbergen 's assumptions about : 1 - the logical implication - &#62; ' is not the material one , and 2 - p (d - &#62; q) could be estimated by the conditional-probability p (q | d) . more precisely , we claim that the material implication is an appropriate implication for ir , and also we mathematically prove that replacing p (d - &#62; q) by p (q | d) is a correct choice . in order to prove the van rijsbergen 's assumption , we use the propositional-logic and the lattice-theory . we also exploit the notion of degree of implication that is proposed by knuth .
