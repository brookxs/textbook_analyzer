compression of indexes with full positional-information in very-large text-databases this paper describes a combination of compression methods which may be used to reduce the size of inverted-indexes for very-large text-databases . these methods are prefix omission , run-length-encoding , and a novel family of numeric representations called n-s coding . using these compression methods on two different text sources (the king james version of the bible and a sample of wall-street-journal stories) , the compressed index occupies less than 40 \ % of the size of the original text , even when both stopwords and numbers are included in the index . the decreased time required for i/o can almost fully compensate for the time needed to uncompress the postings . this research is part of an effort to handle very-large text-databases on the cm-5 , a massively-parallel mimd supercomputer .
