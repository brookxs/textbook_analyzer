query dependent pseudo-relevance-feedback based on wikipedia pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) via query-expansion has been proven to be e ective in many information-retrieval (ir) tasks . in most existing work , the top-ranked documents from an initial search are assumed to be relevant and used for prf . one problem with this approach is that one or more of the top retrieved documents may be non-relevant , which can introduce noise into the feedback process . besides , existing methods generally do not take into account the significantly different types of queries that are often entered into an ir-system . intuitively , wikipedia can be seen as a large , manually edited document-collection which could be exploited to improve document-retrieval effectiveness within prf . it is not obvious how we might best utilize information from wikipedia in prf , and to date , the potential of wikipedia for this task has been largely unexplored . in our work , we present a systematic exploration of the utilization of wikipedia in prf for query dependent expansion . specifically , we classify trec topics into three categories based on wikipedia : 1) entity queries , 2) ambiguous-queries , and 3) broader queries . we propose and study the effectiveness of three methods for expansion term selection , each modeling the wikipedia based pseudo-relevance information from a different perspective . we incorporate the expansion terms into the original query and use language-modeling ir to evaluate these methods . experiments on four trec test-collections , including the large web collection gov2 , show that retrieval-performance of each type of query can be improved . in addition , we demonstrate that the proposed method out-performs the baseline relevance-model in terms of precision and robustness .
