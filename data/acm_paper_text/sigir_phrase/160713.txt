concept_based query-expansion query-expansion methods have been studied for a long time - with debatable success in many instances . in this paper we present a probabilistic query-expansion model based on a similarity-thesaurus which was constructed automatically . a similarity-thesaurus reflects domain-knowledge about the particular collection from which it is constructed . we address the two important issues with query-expansion : the selection and the weighting of additional search-terms . in contrast to earlier methods , our queries are expanded by adding those terms that are most similar to the concept of the query , rather than selecting terms that are similar to the query terms . our experiments show that this kind of query-expansion results in a notable improvement in the retrieval-effectiveness when measured using both recall-precision and usefulness .
