an investigation of broad coverage automatic pronoun-resolution for information-retrieval term-weighting methods have been shown to give significant increases in information-retrieval performance . the presence of pronomial references in documents reduces the term frequencies of associated words with a consequent effect on term-weights and information retrieval behaviour . this investigation explores the impact on information-retrieval performance of broad coverage automatic pronoun-resolution . results indicate that this approach has potential to improve both precision at fixed cutoff levels and average-precision .
