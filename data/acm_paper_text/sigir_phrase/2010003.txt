filtering semi-structured-documents based on faceted-feedback existing adaptive-filtering systems learn user-profiles based on users ' relevance-judgments on documents . in some cases , users have some prior-knowledge about what features are important for a document to be relevant . for example , a spanish speaker may only want news written in spanish , and thus a relevant-document should contain the feature `` language : spanish '' ; a researcher working on hiv knows an article with the medical subject `` subject : aids '' is very likely to be interesting to him/her . semi-structured-documents with rich faceted-metadata are increasingly prevalent over the-internet . motivated by the commonly used faceted-search interface in e-commerce , we study whether users ' prior-knowledge about faceted features could be exploited for filtering semi-structured-documents . we envision two faceted-feedback solicitation mechanisms , and propose a novel user profile-learning algorithm that can incorporate user-feedback on features . to evaluate the proposed work , we use two data-sets from the trec filtering track , and conduct a user-study on amazon-mechanical-turk . our experimental-results show that user-feedback on faceted features is useful for filtering . the new-user profile-learning algorithm can effectively learn from user-feedback on faceted features and performs better than several other methods adapted from the feature-based feedback techniques proposed for retrieval and text-classification tasks in previous work .
