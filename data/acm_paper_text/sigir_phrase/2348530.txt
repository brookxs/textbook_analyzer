crowdsourcing for search-evaluation and social-algorithmic search the first computers were people . today , internet-based access to 24/7 online human crowds has led to a renaissance of research in human-computation and the advent of crowdsourcing . these new-opportunities have brought a disruptive shift to research-and-practice for how we build intelligent-systems today . not only can labeled-data for training and evaluation be collected faster , cheaper , and easier than ever before , but we now see human-computation being integrated into the systems themselves , operating in concert with automation . this tutorial introduces opportunities and challenges of human-computation and crowdsourcing , particularly for search-evaluation and developing hybrid-search solutions that integrate human-computation with traditional forms of automated-search . we review methodology and findings of recent research and survey current generation crowdsourcing platforms now available , analyzing methods , potential , and limitations across platforms .
