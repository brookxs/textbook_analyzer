on performance of topical opinion-retrieval we investigate the effectiveness of both the standard evaluation-measures and the opinion component for topical opinion-retrieval . we analyze how relevance is affected by opinions by perturbing relevance-ranking by the outcomes of opinion-only classifiers built by monte-carlo-sampling . topical opinion rankings are obtained by either re-ranking or filtering the documents of a first-pass retrieval of topic-relevance . the proposed approach establishes the correlation between the accuracy and the precision of the classifier and the performance of the topical opinion-retrieval . among other results , it is possible to assess the effectiveness of the opinion component by comparing the effectiveness of the relevance baseline with the topical opinion ranking .
