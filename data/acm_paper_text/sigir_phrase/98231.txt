evaluation of an expert-system for searching in full text this paper presents a prototype expert-system which provides online-search assistance . the expert-system automatically reformulates queries , using an online thesaurus as the source of domain-knowledge , and a knowledge-base of domain-independent search-tactics . the expert-system works with a full-text database which requires no syntactic or semantic pre-processing . in addition , the expert-system ranks the retrieved passages in decreasing order of probable relevance . users ' search-performance using the expert-system was compared with their search-performance on their own , and their search-performance using the online thesaurus . the following conclusions were reached : 1) the expert-system significantly reduced the number of queries necessary to find relevant passages compared with the user searching alone or with the thesaurus . 2) the expert-system produced marginally significant improvements in precision compared with the user searching on their own . there was no significant difference in the recall achieved by the three system configurations . 3) overall , the expert-system ranked relevant passages above irrelevant passages .
