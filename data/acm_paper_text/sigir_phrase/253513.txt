processing free-text input to obtain a database of medical-information the linguistic string project of new york university has developed computer programs that convert the information in free-text documents of a technical specialty into a structured form suitable for mapping into a relational-database . the processing is based upon the restrictions on the use of language that are characteristic of the subject matter and the document type . these restrictions are summarized in a sublanguage grammar that provides a set of word-classes and formulas corresponding to the objects and relations of interest in the domain . the programs are independent of the particular sublanguage grammar employed . the application to narrative patient-records will be described and the applicability of the methods to other domains discussed .
