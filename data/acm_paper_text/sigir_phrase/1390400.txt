a unified and discriminative-model for query-refinement this paper addresses the issue of query-refinement , which involves reformulating ill-formed search queries in order to enhance relevance of search-results . query-refinement typically includes a number of tasks such as spelling-error correction , word-splitting , word merging , phrase-segmentation , word-stemming , and acronym-expansion . in previous research , such tasks were addressed separately or through employing generative-models . this paper proposes employing a unified and discriminative-model for query-refinement . specifically , it proposes a conditional-random-field (crf) model suitable for the problem , referred to as conditional-random-field for query-refinement (crf-qr) . given a sequence of query words , crf-qr predicts a sequence of refined query words as well as corresponding refinement operations . in that sense , crf-qr differs greatly from conventional crf models . two types of crf-qr models , namely a basic model and an extended model are introduced . one merit of employing crf-qr is that different refinement tasks can be performed simultaneously and thus the accuracy of refinement can be enhanced . furthermore , the advantages of discriminative-models over generative-models can be fully leveraged . experimental-results demonstrate that crf-qr can significantly outperform baseline methods . furthermore , when crf-qr is used in web-search , a significant improvement of relevance can be obtained .
