personalization of search-results using interaction behaviors in search-sessions personalization of search-results offers the potential for significant improvement in information-retrieval performance . user-interactions with the system and documents during information-seeking sessions provide a wealth of information about user-preferences and their task goals . in this paper , we propose methods for analyzing and modeling user search-behavior in search-sessions to predict document usefulness and then using information to personalize search-results . we generate prediction-models of document usefulness from behavior data collected in a controlled lab experiment with 32 participants , each completing uncontrolled searching for 4 tasks in the web . the generated models are then tested with another data-set of user-search sessions in radically different search-tasks and constrains . the documents predicted useful and not useful by the models are used to modify the queries in each search-session using a standard relevance-feedback technique . the results show that application of the models led to consistently improved performance over a baseline that did not take account of user-interaction information . these findings have implications for designing systems for personalized-search and improving user-search-experience .
