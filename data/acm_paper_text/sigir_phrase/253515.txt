optimization of inverted vector searches a simple algorithm is presented for increasing the efficiency of information-retrieval searches which are implemented using inverted-files . this optimization-algorithm employs knowledge about the methods used for weighting document and query terms in order to examine as few inverted-lists as possible . an extension to the basic algorithm allows greatly increased performance-optimization at a modest cost in retrieval-effectiveness . experimental runs are made examining several different term-weighting models and showing the optimization possible with each .
