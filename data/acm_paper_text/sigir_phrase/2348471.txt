exploiting term-dependence while handling negation in medical-search in medical-records , negative qualifiers , e.g. no or without , are commonly used by health practitioners to identify the absence of a medical condition . without considering whether the term occurs in a negative or positive context , the sole presence of a query-term in a medical-record is insufficient to imply that the record is relevant to the query . in this paper , we show how to effectively handle such negation within a medical-records information-retrieval-system . in particular , we propose a term-representation that tackles negated language in medical-records , which is further extended by considering the dependence of negated query terms . we evaluate our negation handling technique within the search-task provided by the trec medical-records 2011 track . our results , which show a significant improvement upon a system that does not consider negated context within records , attest the importance of handling negation .
