file organizations and access-methods for clv disks a large and important class of optical disc technology are clv format discs such as cd rom and worm . in this paper , we examine the issues related to the implementation and performance of several different file organizations on clv format optical discs such as cd rom and worm . the organizations examined are based on hashing and-trees . the clv recording scheme is shown to be a good environment for efficiently implementing hashing . single seek access and storage utilization levels approaching 100 \ % can be achieved for cd rom 's . it is shown that a b-tree organization is not a good choice for worm discs (both cav and clv) , but a modified isam approach can be appropriate for worm discs . we describe clustered bim 's , a class of tree organizations appropriate for cd roms . expressions for the expected retrieval-performance of both hashing and-trees are also given . the paper concludes by outlining recent results and future-directions on buffered implementations of access-methods for worm discs , as well as advantages of signature_based access-methods for text-retrieval in worm disc architectures .
