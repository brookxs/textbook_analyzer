no-free-lunch : brute-force vs. locality-sensitive-hashing for cross-lingual pairwise similarity this work explores the problem of cross-lingual pairwise similarity , where the task is to extract similar pairs of documents across two different languages . solutions to this problem are of general interest for text-mining in the multi-lingual context and have specific applications in statistical-machine-translation . our approach takes advantage of cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) techniques to project feature-vectors from one language into another , and then uses locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) to extract similar pairs . we show that effective cross-lingual pairwise similarity requires working with similarity thresholds that are much lower than in typical monolingual applications , making the problem quite challenging . we present a parallel , scalable mapreduce implementation of the sort-based sliding-window algorithm , which is compared to a brute-force approach on german and english wikipedia collections . our central finding can be summarized as `` no-free-lunch '' : there is no single optimal-solution . instead , we characterize effectiveness-efficiency tradeoffs in the solution-space , which can guide the developer to locate a desirable operating point based on application - and resource-specific constraints .
