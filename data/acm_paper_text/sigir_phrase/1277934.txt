power and bias of subset pooling strategies we define a method to estimate the random and systematic errors resulting from incomplete relevance assessments.mean average-precision (map) computed over a large number of topics with a shallow assessment pool substantially outperforms -- for the same adjudication effort map computed over fewer topics with deeper pools , and p@k computed with pools of the same depth . move-to-front pooling , previously reported to yield substantially better rank-correlation , yields similar power , and lower bias , compared tofixed-depth pooling .
