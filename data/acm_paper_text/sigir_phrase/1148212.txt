a framework to predict the quality of answers with non-textual features new types of document-collections are being developed by various web-services . the service-providers keep track of non-textual features such as click counts . in this paper , we present a framework to use non-textual features to predict the quality of documents . we also show our quality-measure can be successfully incorporated into the language modeling-based retrieval-model . we test our approach on a collection of question-and-answer pairs gathered from a-community_based question-answering service where people ask and answer questions . experimental-results using our quality-measure show a significant improvement over our baseline .
