simplified similarity-scoring using term ranks we propose a method for document-ranking that combines a simple document-centric view of text , and fast evaluation-strategies that have been developed in connection with the vector-space-model . the new method defines the importance of a term within a document qualitatively rather than quantitatively , and in doing so reduces the need for tuning parameters . in addition , the method supports very fast-query processing , with most of the computation carried out on small integers , and dynamic-pruning an effective option . experiments on a wide range of trec-data show that the new method provides retrieval-effectiveness as good as or better than the okapi-bm25 formulation , and variants of language-models .
