a location-based news article recommendation with explicit localized semantic-analysis the interest of users in handheld-devices is strongly related to their location . therefore , the user-location is important , as a user-context , for news article recommendation in a mobile-environment . this paper proposes a novel news article recommendation that reflects the geographical context of the user . for this purpose , we propose the explicit localized semantic-analysis (elsa) , an esa-based topical representation of documents . every location has its own geographical-topics , which can be captured from the geo-tagged documents related to the location . thus , not only news-articles but locations are also represented as topic vectors . the main advantage of elsa is that it stresses only the topics that are relevant to a given location , whereas all topics are equally important in esa . as a result , geographical-topics have different importance according to the user-location in elsa , even if they come from the same article . another advantage of elsa is that it allows a simple comparison of the user-location and news-articles , because it-projects both locations and articles onto an identical space composed of wikipedia topics . in the evaluation of elsa with the new york times corpus , it outperformed two simple baselines of bag-of-words and lda as well as two esa-based methods . rt10 of elsa was improved up to 46.25 % over other methods , and its ndcg@k was always higher than those of the others regardless of k.
