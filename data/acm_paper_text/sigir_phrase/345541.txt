a novel method for the evaluation of boolean-query effectiveness across a wide operational range traditional methods for the system-oriented-evaluation of boolean ir-system suffer from validity and reliability problems . laboratory-based research neglects the searcher and studies suboptimal queries . research on operational systems fails to make a distinction between searcher performance and system-performance . this approach is neither capable of measuring performance at standard points of operation (e.g. across r0.0-r1 .0) . a new laboratory-based evaluation-method for boolean ir systems is proposed . it is based on a controlled formulation of inclusive query plans , on an automatic-conversion of query plans into elementary queries , and on combining elementary queries into optimal queries at standard points of operation . major results of a large case experiment are reported . the validity , reliability , and efficiency of the method are considered in the light of empirical and analytical test-data .
