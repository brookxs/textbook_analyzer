trnon-greedy active-learning for text-categorization using convex ansductive experimental-design in this paper we propose a non-greedy active-learning method for text-categorization using least-squares support-vector-machines (lssvm) . our work is based on transductive-experimental-design (ted) , an active-learning formulation that effectively explores the information of unlabeled-data . despite its appealing properties , the optimization-problem is however np-hard and thus -- like most of other active-learning methods -- a greedy sequential strategy to select one data example after another was suggested to find a suboptimum . in this paper we formulate the problem into a continuous-optimization problem and prove its convexity , meaning that a set of data-examples can be selected with a guarantee of global optimum . we also develop an iterative-algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization-problem , which turns out to be very easy-to-implement . our text-categorization experiments on two text-corpora empirically demonstrated that the new active-learning-algorithm outperforms the sequential greedy-algorithm , and is promising for active-text categorization applications .
