learning-to-rank collections collection-selection , ranking collections according to user-query is crucial in distributed-search . however , few features are used to rank collections in the current collection-selection methods , while hundreds of features are exploited to rank web-pages in web-search . the lack of features affects the efficiency of collection-selection in distributed-search . in this paper , we exploit some new features and learn-to-rank collections with them through svm and rankingsvm respectively . experimental-results show that our features are beneficial to collection-selection , and the learned ranking-functions outperform the classical cori algorithm .
