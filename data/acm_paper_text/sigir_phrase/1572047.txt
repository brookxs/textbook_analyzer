detecting spammers and content promoters in online-video social-networks a number of online-video social-networks , out of which youtube is the most popular , provides features that allow users to post a video as a response to a discussion topic . these features open opportunities for users to introduce polluted content , or simply pollution , into the system . for instance , spammers may post an unrelated video as response to a popular one aiming at increasing the likelihood of the response being viewed by a larger number-of-users . moreover , opportunistic users -- promoters -- may try to gain visibility to a specific video by posting a large number of (potentially unrelated) responses to boost the rank of the responded video , making it appear in the top lists maintained by the system . content-pollution may jeopardize the trust of users on the system , thus compromising its success in promoting social-interactions . in spite of that , the available literature is very limited in providing a deep-understanding of this problem . in this paper , we go a step further by addressing the issue of detecting video spammers and promoters . towards that end , we manually build a test-collection of real youtube users , classifying them as spammers , promoters , and legitimates . using our test-collection , we provide a characterization of social and content attributes that may help distinguish each user class . we also investigate the feasibility of using a state-of-the-art supervised-classification algorithm to detect spammers and promoters , and assess its effectiveness in our test-collection . we found that our approach is able to correctly identify the majority of the promoters , misclassifying only a small percentage of legitimate users . in contrast , although we are able to detect a significant fraction of spammers , they showed to be much harder to distinguish from legitimate users .
