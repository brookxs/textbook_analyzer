watson : the jeopardy! challenge and beyond watson , named after ibm founder thomas j. watson , was built by a team of ibm researchers who set out to accomplish a grand challenge-build a computing system that rivals a human 's ability to answer questions posed in natural-language with speed , accuracy and confidence . the quiz show jeopardy! provided the ultimate test of this technology because the game 's clues involve analyzing subtle meaning , irony , riddles and other complexities of natural-language in which humans excel and computers traditionally fail . watson passed its first test on jeopardy! , beating the show 's two greatest champions in a televised exhibition match , but the real test will be in applying the underlying natural-language-processing and analytics technology in business and across industries . in this talk i will introduce the jeopardy! grand-challenge , present an overview of watson and the deepqa technology upon which watson is built , and explore future-applications of this technology .
