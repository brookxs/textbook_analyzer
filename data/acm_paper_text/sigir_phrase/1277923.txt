high-dimensional visual-vocabularies for image-retrieval in this paper we formulate image-retrieval by text query as a vector-space classification-problem . this is achieved by creating a high-dimensional visual-vocabulary that represents the image documents in great detail . we show how the representation of these image documents enables the application of well known text-retrieval techniques such as rocchio tf-idf and na ve-bayes to the semantic image-retrieval problem . we tested these methods on a corel images subset and achieve state-of-the-art retrieval-performance using the proposed methods .
