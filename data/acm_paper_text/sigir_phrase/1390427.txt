spectral-geometry for simultaneously clustering and ranking query search-results how best to present query-search results is an important problem in search-engines and information-retrieval-systems . when a single query retrieves many results , simply showing them as a long list will provide users with poor overview . nowadays , ranking and clustering query-search results have been two useful separate post-processing techniques to organize retrieved documents . in this paper , we proposed a spectral-analysis method based on the content-similarity networks to integrate the clustering and ranking-techniques for improving literature-search . the new approach organizes all these search-results into categories intelligently and simultaneously rank the results in each category . a variety of theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that the presented method performs well in real applications , especially in biomedical-literature retrieval . moreover , any free-text information can be analyzed with the new method , i.e. , the proposed approach can be applied to various information systems , such as web-search-engines and literature-search service .
