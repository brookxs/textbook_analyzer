transforming patents into prior-art queries searching for prior-art patents is an essential step for the patent examiner to validate or invalidate a patent application . in this paper , we consider the whole patent as the query , which reduces the burden on the user , and also makes many more potential search features available . we explore how to automatically transform the query patent into an effective search-query , especially focusing on the effect of different patent fields . experiments show that the background summary of a patent is the most useful source of terms for generating a query , even though most previous work used the patent-claims .
