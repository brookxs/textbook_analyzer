context-sensitive semantic-smoothing for the language-modeling-approach to genomic-ir semantic-smoothing , which incorporates synonym and sense-information into the language-models , is effective and potentially significant to improve retrieval-performance . the implemented semantic-smoothing models , such as the translation-model which statistically maps document terms to query terms , and a number of works that have followed have shown good experimental-results . however , these models are unable to incorporate contextual-information . thus , the resulting translation might be mixed and fairly general . to overcome this limitation , we propose a novel context-sensitive semantic-smoothing method that decomposes a document or a query into a set of weighted context-sensitive topic signatures and then translate those topic signatures into query terms . in detail , we solve this problem through (1) choosing concept pairs as topic signatures and adopting an ontology-based-approach to extract concept pairs ; (2) estimating the translation-model for each topic-signature using the em-algorithm ; and (3) expanding document and query-models based on topic-signature translations . the new smoothing-method is evaluated on trec 2004/05 genomics track collections and significant improvements are obtained . the map (mean-average-precision) achieves a 33.6 \ % maximal gain over the simple language-model , as well as a 7.8 \ % gain over the language-model with context-insensitive semantic-smoothing .
