composite-hashing with multiple-information-sources similarity-search applications with a large amount of text and image-data demands an efficient and effective solution . one useful strategy is to represent the examples in databases as compact binary codes through semantic-hashing , which has attracted much attention due to its fast query/search speed and drastically reduced storage requirement . all of the current semantic-hashing methods only deal with the case when each example is represented by one type of features . however , examples are often described from several different information-sources in many real-world-applications . for example , the characteristics of a webpage can be derived from both its content part and its associated links . to address the problem of learning good hashing codes in this scenario , we propose a novel research problem -- composite-hashing with multiple-information-sources (chmis) . the focus of the new research problem is to design an algorithm for incorporating the features from different information-sources into the binary hashing codes efficiently and effectively . in particular , we propose an algorithm chmis-aw (chmis with adjusted weights) for learning the codes . the proposed algorithm integrates information from several different sources into the binary hashing codes by adjusting the weights on each individual source for maximizing the coding performance , and enables fast conversion from query examples to their binary hashing codes . experimental-results on five different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against several other state-of-the-art semantic-hashing techniques .
