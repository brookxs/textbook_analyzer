forming test-collections with no system pooling forming test-collection relevance judgments from the pooled output of multiple retrieval-systems has become the standard process for creating resources such as the trec , clef , and ntcir test-collections . this paper presents a series of experiments examining three different ways of building test-collections where no system pooling is used . first , a collection formation technique combining manual feedback and multiple systems is adapted to work with a single retrieval-system . second , an existing method based on pooling the output of multiple manual searches is re-examined : testing a wider range of searchers and retrieval-systems than has been examined before . third , a new approach is explored where the ranked output of a single automatic search on a single retrieval-system is assessed for relevance : no pooling whatsoever . using established techniques for evaluating the quality of relevance-judgments , in all three cases , test-collections are formed that are as good as trec .
