record block allocation for retrieval on secondary-keys query-retrieval based on secondary-keys is an important operation in retrieval-systems . such a query generally retrieves more than one data record which satisfies the query criterion . this paper studies the problem of record address-allocation in disk-like devices so as to facilitate the fast retrieval of a set of records which are jointly accessed by a query . a heuristic scheme , using the proposed minimal access retrieval property , is designed to assign records to blocks . some experimental-results are also presented .
