learning with support-vector-machines for query-by-multiple-examples we explore an alternative information-retrieval-paradigm called query-by-multiple-examples (qbme) where the information-need is described not by a set of terms but by a set of documents . intuitive ideas for qbme include using the centroid of these documents or the well-known rocchio-algorithm to construct the query-vector . we consider this problem from the perspective of text-classification , and find that a better query-vector can be obtained through learning with support-vector-machines (svms) . for online queries , we show how svms can be learned from one-class examples in linear-time . for offline queries , we show how svms can be learned from positive and unlabeled examples together in linear or polynomial-time . the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches have been confirmed by our experiments on four real-world datasets .
