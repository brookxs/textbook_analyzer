deep-classification in large-scale text hierarchies most classification algorithms are best at categorizing the-web documents into a few categories , such as the top two levels in the open-directory-project . such a classification-method does not give very detailed topic-related class-information for the user because the first two levels are often too coarse . however , classification on a large-scale-hierarchy is known to be intractable for many target categories with cross-link relationships among them . in this paper , we propose a novel deep-classification approach to categorize web-documents into categories in a large-scale taxonomy . the approach consists of two stages : a search-stage and a classification stage . in the first stage , a category-search algorithm is used to acquire the category candidates for a given document . based on the category candidates , we prune the large-scale-hierarchy to focus our classification effort on a small subset of the original hierarchy . as a result , the classification-model is trained on the small subset before being applied to assign the category for a new document . since the category candidates are sufficiently close to each other in the hierarchy , a statistical-language-model based classifier using n-gram features is exploited . furthermore , the structure of the taxonomy can be utilized in this stage to improve the performance of classification . we demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms on the open-directory-project with over 130,000 categories . experimental-results show that our proposed approach can reach 51.8 \ % on the measure of mi-f1 at the 5th level , which is 77.7 \ % improvement over top-down based svm-classification algorithms .
