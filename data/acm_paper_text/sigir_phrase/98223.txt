a dynamic signature technique for multimedia-databases a signature-file acts as a filtering-mechanism to reduce the amount of data that needs to be searched during query-evaluation . even though several techniques for organizing and searching signature-files have been proposed in literature , they have serious limitations when applied to multimedia-databases , where integrated access-methods to text and image-content are needed . a new signature technique , called quick filter , is proposed in the paper . according to this technique , signatures are divided into partitions , each of which holds signatures sharing the same characteristic key . as a result , it is possible to determine if the signatures in a partition satisfy a query by merely examining the key . partitions not matching the key need not be searched . this method is based on dynamic hashing since signatures are hashed into partitions according to the keys and the file-size , computed algorithmically from the signatures . implementation of this technique is illustrated using an example and is verified by analytical performance evaluation . the result is a signature technique which satisfies the requirements for access-methods in multimedia-databases : dynamicity , with respect to insertions and updates , good query-processing performance on large-databases for high-weight queries .
