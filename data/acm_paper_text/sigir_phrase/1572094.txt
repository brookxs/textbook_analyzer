k-tree : large-scale document-clustering we introduce k-tree in an information-retrieval context . it is an efficient approximation of the k-means-clustering-algorithm . unlike k-means it forms a hierarchy of clusters . it has been extended to address issues with sparse-representations . we compare performance and quality to cluto using document-collections . the k-tree has a low time-complexity that is suitable for large document collections . this tree-structure allows for efficient disk_based implementations where space requirements exceed that of main-memory .
