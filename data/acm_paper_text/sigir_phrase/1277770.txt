information re-retrieval : repeat-queries in yahoo 's logs people often repeat web-searches , both to find new information on topics they have previously explored and to re-find information they have seen in the past . the query associated with a repeat search may differ from the initial query but can nonetheless lead to clicks on the same results . this paper explores repeat search-behavior through the analysis of a one-year web-query log of 114 anonymous users and a separate controlled survey of an additional 119 volunteers . our study demonstrates that as many as 40 \ % of all queries are re-finding queries . re-finding appears to be an important behavior for search-engines to explicitly support , and we explore how this can be done . we demonstrate that changes to search-engine-results can hinder re-finding , and provide a way to automatically detect repeat searches and predict repeat clicks .
