comparison of using passages and documents for blind-relevance-feedback in information-retrieval this paper compares document blind-feedback and passage blind-feedback in information-retrieval (ir) , based on the work during the nrrc 2003 reliable information-access summer workshop . the analysis of our experimental-results shows overall consistency on the performance-impact of using passages and documents for blind-feedback . however , it is observed that the behavior of passage blind-feedback , compared to document blind-feedback , is both system dependent and topic dependent . the relationships between the performance-impact of passage blind-feedback and the number of feedback terms and the topic 's average relevant-document length , respectively , are examined to illustrate these dependencies .
