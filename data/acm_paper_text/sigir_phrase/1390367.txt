enhancing text-clustering by leveraging wikipedia semantics most traditional text-clustering methods are based on `` bag-of-words '' (bow) representation based on frequency statistics in a set of documents . bow , however , ignores the important information on the semantic-relationships between key terms . to overcome this problem , several methods have been proposed to enrich text-representation with external resource in the past , such as wordnet . however , many of these approaches suffer from some limitations : 1) wordnet has limited coverage and has a lack of effective word-sense-disambiguation ability ; 2) most of the text-representation enrichment strategies , which append or replace document terms with their hypernym and synonym , are overly simple . in this paper , to overcome these deficiencies , we first propose a way to build a concept thesaurus based on the semantic relations (synonym , hypernym , and associative relation) extracted from wikipedia . then , we develop a unified-framework to leverage these semantic-relations in order to enhance traditional content-similarity measure for text-clustering . the experimental-results on reuters and ohsumed datasets show that with the help of wikipedia thesaurus , the clustering performance of our method is improved as compared to previous methods . in addition , with the optimized weights for hypernym , synonym , and associative concepts that are tuned with the help of a few labeled-data users provided , the clustering performance can be further improved .
