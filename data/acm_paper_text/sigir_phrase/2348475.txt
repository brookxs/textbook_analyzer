finding interesting posts in twitter based on retweet graph-analysis millions of posts are being generated in real-time by users in social-networking-services , such as twitter . however , a considerable number of those posts are mundane posts that are of interest to the authors and possibly their friends only . this paper investigates the problem of automatically discovering valuable posts that may be of potential interest to a wider audience . specifically , we model the structure of twitter as a graph consisting of users and posts as nodes and retweet relations between the nodes as edges . we propose a variant of the hits-algorithm for producing a static-ranking of posts . experimental-results on real-world data demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance than several baseline methods .
