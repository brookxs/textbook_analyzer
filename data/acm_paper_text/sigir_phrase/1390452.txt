exploring evaluation-metrics : gmap versus map in retrieval experiments , an effectiveness-metrics is used to generate a score for each system-topic pair being tested . it is then usual to average the system-topic scores to obtain a system score , which is used for the purpose of system comparison . in this paper we explore the ramifications of using the geometric-mean (gmap) , rather than the arithmetic-mean (map) when computing an aggregate system score from a set of system-topic scores . we find that gmap does indeed handle variability in topic difficulty more consistently than does the usual map aggregation method .
