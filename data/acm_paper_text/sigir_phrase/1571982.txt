using anchor-texts with their hyperlink-structure for web-search as a good complement to page content , anchor-texts have been extensively used , and proven to be useful , in commercial search engines . however , anchor-texts have been assumed to be independent , whether they come from the same web-site or not . intuitively , an anchor-text from unrelated web-sites should be considered as stronger evidence than that from the same site . this paper proposes two new methods to take into account the possible relationships between anchor-texts . we consider two relationships in this paper : links from the same site and links from related sites . the importance assigned to the anchor-texts in these two situations is discounted . experimental-results show that these two new models outperform the baseline-model which assumes independence between hyperlinks .
