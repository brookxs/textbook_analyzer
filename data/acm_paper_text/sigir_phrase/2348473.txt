exploring tag-relevance for image tag re-ranking in this paper , we propose to explore the relevance between tags for image tag re-ranking . the key component is to define a global tag-tag similarity-matrix , which is achieved by analysis in both semantic and visual aspects . the text semantic-relevance is explored by the latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) model [1] . for the visual-information , the tag-relevance can be propagated by reconstructing exemplar images with visually and semantically consistent images . based on our tag-relevance matrix , a random-walk approach is leveraged to discover the significance of each tag . finally , all tags in an image are re-ranked by their significance values . extensive experiments show its effectiveness on an image dataset with a large tags vocabulary .
