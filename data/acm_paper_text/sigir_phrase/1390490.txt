automatic document prior-feature-selection for web-retrieval document prior features , such as pagerank and url depth , can improve the retrieval-effectiveness of web-information-retrieval (ir) systems . however , not all queries equally benefit from the application of a document prior feature . this paper aims to investigate whether the retrieval-performance can be further enhanced by selecting the best document prior feature on a per-query basis . we present a novel method for selecting the best document prior feature on a per-query basis . we evaluate our technique on the trec . gov web test collection and its associated trec 2003 web-search tasks . our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed selection-method .
