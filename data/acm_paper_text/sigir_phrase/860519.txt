enhancing cross-language-information-retrieval by an automatic acquisition of bilingual-terminology from comparable-corpora this paper presents an approach to bilingual-lexicon-extraction from comparable-corpora and evaluations on cross-language-information-retrieval . we explore a bi-directional extraction of bilingual-terminology primarily from comparable-corpora . a combined statistics-based and linguistics-based model to select best translation-candidates to phrasal-translation is proposed . evaluations using a large test collection for japanese-english revealed the proposed combination of bi-directional comparable-corpora , bilingual-dictionaries and transliteration , augmented with linguistics-based-pruning to be highly effective in cross-language-information-retrieval .
