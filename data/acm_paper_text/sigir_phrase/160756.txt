spider : a multiuser information-retrieval-system for semistructured and dynamic-data the access structure , the retrieval-model , and the system-architecture of the spider information-retrieval-system are described . the access structure provides efficient weighted retrieval on dynamic-data collections . it is based on signatures and non-inverted item descriptions . the signatures provide upper-bounds for the exact retrieval status values such that only a small number of exact retrieval status values have to be computed . spider 's retrieval-model is a probabilistic-retrieval-model that is capable to exploit the database scheme of semistructured-data collections . this model can be considred as a further development of the binary independence indexing (bii) model . the system-architecture was derived systematically from a given set of requirements such as effective and efficient retrieval on dynamic-data collections , exploitation of the database scheme , computed views , and the integration of information-retrieval-functionality and database functionality .
