flexible selection among objects : a framework based on fuzzy-sets up to now , most of the retrieving systems are founded on a boolean selection-mechanism . it appears that this way of doing is not powerful enough to deal with some applications , especially when the size (number) of the results must be controlled . in that case , some kind of flexibility is needed in query expression . in this paper , we suggest the use of a fuzzy-sets_based approach . the basic principles of this approach are presented and compared to more conventional solutions providing only limited extensions . moreover , the implementation aspects related to our approach are discussed to show that reasonable performances can be expected .
