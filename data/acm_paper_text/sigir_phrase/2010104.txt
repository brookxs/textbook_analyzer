detecting seasonal queries by time-series-analysis seasonal events such as halloween and christmas repeat every year and initiate several temporal-information needs . the impact of such events on users is often reflected in search-logs in form of seasonal spikes in the frequency of related queries (e.g. `` halloween costumes '' , `` where is santa '') . many seasonal queries such as `` sigir conference '' mainly target fresh pages (e.g. sigir2011.org) that have less usage-data such as clicks and anchor-text compared to older alternatives (e.g.sigir2009.org) . thus , it is important for search-engines to correctly identify seasonal queries and make sure that their results are temporally reordered if necessary . in this poster , we focus on detecting seasonal queries using time-series-analysis . we demonstrate that the seasonality of a query can be determined with high accuracy according to its historical frequency-distribution .
