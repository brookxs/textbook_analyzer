web-a-where : geotagging web-content we describe web-a-where , a system for associating geography with web-pages . web-a-where locates mentions of places and determines the place each name refers to . in addition , it assigns to each page a geographic focus -- a locality that the page discusses as a whole . the tagging-process is simple and fast , aimed to be applied to large-collections of web-pages and to facilitate a variety of location-based-applications and data analyses.geotagging involves arbitrating two types of ambiguities : geo/non-geo and geo/geo . a geo/non-geo ambiguity occurs when a place name also has a non-geographic meaning , such as a person-name (e.g. , berlin) or a common word (turkey) . geo/geo ambiguity arises when distinct places have the same name , as in london , england vs. london , ontario.an implementation of the tagger within the framework of the webfountain data-mining system is described , and evaluated on several corpora of real web-pages . precision of up to 82 \ % on individual geotags is achieved . we also evaluate the relative contribution of various heuristics the tagger employs , and evaluate the focus-finding algorithm using a corpus pretagged with localities , showing that as many as 91 \ % of the foci reported are correct up to the country level .
