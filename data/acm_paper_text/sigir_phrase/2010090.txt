towards effective short-text deep-classification recently , more and more short-texts (e.g. , ads , tweets) appear on the web . classifying short-texts into a large taxonomy like odp or wikipedia category system has become an important mining-task to improve the performance of many applications such as contextual-advertising and topic-detection for micro-blogging . in this paper , we propose a novel multi-stage classification-approach to solve the problem . first , explicit-semantic-analysis is used to add more features for both short-texts and categories . second , we leverage information-retrieval technologies to fetch the most relevant categories for an input short-text from thousands of candidates . finally , a svm-classifier is applied on only a few selected categories to return the final answer . our experimental-results show that the proposed method achieved significant improvements on classification-accuracy compared with several existing state of art approaches .
