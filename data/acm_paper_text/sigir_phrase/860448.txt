implicit-link analysis for small web-search current web search-engines generally impose link analysis-based re-ranking on web-page retrieval . however , the same techniques , when applied directly to small web-search such as intranet and site-search , can not achieve the same performance because their link-structures are different from the global web . in this paper , we propose an approach to constructing implicit-links by mining users ' access-patterns , and then apply a modified pagerank-algorithm to re-rank web-pages for small web-search . our experimental-results indicate that the proposed method outperforms content-based method by 16 \ % , explicit link-based pagerank by 20 \ % and directhit by 14 \ % , respectively .
