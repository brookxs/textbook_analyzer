fast context-aware-recommendations with factorization machines the situation in which a choice is made is an important information for recommender-systems . context-aware recommenders take this information into account to make predictions . so far , the best performing method for context-aware rating-prediction in terms of predictive-accuracy is multiverse recommendation based on the tucker tensor-factorization model . however this method has two drawbacks : (1) its model-complexity is exponential in the number of context variables and polynomial in the size of the factorization and (2) it only works for categorical context variables . on the other hand there is a large variety of fast but specialized recommender methods which lack the generality of context-aware methods . we propose to apply factorization machines (fms) to model contextual-information and to provide context-aware rating predictions . this approach results in fast context-aware-recommendations because the model equation of fms can be computed in linear-time both in the number of context variables and the factorization size . for learning fms , we develop an iterative-optimization method that analytically finds the least-square solution for one parameter given the other ones . finally , we show empirically that our approach outperforms multiverse recommendation in prediction-quality and runtime .
