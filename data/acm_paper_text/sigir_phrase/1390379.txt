learning-to-rank with partially-labeled data ranking-algorithms , whose goal is to appropriately order a set of objects/documents , are an important component of information-retrieval-systems . previous work on ranking-algorithms has focused on cases where only labeled-data is available for training (i.e. supervised-learning) . in this paper , we consider the question whether unlabeled (test) data can be exploited to improve ranking-performance . we present a framework for transductive-learning of ranking-functions and show that the answer is affirmative . our framework is based on generating better features from the test-data (via kernelpca) and incorporating such features via boosting , thus learning different ranking-functions adapted to the individual test queries . we evaluate this method on the letor (trec , ohsumed) dataset and demonstrate significant improvements .
