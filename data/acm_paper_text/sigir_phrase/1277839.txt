how well does result relevance predict session satisfaction ? per-query relevance-measures provide standardized , repeatable measurements of search result quality , but they ignore much of what users actually experience in a full-search session . this paper examines how well we can approximate a user 's ultimate session-level satisfaction using a simple relevance metric . we find that thisrelationship is surprisingly strong . by incorporating additional properties of the query itself , we construct a model which predicts user-satisfaction even more accurately than relevance alone .
