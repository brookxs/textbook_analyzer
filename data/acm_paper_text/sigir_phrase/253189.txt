s-tree : a dynamic balanced signature index for office retrieval the signature approach is an access-method for partial-match-retrieval which meets many requirements of an office-environment . signatures are hash coded binary words derived from objects stored in the data-base . they serve as a filter for retrieval in order to discard a large number of nonqualifying objects . in an indexed signature method the signatures of objects stored on a single page are used to form a signature for that page . in this paper we describe a new technique of indexed signatures which combines the dynamic balancing of b-trees with the signature approach . the main problem of appropriate splitting is solved in a heuristic way . operations are described and a simple performance-analysis is given . the analysis and some experimental-results indicate a considerable performance-gain . moreover , the new s-tree approach supports a clustering on a signature basis . further remarks on adaptability complete this work .
