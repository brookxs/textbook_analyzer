measuring pseudo-relevance-feedback & clir in this poster , we report on the effects of pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) for a cross-language image-retrieval task using a test-collection . typically prf has been shown to improve retrieval-performance in previous clir experiments based on average-precision at a fixed rank . however our experiments have shown that queries in which no relevant documents are returned also increases . because query-reformulation for cross-language is likely to be harder than with monolingual searching , a great deal of user dissatisfaction would be associated with this scenario . we propose that an additional effectiveness measure based on failed queries may better reflect user-satisfaction than average-precision alone .
