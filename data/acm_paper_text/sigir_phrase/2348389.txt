category-hierarchy maintenance : a data-driven-approach category hierarchies often evolve at a much slower pace than the documents reside in . with newly available documents kept adding into a hierarchy , new topics emerge and documents within the same category become less topically cohesive . in this paper , we propose a novel automatic approach to modifying a given category-hierarchy by redistributing its documents into more topically cohesive categories . the modification is achieved with three operations (namely , sprout , merge , and assign) with reference to an auxiliary hierarchy for additional semantic-information ; the auxiliary hierarchy covers a similar set of topics as the hierarchy to be modified . our user-study shows that the modified category-hierarchy is semantically meaningful . as an extrinsic-evaluation , we conduct experiments on document-classification using real-data from yahoo!-answers and answerbag hierarchies , and compare the classification accuracies obtained on the original and the modified hierarchies . our experiments show that the proposed method achieves much larger classification-accuracy improvement compared with several baseline methods for hierarchy modification .
