predicting web searcher-satisfaction with existing community-based answers community-based-question-answering (cqa) sites , such as yahoo!-answers , baidu knows , naver , and quora , have been rapidly growing in popularity . the resulting archives of posted answers to questions , in yahoo!-answers alone , already exceed in size 1 billion , and are aggressively indexed by web-search-engines . in fact , a large number of search-engine users benefit from these archives , by finding existing answers that address their own queries . this scenario poses new challenges and opportunities for both search-engines and cqa sites . to this end , we formulate a new problem of predicting the satisfaction of web searchers with cqa answers . we analyze a large number of web-searches that result in a visit to a popular cqa site , and identify unique characteristics of searcher-satisfaction in this setting , namely , the effects of query-clarity , query-to-question match , and answer-quality . we then propose and evaluate several approaches to predicting searcher-satisfaction that exploit these characteristics . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to predict and validate the usefulness of cqa archives for external searchers , rather than for the original askers . our results suggest promising directions for improving and exploiting community-question-answering services in pursuit of satisfying even more web-search-queries .
