estimating interference in the qprp for subtopic-retrieval the quantum-probability-ranking-principle (qprp) has been recently proposed , and accounts for interdependent-document-relevance when ranking . however , to be instantiated , the qprp requires a method to approximate the `` interference '' between two documents . in this poster , we empirically evaluate a number of different methods of approximation on two trec test-collections for subtopic-retrieval . it is shown that these approximations can lead to significantly better retrieval-performance over the-state-of-the-art .
