detecting word substitutions : pmi vs. hmm those who want to conceal the content of their communications can do so by replacing words that might trigger attention . for example , instead of writing `` the bomb is in position '' , a terrorist may chose to write `` the flower is in position . '' the substituted sentence would sound a bit `` odd '' for a human-reader and it has been shown in prior research that such oddity is detectable by text-mining approaches . however , the importance of each component in the suggested oddity detection-approach has not been thoroughly investigated . also , the approach has not been compared with such an obvious candidate for the task as hidden-markov-models (hmm) . in this work , we explore further oddity detection-algorithms reported earlier , specifically those based on pointwise-mutual-information (pmi) and hidden-markov-models (hmm) .
