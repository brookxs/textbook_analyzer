a low rank structural large-margin method for cross-modal ranking cross-modal retrieval is a classic research-topic in multimedia-information-retrieval . the traditional approaches study the problem as a pairwise similarity function problem . in this paper , we consider this problem from a new perspective as a listwise ranking problem and propose a general cross-modal ranking-algorithm to optimize the listwise ranking loss with a low rank embedding , which we call latent-semantic cross-modal ranking (lscmr) . the latent low-rank embedding space is discriminatively learned by structural large-margin-learning to optimize for certain ranking criteria directly . we evaluate lscmr on the wikipedia and nus-wide dataset . experimental-results show that this method obtains significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods .
