user-behavior in zero-recall ecommerce queries user expectation and experience for web-search and ecommerce (product) search are quite different . product descriptions are concise as compared to typical web-documents . user expectation is more specific to find the right product . the difference in the publisher and searcher vocabulary (in case of product-search the seller and the buyer vocabulary) combined with the fact that there are fewer products to search over than web-documents result in observable numbers of searches that return no results (zero-recall searches) . in this paper we describe a study of zero-recall searches . our study is focused on ecommerce-search and uses data from a leading ecommerce site 's user click-stream logs . there are 3 main contributions of our study : 1) the cause of zero-recall searches ; 2) a study of user 's reaction and recovery from zero-recall ; 3) a study of differences in behavior of power-users versus novice-users to zero-recall searches .
