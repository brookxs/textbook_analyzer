commodity query by snapping commodity information such as prices and public reviews is always the concern of consumers . helping them conveniently acquire these information as an instant reference is often of practical significance for their purchase activities . nowadays , web-2.0 , linked-data clouds , and the pervasiveness of smart hand-held devices have created opportunities for this demand , i.e. , users could just snap a photo of any commodity that is of interest at anytime and anywhere , and retrieve the relevant-information via their internet-linked mobile-devices . nonetheless , compared with the traditional keyword-based-information-retrieval , extracting the hidden-information related to the commodities in photos is a much more complicated and challenging task , involving techniques such as pattern-recognition , knowledge-base-construction , semantic comprehension , and statistic deduction . in this paper , we propose a framework to address this issue by leveraging on various techniques , and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this framework with experiments on a prototype .
