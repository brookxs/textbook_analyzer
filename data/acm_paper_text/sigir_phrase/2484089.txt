toward whole-session relevance : exploring intrinsic diversity in web-search current-research on web-search has focused on optimizing and evaluating single queries . however , a significant fraction of user queries are part of more complex-tasks [20] which span multiple-queries across one or more search-sessions [26,24] . an ideal search-engine would not only retrieve relevant results for a user 's particular query but also be able to identify when the user is engaged in a more complex task and aid the user in completing that task [29,1] . toward optimizing whole-session or task relevance , we characterize and address the problem of intrinsic diversity (id) in retrieval [30] , a type of complex task that requires multiple interactions with current search-engines . unlike existing work on extrinsic diversity [30] that deals with ambiguity in intent across multiple users , id queries often have little ambiguity in intent but seek content covering a variety of aspects on a shared theme . in such scenarios , the underlying needs are typically exploratory , comparative , or breadth-oriented in nature . we identify and address three key problems for id retrieval : identifying authentic examples of id tasks from post-hoc analysis of behavioral-signals in search-logs ; learning to identify initiator queries that mark the start of an id search-task ; and given an initiator query , predicting which content to prefetch and rank .
