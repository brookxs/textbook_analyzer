nested-transactions in a combined irs-dbms architecture the possibility to put an information-retrieval-system (irs) on top of a data-base-management system (dbms) is investigated with respect to concurrency-control and recovery . the simple mapping of one irs transaction to one dbms transaction is analyzed and found to be unsatisfactory . therefore , the idea of generating a sequence of dbms transactions for a single irs transaction is discussed . this notion of `` nested '' transactions assumes standard concurrency-control technology but is applied twice : in the underlaying dbms layer and in the irs layer . the consequence is that multi-user control and recovery is also necessary in the irs layer but it utilizes the concurrency-control and recovery function of the dbms .
