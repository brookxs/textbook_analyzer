a probabilistic-model for retrospective-news-event-detection retrospective-news-event-detection (red) is defined as the discovery of previously unidentified events in historical news-corpus . although both the contents and time information of news-articles are helpful to red , most researches focus on the utilization of the contents of news-articles . few research works have been carried out on finding better usages of time information . in this paper , we do some explorations on both directions based on the following two characteristics of news-articles . on the one hand , news-articles are always aroused by events ; on the other hand , similar articles reporting the same event often redundantly appear on many news sources . the former hints a generative-model of news-articles , and the latter provides data enriched environments to perform red . with consideration of these characteristics , we propose a probabilistic-model to incorporate both content and time information in a unified-framework . this model gives new representations of both news-articles and news events . furthermore , based on this approach , we build an interactive red system , hiscovery , which provides additional functions to present events , photo story and chronicle .
