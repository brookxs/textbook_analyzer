a flexible retrieval-system of shapes in binary-images this poster overviews the main characteristics of a flexible retrieval-systems of shapes present in binary-images and discusses some evaluation results . the system applies multiple indexing criteria of the shapes synthesizing distinct characteristics such as global-features of the objects contour (fourier-coefficients) , boundary irregularities (multifractal spectrum) , presence of concavities and convexities on the boundary (contour scale-space distribution) . the system is flexible since it allows customizing the retrieval-function to fit an application need . the query is a binary-image containing the desired shape and a set of parameters specifying the distinct importance of the shape characteristics that must be taken into account to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved shapes . the retrieval-function is then defined as a flexible multicriteria fusion-function producing ranked results . the evaluation experiments showed that this system can be suited to different retrieval purposes , and that generally the combination of the distinct shape-indexing criteria increases both recall and precision with respect to the application of any single indexing criterion alone .
