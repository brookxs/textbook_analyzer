multiple-evidence combination in image-retrieval : diogenes searches for people on the web in this work , we examine evidence-combination mechanisms for classifying multimedia-information . in particular , we examine linear and dempster-shafer methods of evidence-combination in the context of identifying personal images on the world-wide-web . an automatic web search-engine named diogenes 1 searches the-web for personal images and combines different pieces of evidence for identification . the sources of evidence consist of input from face detection/recognition and text/html analysis modules . a degree of uncertainty is involved with both of these sources . diogenes automatically determines the uncertainty locally for each retrieval and uses this information to set a relative significance for each evidence . to our knowledge , diogenes is the first image-search-engine using dempster-shafer evidence-combination based on automatic-object-recognition and dynamic local uncertainty assessment . in our experiments diogenes comfortably outperformed some well known commercial and research prototype image-search engines for celebrity image-queries .
