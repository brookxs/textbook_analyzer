a study of statistical-models for query-translation : finding a good unit of translation this paper presents a study of three statistical-query translation-models that use different units of translation . we begin with a review of a word-based-translation-model that uses co-occurrence-statistics for resolving translation ambiguities . the translation-selection problem is then formulated under the framework of graphic-model resorting to which the modeling assumptions and limitations of the co-occurrence model are discussed , and the research of finding better translation units is motivated . then , two other models that use larger , linguistically motivated translation units (i.e. , noun-phrase and dependency triple) are presented . for each model , the modeling and training methods are described in detail . all query-translation models are evaluated using trec collections . results show that larger translation units lead to more specific models that usually achieve better translation and cross-language-information-retrieval results .
