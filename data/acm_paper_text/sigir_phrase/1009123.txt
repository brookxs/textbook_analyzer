broken plural-detection for arabic-information-retrieval due to the high number of inflectional variations of arabic words , empirical-results suggest that stemming is essential for arabic-information-retrieval . however , current light-stemming algorithms do not extract the correct stem of irregular (so-called broken) plurals , which constitute ~ 10 \ % of arabic texts and ~ 41 \ % of plurals . although light-stemming in particular has led to improvements in information-retrieval [5 , 6] , the effects of broken-plurals on the performance of information-retrieval-systems has not been examined.we propose a light stemmer that incorporates a broken plural recognition-component , and evaluate it within the context of information-retrieval . our results show that identifying broken-plurals and reducing them to their correct stems does result in a significant improvement in the performance of information-retrieval-systems .
