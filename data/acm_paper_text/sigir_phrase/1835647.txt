transitive history-based query-disambiguation for query-reformulation we present a probabilistic-model of a user 's search-history and a target query-reformulation . we derive a simple transitive similarity algorithm for disambiguating queries and improving history-based query-reformulation accuracy . we compare the merits of this approach to other methods and present results on both examples assessed by human editors and on automatically-labeled click-data .
