boosted decision trees for word-recognition in handwritten document-retrieval recognition and retrieval of historical handwritten material is an unsolved problem . we propose a novel approach to recognizing and retrieving handwritten-manuscripts , based upon word image-classification as a key step . decision-trees with normalized pixels as features form the basis of a highly accurate adaboost-classifier , trained on a corpus of word images that have been resized and sampled at a pyramid of resolutions . to stem problems from the highly skewed-distribution of class frequencies , word-classes with very few training-samples are augmented with stochastically altered versions of the originals . this increases recognition performance substantially . on a standard corpus of 20 pages of handwritten material from the george washington collection the recognition performance shows a substantial improvement in performance over previous published results (75 \ % vs 65 \ %) . following word-recognition , retrieval is done using a language-model over the recognized words . retrieval-performance also shows substantially improved results over previously published results on this database . recognition/retrieval results on a more challenging database of 100 pages from the george washington collection are also presented .
