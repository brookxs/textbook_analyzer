diversifying product-search results in recent years , online-shopping is becoming more and more popular . users type keyword-queries on product-search systems to find relevant products , accessories , and even related products . however , existing product-search systems always return very similar products on the first several pages instead of taking diversity into consideration . in this paper , we propose a novel approach to address the diversity issue in the context of product-search . we transform search-result-diversification into a combination of diversifying product categories and diversifying product attribute values within each category . the two sub-problems are optimization-problems which can be reduced into well-known np-hard-problems respectively . we further leverage greedy-based approximation-algorithms for efficient product-search results re-ranking .
