the overlap problem in content-oriented xml-retrieval-evaluation within the initiative for the evaluation of xml-retrieval (inex) a number of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of content-oriented xml-retrieval approaches were developed . although these metrics provide a solution towards addressing the problem of overlapping result elements , they do not consider the problem of overlapping reference components within the recall-base , thus leading to skewed effectiveness scores . we propose alternative metrics that aim to provide a solution to both overlap issues .
