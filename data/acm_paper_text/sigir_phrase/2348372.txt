collaborative personalized tweet recommendation twitter has rapidly grown to a popular social-network in recent years and provides a large number of real-time messages for users . tweets are presented in chronological order and users scan the followees ' timelines to find what they are interested in . however , an information-overload problem has troubled many users , especially those with many followees and thousands of tweets arriving every day . in this paper , we focus on recommending useful tweets that users are really interested in personally to reduce the users ' effort to find useful information . many kinds of information on twitter are available for helping recommendation , including the user 's own tweet history , retweet history and social-relations between users . we propose a method of making tweet recommendations based on collaborative-ranking to capture personal interests . it can also conveniently integrate the other useful contextual-information . our final method considers three major elements on twitter : tweet topic level factors , user social relation factors and explicit features such as authority of the publisher and-quality of the tweet . the experiments show that all the proposed elements are important and our method greatly outperforms several baseline methods .
