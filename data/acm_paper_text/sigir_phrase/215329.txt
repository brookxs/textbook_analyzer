fast evaluation of structured-queries for information-retrieval information-retrieval-systems are being challenged to manage larger and larger document-collections . in an effort to provide better retrieval-performance on large-collections , more sophisticated retrieval techniques have been developed that support rich , structured-queries . structured-queries are not amenable to previously proposed optimization-techniques . optimizing execution , however , is even more important in the context of large document collections . we present a new structured-query optimization-technique which we have implemented in an inference network-based information-retrieval-system . experimental-results show that query-evaluation time can be reduced by more than half with little impact on retrieval-effectiveness .
