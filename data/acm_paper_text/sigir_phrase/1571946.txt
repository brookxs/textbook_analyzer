refined experts : improving classification in large taxonomies while large-scale taxonomies -- especially for web-pages -- have been in existence for some time , approaches to automatically classify documents into these taxonomies have met with limited success compared to the more general progress made in text-classification . we argue that this stems from three causes : increasing sparsity of training-data at deeper nodes in the taxonomy , error-propagation where a mistake made high in the hierarchy can not be recovered , and increasingly complex decision surfaces in higher nodes in the hierarchy . while prior research has focused on the first problem , we introduce methods that target the latter two problems -- first by biasing the training distribution to reduce error-propagation and second by propagating up `` first-guess '' expert information in a bottom-up manner before making a refined top-down choice . finally , we present an empirical-study demonstrating that the suggested changes lead to 10 -- 30 \ % improvements in f1 scores versus an accepted competitive baseline , hierarchical svms .
