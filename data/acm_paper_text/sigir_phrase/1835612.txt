improving sentence-retrieval with an importance prior the retrieval of sentences is a core task within information-retrieval . in this poster we employ a language-model that incorporates a prior which encodes the importance of sentences within the retrieval-model . then , in a set of comprehensive experiments using the trec novelty tracks , we show that including this prior substantially improves retrieval-effectiveness , and significantly outperforms the current-state of the art in sentence-retrieval .
