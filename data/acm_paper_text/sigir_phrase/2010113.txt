analysis of an expert-search query-log expert-search has made rapid progress in modeling , algorithms and evaluations in the recent years . however , there is very few work on analyzing how users interact with expert-search systems . in this paper , we conduct analysis of an expert-search query-log . the aim is to understand the special characteristics of expert-search usage . to the best of our knowledge , this is one of the earliest work on expert-search query-log-analysis . we find that expert-search users generally issue shorter queries , more common queries , and use more advanced-search-features , with fewer queries in a session , than general web-search users do . this study explores a new research direction in expert-search by analyzing and exploiting query-logs .
