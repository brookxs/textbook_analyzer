constant interaction-time scatter/gather browsing of very-large document-collections the scatter/gather document-browsing method uses fast document-clustering to produce table-of-contents-like outlines of large document collections . previous work [1] developed linear-time document-clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large-collections . however , even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive-browsing of very-large collections such as tipster , the darpa standard text-retrieval evaluation collection . we present a scheme that supports constant interaction-time scatter/gather of arbitrarily large-collections after near-linear time preprocessing . this involves the construction of a cluster hierarchy . a modification of scatter/gather employing this scheme , and an example of its use over the tipster-collection are presented .
