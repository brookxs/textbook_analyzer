diversity by proportionality : an election-based approach to search-result-diversification this paper presents a different perspective on diversity in search-results : diversity by proportionality . we consider a result list most diverse , with respect to some set of topics related to the query , when the number of documents it provides on each topic is proportional to the topic 's popularity . consequently , we propose a framework for optimizing proportionality for search-result-diversification , which is motivated by the problem of assigning seats to members of competing political parties . our technique iteratively determines , for each position in the result ranked list , the topic that best maintains the overall proportionality . it then selects the best document on this topic for this position . we demonstrate empirically that our method significantly outperforms the top performing approach in the literature not only on our proposed metric for proportionality , but also on several standard diversity-measures . this result indicates that promoting proportionality naturally leads to minimal redundancy , which is a goal of the current diversity approaches .
