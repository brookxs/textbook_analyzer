out of sight , not out of mind : on the effect of social and physical detachment on information-need the information-needs of users and the documents which answer it are frequently contingent on the different characteristics of users . this is especially evident during natural-disasters , such as earthquakes and violent weather incidents , which create a strong transient information-need . in this paper we investigate how the information-need of users is affected by their physical detachment , as estimated by their physical location in relation to that of the event , and by their social detachment , as quantified by the number of their acquaintances who may be affected by the event . drawing on large-scale-data from three major events , we show that social and physical detachment levels of users are a major influence on their information-needs , as manifested by their search-engine-queries . we demonstrate how knowing social and physical detachment levels can assist in improving retrieval for two applications : identifying search queries related to events and ranking results in response to event-related queries . we find that the average-precision in identifying relevant search queries improves by approximately 18 \ % , and that the average-precision of ranking that uses detachment information improves by 10 \ % .
