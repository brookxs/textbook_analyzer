enhancing topic-tracking with temporal-information in this paper , we propose a new strategy with time-granularity reasoning for utilizing temporal-information in topic-tracking . compared with previous ones , our work has four distinguished characteristics . firstly , we try to determine a set of topic times for a target topic from the given on-topic stories . it helps to avoid the negative influence from other irrelevant times . secondly , we take into account time-granularity variance when deciding whether a coreference relationship exists between two times . thirdly , both publication time and times presented in texts are considered . finally , as time is only one attribute of a topic , we increase the similarity between a story and a target topic only when they are related not only temporally but also semantically . experiments on two tdt corpora show that our method makes good use of temporal-information in news stories .
