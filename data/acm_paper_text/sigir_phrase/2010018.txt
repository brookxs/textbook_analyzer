ranking related news-predictions we estimate that nearly one third of news-articles contain references to future-events . while this information can prove crucial to understanding news stories and how events will develop for a given topic , there is currently no easy way to access this information . we propose a new task to address the problem of retrieving and ranking sentences that contain mentions to future-events , which we call ranking related news-predictions . in this paper , we formally define this task and propose a learning-to-rank approach based on 4 classes of features : term-similarity , entity-based similarity , topic similarity , and temporal-similarity . through extensive evaluations using a corpus consisting of 1.8 millions news-articles and 6,000 manually judged relevance pairs , we show that our approach is able to retrieve a significant number of relevant predictions related to a given topic .
