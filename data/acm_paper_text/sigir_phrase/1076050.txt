server-selection methods in hybrid portal search the trec.gov collection makes a valuable web testbed for distributed-information-retrieval methods because it is naturally partitioned and includes 725 web-oriented queries with judged answers . it can usefully model aspects of government and large corporate-portals . analysis of the.gov data shows that a purely distributed approach would not be feasible for providing search on a.gov portal because of the large number (17,000 +) of web-sites and the high proportion that do not provide a search-interface . an alternative hybrid-approach , combining both distributed and centralized techniques , is proposed and server-selection methods are evaluated within this framework using web-oriented evaluation-methodology . a number of well-known algorithms are compared against representatives (highest anchor ranked page (harp) and anchor weighted sum (awsum)) of a family of new selection-methods which use link anchortext extracted from an auxiliary crawl to provide descriptions of sites which are not themselves crawled . of the previously published methods , redde substantially outperformed three variants of cori and also outperformed a method based on kullback-leibler-divergence (extended) except on topic-distillation . harp and awsum performed best overall but were outperformed on the topic-distillation task by extended kl-divergence .
