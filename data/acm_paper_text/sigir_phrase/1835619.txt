hierarchical pitman-yor-language-model for information-retrieval in this paper , we propose a new application of bayesian-language-model based on pitman-yor-process for information-retrieval . this model is a generalization of the dirichlet-distribution . the pitman-yor-process creates a power-law-distribution which is one of the statistical-properties of word-frequency in natural-language . our experiments on robust04 indicate that this model improves the document retrieval-performance compared to the commonly used dirichlet-prior and absolute discounting smoothing-techniques .
