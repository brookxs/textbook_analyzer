evaluating high-accuracy-retrieval techniques although information-retrieval-research has always been concerned with improving the effectiveness of search , in some applications , such as information-analysis , a more specific requirement exists for high-accuracy-retrieval . this means that achieving high precision in the top document ranks is paramount . in this paper we present work aimed at achieving high accuracy in ad-hoc document-retrieval by incorporating approaches from question-answering (qa) . we focus on getting the first relevant result as high as possible in the ranked list and argue that traditional precision-and-recall are not appropriate measures for evaluatin this task . we instead use the mean reciprocal rank (mrr) of the first relevant result . we evaluate three different methods for modifying queries to achieve high accuracy . the experiments done on trec-data provide support for the approach of using mrr and incorporating qa techniques for getting high accuracy in ad-hoc-retrieval task .
