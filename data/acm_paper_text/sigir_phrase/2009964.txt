why searchers switch : understanding and predicting engine switching rationales search-engine-switching is the voluntary transition between web-search-engines . engine switching can occur for a number of reasons , including user dissatisfaction with search-results , a desire for broader topic-coverage or verification , user-preferences , or even unintentionally . an improved understanding of switching rationales allows search providers to tailor the search experience according to the different causes . in this paper we study the reasons behind search-engine-switching within a session . we address the challenge of identifying switching rationales by designing and implementing client-side instrumentation to acquire in-situ feedbacks from users . using this feedback , we investigate in detail the reasons that users switch engines within a session . we also study the relationship between implicit behavioral-signals and the switching causes , and develop and evaluate models to predict the reasons for switching . in addition , we collect editorial-judgments of switching rationales by third-party judges and show that we can recover switching causes a posteriori . our findings provide valuable insights into why users switch search-engines in a session and demonstrate the relationship between search-behavior and switching motivations . the findings also reveal sufficient behavioral-consistency to afford accurate prediction of switching rationale , which can be used to dynamically adapt the search experience and derive more accurate competitive metrics .
