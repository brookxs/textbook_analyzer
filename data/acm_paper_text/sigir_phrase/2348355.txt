generating reformulation trees for complex-queries search queries have evolved beyond keyword-queries . many complex-queries such as verbose-queries , natural-language-question queries and document-based queries are widely used in a variety of applications . processing these complex-queries usually requires a series of query-operations , which results in multiple sequences of reformulated queries . however , previous query representations , either the `` bag-of-words '' method or the recently proposed `` query-distribution '' method , can not effectively model these query sequences , since they ignore the relationships between two queries . in this paper , a reformulation tree framework is proposed to organize multiple sequences of reformulated queries as a tree-structure , where each path of the tree corresponds to a sequence of reformulated queries . specifically , a two-level reformulation tree is implemented for verbose-queries . this tree effectively combines two query-operations , i.e. , subset-selection and query-substitution , within the same framework . furthermore , a weight-estimation approach is proposed to assign weights to each node of the reformulation tree by considering the relationships with other nodes and directly optimizing retrieval-performance . experiments on trec collections show that this reformulation tree_based representation significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques .
