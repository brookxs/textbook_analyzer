query-processing in a heterogeneous retrieval network the concept of a large-scale-information-retrieval network incorporating heterogeneous retrieval-systems and users is introduced , and the necessary components for enabling term-based searching of any database by untrained end-users are outlined . we define a normal-form for expression of queries , show that such queries can be automatically produced , if necessary , from a natural-language request for information , and give algorithms for translating such queries , with little or no loss of expressiveness , into equivalent queries on both boolean and term-vector type retrieval-systems . we conclude with a proposal for extending this approach to arbitrary database models .
