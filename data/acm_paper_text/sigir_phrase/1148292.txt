on hierarchical web catalog-integration with conceptual-relationships in thesaurus web catalog-integration is an interesting problem in current digital-content management . past studies have shown that using a flattened structure with auxiliary-information extracted from the source catalog can improve the integration results . however , the nature of a flattened structure ignores the hierarchical-relationships , and thus the performance-improvement of catalog-integration may be reduced . in this paper , we propose an enhanced hierarchical-catalog-integration (ehci) approach with conceptual thesauri extracted from the source catalog . the results show that our enhanced hierarchical integration approach effectively boosts the accuracy of hierarchical-catalog-integration .
