the document management component of a multimedia-data model we describe estrella a multimedia-object oriented data-model developed by matra . this model is based upon objects , classes (organized in a lattice) and functions (allow to dynamically implement operations on data and new data-types) . the valid states of the data-base are described by a set of integrity-constraints . we propose a document-model capable to manage structured-documents and to index them with a superimposed-codes method . we present as well the associated data-manipulation-language with a navigational interface and content-search operators
