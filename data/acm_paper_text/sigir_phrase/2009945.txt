who should share what ? : item-level social-influence prediction for users and posts ranking people and information are two core dimensions in a social-network . people sharing information (such as blogs , news , albums , etc.) is the basic behavior . in this paper , we focus on predicting item-level social-influence to answer the question who should share what , which can be extended into two information-retrieval scenarios : (1) users ranking : given an item , who should share it so that its diffusion range can be maximized in a social-network ; (2) web posts ranking : given a user , what should she share to maximize her influence among her friends . we formulate the social-influence prediction problem as the estimation of a user-post matrix , in which each entry represents the strength of influence of a user given a web post . we propose a hybrid factor non-negative-matrix-factorization (hf-nmf) approach for item-level social-influence modeling , and devise an efficient projected gradient-method to solve the hf-nmf problem . intensive experiments are conducted and demonstrate the advantages and characteristics of the proposed method .
