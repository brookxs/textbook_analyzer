the user 's mental-model-of-an-information-retrieval-system an empirical-study was performed to train naive subjects in the use of a prototype boolean logic-based information-retrieval-system on a bibliographic database . subjects were undergraduates with little or no prior computing experience . subjects trained with a conceptual-model of the system performed better than subjects trained with procedural instructions , but only on complex , problem-solving tasks . performance was equal on simple tasks . differences in patterns of interaction with the system (based on a stochastic-process model) showed parallel results . most subjects were able to articulate some description of the system 's operation , but few articulated a model similar to the card catalog analogy provided in training . eleven of 43 subjects were unable to achieve minimal competency in system-use . the failure-rate was equal between training conditions and genders ; the only differences found between those passing and failing the benchmark-test were academic major and in frequency of library use .
