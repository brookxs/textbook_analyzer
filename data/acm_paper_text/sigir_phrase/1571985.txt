learning-to-rank for quantity consensus queries web-search is increasingly exploiting named-entities like persons , places , businesses , addresses and dates . entity-ranking is also of current interest at inex and trec . numerical quantities are an important class of entities , especially in queries about prices and features related to products , services and travel . we introduce quantity consensus queries (qcqs) , where each answer is a tight quantity interval distilled from evidence of relevance in thousands of snippets . entity-search and factoid-question-answering have benefited from aggregating evidence from multiple promising snippets , but these do not readily apply to quantities . here we propose two new algorithms that learn to aggregate information from multiple snippets . we show that typical signals used in entity-ranking , like rarity of query words and their lexical proximity to candidate quantities , are very noisy . our algorithms learn to score and rankquantity intervals directly , combining snippet quantity and snippet text-information . we report on experiments using hundreds of qcqs with ground-truth taken from trec qa , wikipedia infoboxes , and other sources , leading to tens of thousands of candidate snippets and quantities . our algorithms yield about 20 \ % better map and ndcg compared to the best-known collective rankers , and are 35 \ % better than scoring snippets independent of each other .
