evaluation of an extraction-based approach to answering definitional questions this paper evaluates an extraction-based approach to answering definitional questions . our system extracted useful linguistic constructs called linguistic-features from raw text using information-extraction-tools and formulated answers based on such features . the features employed include appositives , copulas , structured patterns , relations , propositions and raw sentences . the features were ranked based on feature-type and similarity to a question profile . redundant features were detected using a simple heuristic-based strategy . the approach achieved state-of-the-art performance at the trec 2003 qa evaluation . component-analysis of the system was carried out using an automatic-scoring function called rouge (lin and hovy , 2003) . major findings include 1) answers using linguistic-features are significantly better than those using raw sentences ; 2) the most useful features are appositives and copulas ; 3) question profiles , as a means of modeling user interests , can significantly improve system-performance ; 4) the rouge scores are closely correlated with subjective-evaluation results , indicating the suitability of using rouge for evaluating definitional qa-systems .
