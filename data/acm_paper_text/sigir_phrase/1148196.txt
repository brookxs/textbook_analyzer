building bridges for web-query-classification web-query-classification (qc) aims to classify web users ' queries , which are often short and ambiguous , into a set of target categories . qc has many applications including page-ranking in web-search , targeted advertisement in response to queries , and personalization . in this paper , we present a novel approach for qc that outperforms the winning solution of the acm kddcup-2005 competition , whose objective is to classify 800,000 real user queries . in our approach , we first build a bridging-classifier on an intermediate taxonomy in an offline mode . this classifier is then used in an online mode to map user queries to the target categories via the above intermediate taxonomy . a major innovation is that by leveraging the similarity distribution over the intermediate taxonomy , we do not need to retrain a new classifier for each new set of target categories , and therefore the bridging-classifier needs to be trained only once . in addition , we introduce category-selection as a new method for narrowing down the scope of the intermediate taxonomy based on which we classify the queries . category-selection can improve both efficiency-and-effectiveness of the online classification . by combining our algorithm with the winning solution of kddcup-2005 , we made an improvement by 9.7 \ % and 3.8 \ % in terms of precision and f1 respectively compared with the best results of kddcup-2005 .
