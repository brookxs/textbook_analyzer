exploration of the tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency for results-merging in federated-search federated-search is the task of retrieving relevant documents from different information-resources . one of the main research problems in federated-search is to combine the results from different sources into a single ranked list . recent work proposed a regression_based method to download some documents from each ranked list of the different sources , calculated comparable scores for the documents and estimated mapping functions that transform source-specific scores into comparable scores . experiments have shown that downloading more documents improves the accuracy of results-merging . however downloading more documents increases the computation and communication costs . this paper proposes a utility_based optimization-method that enables the system to automatically decide on the desired number of training-documents to download according to the user 's need for effectiveness and efficiency .
