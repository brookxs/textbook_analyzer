a multi-criteria content-based-filtering system in this paper we present a novel filtering system , based on a new model which reshapes the aims of content-based-filtering . the filtering system has been developed within the ec project peng , aimed at providing news professionals , such as journalists , with a system supporting both filtering and retrieval capabilities . in particular , we suggest that in tackling the problem of information-overload , it is necessary for filtering systems to take into account multiple aspects of incoming documents in order to estimate their relevance to a user 's profile , and in order to help users better understand documents , as distinct from solely attempting to either select relevant material from a stream , or block inappropriate material . aiming to so this , a filtering model based on multiple criteria has been defined , based on the ideas gleamed in the project requirements stage . the filtering model is briefly described in this paper .
