predicting user interests from contextual-information search and recommendation-systems must include contextual-information to effectively model users ' interests . in this paper , we present a systematic study of the effectiveness of five variant sources of contextual-information for user-interest-modeling . post-query navigation and general browsing-behaviors far outweigh direct-search engine interaction as an information-gathering activity . therefore we conducted this study with a focus on website recommendations rather than search-results . the five contextual-information sources used are : social , historic , task , collection , and user-interaction . we evaluate the utility of these sources , and overlaps between them , based on how effectively they predict users ' future interests . our findings demonstrate that the sources perform differently depending on the duration of the time-window used for future-prediction , and that context overlap outperforms any isolated source . designers of website suggestion systems can use our findings to provide improved support for post-query navigation and general browsing-behaviors .
