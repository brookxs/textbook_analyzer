beyond independent relevance : methods and evaluation-metrics for subtopic-retrieval we present a non-traditional retrieval problem we call subtopic-retrieval . the subtopic-retrieval problem is concerned with finding documents that cover many different subtopics of a query topic . in such a problem , the utility of a document in a ranking is dependent on other documents in the ranking , violating the assumption of independent relevance which is assumed in most traditional retrieval-methods . subtopic-retrieval poses challenges for evaluating performance , as well as for developing effective algorithms . we propose a framework for evaluating subtopic-retrieval which generalizes the traditional precision-and-recall metrics by accounting for intrinsic topic difficulty as well as redundancy in documents . we propose and systematically evaluate several methods for performing subtopic-retrieval using statistical-language-models and a maximal-marginal-relevance (mmr) ranking strategy . a mixture-model combined with query likelihood relevance-ranking is shown to modestly outperform a baseline relevance-ranking on a data-set used in the trec interactive track .
