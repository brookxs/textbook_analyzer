searchresultfinder : federated-search made easy building a federated-search-engine based on a large number existing web-search-engines is a challenge : implementing the programming-interface (api) for each search-engine is an exacting and time-consuming job . in this demonstration we present searchresultfinder , a browser-plugin which speeds up determining reusable xpaths for extracting search result items from html search result pages . based on a single search result page , the tool presents a ranked list of candidate-extraction xpaths and allows highlighting to view the extraction result . an evaluation with 148 web-search-engines shows that in 90 % of the cases a correct xpath is suggested .
