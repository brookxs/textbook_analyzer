exploiting hybrid contexts for tweet segmentation twitter has attracted hundred millions of users to share and disseminate most up-to-date information . however , the noisy and short nature of tweets makes many applications in information-retrieval (ir) and natural-language-processing (nlp) challenging . recently , segment-based tweet representation has demonstrated effectiveness in named-entity-recognition (ner) and event-detection from tweet streams . to split tweets into meaningful phrases or segments , the previous work is purely based on external-knowledge bases , which ignores the rich local-context information embedded in the tweets . in this paper , we propose a novel framework for tweet segmentation in a batch mode , called hybridseg . hybridseg incorporates local-context knowledge with global-knowledge bases for better tweet segmentation . hybridseg consists of two steps : learning from off-the-shelf weak ners and learning from pseudo-feedback . in the first step , the existing ner tools are applied to a batch of tweets . the named-entities recognized by these ners are then employed to guide the tweet segmentation-process . in the second step , hybridseg adjusts the tweet segmentation results iteratively by exploiting all segments in the batch of tweets in a collective manner . experiments on two tweet datasets show that hybridseg significantly improves tweet segmentation quality compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm . we also conduct a case-study by using tweet segments for the task of named-entity-recognition from tweets . the experimental-results demonstrate that hybridseg significantly benefits the downstream applications .
