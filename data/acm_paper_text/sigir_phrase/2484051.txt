an incremental-approach to efficient pseudo-relevance-feedback pseudo-relevance-feedback is an important strategy to improve search accuracy . it is often implemented as a two-round retrieval-process : the first round is to retrieve an initial set of documents relevant to an original query , and the second round is to retrieve final retrieval results using the original query expanded with terms selected from the previously retrieved documents . this two-round retrieval-process is clearly time consuming , which could arguably be one of main reasons that hinder the wide adaptation of the pseudo-relevance-feedback methods in real-world ir systems . in this paper , we study how to improve the efficiency of pseudo-relevance-feedback methods . the basic idea is to reduce the time needed for the second round of retrieval by leveraging the query-processing results of the first round . specifically , instead of processing the expand query as a newly submitted query , we propose an incremental-approach , which resumes the query-processing results (i.e. document accumulators) for the first round of retrieval and process the second round of retrieval mainly as a step of adjusting the scores in the accumulators . experimental-results on trec terabyte collections show that the proposed incremental-approach can improve the efficiency of pseudo-relevance-feedback methods by a factor of two without sacrificing their effectiveness .
