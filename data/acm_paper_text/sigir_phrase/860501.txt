on the effectiveness of evaluating retrieval-systems in the absence of relevance-judgments soboroff , nicholas and cahan recently proposed a method for evaluating the performance of retrieval-systems without relevance-judgments . they demonstrated that the system evaluations produced by their methodology are correlated with actual evaluations using relevance-judgments in the trec competition . in this work , we propose an explanation for this phenomenon . we devise a simple measure for quantifying the similarity of retrieval-systems by assessing the similarity of their retrieved results . then , given a collection of retrieval-systems and their retrieved results , we use this measure to assess the average similarity of a system to the other systems in the collection . we demonstrate that evaluating retrieval-systems according to average similarity yields results quite similar to the methodology proposed by soboroff et ~ al. , and we further demonstrate that these two techniques are in fact highly correlated . thus , the techniques are effectively evaluating and ranking-retrieval-systems by `` popularity '' as opposed to `` performance .
