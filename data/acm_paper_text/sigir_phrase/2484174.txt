boosting novelty for biomedical-information-retrieval through probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis in information-retrieval , we are interested in the information that is not only relevant but also novel . in this paper , we study how to boost novelty for biomedical-information-retrieval through probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis . we conduct the study based on trec-genomics track data . in trec-genomics track , each topic is considered to have an arbitrary number of aspects , and the novelty of a piece of information retrieved , called a passage , is assessed based on the amount of new aspects it contains . in particular , the aspect performance of a ranked list is rewarded by the number of new aspects reached at each rank and penalized by the amount of irrelevant passages that are rated higher than the novel ones . therefore , to improve aspect performance , we should reach as many aspects as possible and as early as possible . in this paper , we make a preliminary study on how probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis can help capture different aspects of a ranked list , and improve its performance by re-ranking . experiments indicate that the proposed approach can greatly improve the aspect-level performance over baseline algorithm okapi-bm25 .
