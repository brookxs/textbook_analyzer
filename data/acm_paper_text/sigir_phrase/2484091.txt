search-result-diversification in resource-selection for federated-search prior research in resource-selection for federated-search mainly focused on selecting a small number of information-sources that are most relevant to a user-query . however , result novelty and diversification are largely unexplored , which does not reflect the various kinds of information-needs of users in real-world-applications . this paper proposes two general approaches to model both result relevance and diversification in selecting sources , in order to provide more comprehensive coverage of multiple aspects of a user-query . the first approach focuses on diversifying the document ranking on a centralized sample database before selecting information-sources under the framework of relevant-document distribution estimation (redde) . the second approach first evaluates the relevance of information-sources with respect to each aspect of the query , and then ranks the sources based on the novelty and relevance that they offer . both approaches can be applied with a wide range of existing resource-selection algorithms such as redde , crcs , cori and big document . moreover , this paper proposes a learning_based approach to combine multiple resource selection-algorithms for result-diversification , which can further improve the performance . we propose a set of new metrics for resource-selection in federated-search to evaluate the diversification performance of different approaches . to our best knowledge , this is the first piece of work that addresses the problem of search-result-diversification in federated-search . the effectiveness of the proposed approaches has been demonstrated by an extensive set of experiments on the federated-search testbed of the clueweb dataset .
