spoken-document-retrieval from call-center conversations we are interested in retrieving information from conversational-speech corpora , such as call-center data . this data comprises spontaneous-speech conversations with low recording quality , which makes automatic-speech-recognition (asr) a highly difficult task . for typical call-center data , even state-of-the-art large-vocabulary-continuous-speech-recognition systems produce a transcript with word-error-rate of 30 \ % or higher . in addition to the output transcript , advanced systems provide word confusion networks (wcns) , a compact-representation of word-lattices associating each word hypothesis with its posterior-probability . our work exploits the information provided by wcns in order to improve retrieval-performance . in this paper , we show that the mean-average-precision (map) is improved using wcns compared to the raw word transcripts . finally , we analyze the effect of increasing asr word-error-rate on search-effectiveness . we show that map is still reasonable even under extremely high error-rate .
