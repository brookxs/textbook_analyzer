an automatic-weighting scheme for collaborative-filtering collaborative-filtering identifies information interest of a particular user based on the information provided by other similar users . the memory-based approaches for collaborative-filtering (e.g. , pearson-correlation-coefficient approach) identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items . in these approaches , different items are weighted either equally or by some predefined functions . the impact of rating discrepancies among different users has not been taken into consideration . for example , an item that is highly favored by most users should have a smaller impact on the user-similarity than an item for which different types of users tend to give different ratings . even though simple weighting methods such as variance weighting try to address this problem , empirical-studies have shown that they are ineffective in improving the performance of collaborative-filtering . in this paper , we present an optimization-algorithm to automatically compute the weights for different items based on their ratings from training users . more specifically , the new weighting-scheme will create a clustered distribution for user vectors in the item space by bringing users of similar interests closer and separating users of different interests more distant . empirical-studies over two datasets have shown that our new weighting-scheme substantially improves the performance of the pearson-correlation-coefficient method for collaborative-filtering .
