understanding the relationship of information-need specificity to search-query-length when searching , people 's information-needs flowthrough to expressing an information-retrieval request posed to asearch engine . we hypothesise that the degree of specificity of anir request might correspond to the length of a search-query . ourresults show a strong correlation between decreasing query lengthand increasing broadness or generality of the ir request . we foundan average cross-over point of specificity from broad to narrow of 3words in the query . these results have implications for searchengines in responding to queries of differing lengths .
