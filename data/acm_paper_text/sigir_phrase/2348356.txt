proximity-based rocchio 's model for pseudo relevance rocchio 's relevance-feedback model is a classic query-expansion method and it has been shown to be effective in boosting information-retrieval performance . the selection of expansion terms in this method , however , does not take into account the relationship between the candidate-terms and the query terms (e.g. , term-proximity) . intuitively , the proximity between candidate expansion terms and query terms can be exploited in the process of query-expansion , since terms closer to query terms are more likely to be related to the query topic . in this paper , we study how to incorporate proximity information into the rocchio 's model , and propose a proximity-based rocchio 's model , called proc , with three variants . in our proc models , a new concept (proximity-based term-frequency , ptf) is introduced to model the proximity information in the pseudo relevant documents , which is then used in three kinds of proximity measures . experimental-results on trec collections show that our proposed proc models are effective and generally superior to the state-of-the-art relevance-feedback models with optimal parameters.a direct comparison with positional-relevance-model (prm) on the gov2 collection also indicates our proposed model is at least competitive to the most recent progress .
