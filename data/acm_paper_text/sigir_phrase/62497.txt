conceptual-representation for knowledge-bases and << intelligent >> information-retrieval-systems this paper describes the conceptual-knowledge representation-language (krl) proper to an environment for the construction and use of large knowledge-bases and/or intelligent-information-retrieval systems . in the krl , we separate the treatment of the episodic-memory (extensional , assertional data = snoopy is charlie brown 's beagle) from the treatment of the semantic memory (intensional , terminological data = a beagle is a sort of hound / a hound is a dog) . a compromise between an object-oriented-approach and a logic-oriented approach is proposed for implementation purposes .
