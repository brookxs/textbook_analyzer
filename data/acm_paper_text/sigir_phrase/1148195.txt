on-line spam-filter fusion we show that a set of independently developed spam-filters may be combined in simple ways to provide substantially better filtering than any of the individual filters . the results of fifty-three spam-filters evaluated at the trec 2005 spam track were combined post-hoc so as to simulate the parallel on-line operation of the filters . the combined results were evaluated using the trec methodology , yielding more than a factor of two improvement over the best filter . the simplest method -- averaging the binary classifications returned by the individual filters -- yields a remarkably good result . a new method -- averaging log-odds estimates based on the scores returned by the individual filters -- yields a somewhat better result , and provides input to svm - and logistic-regression-based stacking methods . the stacking methods appear to provide further improvement , but only for very-large-corpora . of the stacking methods , logistic-regression yields the better result . finally , we show that it is possible to select a priori small subsets of the filters that , when combined , still outperform the best individual filter by a substantial margin .
