introduction to probabilistic-models in ir most of today 's state-of-the-art retrieval-models , including bm25 and language-modeling , are grounded in probabilistic principles . having a working understanding of these principles can help researchers understand existing retrieval-models better and also provide industrial practitioners with an understanding of how such models can be applied to real-world problems . this half-day tutorial will cover the fundamentals of two dominant probabilistic frameworks for information-retrieval : the classical probabilistic-model and the language-modeling-approach . the elements of the classical framework will include the-probability-ranking-principle , the binary independence-model , the 2-poisson-model , and the widely used bm25 model . within language-modeling framework , we will discuss various distributional assumptions and smoothing-techniques . special attention will be devoted to the event spaces and independence assumptions underlying each approach . the tutorial will outline several techniques for modeling term-dependence and addressing vocabulary mismatch . we will also survey applications of probabilistic-models in the domains of cross-language and multimedia-retrieval . the tutorial will conclude by suggesting a set of open problems in probabilistic-models of ir . attendees should have a basic familiarity with probability-and-statistics . a brief refresher of basic concepts , including random variables , event spaces , conditional-probabilities , and independence will be given at the beginning of the tutorial . in addition to slides , some hands on exercises and examples will be used throughout the tutorial .
