viewing online searching within a learning-paradigm in this research , we investigate whether one can model online searching as a learning-paradigm . we examined the searching characteristics of 41 participants engaged in 246 searching tasks . we classified the searching tasks according to anderson and krathwohl 's taxonomy , an updated version of bloom 's taxonomy . anderson and krathwohl is a six level categorization of cognitive learning . research results show that applying takes the most searching effort as measured by queries per session and specific topics searched per sessions . the categories of remembering and understanding , which are lower-order learning levels , exhibit searching characteristics similar to the higher-order categories of evaluating and creating . it seems that searchers rely primarily on their internal knowledge and use searching primarily as fact checking and-verification when engaged in evaluating and creating . implications are that the commonly held notions of web searchers having simple information goals may not be correct . we discuss the implications for web-searching , including designing interfaces to support exploration and alternate views .
