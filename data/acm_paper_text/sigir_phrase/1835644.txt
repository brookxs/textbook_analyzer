a framework for bm25f-based xml-retrieval we evaluate a framework for bm25f-based xml element-retrieval . the framework gathers contextual-information associated with each xml element into an associated field , which we call a characteristic field . the contents of the element and the contents of the characteristic field are then treated as distinct fields for bm25f weighting purposes . evidence supporting this framework is drawn from both our own experiments and experiments reported in related work .
