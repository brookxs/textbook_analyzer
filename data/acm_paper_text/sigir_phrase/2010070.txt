when documents are very long , bm25 fails ! we reveal that the okapi-bm25 retrieval-function tends to overly penalize very-long-documents . to address this problem , we present a simple yet effective extension of bm25 , namely bm25l , which `` shifts '' the term-frequency-normalization formula to boost scores of very-long-documents . our experiments show that bm25l , with the same computation-cost , is more effective and robust than the standard bm25 .
