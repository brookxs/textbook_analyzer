learning-to-rank using query-level regression in this paper , we use query-level regression as the loss-function . the regression loss-function has been used in pointwise methods , however pointwise methods ignore the query boundaries and treat the data equally across queries , and thus the effectiveness is limited . we show that regression is an effective loss-function for learning-to-rank when used in query-level . we use neural-network to model the ranking-function and gradient-descent for optimization and refer our method as listreg . experimental-results show that listreg significantly outperforms pointwise regression and the state-of-the-art listwise method in most cases .
