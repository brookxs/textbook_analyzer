document-identifier-reassignment and run-length-compressed inverted-indexes for improved-search performance text-search engines are a fundamental tool nowadays . their efficiency relies on a popular and simple data structure : the inverted-indexes . currently , inverted-indexes can be represented very efficiently using index-compression schemes . recent investigations also study how an optimized document-ordering can be used to assign document identifiers (docids) to the document database . this yields important improvements in index-compression and query-processing time . in this paper we follow this line-of-research , yet from a different perspective . we propose a docid reassignment method that allows one to focus on a given subset of inverted-lists to improve their performance . we then use run-length-encoding to compress these lists (as many consecutive 1s are generated) . we show that by using this approach , not only the performance of the particular subset of inverted-lists is improved , but also that of the whole inverted-index . our experimental-results indicate a reduction of about 10 % in the space usage of the whole index docid reassignment was focused . also , decompression speed is up to 1.22 times faster if the runs must be explicitly decompressed and up to 4.58 times faster if implicit decompression of runs is allowed . finally , we also improve the document-at-a-time query-processing time of and queries (by up to 12 %) , wand queries (by up to 23 %) and full (non-ranked) or queries (by up to 86 %) .
