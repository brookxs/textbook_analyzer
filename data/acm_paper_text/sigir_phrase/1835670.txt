a co-learning framework for learning user search-intents from rule-generated training-data learning to understand user-search intents from their online-behaviors is crucial for both web-search and online-advertising . however , it is a challenging task to collect and label a sufficient amount of high quality training-data for various user-intents such as `` compare products '' , `` plan a travel '' , etc. . motivated by this bottleneck , we start with some user common-sense , i.e. a set of rules , to generate training-data for learning to predict user-intents . the rule-generated training-data are however hard to be used since these data are generally imperfect due to the serious data bias and possible data noises . in this paper , we introduce a co-learning framework (clf) to tackle the problem of learning from biased and noisy rule-generated training-data . clf firstly generates multiple sets of possibly biased and noisy training data using different rules , and then trains the individual user-search-intent classifiers over different training datasets independently . the intermediate classifiers are then used to categorize the training-data themselves as well as the unlabeled-data . the confidently classified data by one classifier are added to other training datasets and the incorrectly classified ones are instead filtered out from the training datasets . the algorithmic performance of this iterative-learning procedure is theoretically guaranteed .
