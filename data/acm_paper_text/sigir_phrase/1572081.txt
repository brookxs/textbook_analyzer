has adhoc retrieval improved since 1994 ? evaluation forums such as trec allow systematic measurement and comparison of information-retrieval-techniques . the goal is consistent improvement , based on reliable comparison of the effectiveness of different approaches and systems . in this paper we report experiments to determine whether this goal has been achieved . we ran five publicly available search systems , in a total of seventeen different configurations , against nine trec adhoc-style collections , spanning 1994 to 2005 . these runsets were then used as a benchmark for reassessing the relative effectiveness of the original trec runs for those collections . surprisingly , there appears to have been no overall improvement in effectiveness for either median or top-end trec submissions , even after allowing for several possible confounds . we therefore question whether the effectiveness of adhoc information-retrieval has improved over the past decade and a half .
