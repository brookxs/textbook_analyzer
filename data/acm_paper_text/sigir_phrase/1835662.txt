machine learned ranking of entity facets the research described in this paper forms the backbone of a service that enables the faceted-search experience of the yahoo! search-engine . we introduce an approach for a machine learned ranking of entity facets based on user click-feedback and features extracted from three different ranking sources . the objective of the learned model is to predict the click-through-rate on an entity facet . in an empirical-evaluation we compare the performance of gradient-boosted-decision-trees (gbdt) against a linear combination-of-features on two different click-feedback models using the raw click-through-rate (ctr) , and click over expected clicks (coec) . the results show a significant improvement in retrieval-performance , in terms of discounted-cumulated-gain , when ranking-entity-facets with gbdt trained on the coec model . most notably this is true when evaluated against the ctr test-set .
