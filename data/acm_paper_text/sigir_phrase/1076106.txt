relevance-weighting for query independent evidence a query independent feature , relating perhaps to document-content , linkage or usage , can be transformed into a static , per-document relevance weight for use in ranking . the challenge is to find a good function to transform feature values into relevance-scores . this paper presents floe , a simple density-analysis method for modelling the shape of the transformation required , based on training-data and without assuming independence between feature and baseline . for a new query independent feature , it addresses the questions : is it required for ranking , what sort of transformation is appropriate and , after adding it , how successful was the chosen transformation ? based on this we apply sigmoid transformations to pagerank , indegree , url length and clickdistance , tested in combination with a bm25 baseline .
