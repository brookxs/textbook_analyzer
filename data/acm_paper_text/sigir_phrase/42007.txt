probabilistic-search term-weighting - some negative results the effect of probabilistic-search term-weighting on the improvement of retrieval quality has been demonstrated in various experiments described in the literature . in this paper , we investigate the feasibility of this method for boolean-retrieval with terms from a prescribed indexing vocabulary . this is a quite different test setting in comparison to other experiments where linear retrieval with free-text terms was used . the experimental-results show that in our case no improvement over a simple coordination match-function can be achieved . on the other hand , models based on probabilistic indexing outperform the ranking procedures using search-term weights .
