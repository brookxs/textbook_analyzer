automatic suggestion of query-rewrite rules for enterprise-search enterprise-search is challenging for several reasons , notably the dynamic terminology and jargon that are specific to the enterprise domain . this challenge is partly addressed by having domain-experts maintaining the enterprise search-engine and adapting it to the domain specifics . those administrators commonly address user complaints about relevant documents missing from the top matches . for that , it has been proposed to allow administrators to influence search-results by crafting query-rewrite rules , each specifying how queries of a certain pattern should be modified or augmented with additional queries . upon a complaint , the administrator seeks a semantically coherent rule that is capable of pushing the desired documents up to the top matches . however , the creation and maintenance of rewrite-rules is highly tedious and time consuming . our goal in this work is to ease the burden on search administrators by automatically suggesting rewrite-rules . this automation entails several challenges . one major challenge is to select , among many options , rules that are `` natural '' from a semantic perspective (e.g. , corresponding to closely related and syntactically complete concepts) . towards that , we study a machine-learning-classification approach . the second challenge is to accommodate the cross-query effect of rules -- a rule introduced in the context of one query can eliminate the desired results for other queries and the desired effects of other rules . we present a formalization of this challenge as a generic computational problem . as we show that this problem is highly intractable in terms of complexity-theory , we present heuristic approaches and optimization thereof . in an experimental-study within ibm intranet-search , those heuristics achieve near-optimal quality and well scale to large-data-sets .
