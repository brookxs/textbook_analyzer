rating-based collaborative-filtering combined with additional regularization the collaborative-filtering (cf) approach to recommender-system has received much attention recently . however , previous work mainly focuses on improving the formula of rating-prediction , e.g. by adding user and item biases , implicit-feedback and time-aware factors , etc , to reach a better prediction by minimizing an objective-function . however , little effort has been made on improving cf by incorporating additional regularization to the objective-function . regularization can further bound the searching range of predicted ratings . in this paper , we improve the conventional rating-based objective-function by using ranking constraints as the supplementary regularization to restrict the searching of predicted ratings in smaller and more likely ranges , and develop a novel method , called ranksvd + + , based on the svd + + model . experimental-results show that ranksvd + + achieves better performance than existing main-streaming methods due to the addition of informative ranking-based regularization . the idea proposed here can also be easily incorporated to the other cf models .
