modeling search response-time modeling the response-time of search-engines is an important task for many applications such as resource-selection in federated text-search . limited research has been conducted to address this task . prior research calculated the search response-time of all queries in the same way either with the average-response-time of several sample queries or with a single probability-distribution , which is irrelevant to the characteristics of queries . however , the search response-time may vary a lot for different types of queries . this paper proposes a novel query-specific and source-specific approach to model-search response-time . some training-data is acquired by measuring the search response-time of some sample queries from a search-engine . then , a query-specific model is estimated with the training-data and their corresponding response-times by utilizing ridge-regression . the obtained model can be used to predict search response-times for new queries . a set of empirical-studies are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method .
