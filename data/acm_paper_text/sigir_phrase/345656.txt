on the design-and-evaluation of a multi-dimensional approach to information-retrieval (poster session) we present a method of searching text-collections that takes advantage of hierarchrical information within documents and integrates searches of structured and unstructured-data . we show that multidimensional-databases (mdb) , designed for accessing-data along hierarchical dimensions , are effective for information-retrieval . we demonstrate a method of using on-line analytic processing (olap) techniques on a text-collection . this combines traditional information-retrieval and the slicing , dicing , drill-down , and roll-up of olap . we demonstrate use of a prototype for searching documents from the trec collection .
