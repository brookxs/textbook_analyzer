a study on the accuracy of flickr 's geotag data obtaining geographically tagged multimedia items from social-web platforms such as flickr is beneficial for a variety of applications including the automatic creation of travelogues and personalized travel recommendations . in order to take advantage of the large number of photos and videos that do not contain (gps-based) latitude/longitude coordinates , a number of approaches have been proposed to estimate the geographic-location where they were taken . such location-estimation methods rely on existing geotagged multimedia items as training-data . across application and usage-scenarios , it is commonly assumed that the available geotagged items contain (reasonably) accurate latitude/longitude coordinates . here , we consider this assumption and investigate how accurate the provided location-data is . we conduct a study of flickr images and videos and find that the accuracy of the geotag information is highly dependent on the popularity of the location : images/videos taken at popular (unpopular) locations , are likely to be geotagged with a high (low) degree of accuracy with respect to the ground-truth .
