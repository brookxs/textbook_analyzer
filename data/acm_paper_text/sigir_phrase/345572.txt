text-filtering by boosting naive-bayes-classifiers several machine-learning-algorithms have recently been used for text-categorization and filtering . in particular , boosting methods such as adaboost have shown good performance applied to real text-data . however , most of existing boosting algorithms are based on classifiers that use binary-valued features . thus , they do not fully make use of the weight information provided by standard term weighting methods . in this paper , we present a boosting-based learning-method for text-filtering that uses naive-bayes-classifiers as a weak-learner . the use of naive-bayes allows the boosting-algorithm to utilize term-frequency information while maintaining probabilistically accurate confidence ratio . applied to trec-7 and trec-8 filtering track documents , the proposed method obtained a significant improvement in lf1 , lf2 , f1 and f3 measures compared to the best results submitted by other trec entries .
