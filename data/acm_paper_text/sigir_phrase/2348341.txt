explanatory semantic-relatedness and explicit spatialization for exploratory-search exploratory-search , in which a user investigates complex concepts , is cumbersome with today 's search-engines . we present a new exploratory-search approach that generates interactive-visualizations of query concepts using thematic-cartography (e.g. choropleth-maps , heat-maps) . we show how the approach can be applied broadly across both geographic and non-geographic contexts through explicit spatialization , a novel method that leverages any figure or diagram -- from a periodic table , to a parliamentary seating chart , to a world-map -- as a spatial-search environment . we enable this capability by introducing explanatory semantic-relatedness measures . these measures extend frequently-used semantic-relatedness measures to not only estimate the degree of relatedness between two concepts , but also generate human-readable explanations for their estimates by mining wikipedia 's text , hyperlinks , and category-structure . we implement our approach in a system called atlasify , evaluate its key components , and present several use-cases .
