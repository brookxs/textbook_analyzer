users ' stopping behaviors and estimates of recall this paper investigates subjects ' stopping behaviors and estimates of recall in an interactive-information-retrieval (iir) experiment . subjects completed four recall-oriented search-tasks and were asked to estimate how many of the relevant documents they believed they had found after each task . subjects also responded to an interview question probing their reasons for stopping a search . results show that most subjects believed they found about 51-60 \ % of the relevant documents and that this estimate was correlated positively with number of documents saved and actual recall , even though subjects ' recall-estimates were inaccurate . reasons given for stopping search are also explored .
