efficiently decodable and searchable natural-language adaptive compression we address the problem of adaptive compression of natural-language-text , focusing on the case where low-bandwidth is available and the receiver has little processing power , as in mobile-applications . our technique achieves compression ratios around 32 \ % and requires very little effort from the receiver . this tradeoff , not previously achieved with alternative techniques , is obtained by breaking the usual symmetry between sender and receiver dominant in statistical adaptive compression . moreover , we show that our technique can be adapted to avoid decompression at all in cases where the receiver only wants to detect the presence of some keywords in the document . this is useful in scenarios such as selective-dissemination-of-information , news clipping , alert systems , text-categorization , and clustering . thanks to the asymmetry we introduce , the receiver can search the compressed text much faster than the plain-text . this was previously achieved only in semistatic compression scenarios .
