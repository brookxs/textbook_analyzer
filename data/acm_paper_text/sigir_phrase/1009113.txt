a unified-model of literal mining and link-analysis for ranking web-resources web-link-analysis has been proved to provide significant enhancement to the precision of web-search in practice . the pagerank-algorithm , which is used in google-search-engine , plays an important role on improving the quality of its resuls by employing the explicit hyperlink-structure among the-web pages . the prestige of web-pages defined by pagerank is purely derived from surfer random-walk on the-web graph without textual content content consideration . however , in the practical sense , user surfing behavior is far from random jumping . in this paper , we present a unified-model for a more accurate page-rank . user 's surfing is guided by a probabilistic-model that is based on literal matching between connected pages . the result shows that our proposed ranking-algorithms do perform better than the original pagerank .
