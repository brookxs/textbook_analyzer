a document-document similarity-measure based on cited titles and probability-theory , and its application to relevance-feedback retrieval the use of cited title terms of a scientific document for automatic-indexing is explored . it offers a means of index term selection as well as term-relevance weighting , based on author-provided relevance information and bayes theorem as in probabilistic-retrieval . the latter quantitative consideration leads to a new measure of document-document similarity-measure which is shown to have importance both for initial search and in relevance-feedback retrieval , by offering a choice of iterative strategies.extension of the concept of cited title terms to citing title terms shows that these two approaches are compatible with the current two competing models of probability-of-relevance for document-retrieval (robertson <u> et al </u> . 1982) , if a document can also be regarded as a query . their term usage may therefore provide the necessary statistics for parameter-estimation to test both theories .
