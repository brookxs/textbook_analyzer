locality-preserving-indexing for document-representation document-representation-and-indexing is a key problem for document-analysis and processing , such as clustering , classification and retrieval . conventionally , latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) is considered effective in deriving such an indexing . lsi essentially detects the most representative features for document-representation rather than the most discriminative-features . therefore , lsi might not be optimal in discriminating documents with different semantics . in this paper , a novel algorithm called locality-preserving-indexing (lpi) is proposed for document-indexing . each document is represented by a vector with low dimensionality . in contrast to lsi which discovers the global structure of the document space , lpi discovers the local-structure and obtains a compact document-representation subspace that best detects the essential semantic-structure . we compare the proposed lpi approach with lsi on two standard databases . experimental-results show that lpi provides better representation in the sense of semantic-structure .
