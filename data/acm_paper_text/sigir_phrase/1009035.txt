web-page-classification through summarization web-page-classification is much more difficult than pure-text classification due to a large variety of noisy information embedded in web-pages . in this paper , we propose a new web-page-classification algorithm based on web-summarization for improving the accuracy . we first give empirical evidence that ideal web-page summaries generated by human editors can indeed improve the performance of web-page-classification algorithms . we then propose a new web summarization-based classification-algorithm and evaluate it along with several other state-of-the-art text-summarization algorithms on the looksmart web-directory . experimental-results show that our proposed summarization-based classification-algorithm achieves an approximately 8.8 \ % improvement as compared to pure-text-based classification-algorithm . we further introduce an ensemble-classifier using the improved summarization algorithm and show that it achieves about 12.9 \ % improvement over pure-text based methods .
