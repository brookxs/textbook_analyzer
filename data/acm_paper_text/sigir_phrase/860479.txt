table-extraction using conditional-random-fields the ability to find tables and extract information from them is a necessary component of data-mining , question-answering , and other information-retrieval-tasks . documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed , multi-dimensional information . tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language-modeling techniques , however . this paper presents the use of conditional-random-fields (crfs) for table-extraction , and compares them with hidden-markov-models (hmms) . unlike hmms , crfs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language-features , and as a result , they perform significantly better . we show experimental-results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92 \ % f1 , and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94 \ % accuracy . we also discuss future work on undirected-graphical-models for segmenting columns , finding cells , and classifying them as data cells or label cells .
