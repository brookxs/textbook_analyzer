semantic-hashing using tags and topic-modeling it is an important research problem to design efficient and effective solutions for large-scale similarity-search . one popular strategy is to represent data-examples as compact binary codes through semantic-hashing , which has produced promising results with fast-search speed and low storage-cost . many existing semantic-hashing methods generate binary codes for documents by modeling document-relationships based on similarity in a keyword feature-space . two major limitations in existing methods are : (1) tag-information is often associated with documents in many real-world-applications , but has not been fully exploited yet ; (2) the similarity in keyword feature-space does not fully reflect semantic-relationships that go beyond keyword-matching . this paper proposes a novel hashing approach , semantic-hashing using tags and topic-modeling (shttm) , to incorporate both the tag-information and the similarity information from probabilistic-topic-modeling . in particular , a unified-framework is designed for ensuring hashing codes to be consistent with tag-information by a formal latent-factor-model and preserving the document topic/semantic similarity that goes beyond keyword-matching . an iterative coordinate descent procedure is proposed for learning the optimal hashing codes . an extensive set of empirical-studies on four different datasets has been conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed shttm approach against several other state-of-the-art semantic-hashing techniques . furthermore , experimental-results indicate that the modeling of tag-information and utilizing topic-modeling are beneficial for improving the effectiveness of hashing separately , while the combination of these two techniques in the unified-framework obtains even better results .
