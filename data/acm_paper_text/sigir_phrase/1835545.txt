exploring reductions for long web queries long-queries form a difficult , but increasingly important segment for web-search-engines . query-reduction , a technique for dropping unnecessary query terms from long-queries , improves performance of ad-hoc-retrieval on trec collections . also , it has great potential for improving long web queries (upto 25 \ % improvement in ndcg@5) . however , query-reduction on the web is hampered by the lack of accurate query-performance predictors and the constraints imposed by search-engine architectures and ranking-algorithms . in this paper , we present query-reduction techniques for long web queries that leverage effective and efficient query performance predictors . we propose three learning formulations that combine these predictors to perform automatic query reduction . these formulations enable trading of average improvements for the number of queries impacted , and enable easy integration into the search-engine 's architecture for rank-time query-reduction . experiments on a large-collection of long-queries issued to a commercial-search-engine show that the proposed techniques significantly outperform baselines , with more than 12 \ % improvement in ndcg@5 in the impacted set of queries . extension to the formulations such as result interleaving further improves results . we find that the proposed techniques deliver consistent retrieval gains where it matters most : poorly performing long web queries .
