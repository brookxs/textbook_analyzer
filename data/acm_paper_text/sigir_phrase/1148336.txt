concept-based biomedical-text-retrieval one challenging problem for biomedical-text-retrieval is to find accurate synonyms or name variants for biomedical entities . in this paper , we propose a new concept-based approach to tackle this problem . in this approach , a set of concepts instead of keywords will be extracted from a query first . then these concepts will be used for retrieval purpose . the experiment results show that the proposed approach can boost the retrieval-performance and it generates very good results on 2005 trec-genomics data-sets .
