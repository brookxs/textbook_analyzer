collecting high quality overlapping-labels at low-cost this paper studies quality of human labels used to train search-engines ' rankers . our specific focus is-performance improvements obtained by using overlapping relevance-labels , which is by collecting multiple human-judgments for each training sample . the paper explores whether , when , and for which samples one should obtain overlapping training labels , as well as how many labels per sample are needed . the proposed selective labeling-scheme collects additional labels only for a subset of training-samples , specifically for those that are labeled relevant by a judge . our experiments show that this labeling-scheme improves the ndcg of two web-search rankers on several real-world test-sets , with a low labeling overhead of around 1.4 labels per sample . this labeling-scheme also outperforms several methods of using overlapping-labels , such as simple k-overlap , majority-vote , the highest labels , etc. . finally , the paper presents a study of how many overlapping-labels are needed to get the best improvement in retrieval-accuracy .
