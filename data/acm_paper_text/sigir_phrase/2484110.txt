an lda-smoothed relevance-model for document-expansion : a case-study for spoken-document-retrieval document-expansion (de) in information-retrieval (ir) involves modifying each document in the collection by introducing additional terms into the document . it is particularly useful to improve retrieval of short and noisy documents where the additional terms can improve the description of the document content . existing approaches to de assume that documents to be expanded are from a single topic . in the case of multi-topic documents this can lead to a topic bias in terms selected for de and hence may result in poor retrieval quality due to the lack of coverage of the original document topics in the expanded document . this paper proposes a new de technique providing a more uniform selection-and-weighting of de terms from all constituent topics . we show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the most recently reported relevance-model_based de method on a spoken document-retrieval task for both manual and automatic-speech-recognition transcripts .
