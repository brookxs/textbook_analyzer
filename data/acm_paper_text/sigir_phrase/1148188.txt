respect my authority ! : hits without hyperlinks , utilizing cluster-based-language-models we present an approach to improving the precision of an initial document-ranking wherein we utilize cluster information within a graph-based framework . the main idea is to perform reranking based on centrality within bipartite-graphs of documents (on one side) and clusters (on the other side) , on the premise that these are mutually reinforcing entities . links between entities are created via consideration of language-models induced from them.we find that our cluster-document graphs give rise to much better retrieval-performance than previously proposed document-only graphs do . for example , authority-based reranking of documents via a hits-style cluster-based approach outperforms a previously-proposed pagerank-inspired algorithm applied to solely-document graphs . moreover , we also show that computing authority scores for clusters constitutes an effective method for identifying clusters containing a large percentage of relevant documents .
