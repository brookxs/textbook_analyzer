studying trailfinding algorithms for enhanced-web-search search-engines return ranked-lists of web-pages in response to queries . these pages are starting-points for post-query navigation , but may be insufficient for search-tasks involving multiple steps . search-trails mined from toolbar logs start with a query and contain pages visited by one user during post-query navigation . implicit endorsements from many trails can enhance result-ranking . rather than using trails solely to improve ranking , it may also be worth providing trail information directly to users . in this paper , we quantify the benefit that users currently obtain from trail-following and compare different methods for finding the best trail for a given query and each top-ranked result . we compare the relevance , topic-coverage , topic diversity , and utility of trails selected using different methods , and break out findings by factors such as query type and origin relevance . our findings demonstrate value in trails , highlight interesting differences in the performance of trailfinding algorithms , and show we can find best-trails for a query that outperform the trails most users follow . findings have implications for enhancing web-information seeking using trails .
