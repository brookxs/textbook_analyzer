social-annotations : utility and prediction modeling social features are increasingly integrated within the search-results page of the main commercial search engines . there is , however , little understanding of the utility of social-features in traditional search . in this paper , we study utility in the context of social-annotations , which are markings indicating that a person in the social-network of the user has liked or shared a result document . we introduce a taxonomy of social-relevance aspects that influence the utility of social-annotations in search , spanning query classes , the social-network , and content relevance . we present the results of a user-study quantifying the utility of social-annotations and the interplay between social-relevance aspects . through the user-study we gain insights on conditions under which social-annotations are most useful to a user . finally , we present machine-learned-models for predicting the utility of a social-annotation using the user-study judgments as an optimization-criterion . we model the learning-task with features drawn from web-usage logs , and show empirical evidence over real-world head and tail-queries that the problem is learnable and that in many cases we can predict the utility of a social-annotation .
