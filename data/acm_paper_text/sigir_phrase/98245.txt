optimization for dynamic inverted-index maintenance for free-text-search over rapidly evolving corpora , dynamic-update of inverted-indices is a basic requirement . b-trees are an effective tool in implementing such indices . the zipfian distribution of postings suggests space and time optimizations unique to this task . in particular , we present two novel optimizations , merge update , which performs better than straight forward block update , and pulsing which significantly reduces space requirements without sacrificing performance .
