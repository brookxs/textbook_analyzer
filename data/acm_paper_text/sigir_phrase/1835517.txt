proximity-based opinion-retrieval blog post opinion-retrieval aims at finding blog posts that are relevant and opinionated about a user 's query . in this paper we propose a simple probabilistic-model for assigning relevant opinion scores to documents . the key problem is how to capture opinion expressions in the document , that are related to the query topic . current solutions enrich general opinion lexicons by finding query-specific opinion lexicons using pseudo-relevance-feedback on external corpora or the collection itself . in this paper we use a general opinion-lexicon and propose using proximity information in order to capture opinion term relatedness to the query . we propose a proximity-based opinion propagation method to calculate the opinion density at each point in a document . the opinion density at the position of a query-term in the document can then be considered as the probability of opinion about the query-term at that position . the effect of different kernels for capturing the proximity is also discussed . experimental-results on the blog06 dataset show that the proposed method provides significant improvement over standard trec baselines and achieves a 2.5 \ % increase in map over the best performing run in the trec 2008 blog track .
