separate and inequal : preserving heterogeneity in topical authority flows web-pages , like people , are often known by others in a variety of contexts . when those contexts are sufficiently distinct , a page 's importance may be better represented by multiple domains of authority , rather than by one that indiscriminately mixes reputations . in this work we determine domains of authority by examining the contexts in which a page is cited . however , we find that it is not enough to determine separate domains of authority ; our model additionally determines the local flow of authority based upon the relative similarity of the source and target authority domains . in this way , we differentiate both incoming and outgoing hyperlinks by topicality and importance rather than treating them indiscriminately . we find that this approach compares favorably to other topical-ranking methods on two real-world datasets and produces an approximately 10 \ % improvement in precision and quality of the top ten results over pagerank .
