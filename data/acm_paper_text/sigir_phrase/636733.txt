information-retrieval by voice-input and output voice-recognition and synthesis will become increasinglyimportant in the 1980 's for both data-input and output to many computer-systems . however , they are still only successful for special applications where the syntax of the language is precisely defined and the number of words in the language is limited . such a case is a modified form of the query-language for an information-retrieval-system . some early experience with a micro-based information-retrieval-system developed at belfast , called micro-bird , shows that it is not difficult to build a simple voice-interface at low-cost , but its usefulness is still limited with current technology .
