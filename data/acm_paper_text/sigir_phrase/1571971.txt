efficiency trade-offs in two-tier web-search systems search-engines rely on searching multiple partitioned corpora to return results to users in a reasonable amount of time . in this paper we analyze the standard two-tier-architecture for web-search with the difference that the corpus to be searched for a given query is predicted in advance . we show that any predictor better than random yields time savings , but this decrease in the processing-time yields an increase in the infrastructure cost . we provide an analysis and investigate this trade-off in the context of two different scenarios on real-world-data . we demonstrate that in general the decrease in answer time is justified by a small increase in infrastructure cost .
