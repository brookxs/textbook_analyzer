strategies for retrieving plagiarized documents for the identification of plagiarized passages in large document collections we present retrieval-strategies which rely on stochastic-sampling and chunk indexes . using the entire wikipedia corpus we compile n-gram indexes and compare them to a new kind of fingerprint-index in a plagiarism-analysis use-case . our index provides an analysis speed-up by factor 1.5 and is an order of magnitude smaller , while being equivalent in terms of precision-and-recall .
