personalizing search via automated-analysis of interests and activities we formulate and study search-algorithms that consider a user 's prior interactions with a wide variety of content to personalize that user 's current web search . rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption that people will precisely specify their intent when searching , we pursue techniques that leverage implicit-information about the user 's interests . this information is used to re-rank web-search-results within a relevance-feedback framework . we explore rich models-of-user interests , built from both search-related information , such as previously issued queries and previously visited web-pages , and other information about the user such as documents and email the user has read and created . our research suggests that rich representations of the user and the corpus are important for personalization , but that it is possible to approximate these representations and provide efficient client-side algorithms for personalizing search . we show that such personalization algorithms can significantly improve on current web search .
