constructing a text-corpus for inexact duplicate-detection as online document collections continue to expand , both on the web and in proprietary environments , the need for duplicate-detection becomes more critical . the goal of this work is to facilitate (a) investigations into the phenomenon of near-duplicates and (b) algorithmic approaches to minimizing its negative effect on search-results . harnessing the expertise of both client-users and professional searchers , we establish principled methods to generate a test-collection for identifying and handling inexact duplicate-documents .
