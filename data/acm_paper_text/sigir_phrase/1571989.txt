named-entity-recognition in query this paper addresses the problem of named-entity-recognition in query (nerq) , which involves detection of the named-entity in a given query and classification of the named-entity into predefined classes . nerq is potentially useful in many applications in web-search . the paper proposes taking a probabilistic-approach to the task using query-log-data and latent-dirichlet-allocation . we consider contexts of a named-entity (i.e. , the remainders of the named-entity in queries) as words of a document , and classes of the named-entity as topics . the topic-model is constructed by a novel and general learning-method referred to as ws-lda (weakly supervised latent-dirichlet-allocation) , which employs weakly-supervised-learning (rather than unsupervised-learning) using partially labeled seed entities . experimental-results show that the proposed method based on ws-lda can accurately perform nerq , and outperform the baseline methods .
