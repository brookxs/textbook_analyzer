a new probabilistic-retrieval-model based on the dirichlet compound multinomial-distribution the classical probabilistic-models attempt to capture the ad-hoc-information-retrieval problem within a rigorous probabilistic-framework . it has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of the probabilistic-models is the need to estimate a relevance-model . the dirichlet compound multinomial (dcm) distribution , which relies on hierarchical-bayesian-modeling techniques , or the polya urn scheme , is a more appropriate generative-model than the traditional multinomial-distribution for text-documents . we explore a new probabilistic-model based on the dcm distribution , which enables efficient retrieval and accurate ranking . because the dcm distribution captures the dependency of repetitive word occurrences , the new probabilistic-model is able to model the concavity of the score function more effectively . to avoid the empirical-tuning of retrieval parameters , we design several parameter-estimation algorithms to automatically set model-parameters . additionally , we propose a pseudo-relevance-feedback algorithm based on the latent mixture-modeling of the dirichlet compound multinomial-distribution to further improve retrieval-accuracy . finally , our experiments show that both the baseline probabilistic-retrieval algorithm based on the dcm distribution and the corresponding pseudo-relevance-feedback algorithm outperform the existing language-modeling systems on several trec retrieval tasks .
