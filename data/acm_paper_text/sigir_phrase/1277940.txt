dimensionality-reduction for dimension-specific search dimensionality-reduction plays an important role in efficient similarity-search , which is often based on k-nearest-neighbor (k-nn) queries over a high-dimensional feature space . in this paper , we introduce a novel type of k-nn query , namely conditional k-nn (ck-nn) , which considers dimension-specific constraint in addition to the inter-point distances . however , existing dimensionality-reduction methods are not applicable to this new type of queries . we propose a novel mean-std (standard-deviation) guided dimensionality-reduction (msdr) to support a pruning based efficient ck-nn query-processing strategy . our preliminary experimental-results on 3d protein-structure data demonstrate that the msdr method is promising .
