probabilistic latent maximal-marginal-relevance diversity has been heavily motivated in the information-retrieval literature as an objective criterion for result sets in search and recommender-systems . perhaps one of the most well-known and most used algorithms for result-set diversification is that of maximal-marginal-relevance (mmr) . in this paper , we show that while mmr is somewhat ad-hoc and motivated from a purely pragmatic perspective , we can derive a more principled variant via probabilistic-inference in a latent-variable graphical-model . this novel derivation presents a formal probabilistic latent view of mmr (plmmr) that (a) removes the need to manually balance relevance and diversity parameters , (b) shows that specific definitions of relevance and diversity-metrics appropriate to mmr emerge naturally , and (c) formally derives variants of latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) similarity-metrics for use in plmmr . empirically , plmmr outperforms mmr with standard term frequency_based similarity and diversity-metrics since plmmr maximizes latent diversity in the results .
