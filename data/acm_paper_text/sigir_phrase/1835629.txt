investigating the suboptimality and instability of pseudo-relevance-feedback although pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) techniques improve average retrieval-performance at the price of high variance , not much is known about their optimality and the reasons for their instability . in this work , we study more than 800 topics from several test-collections including the trec robust track and show that prf techniques are highly suboptimal , i.e. they do not make the fullest utilization of pseudo-relevant documents and under-perform . a careful selection of expansion terms from the pseudo-relevant document with the help of an oracle can actually improve retrieval-performance dramatically (by > 60 \ %) . further , we show that instability in prf techniques is mainly due to wrong selection of expansion terms from the pseudo-relevant documents . our findings emphasize the need to revisit the problem of term-selection to make a break through in prf .
