improving search result summaries by using searcher-behavior data query-biased search result summaries , or `` snippets '' , help users decide whether a result is relevant for their information-need , and have become increasingly important for helping searchers with difficult or ambiguous search-tasks . previously published snippet-generation algorithms have been primarily based on selecting document fragments most similar to the query , which does not take into account which parts of the document the searchers actually found useful . we present a new approach to improving result summaries by incorporating post-click searcher-behavior data , such as mouse-cursor movements and scrolling over the result documents . to achieve this aim , we develop a method for collecting behavioral data with precise association between searcher intent , document examination behavior , and the corresponding document fragments . in turn , this allows us to incorporate page examination behavior signals into a novel behavior-biased snippet-generation system (bebs) . by mining searcher examination data , bebs infers document fragments of most interest to users , and combines this evidence with text-based features to select the most promising fragments for inclusion in the result summary . our extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our method improves the quality-of-result summaries compared to existing state-of-the-art methods . we believe that this work opens a new direction for improving search-result-presentation , and we make available the code and the search-behavior data used in this study to encourage further research in this area .
