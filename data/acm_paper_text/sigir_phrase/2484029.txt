learning latent friendship propagation networks with interest awareness for link-prediction it 's well known that the transitivity of friendship is a popular sociological principle in social-networks . however , it 's still unknown that to what extent people 's friend-making behaviors follow this principle and to what extent it can benefit the link-prediction task . in this paper , we try to adopt this sociological principle to explain the evolution-of-networks and study the latent friendship propagation . unlike traditional link-prediction approaches , we model link-formation as results of individuals ' friend-making behaviors combined with personal interests . we propose the latent friendship propagation-network (lfpn) , which depicts the evolution progress of one 's egocentric-network and reveals future growth potentials driven by the transitivity of friendship based on personal interests . we model individuals ' social-behaviors using the latent friendship propagation-model (lfpm) , a probabilistic-generative-model from which the lfpn can be learned effectively . to evaluate the power of the friendship propagation in link-prediction , we design lfpn-rw which models the friend-making behavior as a random-walk upon the lfpn naturally and captures the co-influence effect of the friend circles as well as personal interests to provide more accurate prediction . experimental-results on real-world datasets show that lfpn-rw outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches . this convinces that the transitivity of friendship actually plays important roles in the evolution of social-networks .
