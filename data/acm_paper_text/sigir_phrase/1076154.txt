a dual index model for contextual-information-retrieval in this paper , we propose a dual index model for contextual-ir . for each query , we search against both document level and passage level indexes , and use the corresponding merge function to update the weights for both documents and paragraphs by combining the results from both indexes according to the granularity information in metadata . experiments on 2004 trec-data show that a significant improvement can be made by using the dual index model .
