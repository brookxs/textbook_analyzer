from fusion to re-ranking : a semantic-approach a number of works have shown that the aggregation of several information-retrieval (ir) systems works better than each system working individually . nevertheless , early investigation in the context of clef robust-wsd task , in which semantics is involved , showed that aggregation strategies achieve only slight improvements . this paper proposes a re-ranking approach which relies on inter-document similarities . the novelty of our idea is twofold : the output of a semantic based ir-system is exploited to re-weigh documents and a new strategy based on semantic vectors is used to compute inter-document similarities .
