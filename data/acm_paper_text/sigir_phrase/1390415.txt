finding question-answer pairs from online-forums online-forums contain a huge amount of valuable user-generated-content . in this paper we address the problem of extracting question-answer pairs from forums . question-answer pairs extracted from forums can be used to help question-answering services (e.g. yahoo!-answers) among other applications . we propose a sequential-patterns_based classification-method to detect questions in a forum thread , and a graph-based propagation method to detect answers for questions in the same thread . experimental-results show that our techniques are very promising .
