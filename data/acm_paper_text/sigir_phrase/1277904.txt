boosting static-pruning of inverted-files this paper revisits the static term-based pruning-technique presented in carmel et al. , sigir 2001 for ad-hoc-retrieval , addressing different issues concerning its algorithmic design not yet taken into account . although the original technique is able to retain precision when a considerable part of the inverted-file is removed , we show that it is possible to improve precision in some scenarios if some key design-features are properly selected .
