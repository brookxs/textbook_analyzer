iterative translation-disambiguation for cross-language-information-retrieval finding a proper distribution of translation-probabilities is one of the most important factors impacting the effectiveness of a cross-language-information-retrieval system . in this paper we present a new approach that computes translation-probabilities for a given query by using only a bilingual-dictionary and a monolingual-corpus in the target-language . the algorithm combines term association measures with an iterative machine-learning-approach based on expectation-maximization . our approach considers only pairs of translation-candidates and is therefore less sensitive to data-sparseness issues than approaches using higher n-grams . the learned translation-probabilities are used as query-term weights and integrated into a vector-space retrieval-system . results for english-german cross-lingual-retrieval show substantial improvements over a baseline using dictionary-lookup without term-weighting .
