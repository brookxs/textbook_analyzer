hat : a hardware assisted top-doc inverted-index component a novel-hardware assisted top-doc (hat) component is disclosed . hat is an optimized content-indexing device based on a modified inverted index-structure . hat accommodates patterns of different lengths and supports a varied posting list versus term count feature sustaining high reusability and efficiency . the developed component can be used either as an internal slave component or as an external co-processor and is efficient in resource demands as the component controllers take only a minimal percentage of the target device space leaving the majority of the space to term and posting entries . a very high speed integrated-circuit (vhsic) hardware-description-language (vhdl) is used to model the hat system .
