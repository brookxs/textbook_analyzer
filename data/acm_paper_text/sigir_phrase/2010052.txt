a unified-framework for recommendations based on quaternary semantic-analysis social-network-systems such as facebook and youtube have played a significant role in capturing both explicit and implicit user preferences for different items in the form of ratings and tags . this forms a quaternary relationship among users , items , tags and ratings . existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings , or users-items-tags to derive their recommendations . in this paper , we show that ternary relationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations . instead , we model the quaternary relationship among users , items , tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and cast the recommendation problem as a multi-way latent-semantic-analysis problem . a unified-framework for user-recommendation , item-recommendation , tag-recommendation and item rating-prediction is proposed . the results of extensive experiments performed on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our unified-framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in all the four recommendation tasks .
