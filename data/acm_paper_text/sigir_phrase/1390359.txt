resin : a combination of results caching and index-pruning for high-performance web-search-engines results caching is an efficient technique for reducing the query-processing load , hence it is commonly used in real search-engines . this technique , however , bounds the maximum hit-rate due to the large fraction of singleton queries , which is an important limitation . in this paper we propose resin - an architecture that uses a combination of res ults caching and in dex pruning to overcome this limitation . we argue that results caching is an inexpensive and efficient way to reduce the query-processing load and show that it is cheaper to implement compared to a pruned index . at the same time , we show that index-pruning performance is fundamentally affected by the changes in the query traffic that the results cache induces . we experiment with real query-logs and a large-document-collection , and show that the combination of both techniques enables efficient reduction of the query-processing costs and thus is practical to use in web-search-engines .
