exploiting sequential-dependencies for expert-finding we propose an expert-finding method based on assumption of sequential dependence between a candidate expert and the query terms in the scope of a document . we assume that the strength of relation of a candidate to the document 's content depends on its position in this document with respect to the positions of the query terms . the experiments on the official enterprise trec-data demonstrate the advantage of our method over the method based on independence of query terms and persons in a document .
