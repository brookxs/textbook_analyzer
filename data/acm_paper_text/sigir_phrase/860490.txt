relevant-document distribution estimation-method for resource-selection prior research under a variety of conditions has shown the cori algorithm to be one of the most effective resource-selection algorithms , but the range of database sizes studied was not large . this paper shows that the cori algorithm does not do well in environments with a mix of `` small '' and `` very-large '' databases . a new resource-selection algorithm is proposed that uses information about database sizes as well as database contents . we also show how to acquire database-size estimates in uncooperative environments as an extension of the query-based-sampling used to acquire resource descriptions . experiments demonstrate that the database-size estimates are more accurate for large-databases than estimates produced by a competing method ; the new resource ranking-algorithm is always at least as effective as the cori algorithm ; and the new algorithm results in better document rankings than the cori algorithm .
