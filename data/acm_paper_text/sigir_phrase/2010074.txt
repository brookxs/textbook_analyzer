graph-cut_based tag-enrichment in this paper , a graph-cut_based tag-enrichment approach is proposed . we build a graph for each image with its initial tags . the graph is with two terminals . nodes of the graph are full connected with each other . min-cut/max-flow algorithm is utilized to find the relevant tags for the image . experiments on flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed graph-cut_based tag-enrichment approach .
