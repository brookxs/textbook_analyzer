user-modeling for full-text federated-search in peer-to-peer-networks user-modeling for information-retrieval has mostly been studied to improve the effectiveness of information-access in centralized repositories . in this paper we explore user-modeling in the context of full-text federated-search in peer-to-peer-networks . our approach models a user 's persistent , long-term interests based on past-queries , and uses the model to improve search efficiency for future queries that represent interests similar to past-queries . our approach also enables queries representing a user 's transient , ad-hoc interests to be automatically recognized so that search for these queries can rely on a relatively large search radius to avoid sacrificing effectiveness for efficiency . experimental-results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the efficiency of full-text federated-search without degrading its accuracy . furthermore , the proposed approach does not require a large amount of training-data , and is robust to a range of parameter-values .
