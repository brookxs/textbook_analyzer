user-preference choices for complex-question-answering question-answering-systems increasingly need to deal with complex-information-needs that require more than simple factoid answers . the evaluation of such systems is usually carried out using precision - or recall-based system-performance metrics . previous work has demonstrated that when users are shown two search result lists side-by-side , they can reliably differentiate between the qualities of the lists . we investigate the consistency between this user-based approach and system-oriented metrics in the question-answering environment . our initial results indicate that the two methodologies show a high level of disagreement .
