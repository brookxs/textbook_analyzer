identifying points-of-interest by self-tuning clustering deducing trip related information from web-scale datasets has received very-large amounts of attention recently . identifying points-of-interest (pois) in geo-tagged-photos is one of these problems . the problem can be viewed as a standard clustering problem of partitioning two dimensional objects . in this work , we study spectral-clustering which is the first attempt for the pois identification . however , there is no unified approach to assign the clustering parameters ; especially the features of pois are immensely varying in different metropolitans and locations . to address this , we are intent to study a self-tuning technique which can properly assign the parameters for the clustering needed . besides geographical-information , web photos inherently store rich information . these information are mutually influenced each others and should be taken into trip related mining tasks . to address this , we study reinforcement which constructs the relationship over multiple sources by iterative-learning . at last , we thoroughly demonstrate our findings by web-scale datasets collected from flickr .
