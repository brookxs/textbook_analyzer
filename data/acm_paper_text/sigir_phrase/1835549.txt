human-performance and retrieval-precision revisited several studies have found that the cranfield approach to evaluation can report significant performance-differences between retrieval-systems for which little to no performance difference is found for humans completing tasks with these systems . we revisit the relationship between precision and performance by measuring human-performance on tightly controlled search-tasks and with user-interfaces offering limited interaction . we find that human-performance and retrieval-precision are strongly related . we also find that users change their relevance judging behavior based on the precision of the results . this change in behavior coupled with the well-known lack of perfect inter-assessor agreement can reduce the measured performance gains predicted by increased precision .
