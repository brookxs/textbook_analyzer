words-of-interest selection based on temporal-motion-coherence for video-retrieval the `` bag-of-visual-words '' (bow) framework has been widely used in query-by-example video-retrieval to model the visual-content by a set of quantized local-feature descriptors . in this paper , we propose a novel technique to enhance bow by the selection of word-of-interest (woi) that utilizes the quantified temporal-motion-coherence of the visual-words between the adjacent frames in the query example . experiments carried out using trecvid datasets show that our technique improves the retrieval-performance of the classical bow-based approach .
