a large-scale-study of the effect of training-set characteristics over learning-to-rank algorithms in this work we describe the results of a large-scale-study on the effect of the distribution of labels across the different grades of relevance in the training-set on the performance of trained ranking-functions . in a controlled-experiment we generate a large number of training datasets wih different label distributions and employ three learning-to-rank algo - rithms over these datasets . we investigate the effect of these distributions on the accuracy of obtained ranking-functions to give an insight into the manner training-sets should be constructed .
