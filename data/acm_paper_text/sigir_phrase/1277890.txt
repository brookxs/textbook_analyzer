evaluating relevant in context : document-retrieval with a twist the relevant in context retrieval-task is document or article retrieval with a twist , where not only the relevant articles should be retrieved but also the relevant-information within each article (captured by a set of xml elements) should be correctly identified . our main research question is : how to evaluate the relevant in context task ? we propose a generalized average-precision measure that meets two main requirements : i) the score reflects the ranked list of articles inherent in the result list , and at the same time ii) the score also reflects how well the retrieved information per article (i.e. , the set of elements) corresponds to the relevant-information . the resulting measure was used at inex 2006 .
