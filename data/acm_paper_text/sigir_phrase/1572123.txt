searching documentation using text , ocr , and image we describe a mixed-modality method to index and search software-documentation in three ways : plain-text , ocr text of embedded figures , and visual-features of these figures . using a corpus of 102 computer books with a total of 62,943 pages and 75,800 figures , we empirically demonstrate that our method achieves better precision/recall than do alternatives based on single modalities .
