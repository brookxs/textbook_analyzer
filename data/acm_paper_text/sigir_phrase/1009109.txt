context-sensitive-vocabulary and its application in protein-secondary-structure-prediction protein-secondary-structure-prediction is an important step towards understanding the relation between protein sequence and structure . however , most current prediction methods use-features difficult for biologists to interpret . in this paper , we present a new method that applies information-retrieval-techniques to solve the problem : we extract a context-sensitive biological vocabulary for protein-sequences and apply text-classification methods to predict protein-secondary-structure . experimental-results show that our method performs comparably to the state-of-art methods . furthermore , the context-sensitive vocabularies can serve as a useful tool to discover meaningful regular-expression patterns for protein structures .
