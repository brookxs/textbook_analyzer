multi-modal query-expansion for web-video-search query-expansion is an effective method to improve the usability of multimedia-search . most existing multimedia-search engines are able to automatically expand a list of textual query terms based on text-search techniques , which can be called textual query expansion (tqe) . however , the annotations (title and tag) around web-videos are generally noisier for text-only query-expansion and search matching . in this paper , we propose a novel multi-modal query-expansion (mmqe) framework for web-video-search to solve the issue . compared with traditional methods , mmqe provides a more intuitive query-suggestion by transforming tex-tual query to visual-presentation based on visual-clustering . paral-lel to this , mmqe can enhance the process of search matching with strong pertinence of intent-specific query by joining textual , visual and social-cues from both metadata and content of videos . experimental-results on real web-videos from youtube demon-strate the effectiveness of the proposed method .
