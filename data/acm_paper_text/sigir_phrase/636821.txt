monitoring and evaluation of information-systems via transaction-log-analysis transaction-log-analysis represents a powerful methodology which allows examination of both user commands and system responses when conducting an online-information search . machine-readable transaction log tapes from online catalogs are obtained and subsequently analyzed using stochastic pattern developments within parsed user sessions , mathematical-models utilizing markov-chain-analysis and the development of state-transition probability matrices , which illustrate the probability of proceeding from one user or system-state to another state . the objective of monitoring information-systems and using transaction-log-analysis is to discover the extent to which systems are used and to determine the actual user-patterns when conducting an information-search . this in turn can aid in the evaluation of such systems and assist in the improvement of existing and future systems . such analysis can assist in system-design , while the predictive-power of the methodology may allow real-time aids to be developed.as examples of the use of the methodology , patron use and system-response patterns from several online public catalogs have been obtained by transaction log tapes . this paper presents an overview of the methodology , results obtained , and efforts that are being conducted within oclc 's office of research .
