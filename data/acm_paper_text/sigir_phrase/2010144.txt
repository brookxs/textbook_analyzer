bag-of-visual-words vs global image-descriptors on two-stage multimodal-retrieval the bag-of-visual-words (bovw) paradigm is fast becoming a popular image-representation for content-based-image-retrieval (cbir) , mainly because of its better retrieval-effectiveness over global-feature representations on collections with images being near-duplicate to queries . in this experimental-study we demonstrate that this advantage of bovw is diminished when visual-diversity is enhanced by using a secondary modality , such as text , to pre-filter images . the top-surf descriptor is evaluated against compact composite descriptors on a two-stage image-retrieval setup , which first uses a text modality to rank the collection and then perform cbir only on the top-k items .
