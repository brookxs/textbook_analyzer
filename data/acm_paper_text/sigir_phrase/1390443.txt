classifiers without borders : incorporating fielded text from neighboring web-pages accurate web-page-classification often depends crucially on information gained from neighboring pages in the local web graph . prior work has exploited the class labels of nearby pages to improve performance . in contrast , in this work we utilize a weighted-combination of the contents of neighbors to generate a better virtual-document for classification . in addition , we break pages into fields , finding that a weighted-combination of text from the target and fields of neighboring pages is able to reduce classification-error by more than a third . we demonstrate performance on a large dataset of pages from the open-directory-project and validate the approach using pages from a crawl from the stanford webbase . interestingly , we find no value in anchor-text and unexpected value in page titles (and especially titles of parent pages) in the virtual-document .
