effects of out-of-vocabulary-words in spoken-document-retrieval (poster session) the effects of out-of-vocabulary (oov) items in spoken-document-retrieval (sdr) are investigated . several sets of transcriptions were created for the trec-8 sdr task using a speech-recognition-system varying the vocabulary sizes and oov rates , and the relative retrieval-performance measured . the effects of oov-terms on a simple baseline ir-system and on more sophisticated retrieval-systems are described . the use of a parallel-corpus for query and document expansion is found to be especially beneficial , and with this data-set , good retrieval-performance can be achieved even for fairly high oov rates .
