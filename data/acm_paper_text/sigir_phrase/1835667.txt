on the relationship between effectiveness and accessibility typically the evaluation of information-retrieval (ir) systems is focused upon two main system attributes : efficiency-and-effectiveness . however , it has been argued that it is also important to consider accessibility , i.e. the extent to which the ir-system makes information easily accessible . but , it is unclear how accessibility relates to typical ir-evaluation , and specifically whether there is a trade-off between accessibility and effectiveness . in this poster , we empirically explore the relationship between effectiveness and accessibility to determine whether the two objectives i.e. maximizing effectiveness and maximizing accessibility , are compatible , or not . to this aim , we empirically examine this relationship using two popular ir-models and explore the trade-off between access and performance as these models are tuned .
