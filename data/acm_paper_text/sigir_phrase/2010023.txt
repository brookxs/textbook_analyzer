query-suggestions in the absence of query-logs after an end-user has partially input a query , intelligent-search engines can suggest possible completions of the partial query to help end-users quickly express their information-needs . all major web-search engines and most proposed methods that suggest queries rely on search-engine query logs to determine possible query-suggestions . however , for customized-search systems in the enterprise domain , intranet-search , or personalized-search such as email or desktop-search or for infrequent queries , query-logs are either not available or the user base and the number of past user queries is too small to learn appropriate models . we propose a probabilistic mechanism for generating query-suggestions from the corpus without using query-logs . we utilize the document corpus to extract a set of candidate phrases . as soon as a user starts typing a query , phrases that are highly correlated with the partial user-query are selected as completions of the partial query and are offered as query-suggestions . our proposed approach is tested on a variety of datasets and is compared with state-of-the-art approaches . the experimental-results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in suggesting queries with higher quality .
