tag-based object similarity-computation using term space dimension-reduction in this paper , we propose a novel approach for measuring similarity between web-objects . our similarity-measure is defined based on the representation of a web-object as a collection of tags . precisely , we first construct a vector-space in which multiple terms are mapped into a single dimension by using information available from open-directory-project and delicious.com . then we position web-objects in the vector-space and apply the traditional cosine-measure for similarity-computation . we demonstrate that the proposed similarity-computation method is able to overcome the limitation of traditional vector-space approach while at the same time require less computational cost compares to lsi (latent-semantic-indexing) .
