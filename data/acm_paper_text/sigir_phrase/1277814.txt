know your neighbors : web-spam-detection using the-web topology web-spam can significantly deteriorate the quality of search-engine-results . thus there is a large incentive for commercial search engines to detect spam pages efficiently and accurately . in this paper we present a spam-detection system that combines link-based and content-based features , and uses the topology of the-web graph by exploiting the link dependencies among the-web pages . we find that linked hosts tend to belong to the same class : either both are spam or both are non-spam . we demonstrate three methods of incorporating the-web graph-topology into the predictions obtained by our base classifier : (i) clustering the host-graph , and assigning the label of all hosts in the cluster by majority-vote , (ii) propagating the predicted labels to neighboring hosts , and (iii) using the predicted labels of neighboring hosts as new features and retraining the classifier . the result is an accurate system for detecting web-spam , tested on a large and public-dataset , using algorithms that can be applied in practice to large-scale-web-data .
