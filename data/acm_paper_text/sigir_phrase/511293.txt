full text document-retrieval : hebrew legal-texts (report on the first phase of the responsa retrieval project) a full-text-retrieval system was designed for the responsa literature , which is a large-corpus of hebrew legal-cases . the unique problems of the data-base -- mixture of hebrew , aramaic and vernaculars , lack of vowels and punctuation , extreme language-inflection problems , homographs , existence of thousands of grammatical variants of any given keyword -- dictated development of new methods . among them we list `` grammatical-synthesis '' , which synthesizes all grammatical variants of a given keyword ; `` compact kwic '' , which enables the user to have a glimpse of the nature of the search before having performed it ; effective citation-index imbedded in full text searches ; and , in general , extensive use of both positive and negative feedback within a single search run . a number of searches performed on a relatively small data-base gave in each case a recall of 100 \ % . the average-precision was 34 \ % . a kwic of strategic portions of retrieved documents usually enables a quick disposal of non-relevant material .
