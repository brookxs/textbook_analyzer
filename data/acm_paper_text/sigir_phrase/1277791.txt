ranking-with-multiple-hyperplanes the central problem for many applications in information-retrieval is ranking and learning-to-rank is considered as a promising approach for addressing the issue . ranking-svm , for example , is a state-of-the-art method for learning-to-rank and has been empirically demonstrated to be effective . in this paper , we study the issue of learning-to-rank , particularly the approach of using svm techniques to perform the task . we point out that although ranking-svm is advantageous , it still has shortcomings . ranking-svm employs a single hyperplane in the feature-space as the model for ranking , which is too simple to tackle complex ranking problems . furthermore , the training of ranking-svm is also computationally costly . in this paper , we look at an alternative approach to ranking-svm , which we call `` multiple hyperplane ranker '' (mhr) , and make comparisons between the two approaches . mhr takes the divide-and-conquer-strategy . it employs multiple hyperplanes to rank instances and finally aggregates the ranking results given by the hyperplanes . mhr contains ranking-svm as a special case , and mhr can overcome the shortcomings which ranking-svm suffers from . experimental-results on two information-retrieval datasets show that mhr can outperform ranking-svm in ranking .
