a robust-retrieval system of polyphonic music based on chord-progression similarity-retrieval systems for polyphonic music rely on the automatic estimation of similarity between two musical pieces . in the case of symbolic music , existing systems either consider a monophonic reduction based on melody or propose algorithms with high complexity . in this paper , we propose a new approach . musical pieces are represented as a sequence of chords which are estimated from groups of notes sounding at the same time . a root and a mode are associated to each chord . local-alignment is then applied for estimating a similarity-score between these sequences . experiments performed on midi-files collected on the internet show that the system proposed allows the retrieval of different versions of the same song .
