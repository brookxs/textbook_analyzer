measuring concept relatedness using language-models over the years , the notion of concept relatedness has attracted considerable attention . a variety of approaches , based on ontology structure , information-content , association , or context have been proposed to indicate the relatedness of abstract ideas . we propose a method based on the cross-entropy reduction between language-models of concepts which are estimated based on document-concept assignments . the approach shows improved or competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods on two test-sets in the biomedical-domain .
