mining translations of oov-terms from the-web through cross-lingual query-expansion translating out-of-vocabulary (oov) terms is a great challenge for the cross-lingual-information-retrieval and data-driven machine-translation-systems . several approaches have been proposed to mine translations for oov-terms from the-web , especially from pages containing mixed languages . in this paper , we propose a novel approach to automatically translate oov-terms on-the-fly through cross-lingual query-expansion . the proposed approach does not require any web-crawling and has achieved an inclusion rate of 95 \ % and overall translation-accuracy of 90 \ % , outperforming state-of-the-art oov translation techniques .
