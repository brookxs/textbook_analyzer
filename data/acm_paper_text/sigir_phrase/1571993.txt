a proximity-language-model for information-retrieval the proximity of query terms in a document is a very important information to enable ranking-models go beyond the `` bag-of-word '' assumption in information-retrieval . this paper studies the integration of term-proximity information into the unigram-language-modeling . a new proximity-language-model (plm) is proposed which views query terms ' proximity centrality as the dirichlet hyper-parameter that weights the parameters of the unigram document-language-model . several forms of proximity-measure are developed to be used in plm which could compute a query-term 's proximate centrality in a specific document . in experiments , the proximity-language-model is compared with the basic language-model and previous works that combine the proximity information with language-model using linear score-combination . the experiment results show that the proposed model performs better in both top precision and average-precision .
