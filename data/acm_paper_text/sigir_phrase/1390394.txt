retrieval and feedback models for blog-feed-search blog-feed-search poses different and interesting challenges from traditional ad-hoc document-retrieval . the units of retrieval , the blogs , are collections of documents , the blog posts . in this work we adapt a state-of-the-art federated-search model to the feed retrieval-task , showing a significant improvement over algorithms based on the best performing submissions in the trec 2007 blog-distillation task [12] . we also show that typical query-expansion techniques such as pseudo-relevance-feedback using the blog corpus do not provide any significant performance-improvement and in many cases dramatically hurt performance . we perform an in-depth analysis of the behavior of pseudo-relevance-feedback for this task and develop a novel query-expansion technique using the link-structure in wikipedia . this query-expansion technique provides significant and consistent performance-improvements for this task , yielding a 22 \ % and 14 \ % improvement in map over the unexpanded query for our baseline and federated algorithms respectively .
