reliability and verification of natural-language-text on the world-wide-web (abstract only) the hypothesis that information on the web can be verified automatically , with minimal user-interaction , will be tested by building and evaluating an interactive-system . in this paper , verification is defined as a reasonable determination of the truth or correctness of a statement by examination , research , or comparison with similar text . the system will contain modules for reliability ranking , query-processing , document-retrieval , and document-clustering based on agreement . the query-processing and document-retrieval components will use standard ir techniques . the reliability module will estimate the likelihood that a statement on the web can be trusted using standards developed by information scientists , as well as linguistic aspects of the page and the link-structure of associated web-pages . the clustering module will cluster relevant documents based on whether or not they agree or disagree with the statement to be verified . relevant references are discussed .
