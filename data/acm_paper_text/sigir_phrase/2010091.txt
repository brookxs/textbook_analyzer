temporal latent-semantic-analysis for collaboratively-generated-content : preliminary results latent-semantic-analysis (lsa) has been intensively studied because of its wide application to information-retrieval and natural-language-processing . yet , traditional models such as lsa only examine one (current) version of the document . however , due to the recent proliferation of collaboratively-generated-content such as threads in online-forums , collaborative-question-answering archives , wikipedia , and other versioned content , the document generation-process is now directly observable . in this study , we explore how this additional temporal-information about the document evolution could be used to enhance the identification of latent document topics . specifically , we propose a novel hidden-topic modeling algorithm , temporal latent-semantic-analysis (tlsa) , which elegantly extends lsa to modeling document revision-history using tensor-decomposition . our experiments show that tlsa outperforms lsa on word-relatedness estimation using benchmark data , and explore applications of tlsa for other tasks .
