active-feedback in ad-hoc-information-retrieval information-retrieval is , in general , an iterative-search-process , in which the user often has several interactions with a retrieval-system for an information-need . the retrieval-system can actively probe a user with questions to clarify the information-need instead of just passively responding to user queries . a basic question is thus how a retrieval-system should propose questions to the user so that it can obtain maximum benefits from the feedback on these questions . in this paper , we study how a retrieval-system can perform active-feedback , i.e. , how to choose documents for relevance-feedback so that the system can learn most from the feedback information . we present a general-framework for such an active-feedback problem , and derive several practical algorithms as special cases . empirical-evaluation of these algorithms shows that the performance of traditional relevance-feedback (presenting the top k documents) is consistently worse than that of presenting documents with more diversity . with a diversity-based selection-algorithm , we obtain fewer relevant documents , however , these fewer documents have more learning benefits .
