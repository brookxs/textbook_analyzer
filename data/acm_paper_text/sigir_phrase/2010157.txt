quickview : advanced search of tweets tweets have become a comprehensive repository for real-time-information . however , it is often hard for users to quickly get information they are interested in from tweets , owing to the sheer volume of tweets as well as their noisy and informal nature . we present quickview , an nlp-based tweet-search platform to tackle this issue . specifically , it exploits a series of natural-language-processing technologies , such as tweet normalization , named-entity-recognition , semantic-role-labeling , sentiment-analysis , tweet classification , to extract useful information , i.e. , named-entities , events , opinions , etc. , from a large volume of tweets . then , non-noisy tweets , together with the mined information , are indexed , on top of which two brand new scenarios are enabled , i.e. , categorized browsing and advanced search , allowing users to effectively access either the tweets or fine-grained information they are interested in .
