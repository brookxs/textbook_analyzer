entropy-biased models for query-representation on the click-graph query-log-analysis has received substantial attention in recent years , in which the click-graph is an important technique for describing the relationship between queries and urls . state-of-the-art approaches based on the raw click frequencies for modeling the click-graph , however , are not noise-eliminated . nor do they handle heterogeneous query-url pairs well . in this paper , we investigate and develop a novel entropy-biased framework for modeling click graphs . the intuition behind this model is that various query-url pairs should be treated differently , i.e. , common clicks on less frequent but more specific urls are of greater value than common clicks on frequent and general urls . based on this intuition , we utilize the entropy information of the urls and introduce a new concept , namely the inverse-query-frequency (iqf) , to weigh the importance (discriminative ability) of a click on a certain url . the iqf weighting-scheme is never explicitly explored or statistically examined for any bipartite-graphs in the information-retrieval literature . we not only formally define and quantify this scheme , but also incorporate it with the click-frequency and user-frequency information on the click-graph for an effective query-representation . to illustrate our methodology , we conduct experiments with the aol query-log-data for query-similarity analysis and query-suggestion tasks . experimental-results demonstrate that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with our entropy-biased models . moreover , our method can also be applied to other bipartite-graphs .
