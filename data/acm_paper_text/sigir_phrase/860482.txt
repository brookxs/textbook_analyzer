an empirical-study on retrieval-models for different document genres : patents and newspaper articles reflecting the rapid growth in the utilization of large test collections for information-retrieval since the 1990s , extensive comparative experiments have been performed to explore the effectiveness of various retrieval-models . however , most collections were intended for retrieving newspaper articles and technical abstracts . in this paper , we describe the process of producing a test-collection for patent-retrieval , the ntcir-3 patent-retrieval collection , which includes two years of japanese patent applications and 31 topics produced by professional patent searchers . we also report experimental-results obtained by using this collection to re-examine the effectiveness of existing retrieval-models in the context of patent-retrieval . the relative superiority among existing retrieval-models did not significantly differ depending on the document genre , that is , patents and newspaper articles . issues related to patent-retrieval are also discussed .
