polynomial-filtering in latent-semantic-indexing for information-retrieval latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) is a well established and effective framework for conceptual-information-retrieval . in traditional implementations of lsi the semantic structure of the collection is projected into the k - dimensional space derived from a rank - k approximation of the original term-by-document matrix . this paper discusses a new way to implement the lsi methodology , based on polynomial-filtering . the new framework does not rely on any matrix-decomposition and therefore its computational cost and storage requirements are low relative to traditional implementations of lsi . additionally , it can be used as an effective information-filtering technique when updating lsi models based on user-feedback .
