interpretation of coordinations , compound generation , and result-fusion for query variants we investigate interpreting coordinations (e.g. word-sequences connected with coordinating conjunctions such as `` and '' and `` or '') as logical disjunctions of terms to generate a set of disjunctionfree query variants for information-retrieval (ir) queries . in addition , so-called hyphen coordinations are resolved by generating full compound forms and rephrasing the original query , e.g. `` rice im-and export '' is transformed into `` rice import-and-export '' . query variants are then processed separately and retrieval results are merged using a standard data-fusion technique . we evaluate the approach on german standard ir benchmarking data . the results show that : i) our proposed approach to generate compounds from hyphen coordinations produces the correct results for all test topics . ii) our proposed heuristics to identify coordinations and generate query variants based on shallow natural-language-processing (nlp) techniques is highly accurate on the topics and does not rely on parsing or part-of-speech-tagging . iii) using query variants to produce multiple retrieval results and merging the results decreases precision-at-top-ranks . however , in combination with blind-relevance-feedback (brf) , this approach can show significant improvement over the standard brf baseline using the original queries .
