using small xml elements to support relevance small xml elements are often estimated relevant by the retrieval-model but they are not desirable retrieval units . this paper presents a generic-model that exploits the information obtained from small elements . we identify relationships between small and relevant elements and use this linking information to reinforce the relevance of other elements before removing the small ones . our experiments using the inex testbed show the effectiveness of our approach .
