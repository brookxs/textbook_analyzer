ontology-enriched multi-document-summarization in disaster-management in this poster , we propose a novel document-summarization approach named ontology-enriched multi-document-summarization (oms) for utilizing background-knowledge to improve summarization results . oms first maps the sentences of input documents onto an ontology , then links the given query to a specific node in the ontology , and finally extracts the summary from the sentences in the subtree rooted at the query node . by using the domain-related ontology , oms can better capture the semantic-relevance between the query and the sentences , and thus lead to better summarization results . as a byproduct , the final summary generated by oms can be represented as a tree showing the hierarchical-relationships of the extracted sentences . evaluation results on the collection of press releases by miami-dade county department of emergency-management during hurricane wilma in 2005 demonstrate the efficacy of oms .
