using pagerank to infer user-preferences recently , researchers have shown interest in the use of preference-judgments for evaluation in ir literature . although preference-judgments have several advantages over absolute judgment , one of the major disadvantages is that the number of judgments needed increases polynomially as the number of documents in the pool increases . we propose a novel method using pagerank to minimize the number of judgments required to evaluate systems using preference-judgments . we test the proposed hypotheses using the trec 2004 to 2006 terabyte dataset to show that it is possible to reduce the evaluation cost considerably . further , we study the susceptibility of the methods due to assessor errors .
