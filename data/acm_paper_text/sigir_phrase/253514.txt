an approach to multikey sequencing in an equiprobable keyterm retrieval situation we present a simple generalised technique , for sequencing a multi-attribute file , which can be used in a situation where the query pattern is unknown and the term content equiprobable . the method is based on constructing a short spanning path through the records thereby minimising the sum of the hamming distances between them . retrieval-performance is simulated over a range of query expressions and results suggest a significant reduction in the number of block accesses , using this technique , as compared with records randomly distributed over the file space .
