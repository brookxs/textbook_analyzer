building test-collections : an interactive-tutorial for students and others without their own evaluation conference series while existing test-collections and evaluation conference efforts may sufficiently support one 's research , one can easily find oneself wanting to solve problems no one else is solving yet . but how can research in ir be done (or be published !) without solid data and experiments ? not everyone can talk trec , clef , inex , or ntcir into running a track to build a collection . this tutorial aims to teach how to build a test-collection using resources at hand , how to measure the quality of that collection , how to understand its limitations , and how to communicate them . the intended audience is advanced-students who find themselves in need of a test-collection , or actually in the process of building a test-collection , to support their own research . the goal of this tutorial is to lay out issues , procedures , pitfalls , and practical advice .
