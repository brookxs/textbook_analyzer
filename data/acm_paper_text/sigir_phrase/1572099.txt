modeling facial-expressions and peripheral physiological-signals to predict topical-relevance by analyzing explicit & implicit-feedback-information retrieval-systems can determine topical-relevance and tailor search criteria to the user 's needs . in this paper we investigate whether it is possible to infer what is relevant by observing user affective-behaviour . the sensory-data employed range between facial-expressions and peripheral physiological-signals . we extract a set-of-features from the signals and analyze the data using classification-methods , such as svm and knn . the results of our initial evaluation indicate that prediction of relevance is possible , to a certain extent , and implicit-feedback models can benefit from taking into account user affective-behavior .
