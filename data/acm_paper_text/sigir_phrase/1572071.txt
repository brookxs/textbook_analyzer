estimating query-performance using class predictions we investigate using topic-prediction data , as a summary of document-content , to compute measures of search result quality . unlike existing quality measures such as query-clarity that require the entire content of the top-ranked results , class-based statistics can be computed efficiently online , because class-information is compact enough to precompute and store in the index . in an empirical-study we compare the performance of class-based statistics to their language-model counterparts for predicting two measures : query-difficulty and expansion risk . our findings suggest that using class predictions can offer comparable performance to full language-models while reducing computation-overhead .
