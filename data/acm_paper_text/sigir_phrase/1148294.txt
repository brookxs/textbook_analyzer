a new web page summarization-method in this paper , we present a novel multi-webpage summarization algorithm . it adds the graph-based-ranking-algorithm into the framework of maximum-marginal-relevance (mmr) method , to not only capture the main topic of the-web pages but also eliminate the redundancy existing in the sentences of the summary result . the experiment result indicates that the new approach has the better performance than the previous methods .
