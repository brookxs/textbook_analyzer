interactive-retrieval based on faceted-feedback motivated by the commonly used faceted-search interface in e-commerce , this paper investigates interactive-relevance-feedback mechanism based on faceted document-metadata . in this mechanism , the system recommends a group of document facet-value pairs , and lets users select relevant ones to restrict the returned documents . we propose four facet-value pair recommendation approaches and two retrieval-models that incorporate user-feedback on document-facets . evaluated based on user-feedback collected through amazon-mechanical-turk , our experimental-results show that the boolean-filtering approach , which is widely used in faceted-search in e-commerce , does n't work well for text-document retrieval , due to the incompleteness (low recall) of metadata assignment in semi-structured text-documents . instead , a soft model performs more effectively . the faceted-feedback mechanism can also be combined with document-based relevance-feedback and pseudo-relevance-feedback to further improve the retrieval-performance .
