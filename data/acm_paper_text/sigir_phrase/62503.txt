development of a large , concept-oriented database for information-retrieval the development of concept-oriented databases using ai knowledge-representation schemes is proposed as a step towards improving the precision-and-recall of information-retrieval-systems . currently underway is the augmentation of a 238,000 citation database , chemical abstracts (ca) volume 105 , by addition of detailed conceptual information in the form of frames and hierarchies . the initial text-data is parsed using natural-language-processing (nlp) techniques to create frames describing the semantics of the index entries in the database , with the slots in the frames being pointers into a very-large semantic-network of conceptual objects (956,000 objects) . to examine the resultant knowledge-base (kb) , a simple hypertext system is proposed , with the conceptual information serving as pathways to connect related citations .
