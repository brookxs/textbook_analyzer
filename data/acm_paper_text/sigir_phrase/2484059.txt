an experimental-study on implicit social recommendation social-recommendation problems have drawn a lot of attention recently due to the prevalence of social-networking-sites . the experiments in previous literature suggest that social-information is very effective in improving traditional recommendation-algorithms . however , explicit social-information is not always available in most of the recommender-systems , which limits the impact of social recommendation techniques . in this paper , we study the following two research problems : (1) in some systems without explicit social-information , can we still improve recommender-systems using implicit social information ? (2) in the systems with explicit social-information , can the performance of using implicit social information outperform that of using explicit social-information ? in order to answer these two questions , we conduct comprehensive experimental-analysis on three recommendation datasets . the result indicates that : (1) implicit user and item social-information , including similar and dissimilar relationships , can be employed to improve traditional recommendation-methods . (2) when comparing implicit social information with explicit social-information , the performance of using implicit-information is slightly worse . this study provides additional insights to social-recommendation techniques , and also greatly widens the utility and spreads the impact of previous and upcoming social-recommendation approaches .
