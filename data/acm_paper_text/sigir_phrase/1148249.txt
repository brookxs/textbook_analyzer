elicitation of term-relevance feedback : an investigation of term source and context term-relevance feedback has had a long history in information-retrieval . however , research on interactive term-relevance feedback has yielded mixed results . in this paper , we investigate several aspects related to the elicitation of term-relevance feedback : the display of document surrogates , the technique for identifying or selecting terms , and sources of expansion terms . we conduct a between subjects experiment (n = 61) of three term-relevance feedback-interfaces using the 2005 trec-hard collection , and evaluate each interface with respect to query-length and retrieval-performance . results demonstrate that queries created with each experimental interface significantly outperformed corresponding baseline queries , even though there were no differences in performance between interface conditions . results also demonstrate that pseudo-relevance-feedback runs outperformed both baseline and experimental runs as assessed by recall-oriented measures , but that user-generated terms improved precision .
