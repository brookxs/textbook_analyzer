sushi : scoring scaled samples for server-selection modern techniques for distributed-information-retrieval use a set of documents sampled from each server , but these samples have been underutilised in server-selection . we describe a new-server selection-algorithm , sushi , which unlike earlier algorithms can make full use of the text of each sampled document and which does not need training-data . sushi can directly optimise for many common cases , including high precision retrieval , and by including a simple stopping condition can do so while reducing network-traffic . our experiments compare sushi with alternatives and show it achieves the same effectiveness as the best current methods while being substantially more efficient , selecting as few as 20 \ % as many servers .
