incremental diversification for very-large sets : a streaming-based approach result-diversification is an effective method to reduce the risk that none of the returned results satisfies a user 's query-intention . it has been shown to decrease query-abandonment substantially . on the other hand , computing an optimally diverse set is np-hard for the usual objectives . existing greedy diversification algorithms require random-access to the input set , rendering them impractical in the context of large result sets or continuous-data . to solve this issue , we present a novel diversification approach which treats the input as a stream and processes each element in an incremental fashion , maintaining a near-optimal diverse set at any point in the stream . our approach exhibits a linear computation and constant memory complexity with respect to input size , without significant loss of diversification quality . in an extensive evaluation on several real-world-data sets , we show the applicability and efficiency of our algorithm for large result sets as well as for continuous-query scenarios such as news stream subscriptions .
