a subjunctive exploratory-search interface to support media studies researchers media studies concerns the study of production , content , and/or reception of various types of media . today 's continuous production and storage of media is changing the way media studies researchers work and requires the development of new search models and tools . we investigate the research cycle of media studies researchers and find that it is an iterative-process consisting of several search processes in which data is gathered and the research question is refined . changes in the research question , however , trigger new data-gathering processes . based on these outcomes we propose a subjunctive exploratory-search interface to support media studies researchers in refining their research question in an earlier stage of their research . to assess the subjunctive interface we conduct a user-study and compare to a traditional exploratory-search interface . we find that with the subjunctive interface users explore more diverse topics than with the standard interface and that users formulate more specific research-questions . although the subjunctive interface is more complex , this does not decrease its usability . these findings suggest that the subjunctive interface supports media studies researchers . the advantage of a subjunctive interface for exploration suggests a new direction for the development of exploratory-search systems .
