investigating performance predictors using monte-carlo-simulation and score-distribution-models the standard-deviation of scores in the top k documents of a ranked list has been shown to be significantly correlated with average-precision and has been the basis of a number of query-performance predictors . in this paper , we outline two hypotheses that aid in understanding this correlation . using score-distribution (sd) models with known parameters , we create a large number of document rankings using monte-carlo-simulation to test the validity of these hypotheses .
