efficient document-retrieval in main-memory disk access performance is a major bottleneck in traditional information-retrieval-systems . compared to system memory , disk bandwidth is poor , and seek times are worse . we circumvent this problem by considering query-evaluation strategies in main-memory . we show how new accumulator trimming techniques combined with inverted list skipping can produce extremely high-performance retrieval-systems without resorting to methods that may harm effectiveness . we evaluate our techniques using galago , a new retrieval-system designed for efficient-query-processing . our system achieves a 69 \ % improvement in query throughput over previous methods .
