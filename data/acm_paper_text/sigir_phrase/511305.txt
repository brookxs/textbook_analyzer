a balanced-tree storage-and-retrieval algorithm a storage-and-retrieval scheme which places items to be stored at the nodes of a binary-tree is discussed . the tree is always balanced in a certain sense thus insuring that no excessively long search paths can exist . in addition to presenting the storage-and-retrieval algorithms , the deletion problem is also solved . the programming approaches involved yield a non-trivial case-study of list-processing techniques . finally , a cost-analysis is given .
