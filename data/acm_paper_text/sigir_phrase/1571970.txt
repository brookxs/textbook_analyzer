brute-force and indexed approaches to pairwise document-similarity comparisons with mapreduce this paper explores the problem of computing pairwise similarity on document-collections , focusing on the application of `` more like this '' queries in the life-sciences domain . three mapreduce algorithms are introduced : one based on brute-force , a second where the problem is treated as large-scale ad-hoc-retrieval , and a third based on the cartesian-product of postings lists . each algorithm supports one or more approximations that trade effectiveness for efficiency , the characteristics of which are studied experimentally . results show that the brute-force-algorithm is the most efficient of the three when exact similarity is desired . however , the other two algorithms support approximations that yield large efficiency gains without significant loss of effectiveness .
