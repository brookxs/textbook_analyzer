comparing both relevance and robustness in selection of web-ranking functions in commercial search engines , a ranking-function is selected for deployment mainly by comparing the relevance measurements over candidates . in this paper we suggest to select web-ranking functions according to both their relevance and robustness to the changes that may lead to relevance degradation over time . we argue that the ranking-robustness can be effectively measured by taking into account the ranking score-distribution across web-pages . we then improve ndcg with two new metrics and show their superiority in terms of stability to ranking score turbulence and stability in function selection .
