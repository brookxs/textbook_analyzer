exploring term temporality for pseudo-relevance-feedback as digital-collections expand , the importance of the temporal aspect of information has become increasingly apparent . the aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of using long-term temporal-profiles of terms in information-retrieval by enhancing the term-selection process of pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) . for this purpose , two temporal prf approaches were introduced considering only temporal aspect and temporal along with textual aspect . experiments used the ap88-89 and wsj87-92 test-collections with trec-ad-hoc topics 51-100 . term temporal-profiles are extracted from the google-books n-grams dataset . the results show that the long-term temporal-aspects of terms are capable of enhancing retrieval-effectiveness .
