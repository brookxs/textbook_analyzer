you are what you say : privacy risks of public mentions in today 's data-rich networked world , people express many aspects of their lives online . it is common to segregate different aspects in different places : you might write opinionated rants about movies in your blog under a pseudonym while participating in a forum or web-site for scholarly discussion of medical ethics under your real name . however , it may be possible to link these separate identities , because the movies , journal-articles , or authors you mention are from a sparse-relation-space whose properties (e.g. , many items related to by only a few users) allow re-identification . this re-identification violates people 's intentions to separate aspects of their life and can have negative consequences ; it also may allow other privacy violations , such as obtaining a stronger identifier like name and address.this paper examines this general problem in a specific setting : re-identification of users from a public web movie forum in a private movie ratings dataset . we present three major results . first , we develop algorithms that can re-identify a large proportion of public users in a sparse-relation-space . second , we evaluate whether private dataset owners can protect user-privacy by hiding data ; we show that this requires extensive and undesirable changes to the dataset , making it impractical . third , we evaluate two methods for users in a public forum to protect their own privacy , suppression and misdirection . suppression does n't work here either . however , we show that a simple misdirection strategy works well : mention a few popular items that you have n't rated .
