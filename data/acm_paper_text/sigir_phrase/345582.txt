an investigation of linguistic-features and clustering-algorithms for topical document-clustering we investigate four hierarchical-clustering-methods (single-link , complete-link , groupwise-average , and single-pass) and two linguistically motivated text-features (noun-phrase heads and proper-names) in the context of document-clustering . a statistical model for combining similarity information from multiple sources is described and applied to darpa 's topic-detection-and-tracking phase 2 (tdt2) data . this model , based on log-linear regression , alleviates the need for extensive search in order to determine optimal weights for combining input features . through an extensive series of experiments with more than 40,000 documents from multiple news sources and modalities , we establish that both the choice of clustering-algorithm and the introduction of the additional features have an impact on clustering performance . we apply our optimal combination-of-features to the tdt2 test-data , obtaining partitions of the documents that compare favorably with the results obtained by participants in the official tdt2 competition .
