selecting good expansion terms for pseudo-relevance-feedback pseudo-relevance-feedback assumes that most frequent terms in the pseudo-feedback documents are useful for the retrieval . in this study , we re-examine this assumption and show that it does not hold in reality - many expansion terms identified in traditional approaches are indeed unrelated to the query and harmful to the retrieval . we also show that good expansion terms can not be distinguished from bad ones merely on their distributions in the feedback documents and in the whole collection . we then propose to integrate a term-classification process to predict the usefulness of expansion terms . multiple additional features can be integrated in this process . our experiments on three trec collections show that retrieval-effectiveness can be much improved when term-classification is used . in addition , we also demonstrate that good terms should be identified directly according to their possible impact on the retrieval-effectiveness , i.e. using supervised-learning , instead of unsupervised-learning .
