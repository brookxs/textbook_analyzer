pseudo test-collections for learning web-search-ranking functions test-collections are the primary drivers of progress in information-retrieval . they provide yardsticks for assessing the effectiveness of ranking-functions in an automatic , rapid , and repeatable fashion and serve as training-data for learning-to-rank models . however , manual construction of test-collections tends to be slow , labor-intensive , and expensive . this paper examines the feasibility of constructing web-search test-collections in a completely unsupervised manner given only a large web-corpus as input . within our proposed framework , anchor-text extracted from the-web graph is treated as a pseudo query-log from which pseudo queries are sampled . for each pseudo query , a set of relevant and non-relevant documents are selected using a variety of web-specific features , including spam and aggregated anchor-text weights . the automatically mined queries and judgments form a pseudo test-collection that can be used for training ranking-functions . experiments carried out on trec web track data show that learning-to-rank models trained using pseudo test-collections outperform an unsupervised ranking-function and are statistically indistinguishable from a model trained using manual judgments , demonstrating the usefulness of our approach in extracting reasonable quality training-data `` for free '' .
