the impact of solid-state-drive on search-engine cache-management caching is an important optimization in search-engine architectures . existing caching-techniques for search-engine-optimization are mostly biased towards the reduction of random accesses to disks , because random accesses are known to be much more expensive than sequential accesses in traditional magnetic hard-disk-drive (hdd) . recently , solid-state-drive (ssd) has emerged as a new kind of secondary-storage medium , and some search-engines like baidu have already used ssd to completely replace hdd in their infrastructure . one notable property of ssd is that its random-access latency is comparable to its sequential access latency . therefore , the use of ssds to replace hdds in a search-engine infrastructure may void the cache-management of existing search-engines . in this paper , we carry out a series of empirical experiments to study the impact of ssd on search-engine cache-management . the results give insights to practitioners and researchers on how to adapt the infrastructure and how to redesign the caching policies for ssd-based search-engines .
