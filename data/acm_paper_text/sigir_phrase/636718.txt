an intelligent-terminal for implementing relevance-feedback on large operational retrieval-systems research has shown that document-retrieval based on weighting functions and incorporating relevance-feedback may be more effective than retrieval based on boolean combinations . these novel methods have not been adopted by the large operational systems . in this paper , a software-implementation of an ` intelligent-terminal ' is described . it overcomes many of the objections to non-boolean retrieval . it is linked to an operational database via euronet , and includes such features as the weighting of search-terms , the construction and submission of search statements in the common command-language of euronet , and the use of relevance-feedback information to improve retrieval .
