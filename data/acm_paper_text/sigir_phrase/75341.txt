integrated information retrieval in a knowledge-worker support-system this paper describes the design of the information-retrieval facilities of an integrated-information-system called euromath . euromath is an example of a knowledge-worker support-system : it has been designed specifically to support mathematicians in their research work . euromath is required to provide uniform retrieval facilities for searching in a user 's personal-data , in a shared database of structured-documents and in public , bibliographic-databases . the design of information-retrieval facilities that satisfy these and other requirements posed several interesting design-issues regarding the integration of various retrieval techniques . as well as a uniform query-language , designed to be highly usable by the target user-group , the retrieval facilities provide expert intermediary functions , i.e. sophisticated support for the retrieval of bibliographic-data . this support is achieved using a model of the user , a model of the user 's information-need and a set of search-strategies based on those used by human intermediaries . the expert intermediary facilities include extensive help facilities , automatic query reformulation and browsing of a variety of sources of query terms .
