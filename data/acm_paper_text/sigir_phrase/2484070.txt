a novel tf-idf-weighting scheme for effective ranking term-weighting-schemes are central to the study-of-information retrieval-systems . this article proposes a novel tf-idf term-weighting-scheme that employs two different within document term-frequency normalizations to capture two different aspects of term saliency . one component of the term-frequency is effective for short queries , while the other performs better on long-queries . the final weight is then measured by taking a weighted-combination of these components , which is determined on the basis of the length of the corresponding query . experiments conducted on a large number of trec news and web collections demonstrate that the proposed scheme almost always outperforms five state-of-the-art retrieval-models with remarkable significance and consistency . the experimental-results also show that the proposed model achieves significantly better precision than the existing models .
