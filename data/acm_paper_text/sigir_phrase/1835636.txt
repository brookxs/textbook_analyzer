inferring user-intent in web-search by exploiting social-annotations in this paper , we present a folksonomy-based approach for implicit user intent extraction during a web-search process . we present a number of result re-ranking techniques based on this representation that can be applied to any web-search-engine . we perform a user-experiment the results of which indicate that this type of representation is better at context-extraction than using the actual textual content of the document .
