web-query translation via web-log-mining this paper describes a method to automatically acquire query-translation pairs by mining web click-through-data . the extraction requires no crawling or chinese-words segmentation , and can capture popular translations . experimental-results on a real click-through-data show that only 17.4 \ % of the extracted queries are in the dictionary , and our method can achieve 62.2 \ % (in top-1) to 80.0 \ % (in top-5) precision in translating web-queries . moreover , the extracted translations are semantically relevant to the source query , which is particularly useful for cross-lingual-information-retrieval (clir) .
