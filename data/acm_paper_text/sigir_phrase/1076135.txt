probabilistic hyperspace-analogue-to-language song and bruza [6] introduce a framework for information-retrieval (ir) based on gardenfor 's three tiered cognitive-model ; conceptual-spaces [4] . they instantiate a conceptual-space using hyperspace-analogue-to-language (hal [3] to generate higher-order concepts which are later used for ad-hoc-retrieval . in this poster , we propose an alternative implementation of the conceptual-space by using a probabilistic hal space (phal) . to evaluate whether converting to such an implementation is beneficial we have performed an initial investigation comparing the concept combination of hal against phal for the task of query-expansion . our experiments indicate that phal outperforms the original hal method and that better query-term selection-methods can improve performance on both hal and phal .
