learning to cluster web-search-results organizing web-search-results into clusters facilitates users ' quick browsing through search-results . traditional clustering-techniques are inadequate since they do n't generate clusters with highly readable names . in this paper , we reformalize the clustering problem as a salient phrase ranking problem . given a query and the ranked list of documents (typically a list of titles and snippets) returned by a certain web-search-engine , our method first extracts and ranks salient phrases as candidate cluster names , based on a regression-model learned from human labeled-training-data . the documents are assigned to relevant salient phrases to form candidate clusters , and the final clusters are generated by merging these candidate clusters . experimental-results verify our method 's feasibility and effectiveness .
