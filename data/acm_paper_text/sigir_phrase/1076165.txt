assessing the term independence-assumption in blind-relevance-feedback when applying blind-relevance-feedback for ad-hoc document-retrieval , is it possible to identify , a priori , the set of query terms that will most improve retrieval-performance ? can this complex problem be reduced into the simpler one of making independent decisions about the performance effects of each query-term ? our experiments suggest that , for the selection of terms for blind-relevance-feedback , the term independence-assumption may be empirically justified .
