short-text classification in twitter to improve information-filtering in microblogging-services such as twitter , the users may become overwhelmed by the raw data . one solution to this problem is the classification of short-text messages . as short-texts do not provide sufficient word occurrences , traditional classification-methods such as `` bag-of-words '' have limitations . to address this problem , we propose to use a small set of domain-specific features extracted from the author 's profile and text . the proposed approach effectively classifies the text to a predefined set of generic-classes such as news , events , opinions , deals , and private messages .
