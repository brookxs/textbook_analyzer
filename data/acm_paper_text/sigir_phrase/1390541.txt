inferring the most important types of a query : a semantic-approach in this paper we present a technique for ranking the most important types or categories for a given query . rather than trying to find the category of the query , known as query-categorization , our approach seeks to find the most important types related to the query results . not necessarily the query category falls into this ranking of types and therefore our approach can be complementary .
