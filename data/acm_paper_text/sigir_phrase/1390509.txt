modeling expert-finding as an absorbing random walk we introduce a novel approach to expert-finding based on multi-step relevance-propagation from documents to related candidates . relevance-propagation is modeled with an absorbing random walk . the evaluation on the two official enterprise trec-data sets demonstrates the advantage of our method over the state-of-the-art method based on one-step propagation .
