temporal-query substitution for ad-search recently , information-retrieval researchers have witnessed the increasing interest in query-substitution for ad-search . most previous works substitute search queries via content-based query similarities , and few of them take the temporal characteristics of queries into consideration . in this extended abstract , we propose a novel temporal-similarity measurement for query-substitution in ad-search task . we firstly extract temporal-features , such as burst and periodicity , from query frequency curves and then define the temporal-query similarity by integrating these new features with the temporal-query frequency-distribution . compared to the traditional temporal-similarity measurements such as correlation-coefficient , our proposed approach is more effective owing to the explicit extraction of high-level semantic query temporal-features for similarity-measure . the experimental-results demonstrate that the proposed similarity-measure can make the ads more relevant to user-search queries compared to ad-search without temporal-features .
