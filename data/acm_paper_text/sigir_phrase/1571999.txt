a probabilistic topic-based ranking framework for location-sensitive domain-information retrieval it has been observed that many queries submitted to search-engines are location-sensitive . traditional search-techniques fail to interpret the significance of such geographical clues and as such are unable to return highly relevant search-results . although there have been efforts in the literature to support location-aware information-retrieval , critical challenges still remain in terms of search result quality and data scalability . in this paper , we propose an innovative probabilistic-ranking framework for domain-information retrieval where users are interested in a set of location-sensitive topics . our proposed method recognizes the geographical-distribution of topic influence in the process of ranking documents and models it accurately using probabilistic gaussian-process classifiers . additionally , we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking framework by implementing it in a web-search service for nba news . extensive performance-evaluation is performed on real web-document collections , which confirms that our proposed mechanism works significantly better (around 29.7 \ % averagely using dcg20 measure) than other popular location-aware information-retrieval-techniques in ranking quality .
