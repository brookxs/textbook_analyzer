spacious : an interactive mental search-interface we introduce in this work a novel approach for semantic-indexing and mental-image search . given semantic-concepts defined by few training-examples , our formulation is transductive and learns a mapping from an initial ambient space , related to low level visual-features , to an output space spanned by a well defined semantic basis where data can be easily explored . with this method , searching for a mental visual target reduces to scanning data according to their coordinates in the learned semantic-space . we illustrate the proposed method through our graphical-user-interface `` spacious '' , for the purpose of visualization and interactive-navigation in generic image-databases and satellite-images .
