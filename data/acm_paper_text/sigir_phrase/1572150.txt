when is query-performance-prediction effective ? the utility of query-performance-prediction (qpp) methods is commonly evaluated by reporting correlation coefficients to denote how well the methods perform at predicting the retrieval-performance of a set of queries . however , a quintessential question remains unexplored : how strong does the correlation need to be in order to realize an increase in retrieval-performance ? in this work , we address this question in the context of selective query-expansion (sqe) and perform a large-scale experiment . the results show that to consistently and predictably improve retrieval-effectiveness in the ideal sqe setting , a kendall 's tau correlation of tau > = 0.5 is required , a threshold which most existing query-performance-prediction methods fail to reach .
