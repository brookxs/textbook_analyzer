multiple-signal duplicate-detection for search-evaluation we consider the problem of duplicate-document-detection for search-evaluation . given a query and a small number of web results for that query , we show how to detect duplicate web-documents with precision ~ 0.91 and recall ~ 77 . in contrast , charikar 's algorithm , designed for duplicate-detection in an indexing pipeline , achieves precision ~ 0.91 but with a recall of ~ 0.58 . our improvement in recall while maintaining high precision comes from combining three ideas . first , because we are only concerned with duplicate-detection among results for the same query , the number of pairwise-comparisons is small . therefore we can afford to compute multiple pairwise signals for each pair of documents . a model learned with standard machine-learning techniques improves recall to ~ 0.68 with precision ~ 0.90 . second , most duplicate-detection has focused on text-analysis of the html contents of a document . in some web-pages the html is not a good indicator of the final contents of the page . we use extended fetching techniques to fill in frames and execute java-script . including signals based on our richer fetches further improves the recall to ~ 0.75 and the precision to ~ 0.91 . finally , we also explore using signals based on the query . comparing contextual-snippets based on the richer fetches improves the recall to ~ 0.77 . we show that the overall accuracy of this final model approaches that of human judges .
