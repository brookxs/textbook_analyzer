a summarisation logic for structured-documents the logical approach to information-retrieval tries to model the relevance of a document given a query as the logical implication between documents and queries . in early work , van rijsbergen states that the retrieval status value of a document given a query is proportional to the degree of implication between a document and a query . based on this , several probabilistic logics for information-retrieval have been conceived , which add an additional layer of abstraction to the information-retrieval-task : probabilistic-models for the retrieval of documents are expressed in those logics , rather than implemented directly . the aim of the research presented here is to develop a logic for the ir task of document-summarisation . such a summarisation logic adds an abstraction-layer to the summarisation task , similarly to the way a logic for document-retrieval adds a layer to the retrieval-task . probabilistic-models for document-summarisation will thus be expressed as logical-formulae , with the actual implementation hidden by the logical expressions . the `` extract-worthyness '' of textual components in this logic is measured as the degree of implication from those textual components to their surrounding contexts , providing a measure of how much said components are `` about '' the context within which they are situated .
