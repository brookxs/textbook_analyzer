freshness matters : in flowers , food , and web authority the collective contributions of billions of users across the globe each day result in an ever-changing web . in verticals like news and real-time-search , recency is an obvious significant factor for ranking . however , traditional link-based web-ranking algorithms typically run on a single web snapshot without concern for user-activities associated with the dynamics of web-pages and links . therefore , a stale page popular many years ago may still achieve a high authority score due to its accumulated in-links . to remedy this situation , we propose a temporal web link-based-ranking scheme , which incorporates features from historical author activities . we quantify web-page freshness over time from page and in-link activity , and design a web surfer-model that incorporates web-freshness , based on a temporal web graph composed of multiple web snapshots at different time points . it includes authority propagation among snapshots , enabling link-structures at distinct time points to influence each other when estimating web-page authority . experiments on a real-world archival-web corpus show our approach improves upon pagerank in both relevance and freshness of the search-results .
