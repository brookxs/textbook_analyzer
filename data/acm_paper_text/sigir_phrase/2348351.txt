what reviews are satisfactory : novel features for automatic helpfulness voting this paper focuses on exploring the features of product-reviews that satisfy users , by which to improve the automatic helpfulness voting for the reviews on commercial-websites . compared to the previous work , which single-mindedly adopts the textual-features to assess the review-helpfulness , we propose that user-preferences are more explicit clues to infer the opinions of users on the review-helpfulness . by using the user-preference_based features , we firstly implement a binary helpfulness_based review-classification system to divide helpful reviews and useless , and on the basis , we secondly build a ranking-svm based automatic helpfulness voting-system (ahv) which rank reviews based on their helpfulness . experiments used a large-scale dataset containing over 34,266 reviews on 1289 products to test the systems , which achieves promising performances with accuracy of up to 0.72 and ndcg@10 of 0.25 , and at least 9 % accuracy improvement compared to the textual-feature based helpfulness assessment .
