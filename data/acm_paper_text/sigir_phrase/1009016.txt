gap : a factor model for discrete data we present a probabilistic-model for a document-corpus that combines many of the desirable features of previous models . the model is called `` gap '' for gamma-poisson , the distributions of the first and last random-variable . gap is a factor model , that is it gives an approximate-factorization of the document-term matrix into a product of matrices ? and x . these factors have strictly non-negative terms . gap is a generative probabilistic model that assigns finite probabilities to documents in a corpus . it can be computed with an efficient and simple em recurrence . for a suitable choice of parameters , the gap factorization maximizes independence between the factors . so it can be used as an independent-component algorithm adapted to document data . the form of the gap model is empirically as well as analytically motivated . it gives very accurate results as a probabilistic-model (measured via perplexity) and as a retrieval-model . the gap model projects documents and terms into a low-dimensional space of `` themes , '' and models texts as `` passages '' of terms on the same theme .
