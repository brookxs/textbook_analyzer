semantic-tag recommendation using concept-model the common tags given by multiple-users to a particular document are often semantically relevant to the document and each tag represents a specific topic . in this paper , we attempt to emulate human tagging behavior to recommend tags by considering the concepts contained in documents . specifically , we represent each document using a few most relevant concepts contained in the document , where the concept-space is derived from wikipedia . tags are then recommended based on the tag-concept model derived from the annotated documents of each tag . evaluated on a delicious dataset of more than 53k documents , the proposed technique achieved comparable tag-recommendation accuracy as the state-of-the-art , while yielding an order of magnitude speed-up .
