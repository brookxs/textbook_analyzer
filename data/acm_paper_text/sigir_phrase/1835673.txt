a survival-modeling approach to biomedical-search result-diversification using wikipedia in this paper , we propose a probabilistic survival model derived from the survival-analysis theory for measuring aspect novelty . the retrieved documents ' query-relevance and novelty are combined at the aspect level for re-ranking . experiments conducted on the trec 2006 and 2007 genomics collections demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in promoting ranking diversity for biomedical-information-retrieval .
