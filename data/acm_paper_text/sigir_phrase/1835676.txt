learning-to-rank-for-information-retrieval this tutorial is concerned with a comprehensive introduction to the research area of learning-to-rank-for-information-retrieval . in the first part of the tutorial , we will introduce three major approaches to learning-to-rank , i.e. , the pointwise , pairwise , and listwise approaches , analyze the relationship between the loss-functions used in these approaches and the widely-used ir-evaluation measures , evaluate the performance of these approaches on the letor benchmark datasets , and demonstrate how to use these approaches to solve real ranking applications . in the second part of the tutorial , we will discuss some advanced topics regarding learning-to-rank , such as relational ranking , diverse ranking , semi-supervised-ranking , transfer-ranking , query-dependent ranking , and training-data preprocessing . in the third part , we will briefly mention the recent advances on statistical-learning-theory for ranking , which explain the generalization ability and statistical consistency of different ranking methods . in the last part , we will conclude the tutorial and show several future-research directions .
