idf revisited : a simple new derivation within the robertson-sp rck jones probabilistic-model there have been a number of prior attempts to theoretically justify the effectiveness of the inverse-document-frequency (idf) . those that take as their starting point robertson and sparck jones 's probabilistic-model are based on strong or complex assumptions . we show that a more intuitively plausible assumption suffices . moreover , the new assumption , while conceptually very simple , provides a solution to an estimation problem that had been deemed intractable by robertson and walker (1997) .
