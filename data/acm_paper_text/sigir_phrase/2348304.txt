combining inverted-indices and structured-search for ad-hoc object-retrieval retrieving semi-structured entities to answer keyword-queries is an increasingly important feature of many modern web-applications . the fast-growing linked-open-data (lod) movement makes it possible to crawl and index very-large amounts of structured-data describing hundreds of millions of entities . however , entity-retrieval approaches have yet to find efficient and effective ways of ranking and navigating through those large-data-sets . in this paper , we address the problem of ad-hoc object-retrieval over large-scale lod data by proposing a hybrid-approach that combines ir and structured-search techniques . specifically , we propose an architecture that exploits an inverted-index to answer keyword-queries as well as a semi-structured-database to improve the search-effectiveness by automatically generating queries over the lod graph . experimental-results show that our ranking-algorithms exploiting both ir and graph indices outperform state-of-the-art entity-retrieval techniques by up to 25 % over the bm25 baseline .
