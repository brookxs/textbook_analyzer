why spectral retrieval works we argue that the ability to identify pairs of related terms is at the heart of what makes spectral retrieval work in practice . schemes such as latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) and its descendants have this ability in the sense that they can be viewed as computing a matrix of term-term relatedness scores which is then used to expand the given documents (not the queries) . for almost all existing spectral retrieval schemes , this matrix of relatedness scores depends on a fixed low-dimensional subspace of the original term space . we instead vary the dimension and study for each term pair the resultin curve-of-relatedness-scores . we find that it is actually the shape of this curve which is indicative for the term-pair relatedness , and not any of the individual relatedness scores on the curve . we derive two simple , parameterless algorithms that detect this shape and that consistently outperform previous methods on a number of test-collections . our curves also shed light on the effectiveness of three fundamental types of variations of the basic lsi scheme .
