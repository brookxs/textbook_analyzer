active-learning for ranking through expected-loss-optimization learning-to-rank arises in many information-retrieval applications , ranging from web-search-engine , online-advertising to recommendation-system . in learning-to-rank , the performance of a ranking-model is strongly affected by the number of labeled examples in the training-set ; on the other hand , obtaining labeled examples for training-data is very expensive and time-consuming . this presents a great need for the active-learning approaches to select most informative examples for ranking-learning ; however , in the literature there is still very limited work to address active-learning for ranking . in this paper , we propose a general active-learning framework , expected-loss-optimization (elo) , for ranking . the elo framework is applicable to a wide range of ranking-functions . under this framework , we derive a novel algorithm , expected dcg loss optimization (elo-dcg) , to select most informative examples . furthermore , we investigate both query and document level active-learning for raking and propose a two-stage elo-dcg algorithm which incorporate both query and document selection into active-learning . extensive experiments on real-world web-search data-sets have demonstrated great potential and effective-ness of the proposed framework-and-algorithms .
