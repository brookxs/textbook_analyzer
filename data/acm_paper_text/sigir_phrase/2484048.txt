competence-based song recommendation singing is a popular social-activity and a good way of expressing one 's feelings . one important reason for unsuccessful singing performance is because the singer fails to choose a suitable song . in this paper , we propose a novel singing competence-based song recommendation framework . it is distinguished from most existing music-recommendation systems which rely on the computation of listeners ' interests or similarity . we model a singer 's vocal competence as singer profile , which takes voice pitch , intensity , and-quality into consideration . then we propose techniques to acquire singer profiles . we also present a song profile model which is used to construct a human annotated song database . finally , we propose a learning-to-rank scheme for recommending songs by singer profile . the experimental-study on real singers demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over two baseline methods . to the best of our knowledge , our work is the first to study competence-based song recommendation .
