evaluation of a simple and effective music-information-retrieval method we developed , and then evaluated , a music-information-retrieval (mir) system based upon the intervals found within the melodies of a collection of 9354 folksongs . the songs were converted to an interval-only representation of monophonic melodies and then fragmented t into length-n subsections called n-grams . the length of these n-grams and the degree to which we precisely represent the intervals are variables analyzed in this paper . we constructed a collection of musical word databases using the text-based , smart information-retrieval-system . a group of simulated queries , some of which contained simulated errors , was run against these databases . the results were evaluated using the normalized precision and normalized recall measures . our concept of musical words shows great merit thus implying that useful mir systems can be constructed simply and efficiently using pre-existing text-based-information-retrieval software . second , this study is a formal and comprehensive evaluation of a mir system using rigorous statistical analyses to determine retrieval-effectiveness .
