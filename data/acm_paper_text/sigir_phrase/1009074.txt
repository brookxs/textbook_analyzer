classifying racist texts using a support-vector-machine in this poster we present an overview of the techniques we used to develop and evaluate a text-categorisation system to automatically classify racist texts . detecting racism is difficult because the presence of indicator words is insufficient to indicate racist texts , unlike some other text-classification tasks . support-vector-machines (svm) are used to automatically categorise web-pages based on whether or not they are racist . different interpretations of what constitutes a term are taken , and in this poster we look at three representations of a web-page within an svm -- bag-of-words , bigrams and part-of-speech-tags .
