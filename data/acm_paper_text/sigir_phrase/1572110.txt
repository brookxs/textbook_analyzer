predicting stopping-behaviour : a preliminary analysis the analysis of search transaction-logs often characterizes a search-session but rarely looks at the end point . when do users stop , and what cues are present suggesting that stopping is eminent ? in this preliminary analysis of the logs of 288 search-sessions conducted in a laboratory setting , we identified the activity performed by participants as well as search transitions that were invoked over the course of a search-session . the 4331 search transitions (15 per task on average) contained a total of 9295 actions . we isolated the final transition in each search-session for detailed analysis . as hypothesized some behaviours are predictable , and suggestive of stopping-behavior , with the potential for modeling .
