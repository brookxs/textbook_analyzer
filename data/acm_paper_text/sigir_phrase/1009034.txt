feature-selection using linear classifier weights : interaction with classification-models this paper explores feature-scoring and selection based on weights from linear-classification models . it investigates how these methods combine with various learning-models . our comparative-analysis includes three learning-algorithms : na ve-bayes , perceptron , and support-vector-machines (svm) in combination with three feature-weighting methods : odds ratio , information-gain , and weights from linear-models , the linear-svm and perceptron . experiments show that feature-selection using weights from linear svms yields better classification-performance than other feature-weighting methods when combined with the three explored learning-algorithms . the results support the conjecture that it is the sophistication of the feature-weighting method rather than its apparent compatibility with the learning-algorithm that improves classification-performance .
