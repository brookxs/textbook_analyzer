discriminative probabilistic-models for passage_based retrieval the approach of using passage-level evidence for document-retrieval has shown mixed results when it is applied to a variety of test beds with different characteristics . one main reason of the inconsistent performance is that there exists no unified-framework to model the evidence of individual passages within a document . this paper proposes two probabilistic-models to formally model the evidence of a set of top ranked passages in a document . the first probabilistic-model follows the retrieval criterion that a document is relevant if any passage in the document is relevant , and models each passage independently . the second probabilistic-model goes a step further and incorporates the similarity correlations among the passages . both models are trained in a discriminative manner . furthermore , we present a combination approach to combine the ranked-lists of document-retrieval and passage-based retrieval . an extensive set of experiments have been conducted on four different trec test beds to show the effectiveness of the proposed discriminative probabilistic-models for passage-based retrieval . the proposed algorithms are compared with a state-of-the-art document-retrieval algorithm and a language-model-approach for passage-based retrieval . furthermore , our combined approach has been shown to provide better results than both document-retrieval and passage-based retrieval approaches .
