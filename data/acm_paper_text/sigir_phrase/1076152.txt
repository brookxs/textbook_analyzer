evaluating semantic-indexing techniques through cross-language fingerprinting users in search of on-line document sources are usually looking for content , not words . hence , ir researchers generally agree that search-techniques should be geared toward the meaning underlying documents rather than toward the text itself . the most visible examples of such techniques are latent-semantic-analysis (lsa) , and the hyperspace analog to language (hal) . if these techniques really uncover semantic dependencies , then they should be applicable across languages . we investigated this using electronic versions of three kinds of translated material : a novel , a popular treatise about cosmology , and a data-base of technical-specifications . we used the analogy of fingerprinting used in forensics to establish if individuals are related . genetic fingerprinting uses enzymes to split the dna and then compare the resulting band patterns . likewise , in our research we use queries to split a document into fragments . if a search-technique really isolates fragments related to the query , then a document and its translation should have similar band patterns . in this paper we (1) present the fingerprinting technique , (2) introduce the material used , and (3) report preliminary results of an evaluation for two semantic-indexing techniques .
