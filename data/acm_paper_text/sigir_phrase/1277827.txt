federated text-retrieval from uncooperative overlapped-collections in federated text-retrieval-systems , the query is sent to multiple collections at the same time . the results returned by collections are gathered and ranked by a central broker that presents them to the user . it is usually assumed that the collections have little overlap . however , in practice collections may share many common documents as either exact or near-duplicates , potentially leading to high numbers of duplicates in the final results . considering the natural band width restrictions and efficiency issues of federated-search , sendingqueries to redundant collections leads to unnecessary costs . we propose a novel method for estimating the rate of over-lap among collections based on sampling . then , using theestimated overlap statistics , we propose two collection-selection methods that aim to maximize the number of unique relevant documents in the final results . we show experimentally that , although our estimates of overlap are not in exact , our suggested techniques can significantly improve the search-effectiveness when collections overlap .
