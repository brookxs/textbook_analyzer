inferring and using location-metadata to personalize web-search personalization of search-results offers the potential for significant improvements in web-search . among the many observable user-attributes , approximate user-location is particularly simple for search-engines to obtain and allows personalization even for a first-time web-search user . however , acting on user-location information is difficult , since few web-documents include an address that can be interpreted as constraining the locations where the document is relevant . furthermore , many web-documents -- such as local news stories , lottery results , and sports team fan pages -- may not correspond to physical addresses , but the location of the user still plays an important role in document-relevance . in this paper , we show how to infer a more general location relevance which uses not only physical location but a more general notion of locations of interest for web-pages . we compute this information using implicit user behavioral data , characterize the most location-centric pages , and show how location-information can be incorporated into web-search-ranking . our results show that a substantial fraction of web-search-queries can be significantly improved by incorporating location-based features .
