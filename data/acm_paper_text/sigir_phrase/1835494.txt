using statistical-decision-theory and relevance-models for query-performance-prediction we present a novel framework for the query-performance-prediction task . that is , estimating the effectiveness of a search performed in response to a query in lack of relevance-judgments . our approach is based on using statistical-decision-theory for estimating the utility that a document-ranking provides with respect to an information-need expressed by the query . to address the uncertainty in inferring the information-need , we estimate utility by the expected similarity between the given ranking and those induced by relevance-models ; the impact of a relevance-model is based on its presumed representativeness of the information-need . specific query-performance predictors instantiated from the framework substantially outperform state-of-the-art predictors over five trec corpora .
