a boosting approach to improving pseudo-relevance-feedback pseudo-relevance-feedback has proven effective for improving the average retrieval-performance . unfortunately , many experiments have shown that although pseudo-relevance-feedback helps many queries , it also often hurts many other queries , limiting its usefulness in real retrieval applications . thus an important , yet difficult challenge is to improve the overall effectiveness of pseudo-relevance-feedback without sacrificing the performance of individual queries too much . in this paper , we propose a novel learning-algorithm , feedbackboost , based on the boosting framework to improve pseudo-relevance-feedback through optimizing the combination of a set of basis feedback algorithms using a loss-function defined to directly measure both robustness and effectiveness . feedbackboost can potentially accommodate many basis feedback methods as features in the model , making the proposed method a general optimization framework for pseudo-relevance-feedback . as an application , we apply feedbackboost to improve pseudo-feedback based on language-models through combining different document-weighting strategies . the experiment results demonstrate that feedbackboost can achieve better average-precision and meanwhile dramatically reduce the number and magnitude of feedback failures as compared to three representative pseudo-feedback methods and a standard learning-to-rank approach for pseudo-feedback .
