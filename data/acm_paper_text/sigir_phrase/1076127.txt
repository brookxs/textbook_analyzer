hidden-markov-models for automatic-annotation and content-based-retrieval of images and video this paper introduces a novel method for automatic-annotation-of-images with keywords from a generic-vocabulary of concepts or objects for the purpose of content-based-image-retrieval . an image , represented as sequence of feature-vectors characterizing low-level visual features such as color , texture or oriented-edges , is modeled as having been stochastically generated by a hidden-markov-model , whose states represent concepts . the parameters of the model are estimated from a set of manually annotated (training) images . each image in a large test collection is then automatically annotated with the a posteriori-probability of concepts present in it . this annotation supports content-based-search of the image-collection via keywords . various aspects of model parameterization , parameter-estimation , and image-annotation are discussed . empirical retrieval results are presented on two image-collections | corel and key-frames from trecvid . comparisons are made with two other recently developed techniques on the same datasets .
