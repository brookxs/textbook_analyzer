a collaborative-filtering algorithm and evaluation-metric that accurately model the user-experience collaborative-filtering (cf) systems have been researched for over a decade as a tool to deal with information-overload . at the heart of these systems are the algorithms which generate the predictions and recommendations.in this article we empirically demonstrate that two of the most acclaimed cf recommendation-algorithms have flaws that result in a dramatically unacceptable user experience.in response , we introduce a new belief distribution algorithm that overcomes these flaws and provides substantially richer user-modeling . the belief distribution algorithm retains the qualities of nearest-neighbor algorithms which have performed well in the past , yet produces predictions of belief distributions across rating values rather than a point rating value.in addition , we illustrate how the exclusive use of the mean-absolute-error metric has concealed these flaws for so long , and we propose the use of a modified precision metric for more accurately evaluating the user-experience .
