a comparison of general vs personalised affective models for the prediction of topical-relevance information-retrieval-systems face a number of challenges , originating mainly from the semantic gap problem . implicit-feedback techniques have been employed in the past to address many of these issues . although this was a step towards the right direction , a need to personalise and tailor the search experience to the user-specific needs has become evident . in this study we examine ways of personalising affective models trained on facial-expression data . using personalised data we adapt these models to individual users and compare their performance to a general-model . the main goal is to determine whether the behavioural differences of users have an impact on the models ' ability to determine topical-relevance and if , by personalising them , we can improve their accuracy . for modelling relevance we extract a set-of-features from the facial-expression data and classify them using support-vector-machines . our initial evaluation indicates that accounting for individual-differences and applying personalisation introduces , in most cases , a noticeable improvement in the models ' performance .
