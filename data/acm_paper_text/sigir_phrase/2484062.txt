an unsupervised topic segmentation-model incorporating word-order we present a new unsupervised topic discovery-model for a collection of text-documents . in contrast to the majority of the state-of-the-art topic-models , our model does not break the document 's structure such as paragraphs and sentences . in addition , it preserves word-order in the document . as a result , it can generate two levels of topics of different granularity , namely , segment-topics and word-topics . in addition , it can generate n-gram words in each topic . we also develop an approximate-inference scheme using gibbs-sampling method . we conduct extensive experiments using publicly available data from different collections and show that our model improves the quality of several text-mining tasks such as the ability to support fine-grained topics with n-gram words in the correlation graph , the ability to segment a document into topically coherent sections , document-classification , and document likelihood-estimation .
