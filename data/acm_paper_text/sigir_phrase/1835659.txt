s-plasa + : adaptive sentiment-analysis with application to sales performance-prediction analyzing the large volume of online-reviews would produce useful knowledge that could be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties . in particular , the sentiments expressed in the online-reviews have been shown to be strongly correlated with the sales performance of products . in this paper , we present an adaptive sentiment-analysis model called s-plsa + , which aims to capture the hidden sentiment factors in the reviews with the capability to be incrementally updated as more data become available . we show how s-plsa + can be applied to sales performance-prediction using an arsa model developed in previous literature . a case-study is conducted in the movie domain , and results from preliminary experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model .
