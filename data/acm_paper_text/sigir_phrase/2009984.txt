estimation-methods for ranking recent information temporal-aspects of documents can impact relevance for certain kinds of queries . in this paper , we build on earlier work of modeling temporal-information . we propose an extension to the query likelihood model that incorporates query-specific information to estimate rate parameters , and we introduce a temporal factor into language-model-smoothing and query-expansion using pseudo-relevance-feedback . we evaluate these extensions using a twitter corpus and two newspaper article collections . results suggest that , compared to prior approaches , our models are more effective at capturing the temporal variability of relevance associated with some topics .
