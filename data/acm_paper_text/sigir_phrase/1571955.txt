segment-level display-time as implicit-feedback : a comparison to eye-tracking we examine two basic sources for implicit-relevance-feedback on the segment level for search-personalization : eye-tracking and display-time . a controlled-study has been conducted where 32 participants had to view documents in front of an eye-tracker , query a search-engine , and give explicit relevance ratings for the results . we examined the performance of the basic implicit-feedback methods with respect to improved ranking and compared their performance to a pseudo-relevance-feedback baseline on the segment level and the original ranking of a web-search-engine . our results show that feedback based on display-time on the segment level is much coarser than feedback from eye-tracking . but surprisingly , for re-ranking and query-expansion it did work as well as eye-tracking-based feedback . all behavior-based methods performed significantly better than our non-behavior-based baseline and especially improved poor initial rankings of the-web search-engine . the study shows that segment-level display-time yields comparable results as eye-tracking-based feedback . thus , it should be considered in future personalization systems as an inexpensive but precise-method for implicit-feedback .
