an effective approach to document-retrieval via utilizing wordnet and recognizing phrases noun-phrases in queries are identified and classified into four types : proper-names , dictionary phrases , simple phrases and complex phrases . a document has a phrase if all-content-words in the phrase are within a window of a certain size . the window sizes for different types of phrases are different and are determined using a decision-tree . phrases are more important than individual terms . consequently , documents in response to a query are ranked with matching phrases given a higher priority . we utilize wordnet to disambiguate word-senses of query terms . whenever the sense of a query-term is determined , its synonyms , hyponyms , words from its definition and its compound-words are considered for possible additions to the query . experimental-results show that our approach yields between 23 \ % and 31 \ % improvements over the best-known results on the trec 9 , 10 and 12 collections for short (title only) queries , without using web-data .
