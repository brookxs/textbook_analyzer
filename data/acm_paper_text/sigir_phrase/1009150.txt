an artificial-intelligence approach to information-retrieval (abstract only) current approaches to information-retrieval rely on the creativity of individuals to develop new algorithms . in this investigation the use of genetic-algorithms (ga) and genetic-programming (gp) to learn ir algorithms is examined.document structure weighting is a technique whereby different parts of a document (title , abstract , etc.) contribute unevenly to the overall document weight during ranking . near optimal weights can be learned with a ga. . doing so shows a statistically significant 5 \ % relative improvement in map for vector-space inner-product and croft 's probabilistic-ranking , but no improvement for bm25 . two applications of this approach are suggested : offline-learning , and relevance feedback.in a second set of experiments , a new ranking-function was learned using gp . this new function yields a statistically significant 11 \ % relative improvement on unseen queries tested on the training-documents . portability tests to different collections (not used in training) demonstrate the performance of the new function exceeds vector-space and probability , and slightly exceeds bm25 . learning weights for this new function is proposed.the application of genetic learning to stemming and thesaurus-construction is discussed . stemming rules such as those of the porter algorithm are candidates for gp learning whereas synonym sets are candidates for ga learning .
