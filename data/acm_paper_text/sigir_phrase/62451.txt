two learning schemes in information-retrieval two methods are given to improve weighting-schemes by using relevance information of a set of queries . the first method is to estimate parameter-values of two independence-models in information-retrieval the binary independence-model and the non-binary independence-model . the parameters estimated here are used to calculate optimal weights for terms in a different set of queries . performance of this estimation is compared to the inverse-document-frequency method , the cosine-measure , and the statistical-similarity measure . the second method is to learn optimal weights of the non-binary independence-model adaptively by a learning formula . experiments are performed on three different document-collections cisi , medlars , and crn4nul for both methods , and results are reported . both methods show improvements compared to the existing weighting-schemes . experimental-results show that the second method gives slightly better performance than the first one , and has simpler implementation .
