web-page publication time detection and its application for page-rank publication time (p-time for short) of web-pages is often required in many application areas . in this paper , we address the issue of p-time detection and its application for page-rank . we first propose an approach to extract p-time for a page with explicit p-time displayed on its body . we then present a method to infer p-time for a page without p-time . we further introduce a temporal sensitive page-rank model using p-time . experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform the baseline methods significantly .
