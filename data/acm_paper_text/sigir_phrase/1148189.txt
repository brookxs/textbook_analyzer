topical link analysis for web-search traditional web link-based-ranking schemes use a single score to measure a page 's authority without concern of the community from which that authority is derived . as a result , a resource that is highly popular for one topic may dominate the results of another topic in which it is less authoritative . to address this problem , we suggest calculating a score vector for each page to distinguish the contribution from different topics , using a random-walk-model that probabilistically combines page topic distribution and link-structure . we show how to incorporate the topical model within both pagerank and hits without affecting the overall property and still render insight into topic-level transition . experiments on multiple datasets indicate that our technique outperforms other ranking approaches that incorporate textual-analysis .
