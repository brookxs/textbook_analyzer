text-categorization by boosting automatically extracted concepts term-based representations of documents have found wide-spread use in information-retrieval . however , one of the main shortcomings of such methods is that they largely disregard lexical-semantics and , as a consequence , are not sufficiently robust with respect to variations in word usage.in this paper we investigate the use of concept-based document representations to supplement word - or phrase-based features . the utilized concepts are automatically extracted from documents via probabilistic-latent-semantic-analysis . we propose to use adaboost to optimally combine weak hypotheses based on both types of features . experimental-results on standard-benchmarks confirm the validity of our approach , showing that adaboost achieves consistent improvements by including additional semantic-features in the learned ensemble .
