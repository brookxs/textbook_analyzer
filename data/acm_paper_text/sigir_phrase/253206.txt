an experimental-study of factors important in document-ranking the ability to effectively rank retrieved documents in order of their probable relevance to a query is a critical factor in statistically-based keyword-retrieval systems . this paper summarizes a set of experiments with different methods of term-weighting for documents , using measures of term importance within an entire document-collection , term importance within a given document , and document-length . it is shown that significant improvements over no term-weighting can be made using a combination of weighting measures and normalizing for document-length .
