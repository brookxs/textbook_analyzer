a novel corpus-based stemming algorithm using co-occurrence-statistics we present a stemming algorithm for text-retrieval . the algorithm uses the statistics collected on the basis of certain corpus-analysis based on the co-occurrence between two word variants . we use a very simple co-occurrence-measure that reflects how often a pair of word variants occurs in a document as well as in the whole corpus . a graph is formed where the word variants are the nodes and two word variants form an edge if they co-occur . on the basis of the co-occurrence-measure , a certain edge strength is defined for each of the edges . finally , on the basis of the edge strengths , we propose a partition algorithm that groups the word variants based on their strongest neighbors , that is , the neighbors with largest strengths . our stemming algorithm has two static parameters and does not use any other information except the co-occurrence-statistics from the corpus . the experiments on trec , clef and fire data consisting of four european and two asian-languages show a significant improvement over no-stem strategy on all the languages . also , the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms a number of strong stemmers including the rule-based ones on a number of languages . for highly inflectional languages , a relative improvement of about 50 \ % is obtained compared to un-normalized words and a relative improvement ranging from 5 \ % to 16 \ % is obtained compared to the rule-based stemmer for the concerned language .
