parameterized generation of labeled datasets for text-categorization based on a hierarchical directory although text-categorization is a burgeoning area of ir research , readily available test-collections in this field are surprisingly scarce . we describe a methodology and system (named accio) for automatically acquiring labeled datasets for text-categorization from the world-wide-web , by capitalizing on the body-of-knowledge encoded in the structure of existing hierarchical directories such as the open-directory . we define parameters of categories that make it possible to acquire numerous datasets with desired properties , which in turn allow better control over categorization experiments . in particular , we develop metrics that estimate the difficulty of a dataset by examining the host directory-structure . these metrics are shown to be good predictors of categorization accuracy that can be achieved on a dataset , and serve as efficient heuristics for generating datasets subject to user 's requirements . a large-collection of automatically generated datasets are made available for other researchers to use .
