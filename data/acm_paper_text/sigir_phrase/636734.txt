is text-compression by prefixes-and-suffixes practical ? one approach to text-compression is to replace high-frequency variable-length fragments of words by fixed-length codes pointing to a <u> compression table </u> containing these high-frequency fragments . it is shown that the problem of optimal fragment compression is np-hard even if the fragments are restricted to prefixes-and-suffixes . this seems to be a simplest fragment compression problem which is np-hard , since a polynomial-algorithm for compressing by prefixes only (or suffixes only) has been found recently . various compression heuristics based on using both prefixes-and-suffixes have been tested on large hebrew and english texts . the best of these heuristics produce a net compression of some 37 \ % for hebrew and 45 \ % for english using a prefix/suffix compression table of size 256 .
