web-taxonomy integration through co-bootstrapping we address the problem of integrating objects from a source taxonomy into a master taxonomy . this problem is not only currently pervasive on the web , but also important to the emerging semantic-web . a straightforward approach to automating this process would be to learn a classifier that can classify objects from the source taxonomy into categories of the master taxonomy . the key insight is that the availability of the source taxonomy data could be helpful to build better classifiers for the master taxonomy if their categorizations have some semantic overlap . in this paper , we propose a new approach , co-bootstrapping , to enhance the classification by exploiting such implicit-knowledge . our experiments with real-world web-data show substantial improvements in the performance of taxonomy-integration .
