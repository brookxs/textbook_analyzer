learning-based time-sensitive re-ranking for web-search to model time-dependent user-intent for web-search , this paper proposes a novel method using machine-learning-techniques to exploit temporal-features for effective time-sensitive-search result re-ranking . we propose models to incorporate users ' click-through information for queries that are seen in the training-data , and then further extend the model to deal with unseen queries considering the relationship between queries . experiment shows significant improvement on search-result-ranking over original search outputs .
