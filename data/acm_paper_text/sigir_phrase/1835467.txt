query-forwarding in geographically distributed search-engines query-forwarding is an important technique for preserving the result quality in distributed-search-engines where the index is geographically partitioned over multiple search sites . the key component in query-forwarding is the thresholding algorithm by which the forwarding decisions are given . in this paper , we propose a linear-programming-based thresholding algorithm that significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of achieved search efficiency values . moreover , we evaluate a greedy-heuristic for partial index-replication and investigate the impact of result-cache freshness on query-forwarding performance . finally , we present some optimizations that improve the performance further , under certain conditions . we evaluate the proposed techniques by simulations over a real-life setting , using a large query-log and a document-collection obtained from yahoo! .
