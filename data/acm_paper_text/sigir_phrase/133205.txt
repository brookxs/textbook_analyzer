automating the assignment of submitted manuscripts to reviewers the 117 manuscripts submitted for the hypertext '91 conference were assigned to members of the review committee , using a variety of automated methods based on information-retrieval principles and latent-semantic-indexing . fifteen reviewers provided exhaustive ratings for the submitted abstracts , indicating how well each abstract matched their interests . the automated methods do a fairly good job of assigning relevant papers for review , but they are still somewhat poorer than assignments made manually by human experts and substantially poorer than an assignment perfectly matching the reviewers ' own ranking of the papers . a new automated assignment-method called n of 2 n achieves better performance than human experts by sending reviewers more papers than they actually have to review and then allowing them to choose part of their review load themselves .
