emulating query-biased-summaries using document titles generating query-biased-summaries can take up a large part of the response-time of interactive-information-retrieval (iir) systems . this paper proposes to use document titles as an alternative to queries in the generation of summaries . the use of document titles allows us to pre-generate summaries statically , and thus , improve the response speed of iir systems . our experiments suggest that title-biased-summaries are a promising alternative to query-biased-summaries .
