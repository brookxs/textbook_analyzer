retrieving similar discussion-forum threads : a structure_based approach online-forums are becoming a popular way of finding useful information on the web . search over forums for existing discussion threads so far is limited to keyword-based-search due to the minimal effort required on part of the users . however , it is often not possible to capture all the relevant context in a complex-query using a small number of keywords . example-based search that retrieves similar discussion threads given one exemplary thread is an alternate approach that can help the user provide richer context and vastly improve forum-search results . in this paper , we address the problem of finding similar threads to a given thread . towards this , we propose a novel methodology to estimate similarity between discussion threads . our method exploits the thread-structure to decompose threads in to set of weighted overlapping-components . it then estimates pairwise thread similarities by quantifying how well the information in the threads are mutually contained within each other using lexical similarities between their underlying components . we compare our proposed methods on real datasets against state-of-the-art thread retrieval mechanisms wherein we illustrate that our techniques outperform others by large margins on popular retrieval-evaluation measures such as ndcg , map , precision@k and mrr . in particular , consistent improvements of up to 10 % are observed on all evaluation-measures .
