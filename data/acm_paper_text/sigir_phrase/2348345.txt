image-ranking based on user-browsing behavior ranking of images is difficult because many factors determine their importance (e.g. , popularity , quality , entertainment value , context , etc.) . in social-media platforms , ranking also depends on social-interactions and on the visibility of the images both inside and outside those platforms . in this context , the application of standard ranking methods is not clearly understood , and neither are the subtleties associated with taking into account social-interaction , internal , and external factors . in this paper , we use a large flickr dataset and investigate these factors by performing an in-depth analysis of several ranking-algorithms using both internal (i.e. , within flickr) and external (i.e. , links from outside of flickr) factors . we analyze rankings given by common metrics used in image-retrieval (e.g. , number of favorites) , and compare them with metrics based on page views (e.g. , time spent , number of views) . in addition , we represent users ' navigation by a graph and combine session models with some of these metrics , comparing with pagerank and browserank . our experiments show significant differences between the rankings , providing insights on the impact of social interactions , internal , and external factors in image-ranking .
