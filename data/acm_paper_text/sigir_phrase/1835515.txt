segmentation of multi-sentence questions : towards effective question-retrieval in cqa services existing question-retrieval models work relatively well in finding similar questions in community-based-question-answering (cqa) services . however , they are designed for single-sentence queries or bag-of-word representations , and are not sufficient to handle multi-sentence questions complemented with various contexts . segmenting questions into parts that are topically related could assist the retrieval-system to not only better understand the user 's different information-needs but also fetch the most appropriate fragments of questions-and-answers in cqa archive that are relevant to user 's query . in this paper , we propose a graph-based approach to segmenting multi-sentence questions . the results from user-studies show that our segmentation-model outperforms traditional systems in question-segmentation by over 30 \ % in user 's satisfaction . we incorporate the segmentation-model into existing cqa question-retrieval framework for more targeted question-matching , and the empirical-evaluation results demonstrate that the segmentation boosts the question-retrieval performance by up to 12.93 \ % in mean-average-precision and 11.72 \ % in top one precision . our model comes with a comprehensive question detector equipped with both lexical and syntactic-features .
