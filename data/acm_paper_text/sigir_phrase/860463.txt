combining document representations for known-item search this paper investigates the pre-conditions for successful combination of document representations formed from structural markup for the task of known-item search . as this task is very similar to work in meta-search and data-fusion , we adapt several hypotheses from those research areas and investigate them in this context . to investigate these hypotheses , we present a mixture-based language-model and also examine many of the current meta-search-algorithms . we find that compatible output from systems is important for successful combination of document representations . we also demonstrate that combining low performing document representations can improve performance , but not consistently . we find that the techniques best suited for this task are robust to the inclusion of poorly performing document representations . we also explore the role of variance of results across systems and its impact on the performance of fusion , with the surprising result that the correct documents have higher variance across document representations than highly ranking incorrect documents .
