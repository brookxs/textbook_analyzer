link-analysis for private weighted-graphs link-analysis methods have been used successfully for knowledge-discovery from the link-structure of mutually linking entities . existing link-analysis methods have been inherently designed based on the fact that the entire link-structure of the target graph is observable such as public web-documents ; however , link-information in graphs in the real-world , such as human relationship or economic-activities , is rarely open to public . if link-analysis can be performed using graphs with private links in a privacy-preserving way , it enables us to rank entities connected with private ties , such as people , organizations , or business-transactions . in this paper , we present a secure link-analysis for graphs with private links by means of cryptographic-protocols . our solutions are designed as privacy-preserving expansions of well-known link-analysis methods , pagerank and hits . the outcomes of our protocols are completely equivalent to those of pagerank and hits . furthermore , our protocols theoretically guarantee that the private link-information possessed by each node is not revealed to other nodes . \ % we demonstrate the efficiency of our solution by experimental-studies , comparing with existing solutions , such as secure-function-evaluation , decentralized spectral-analysis , and privacy-preserving link-analysis .
