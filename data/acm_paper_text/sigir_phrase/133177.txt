classifying news stories using memory_based reasoning we describe a method for classifying news stories using memory_based reasoning (mbr) a k - nearest-neighbor method) , that does not require manual topic definitions . using an already coded training-database of about 50,000 stories from the dow jones press release news wire , and seeker [stanfill] (a text-retrieval-system that supports relevance-feedback) as the underlying match engine , codes are assigned to new , unseen stories with a recall of about 80 \ % and precision of about 70 \ % . there are about 350 different codes to be assigned . using a massively-parallel supercomputer , we leverage the information already contained in the thousands of coded stories and are able to code a story in about 2 seconds . given seeker , the text-retrieval-system , we achieved these results in about two person-months . we believe this approach is effective in reducing the development time to implement classification-systems involving large number of topics for the purpose of classification , message-routing etc. .
