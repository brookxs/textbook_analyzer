improving e-discovery using information-retrieval e-discovery is the requirement that the documents and information in electronic-form stored in corporate systems be produced as evidence in litigation . it has posed great challenges for legal experts . legal searchers have always looked to find `` any and all '' evidence for a given case . thus , a legal search-system would essentially be a recall-oriented system . it has been a common practice among expert searchers to formulate boolean-queries to represent their information-need . we want to work on three basic problems : boolean-query formulation - our primary goal is to study boolean-query formulation in the light of the e-discovery task . this will include automatic boolean-query generation , expansion and learning the effect of proximity operators in boolean searches . data-fusion - we would also like to explore the effectiveness of data-fusion techniques in improving recall . error modeling - finally , we will work on error modeling methods for noisy legal documents .
