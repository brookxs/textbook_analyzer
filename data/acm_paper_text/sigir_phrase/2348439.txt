sketch-based image-similarity search with a pen and paper interface we present a novel and innovative user-interface for query-by-sketching based image-retrieval that exploits emergent interactive-paper and digital-pen technology . users can draw sketches with a-digital pen on interactive-paper in a user-friendly way . the pen is able to capture the stroke vectors and to interactively stream them to the underlying content-based-image-retrieval (cbir) system via the pen 's bluetooth interface . we present the integration of interactive paper/digital pen technology with qbs , our cbir system tailored to query-by-sketching , and we demonstrate the use of the paper and pen-interface together with qbs for three different collections : mirflickr-25k , a cartoon collection , and a collection of medieval paper watermarks .
