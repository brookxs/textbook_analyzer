a weakly-supervised detection of entity central documents in a stream filtering a time-ordered corpus for documents that are highly relevant to an entity is a task receiving more and more attention over the years . one application is to reduce the delay between the moment an information about an entity is being first observed and the moment the entity entry in a knowledge-base is being updated . current state-of-the-art approaches are highly supervised and require training-examples for each entity monitored . we propose an approach which does not require new training-data when processing a new entity . to capture intrinsic characteristics of highly relevant documents our approach relies on three types of features : document centric features , entity profile related features and time features . evaluated within the framework of the `` knowledge-base acceleration '' track at trec 2012 , it outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches .
