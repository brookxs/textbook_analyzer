enhancing cluster-labeling using wikipedia this work investigates cluster-labeling enhancement by utilizing wikipedia , the free on-line-encyclopedia . we describe a general-framework for cluster-labeling that extracts candidate labels from wikipedia in addition to important terms that are extracted directly from the text . the `` labeling quality '' of each candidate is then evaluated by several independent judges and the top evaluated candidates are recommended for labeling . our experimental-results reveal that the wikipedia labels agree with manual labels associated by humans to a cluster , much more than with significant terms that are extracted directly from the text . we show that in most cases even when human 's associated label appears in the text , pure statistical-methods have difficulty in identifying them as good descriptors . furthermore , our experiments show that for more than 85 \ % of the clusters in our test-collection , the manual label (or an inflection , or a synonym of it) appears in the top five labels recommended by our system .
