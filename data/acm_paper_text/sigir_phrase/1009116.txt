refining term-weights of documents using term dependencies when processing raw documents in information-retrieval (ir) system , a term-weighting-scheme is used to calculate the importance of each term which occurs in a document . however , most term-weighting schemes assume that a term is independent of the other terms . term-dependency is an indispensable consequence of language-use [1] . therefore , this assumption can make the information of a document being lost . in this paper , we propose new approach to refine term-weights of documents using term dependencies discovered from a set of documents . then , we evaluate our method with two experiments based on the vector-space-model [2] and the language-model [3] .
