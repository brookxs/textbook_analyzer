authorship-classification : a discriminative syntactic-tree mining approach in the past , there have been dozens of studies on automatic authorship-classification , and many of these studies concluded that the writing style is one of the best indicators for original authorship . from among the hundreds of features which were developed , syntactic-features were best able to reflect an author 's writing style . however , due to the high computational-complexity for extracting and computing syntactic-features , only simple variations of basic syntactic-features such as function-words , pos (part-of-speech) tags , and rewrite-rules were considered . in this paper , we propose a new feature-set of k-embedded-edge subtree patterns that holds more syntactic-information than previous feature-sets . we also propose a novel approach to directly mining them from a given set of syntactic-trees . we show that this approach reduces the computational burden of using complex syntactic-structures as the feature-set . comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach is reliable and more accurate than previous studies .
