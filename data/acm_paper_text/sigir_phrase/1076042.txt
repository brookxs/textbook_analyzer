the maximum-entropy-method for analyzing retrieval measures we present a model , based on the maximum-entropy-method , for analyzing various measures of retrieval-performance such as average-precision , r-precision , and precision-at-cutoffs . our methodology treats the value of such a measure as a constraint on the distribution-of-relevant-documents in an unknown list , and the maximum-entropy distribution can be determined subject to these constraints . for good measures of overall performance (such as average-precision) , the resulting maximum-entropy distributions are highly correlated with actual distributions of relevant documents in lists as demonstrated through trec-data ; for poor measures of overall performance , the correlation is weaker . as such , the maximum-entropy-method can be used to quantify the overall quality of a retrieval measure . furthermore , for good measures of overall performance (such as average-precision) , we show that the corresponding maximum-entropy distributions can be used to accurately infer precision-recall curves and the values of other measures-of-performance , and we demonstrate that the quality of these inferences far exceeds that predicted by simple retrieval measure correlation , as demonstrated through trec-data .
