improving collection-selection with overlap awareness in p2p-search engines collection-selection has been a research issue for years . typically , in related work , precomputed statistics are employed in order to estimate the expected result quality of each collection , and subsequently the collections are ranked accordingly . our thesis is that this simple approach is insufficient for several applications in which the collections typically overlap . this is the case , for example , for the collections built by autonomous peers crawling the-web . we argue for the extension of existing quality measures using estimators of mutual overlap among collections and present experiments in which this combination outperforms cori , a popular approach based on quality estimation . we outline our prototype-implementation of a p2p web-search-engine , coined minerva , that allows handling large amounts of data in a distributed and self-organizing manner . we conduct experiments which show that taking overlap into account during collection-selection can drastically decrease the number of collections that have to be contacted in order to reach a satisfactory level of recall , which is a great step toward the feasibility of distributed-web-search .
