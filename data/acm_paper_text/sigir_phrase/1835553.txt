content-enriched classifier for web-video-classification with the explosive growth of online-videos , automatic real-time categorization of web-videos plays a key role for organizing , browsing and retrieving the huge amount of videos on the web . previous work shows that , in addition to text-features , content-features of videos are also useful for web-video-classification . unfortunately , extracting content-features is computationally prohibitive for real-time-video classification . in this paper we propose a novel video-classification framework that is able to exploit both content and text-features for video-classification while avoiding the expensive computation of extracting content-features at classification time . the main idea of our approach is to utilize the content-features extracted from training-data to enrich the text_based semantic-kernels , yielding content-enriched semantic-kernels . the content-enriched semantic-kernels enable to utilize both content and text-features for classifying new videos without extracting their content-features . the experimental-results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art video-classification methods .
