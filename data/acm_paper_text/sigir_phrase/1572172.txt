using computational community-interest as an indicator for ranking ranking documents in response to users ' information-needs is a challenging task , due , in part , to the dynamic nature of users ' interests with respect to a query . i hypothesize that the interests of a given user are similar to the interests of the broader community of which he is a part and propose an innovative method that uses social-media to characterize the interests of the community and use this characterization to improve future rankings . by generating a-community interest vector (civ) for a given query , we use community-interest to alter the ranking score of individual documents retrieved by the query . the civ is based on a continuously updated set of recent (daily or past few hours) user-oriented text-data . the user-oriented data can be user blogs or user comment tagged news . preliminary evaluation shows that the new ranking-method significantly improves ranking-performance .
