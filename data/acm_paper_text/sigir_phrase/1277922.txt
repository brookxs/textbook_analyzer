a comparison of sentence-retrieval techniques identifying redundant-information in sentences is useful for several applications such as summarization , document provenance , detecting text-reuse and novelty-detection . the task of identifying redundant-information in sentences is defined as follows : given a query sentence the task is to retrieve sentences from a given collection that express all or some subset of the information present in the query sentence . sentence-retrieval techniques rank sentences based on some measure of their similarity to a query . the effectiveness of such techniques depends on the similarity-measure used to rank sentences . an effective retrieval-model should be able to handle low word overlap between query and candidate sentences and go beyond just word overlap . simple language-modeling techniques like query likelihood retrieval have outperformed tf-idf and word overlap based methods for ranking sentences . in this paper , we compare the performance of sentence-retrieval using different language-modeling techniques for the problem of identifying redundant-information .
