probabilistic-model for contextual-retrieval contextual-retrieval is a critical technique for facilitating many important applications such as mobile-search , personalized-search , pc troubleshooting , etc. . despite of its importance , there is no comprehensive retrieval-model to describe the contextual-retrieval process . we observed that incompatible context , noisy context and incomplete query are several important issues commonly existing in contextual-retrieval applications . however , these issues have not been previously explored and discussed . in this paper , we propose probabilistic-models to address these problems . our study clearly shows that query-log is the key to build effective contextual-retrieval models . we also conduct a case-study in the pc troubleshooting domain to testify the performance of the proposed models and experimental-results show that the models can achieve very good retrieval-precision .
