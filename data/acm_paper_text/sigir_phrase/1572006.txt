a comparison of query and term-suggestion features for interactive-searching query-formulation is one of the most difficult and important aspects of information-seeking and retrieval . two techniques , term-relevance feedback and query-suggestion , provide methods to help users formulate queries , but each is limited in different ways . in this research we combine these two techniques by automatically creating query-suggestions using term-relevance feedback techniques . to evaluate our approach , we conducted an interactive-information-retrieval study with 55 subjects and 20 topics . each subject completed four topics , half with a term-suggestion system and half with a query-suggestion system . we also investigated the source of the suggestions : approximately half of all subjects were provided with system-generated suggestions , while half were provided with user-generated suggestions . results show that subjects used more query-suggestions than term suggestions and saved more documents with these suggestions , even though there were no significant differences in performance . subjects preferred the query-suggestion system and rated it higher along a number of dimensions including its ability to help them think of new approaches to searching . qualitative-data provided insight into subjects ' usage and ratings , and indicated that subjects often used the suggestions even when they did not click on them .
