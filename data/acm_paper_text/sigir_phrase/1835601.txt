re-examination on lam \ % in spam-filtering logistic average misclassification percentage (lam \ %) is a key measure for the spam-filtering performance . this paper demonstrates that a spam-filter can achieve a perfect 0.00 \ % in lam \ % , the minimal value in theory , by simply setting a biased threshold during the classifier modeling . at the same time , the overall classification-performance reaches only a low accuracy . the result suggests that the role of lam \ % for spam-filtering evaluation should be re-examined .
