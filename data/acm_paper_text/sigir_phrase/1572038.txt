reducing long-queries using query-quality predictors long-queries frequently contain many extraneous terms that hinder retrieval of relevant documents . we present techniques to reduce long-queries to more effective shorter ones that lack those extraneous terms . our work is motivated by the observation that perfectly reducing long trec description queries can lead to an average improvement of 30 \ % in mean-average-precision . our approach involves transforming the reduction problem into a problem of learning-to-rank all sub-sets of the original query (sub-queries) based on their predicted quality , and selecting the top sub-query . we use various measures of query-quality described in the literature as features to represent sub-queries , and train a classifier . replacing the original long-query with the top-ranked sub-query chosen by the ranker results in a statistically significant average improvement of 8 \ % on our test-sets . analysis of the results shows that query-reduction is well-suited for moderately-performing long-queries , and a small set of query-quality predictors are well-suited for the task of ranking sub-queries .
