an information-theoretic account of static index-pruning in this paper , we recast static index-pruning as a model-induction problem under the framework of kullback 's principle of minimum cross-entropy . we show that static index-pruning has an approximate analytical-solution in the form of convex integer program . further analysis on computation feasibility suggests that one of its surrogate-model can be solved efficiently . this result has led to the rediscovery of emph {uniform pruning} , a simple yet powerful pruning-method proposed in 2001 and later easily ignored by many of us . to empirically verify this result , we conducted experiments under a new design in which prune ratio is strictly controlled . our result on standard ad-hoc-retrieval benchmarks has confirmed that uniform pruning is robust to high prune ratio and its performance is currently state-of-the-art .
