find it if you can : a game for modeling different types of web-search-success using interaction data a better understanding of strategies and behavior of successful searchers is crucial for improving the experience of all searchers . however , research of search-behavior has been struggling with the tension between the relatively small-scale , but controlled lab studies , and the large-scale log-based studies where the searcher intent and many other important factors have to be inferred . we present our solution for performing controlled , yet realistic , scalable , and reproducible studies of searcher-behavior . we focus on difficult informational tasks , which tend to frustrate many users of the current web search-technology . first , we propose a principled formalization of different types of `` success '' for informational search , which encapsulate and sharpen previously proposed models . second , we present a scalable game-like infrastructure for crowdsourcing search-behavior studies , specifically targeted towards capturing and evaluating successful search-strategies on informational tasks with known intent . third , we report our analysis of search-success using these data , which confirm and extends previous findings . finally , we demonstrate that our model can predict search-success more effectively than the existing state-of-the-art methods , on both our data and on a different set of log-data collected from regular search-engine sessions . together , our search-success models , the data-collection-infrastructure , and the associated behavior-analysis techniques , significantly advance the study of success in web-search .
