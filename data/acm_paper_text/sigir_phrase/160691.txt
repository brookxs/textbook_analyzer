automatic-indexing based on bayesian-inference networks in this paper , a bayesian-inference network-model for automatic-indexing with index-terms (descriptors) from a prescribed vocabulary is presented . it requires an indexing dictionary with rules mapping terms of the respective subject field onto descriptors and inverted-lists for terms occuring in a set of documents of the subject field and descriptors manually assigned to these documents . the indexing dictionary can be derived automatically from a set of manually indexed documents . an application of the network-model is described , followed by an indexing example and some experimental-results about the indexing performance of the network-model .
