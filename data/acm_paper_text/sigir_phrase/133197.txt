an incrementally extensible document-retrieval-system based on linguistic and logical principles most natural-language_based document-retrieval systems use the syntax structures of constituent phrases of documents as index-terms . many of these systems also attempt to reduce the syntactic variability of natural-language by some normalisation procedure applied to these syntax structures . however , the retrieval-performance of such systems remains fairly disappointing . some systems therefore use a meaning-representation-language to index and retrieve documents . in this paper , a system is presented that uses horn-clause logic as meaning-representation-language , employs advanced techniques from natural-language-processing to achieve incremental extensibility , and uses methods from logic-programming to achieve robustness in the face of insufficient data .
