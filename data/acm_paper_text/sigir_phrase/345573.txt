document-filtering method using non-relevant information profile document-filtering is a task to retrieve documents relevant to a user 's profile from a flow of documents . generally , filtering systems calculate the similarity between the profile and each incoming document , and retrieve documents with similarity higher than a threshold . however , many systems set a relatively high threshold to reduce retrieval of non-relevant documents , which results in the ignorance of many relevant documents . in this paper , we propose the use of a non-relevant information profile to reduce the mistaken retrieval of non-relevant documents . results from experiments show that this filter has successfully rejected a sufficient number of non-relevant documents , resulting in an improvement of filtering performance .
