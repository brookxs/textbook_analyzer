on an equivalence between plsi and lda latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) is a fully generative approach to language-modelling which overcomes the inconsistent generative semantics of probabilistic-latent-semantic-indexing (plsi) . this paper shows that plsi is a maximum a posteriori estimated lda model under a uniform dirichlet-prior , therefore the perceived shortcomings of plsi can be resolved and elucidated within the lda framework .
