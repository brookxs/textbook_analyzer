inferring document-relevance via average-precision we consider the problem of evaluating retrieval-systems using a limited number of relevance-judgments . recent work has demonstrated that one can accurately estimate average-precision via a judged pool corresponding to a relatively small random sample of documents . in this work , we demonstrate that given values or estimates of average-precision , one can accurately infer the relevances of unjudged documents . combined , we thus show how one can efficiently and accurately infer a large judged pool from a relatively small number of judged documents , thus permitting accurate and efficient retrieval-evaluation on a large-scale .
