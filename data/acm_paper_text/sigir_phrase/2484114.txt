irwr : incremental random-walk-with-restart random-walk-with-restart (rwr) has become an appealing measure of node proximities in emerging applications eg recommender-systems and automatic-image-captioning . in practice , a real graph is typically large , and is frequently updated with small changes . it is often cost-inhibitive to recompute proximities from scratch via emph {batch} algorithms when the graph is updated . this paper focuses on the incremental computations of rwr in a dynamic-graph , whose edges often change over time . the prior attempt of rwr [1] deploys kdash to find top - $ k $ highest proximity nodes for a given query , which involves a strategy to incrementally emph {estimate} upper proximity bounds . however , due to its aim to prune needless calculation , such an incremental strategy is emph {approximate} : in $ o (1) $ time for each node . the main contribution of this paper is to devise an emph {exact} and fast incremental-algorithm of rwr for edge updates . our solution , irwr ! , can incrementally compute any node-proximity in $ o (1) $ time for each edge update without loss of exactness . the empirical evaluations show the high efficiency and exactness of irwr for computing proximities on dynamic-networks against its batch counterparts .
