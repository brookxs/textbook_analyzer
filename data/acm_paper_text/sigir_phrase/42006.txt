a statistical similarity-measure within the framework of the vector-space-models , a statistical similarity-measure between document and query is proposed . in this approach the assumption that term (or atomic) vectors are pairwise orthogonal is not required . in addition , it provides a natural and consistent interpretation of term occurrence frequencies obtained from autoindexing .
