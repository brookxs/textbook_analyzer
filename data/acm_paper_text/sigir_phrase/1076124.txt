bootstrapping dictionaries for cross-language-information-retrieval the bottleneck for dictionary-based cross-language-information-retrieval is the lack of comprehensive dictionaries , in particular for many different languages . we here introduce a methodology by which multilingual dictionaries (for spanish and swedish) emerge automatically from simple seed lexicons . these seed lexicons are automatically generated , by cognate mapping , from (previously manually constructed) portuguese and german as well as english sources . lexical and semantic hypotheses are then validated and new ones iteratively generated by making use of co-occurrence patterns of hypothesized translation synonyms in parallel-corpora . we evaluate these newly derived dictionaries on a large medical document collection within a cross-language-retrieval setting .
