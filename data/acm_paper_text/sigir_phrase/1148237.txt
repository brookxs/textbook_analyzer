mining dependency-relations for query-expansion in passage-retrieval classical query-expansion techniques such as the local-context-analysis (lca) make use of term-co-occurrence statistics to incorporate additional contextual terms for enhancing passage-retrieval . however , relevant contextual terms do not always co-occur frequently with the query terms and vice versa . hence the use of such methods often brings in noise , which leads to reduced-precision . previous studies have demonstrated the importance of relationship-analysis for natural-language queries in passage-retrieval . however , they found that without query-expansion , the performance is not satisfactory for short queries . in this paper , we present two novel query-expansion techniques that make use of dependency-relation analysis to extract contextual terms and relations from external corpuses . the techniques are used to enhance the performance of density based and relation_based passage-retrieval frameworks respectively . we compare the performance of the resulting systems with lca in a density_based passage-retrieval system (dbs) and a relation_based system without any query-expansion (rbs) using the factoid questions from the trec-12 qa task . the results show that in terms of mrr scores , our relation_based term-expansion method with dbs outperforms the lca by 9.81 \ % , while our relation expansion method outperforms rbs by 17.49 \ % .
