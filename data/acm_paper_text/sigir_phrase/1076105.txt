a study of relevance-propagation for web-search different from traditional information-retrieval , both content-and-structure are critical to the success of web-information-retrieval . in recent years , many relevance-propagation techniques have been proposed to propagate content information between web-pages through web-structure to improve the performance of web-search . in this paper , we first propose a generic relevance-propagation framework , and then provide a comparison-study on the effectiveness and efficiency of various representative propagation-models that can be derived from this generic-framework . we come to many conclusions that are useful for selecting a propagation-model in real-world search-applications , including 1) sitemap-based propagation-models outperform hyperlink-based models in sense of both effectiveness and efficiency , and 2) sitemap-based term-propagation is easier to be integrated into real-world search-engines because of its parallel offline implementation and acceptable complexity . some other more detailed study results are also reported in the paper .
