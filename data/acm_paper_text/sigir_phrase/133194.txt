a system for retrieving speech documents an information-retrieval-model is presented for the retrieval of speech documents , i.e. audio recordings containing speech . the indexing vocabulary consists of indexing features that have the following characteristics . first , they are easy to recognize by speech-recognition methods . second , the number of different indexing features is small such that a reasonable amount of training-data is sufficent to train the hidden-markov-models that are used by the speech-recognition process . third , the retrieval-method based on such indexing features achieves an acceptable retrieval-effectiveness as shown by experiments on text-collections . fourth , these indexing features can not only be identified in speech documents but also in text-documents . from the last characteristic follows that speech documents and text-documents can be retrieved simultaneously . analogously , the queries may contain either speech or text . thus , we have a simple multimedia-retrieval model where two different medias are indexed coherently . we also describe a prototype retrieval-system under development .
