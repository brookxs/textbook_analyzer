access by content of documents in an office information system this paper presents the integration of retrieval functions of an information-retrieval-system , iota , in an office information server . besides the linear scanning of the text (using a software and a hardware filter) , two access-methods are proposed . the first one is based on a simple indexing of documents based on signatures . here , texts are treated as character strings . we call this method textual-search . the second one is based on the extention of signature methods for implementing the indexing relation of iota , where meaningful terms (noun-groups , for example) are identified in the text together with grammatical-information . we call this method of signature computation the indexing-term signature . the resulting access-method is called semantic-search . we present the current experimentations using the schuss hardware filter as a scanning accelerator and the results of different alternatives of implementation of these retrieval functions .
