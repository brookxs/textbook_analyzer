limits of opinion-finding baseline systems in opinion-finding , the retrieval-system is tasked with retrieving not just relevant documents , but which also express an opinion towards the query target entity . most opinion-finding systems are based on a two-stage approach , where initially the system aims to retrieve relevant documents , which are then re-ranked according to the extent to which they are detected to be of an opinionated nature . in this work , we investigate how the underlying ` baseline ' retrieval-system performance affects the overall opinion-finding performance . we apply two effective opinion-finding techniques to all the baseline runs submitted to the trec 2007 blog track , and draw new insights and conclusions .
