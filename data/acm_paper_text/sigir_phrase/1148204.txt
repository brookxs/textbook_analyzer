lda-based document-models for ad-hoc-retrieval search-algorithms incorporating some form of topic-model have a long history in information-retrieval . for example , cluster-based-retrieval has been studied since the 60s and has recently produced good results in the language-model framework . an approach to building topic-models based on a formal generative-model of documents , latent-dirichlet-allocation (lda) , is heavily cited in the machine-learning literature , but its feasibility and effectiveness in information-retrieval is mostly unknown . in this paper , we study how to efficiently use lda to improve ad-hoc-retrieval . we propose an lda-based document-model within the language-modeling framework , and evaluate it on several trec collections . gibbs-sampling is employed to conduct approximate-inference in lda and the computational-complexity is analyzed . we show that improvements over retrieval using cluster-based models can be obtained with reasonable efficiency .
