the knowing camera : recognizing places-of-interest in smartphone photos this paper presents a framework called knowing camera for real-time recognizing places-of-interest in smartphone photos , with the availability of online geotagged-images of such places . we propose a probabilistic field-of-view model which captures the uncertainty in camera-sensor data . this model can be used to retrieve a set of candidate images . the visual-similarity computation of the candidate images relies on the sparse-coding technique . we also propose an ann filtering technique to speedup the sparse-coding . the final ranking combines an uncertain geometric relevance with the visual-similarity . our preliminary experiments conducted in an urban area of a large city show promising results . the most distinguishing feature of our framework is its ability to perform well in contaminated , real-world online image database . besides , our framework is highly scalable as it does not incur any complex-data structure .
