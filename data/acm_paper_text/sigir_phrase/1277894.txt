characterizing the value of personalizing search we investigate the diverse goals that people have when they issue the same query to a search-engine , and the ability of current search-engines to address such diversity . we quantify the potential value of personalizing search-results based on this analysis . great variance was found in the results that different individuals rated as relevant for the same query -- even when the same information-goal was expressed . our analysis suggests that while search-engines do a good job of ranking results to maximize global happiness , they do not do a very good job for specific individuals .
