on extending the vector-space-model for boolean-query processing an information-retrieval-model , named the generalized vector-space-model (gvsm) , is extended to handle situations where queries are specified as (extended) boolean-expressions . it is shown that this unified-model , unlike currently available alternatives , has the advantage of incorporating term correlations into the retrieval-process . the query-language extension is attractive in the sense that most of the algebraic-properties of the strict boolean language are still preserved . although the experimental-results for extended boolean-retrieval are not always better than the vector-processing method , the developments here are significant in facilitating commercially available retrieval-systems to benefit from the vector_based methods . the proposed scheme is compared to the p-norm-model advanced by salton and coworkers . an important conclusion is that it is desirable to investigate further extensions that can offer the benefits of both proposals .
