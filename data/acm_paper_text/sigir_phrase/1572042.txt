optimizing search-engine revenue in sponsored-search displaying sponsored ads alongside the search-results is a key monetization strategy for search-engine companies . since users are more likely to click ads that are relevant to their query , it is crucial for search-engine to deliver the right ads for the query and the order in which they are displayed . there are several works investigating on how to learn a ranking-function to maximize the number of ad clicks . in this paper , we address a new revenue-optimization problem and aim to answer the question : how to construct a ranking-model that can deliver high quality ads to the user as well as maximize search-engine revenue ? we introduce two novel methods from di fferent machine-learning perspectives , and both of them take the revenue component into careful considerations . the algorithms are built upon the click-through-log-data with real ad clicks and impressions . the extensively experimental-results verify the proposed algorithm that can produce more revenue than other methods as well as avoid losing relevance accuracy . to provide deep insight into the importance of each feature to search-engine revenue , we extract twelve basic features from four categories . the experimental-study provides a feature-ranking list according to the revenue benefit of each feature .
