active-memory for text-information-retrieval a symbolic associative-processor (sap) , capable of supporting parallel keyword match and record-match functions , is proposed to select and streamline textual data for information-retrieval . consequently , high volume text-data could be analysed on-the-fly before being channelled to cpu , and thus , cushion the impact of von neumann bottleneck commonly experienced in applications requiring high i/o-bandwidth . this paper identifies some of the system-requirements to support text-information-retrieval using sap with the aid of simplified examples .
