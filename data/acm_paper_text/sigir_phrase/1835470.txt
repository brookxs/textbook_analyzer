temporal click-model for sponsored-search previous studies on search-engine click-modeling have identified two presentation factors that affect users ' behavior : (1) position bias : the same result will get a different number of clicks when displayed in different positions and (2) externalities : the same result might get more clicks when displayed with results of relatively lower quality than when shown with higher quality results . in this paper we focus on analyzing the sequence of user actions to model users ' click-behavior on sponsored-listings shown on the search-results page . we first show that temporal click sequences are good indicators of externalities in the advertising domain . we then describe the positional rationality hypothesis to explain both the position bias and the externalities , and based on this hypothesis we further propose the temporal click-model (tcm) , a bayesian-framework that is scalable and computationally efficient . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt in the literature to estimate positional bias , externalities and unbiased user-perceived ad quality from user click-logs in a combined model . we finally evaluate the proposed model on two real datasets , each containing over 100 million ad impressions obtained from a commercial-search-engine . the experimental-results show that tcm outperforms two other competitive methods at click-prediction .
