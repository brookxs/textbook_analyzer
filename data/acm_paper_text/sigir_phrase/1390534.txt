xml-aided phrase-indexing for hypertext-documents we combine techniques of xml-mining and text-mining for the benefit of information-retrieval . by manipulating the word-sequence according to the xml structure of the marked-up text , we strengthen phrase boundaries so that they are more obvious to the algorithms that extract multiword sequences from text . consequently , the quality of the indexed phrases improves , which has a positive effect on the average-precision measured by the inex 2007 standards .
