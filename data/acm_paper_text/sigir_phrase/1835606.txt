evaluating whole-page relevance whole page relevance defines how well the surface-level repre-sentation of all elements on a search result page and the corre-sponding holistic attributes of the presentation respond to users ' information-needs . we introduce a method for evaluating the whole-page relevance of web-search-engine results pages . our key contribution is that the method allows us to investigate aspects of component relevance that are difficult or impossible to judge in isolation . such aspects include component-level information-redundancy and cross-component coherence . the method we describe complements traditional document relevance-measurement , affords comparative relevance-assessment across multiple search-engines , and facilitates the study of important factors such as brand presentation effects and component-level quality .
