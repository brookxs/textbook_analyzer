strategy follows technology in strategic-management there has been a debate over many years . already in 1962 alfred chandler had stated : structure follows strategy . in the nineteen eighties , michael porter modified chandler 's dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure : organizational-structure follows strategy , which in turn follows structure . so the question became : what is leading what ? . technology has in this debate been seen as a part of either the structure of the organisation itself , or part of the development of the environment in which the organisation tries to survive by adapting . the notion that technological advancement can also change the paradigmas of organisational strategy-development is new . this has mainly to do with the impact of the technological changes on the workflow and procedures of organisations . never before they were so profound as in our days . technological-change affects us on different levels of our strategic development . i will give three examples of changes that are occurring or have occurred in `` sound and vision '' . the first is the introduction of rfid transmitters in admission rings for the sound and vision experience . the second is the setup of a back office media-asset-management , storage and distribution structure for the public broadcasters . the third is the development of the archive towards becoming a media-application service-provider .
