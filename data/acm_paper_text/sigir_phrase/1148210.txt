probabilistic-model for definitional-question-answering this paper proposes a probabilistic-model for definitional-question-answering (qa) that reflects the characteristics of the definitional-question . the intention of the definitional-question is to request the definition about the question target . therefore , an answer for the definitional-question should contain the content relevant to the topic of the target , and have a representation form of the definition style . modeling the problem of definitional qa from both the topic and definition viewpoints , the proposed probabilistic-model converts the task of answering the definitional questions into that of estimating the three language-models : topic-language-model , definition-language model , and general language-model . the proposed model systematically combines several evidences in a probabilistic-framework . experimental-results show that a definitional qa-system based on the proposed probabilistic-model is comparable to state-of-the-art systems .
