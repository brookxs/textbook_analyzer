multilingual prf : english lends a helping hand in this paper , we present a novel approach to pseudo-relevance-feedback (prf) called multilingual prf (multiprf) . the key idea is to harness multilinguality . given a query in a language , we take the help of another language to ameliorate the well known problems of prf , viz . (a) the expansion terms from prf are primarily based on co-occurrence relationships with query terms , and thus other terms which are lexically and semantically related , such as morphological variants and synonyms , are not explicitly captured , and (b) prf is quite sensitive to the quality of the initially retrieved top k documents and is thus not robust . in multiprf , given a query in language l1 , it is translated into language l2 and prf is performed on a collection in language l2 and the resultant feedback-model is translated from l2 back into l1 . the final feedback-model is obtained by combining the translated model with the original feedback-model of the query in l1 . experiments were performed on standard clef collections in languages with widely differing characteristics , viz. , french , german , finnish and hungarian with english as the assisting language . we observe that multiprf outperforms prf and is more robust with consistent and significant improvements in the above widely differing languages . a thorough analysis of the results reveal that the second-language helps in obtaining both co-occurrence based conceptual terms as well as lexically and semantically related terms . additionally , the use of the second-language collection reduces the sensitivity to performance of initial retrieval , thereby making it more robust .
