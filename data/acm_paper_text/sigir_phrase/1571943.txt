from networks to human-behavior highly interconnected networks with amazingly complex topology describe systems as diverse as the world-wide-web , our cells , social-systems or the economy . recent studies indicate that these networks are the result of self-organizing processes governed by simple but generic laws , resulting in architectural features that makes them much more similar to each other than one would have expected by chance . i will discuss the amazing order characterizing our interconnected world and its implications to network-robustness and spreading processes . finally , most of these networks are driven by the temporal-patterns characterizing human-activity . i will use communication and web-browsing data to show that there is deep order in the temporal domain of human-dynamics , and discuss the different ways to understand and model the emerging-patterns .
