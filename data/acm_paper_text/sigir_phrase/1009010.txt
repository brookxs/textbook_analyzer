configurable indexing and ranking for xml-information-retrieval indexing and ranking are two key factors for efficient and effective xml-information-retrieval . inappropriate indexing may result in false-negatives and false-positives , and improper ranking may lead to low precisions . in this paper , we propose a configurable xml-information-retrieval system , in which users can configure appropriate index types for xml tags and text contents . based on users ' index configurations , the system transforms xml structures into a compact-tree representation , ctree , and indexes xml text contents . to support xml-ranking , we propose the concepts of `` weighted term-frequency '' and `` inverted element frequency , '' where the weight of a term depends on its frequency and location within an xml element as well as its popularity among similar elements in an xml dataset . we evaluate the effectiveness of our system through extensive experiments on the inex 03 dataset and 30 content-and-structure (cas) topics . the experimental-results reveal that our system has significantly high precision at low recall regions and achieves the highest average-precision (0.3309) as compared with 38 official inex 03 submissions using the strict evaluation-metric .
