a scalable assistant librarian : hierarchical subject-classification of books in this paper , we discuss our work-in-progress towards a scalable hierarchical-classification system for books using the library-of-congress subject hierarchy . we examine the characteristics of this domain which make the problem very challenging , and we look at several appropriate performance-measurements . we show that both hieron and hierarchical support-vector-machines perform moderately well .
