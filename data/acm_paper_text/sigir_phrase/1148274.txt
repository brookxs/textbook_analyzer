a complex document-information processing prototype we developed a prototype for integrated-retrieval and aggregation of diverse information contained in scanned paper-documents . such complex document-information processing combines several forms of image-processing together with textual/linguistic processing to enable effective analysis of complex document-collections , a necessity for a wide range of applications . this is the first system to attempt integrated-retrieval from complex-documents ; we report its current capabilities .
