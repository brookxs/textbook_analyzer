multiview clustering : a late-fusion approach using latent-models multi-view-clustering is an important problem in information-retrieval due to the abundance of data offering many perspectives and generating multi-view representations . we investigate in this short note a late-fusion approach for multi-view-clustering based on the latent modeling of cluster-cluster relationships . we derive a probabilistic multi-view-clustering model outperforming an early-fusion approach based on multi-view feature correlation-analysis .
