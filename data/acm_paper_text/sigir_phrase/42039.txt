improved techniques for processing queries in full-text systems in static full-text-retrieval systems , which accommodate metrical as well as boolean-operators , the traditional approach to query-processing uses a concordance , from which large-sets of coordinates are retrieved and then merged and/or collated . alternatively , in a system with l documents , the concordance can be replaced by a set of bit-maps of fixed length l , which are constructed for every different word of the database and serve as occurrence maps . we propose to combine the concordance and bit-map approaches , and show how this can speed up the processing of queries : fast anding and oring of the maps in a preprocessing stage , lead to large i/o savings in collating coordinates of keywords needed to satisfy the metrical and boolean-constraints . moreover , the bit-maps give partial-information on the distribution of the coordinates of the keywords , which can be used when queries must be processed by stages , due to their complexity and the sizes of the involved sets of coordinates . the new techniques are partially implemented at the responsa retrieval project .
