towards an information logic ` probability is expectation founded upon partial knowledge . ' (boole , 1854) information-retrieval based on stored program electronic computers has been an active area of research since the time these machines were invented . it is therefore somewhat surprising that even now no formal computational-model for ir exists . there is no well-defined logic to describe information-retrieval , and there is no proof or model-theory to talk about the truths of ir . this paper argues that much of the research work in the past has been steps in the direction of a logic for ir . these steps have been taken by developing formal-models for information-retrieval , but to date none of these are complete nor could any claim to be a computational-model for ir . to appreciate this development i shall present a picture of ir , describing bits of a puzzle which may fit together to point to a new framework within which a computational-model or logic could be described .
