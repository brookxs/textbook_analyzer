multi searcher : can we support people to get information from text they ca n't read or understand ? the goal of the proposed tool multi searcher is to answer this research question : can we expect people to be able to get information from text in languages they can not read or understand ? the proposed tool multi searcher provides users with interactive contextual-information that describes the translation in the user 's own language so that the user has a certain degree of confidence about the translation . therefore , the user is considered as an integral part of the retrieval-process . the tool provides possibilities to interactively select relevant terms from contextual-information in order to improve the translation and thus improve the cross-lingual-information-retrieval (clir) process .
