sugarcube : quantification of topic-propagation in the blogosphere using percolation-theory blogs facilitate online debates and discussions for millions of people around the world . identifying the most popular and prevailing topics discussed in the blogosphere is a crucial task . this poster describes our novel approach to the quantification of the level of topic-propagation in the blogosphere . our model uses graph-theoretic representations of the blogosphere 's link-structures that allows it to deduce the ` percolation threshold ' , which is then used in the quantification and definition of a global topic . the result of our experiments on a blog collection shows that our model is able to quantify the propagation of topics . moreover , our model is successful in identifying specific topics that propagate throughout the blogosphere and classifies them as ` global ' .
