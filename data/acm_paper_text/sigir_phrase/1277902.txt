the relationship between ir-effectiveness-measures and user-satisfaction this paper presents an experimental-study of users assessing the quality of google web search-results . in particular we look at how users ' satisfaction correlates with the effectiveness of google as quantified by ir-measures such as precision and the suite of cumulative-gain measures (cg , dcg , ndcg) . results indicate strong correlation between users ' satisfaction , cg and precision , moderate correlation with dcg , with perhaps surprisingly negligible correlation with ndcg . the reasons for the low correlation with ndcg are examined .
