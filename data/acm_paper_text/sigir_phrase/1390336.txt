guilt by association as a search-principle the exploitation of fundamental invariants is among the most elegant solutions to many computational-problems in a wide variety of domains . one of the more powerful approaches to exploit invariants is the principle of `` guilt by association '' . in particular , the principle of guilt by association is the foundation of remote homolog detection , protein-function-prediction , disease subtype diagnosis , treatment plan prognosis , and other challenges in computational-biology . the principle suggests that two entities are in a specific relationship if they exhibit invariant-properties underlying that relationship . for example , a protein is predicted to have a particular biological function if it exhibits the underlying invariant-properties of that functional group -- viz. , guilty by association to other members of that functional group through the shared invariant-properties . in my talk , i plan to present several facets of guilt by association in the computational prediction of protein-function and draw parallels of these facets in information-retrieval . specifically , i plan to touch on the following facets : (a) the issue of chance associations ; (b) novel generalizable forms of association ; (c) fusion of multiple heterogeneous sources of evidence ; (d) the dichotomy of knowing to a high degree of reliability that two entities are in some relationship and yet not knowing what that relationship is . i hope this talk will be , for the informational-retrieval community , a window to the opportunities in computational-biology that may benefit from the depth and variety of solutions information-retrieval has to offer .
