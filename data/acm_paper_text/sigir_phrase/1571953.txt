efficient-query-expansion for advertisement search online-advertising represents a growing part of the revenues of major internet-service-providers such as google and yahoo . a commonly used strategy is to place advertisements (ads) on the search result pages according to the users ' submitted queries . relevant ads are likely to be clicked by a user and to increase the revenues of both advertisers and publishers . however , bid phrases defined by ad-owners are usually contained in limited number of ads . directly matching user queries with bid phrases often results in finding few appropriate ads . to address this shortcoming , query-expansion is often used to increase the chances to match the ads . nevertheless , query-expansion on top of the traditional inverted-index faces efficiency issues such as high time-complexity and heavy i/o costs . moreover , precision can not always be improved , sometimes even hurt due to the involvement of additional noise . in this paper , we propose an efficient ad-search solution relying on a block-based-index able to tackle the issues associated with query-expansion . our index-structure places clusters of similar bid phrases in corresponding blocks with their associated ads . it reduces the number of merge operations significantly during query-expansion and allows sequential scans rather than random accesses , saving i/o costs . we adopt flexible block sizes according to the clustering results of bid phrases to further optimize the index-structure for efficient ad-search . the pre-computation of such clusters is achieved through an agglomerative iterative-clustering algorithm . finally , we adapt the spreading-activation mechanism to return the top-k relevant ads , improving search precision . the experimental-results of our prototype , adsearch , show that we can indeed return a larger number of relevant ads without sacrificing execution speed .
