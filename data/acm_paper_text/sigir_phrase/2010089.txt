region-based landmark-discovery by crowdsourcing geo-referenced-photos we propose a novel model for landmark-discovery that locates region-based landmarks on map in contrast to the traditional point-based landmarks . the proposed method preserves more information and automatically identifies candidate regions on map by crowdsourcing geo-referenced-photos . gaussian kernel convolution is applied to remove noises and generate detected region . we adopt f1 measure to evaluate discovered landmarks and manually check the association between tags and regions . the experiment results show that more than 90 \ % of attractions in the selected city can be correctly located by this method .
