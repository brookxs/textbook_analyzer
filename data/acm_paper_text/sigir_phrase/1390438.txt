a general optimization framework for smoothing language-models on graph structures recent work on language-models for information-retrieval has shown that smoothing language-models is crucial for achieving good retrieval-performance . many different effective smoothing-methods have been proposed , which mostly implement various heuristics to exploit corpus-structures . in this paper , we propose a general and unified optimization framework for smoothing language-models on graph structures . this framework not only provides a unified formulation of the existing smoothing heuristics , but also serves as a road-map for systematically exploring smoothing-methods for language-models . we follow this road-map and derive several different instantiations of the framework . some of the instantiations lead to novel smoothing-methods . empirical-results show that all such instantiations are effective with some outperforming the-state-of-the-art smoothing-methods .
