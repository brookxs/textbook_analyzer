improving web-search-results using affinity-graph in this paper , we propose a novel ranking-scheme named affinity-ranking (ar) to re-rank search-results by optimizing two metrics : (1) diversity -- which indicates the variance of topics in a group of documents ; (2) information-richness -- which measures the coverage of a single-document to its topic . both of the two metrics are calculated from a directed link-graph named affinity-graph (ag) . ag models the structure of a group of documents based on the asymmetric content similarities between each pair of documents . experimental-results in yahoo! directory , odp data , and newsgroup data demonstrate that our proposed ranking-algorithm significantly improves the search-performance . specifically , the algorithm achieves 31 \ % improvement in diversity and 12 \ % improvement in information-richness relatively within the top 10 search-results .
