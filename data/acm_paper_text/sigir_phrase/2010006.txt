ilda : interdependent lda model for learning latent aspects and their ratings from online-product-reviews today , more and more product-reviews become available on the internet , e.g. , product-review forums , discussion-groups , and blogs . however , it is almost impossible for a customer to read all of the different and possibly even contradictory opinions and make an informed decision . therefore , mining online-reviews (opinion-mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction . extracting aspects and the corresponding ratings is an important challenge in opinion-mining . an aspect is an attribute or component of a product , e.g. ` screen ' for a-digital camera . it is common that reviewers use different words to describe an aspect (e.g. ` lcd ' , ` display ' , ` screen ') . a rating is an intended interpretation of the user-satisfaction in terms of numerical values . reviewers usually express the rating of an aspect by a set of sentiments , e.g. ` blurry screen ' . in this paper we present three probabilistic-graphical-models which aim to extract aspects and corresponding ratings of products from online-reviews . the first two models extend standard plsi and lda to generate a rated aspect summary of product-reviews . as our main contribution , we introduce interdependent latent-dirichlet-allocation (ilda) model . this model is more natural for our task since the underlying probabilistic assumptions (interdependency between aspects and ratings) are appropriate for our problem-domain . we conduct experiments on a real life dataset , epinions.com , demonstrating the improved effectiveness of the ilda model in terms of the likelihood of a held-out test-set , and the accuracy of aspects and aspect ratings .
