who said what to whom ? : capturing the structure of debates transcripts of meetings are a document genre characterized by a complex narrative-structure . the essence is not only what is said , but also by who and to whom . this paper investigates whether we can use semantic-annotations like the speaker in order to capture this debate structure , as well as the related-content of the debate . the structure is visualized in a graph , while the content is condensed into word-clouds , that are created using a parsimonious language model . evaluation shows that both tools adequately capture the structure-and-content of the debate at an aggregated level .
