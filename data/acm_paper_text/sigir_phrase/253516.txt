p-trees : storage efficient multiway-trees a new variation of high order multiway tree-structures , the p-tree is presented . p-trees have average access costs that are significantly better than those of b-trees and are no worse (and often better) in storage utilization . unlike compact b-trees , they can be maintained dynamically , and unlike dense multiway-trees and b-trees , their associated insertion algorithm , which is also presented , is cheap and involves (at most) a very localized rearrangement of keys .
