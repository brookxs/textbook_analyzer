assigning identifiers to documents to enhance the clustering property of fulltext indexes web-search-engines provide a large-scale text document-retrieval service by processing huge inverted-file indexes . inverted-file indexes allow fast-query resolution and good memory-utilization since their d - gaps representation can be effectively and efficiently compressed by using variable-length encoding methods . this paper proposes and evaluates some algorithms aimed to find an assignment of the document identifiers which minimizes the average values of d - gaps , thus enhancing the effectiveness of traditional compression methods . we ran several tests over the google contest collection in order to validate the techniques proposed . the experiments demonstrated the scalability and effectiveness of our algorithms . using the proposed algorithms , we were able to sensibly improve (up to 20.81 \ %) the compression ratios of several encoding-schemes .
