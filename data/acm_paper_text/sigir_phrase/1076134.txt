a geometric interpretation of r-precision and its correlation with average-precision we consider two of the most commonly cited measures of retrieval-performance : average-precision and r-precision . it is well known that average-precision and r-precision are highly correlated and similarly robust measures-of-performance , though the reasons for this are not entirely clear . in this paper , we give a geometric argument which shows that under a very reasonable set of assumptions , average-precision and r-precision both approximate the area under the precision-recall-curve , thus explaining their high correlation . we further demonstrate through the use of trec-data that the similarity or difference between average-precision and r-precision is largely governed by the adherence to , or violation of , these reasonable assumptions .
