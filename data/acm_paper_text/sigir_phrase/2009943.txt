enhancing ad-hoc relevance-weighting using probability-density-estimation classical probabilistic-information-retrieval (ir) models , e.g. bm25 , deal with document-length based on a trade-off between the verbosity hypothesis , which assumes the independence of a document 's relevance of its length , and the scope hypothesis , which assumes the opposite . despite the effectiveness of the classical probabilistic-models , the potential relationship between document-length and relevance is not fully explored to improve retrieval-performance . in this paper , we conduct an in-depth study of this relationship based on the scope hypothesis that document-length does have its impact on relevance . we study a list of probability-density-functions and examine which of the density-functions fits the best to the actual distribution of the document length . based on the studied probability-density-functions , we propose a length-based bm25 relevance-weighting model , called bm25l , which incorporates document-length as a substantial weighting factor . extensive experiments conducted on standard trec collections show that our proposed bm25l markedly outperforms the original bm25 model , even if the latter is optimized .
