time-sensitive query-auto-completion query-auto-completion (qac) is a common feature in modern search-engines . high quality qac candidates enhance search experience by saving users time that otherwise would be spent on typing each character or word sequentially . current qac methods rank suggestions according to their past popularity . however , query-popularity changes over time , and the ranking of candidates must be adjusted accordingly . for instance , while halloween might be the right suggestion after typing ha in october , harry potter might be better any other time . surprisingly , despite the importance of qac as a key feature in most online-search-engines , its temporal-dynamics have been under-studied . in this paper , we propose a time-sensitive approach for query-auto-completion . instead of ranking candidates according to their past popularity , we apply time-series and rank candidates according their forecasted frequencies . our experiments on 846k queries and their daily frequencies sampled over a period of 4.5 years show that predicting the popularity of queries solely based on their past frequency can be misleading , and the forecasts obtained by time-series modeling are substantially more reliable . our results also suggest that modeling the temporal trends of queries can significantly improve the ranking of qac candidates .
