belief-revision for adaptive-information-retrieval applying belief-revision logic to model adaptive-information-retrieval is appealing since it provides a rigorous theoretical foundation to model partiality and uncertainty inherent in any information-retrieval (ir) processes . in particular , a retrieval context can be formalised as a belief set and the formalised context is used to disambiguate vague user queries . belief-revision logic also provides a robust computational mechanism to revise an ir-system 's beliefs about the users ' changing information-needs . in addition , information-flow is proposed as a text-mining method to automatically acquire the initial ir contexts . the advantage of a belief-based irsystem is that its ir behaviour is more predictable and explanatory . however , computational-efficiency is often a concern when the belief-revision formalisms are applied to large real-life applications . this paper describes our belief-based adaptive ir system which is underpinned by an efficient belief-revision mechanism . our initial experiments show that the belief-based symbolic ir model is more effective than a classical quantitative ir model . to our best knowledge , this is the first successful empirical-evaluation of a logic-based-ir model based on large ir benchmark collections .
