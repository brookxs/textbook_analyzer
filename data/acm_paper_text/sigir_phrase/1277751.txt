effective missing-data prediction for collaborative-filtering memory-based collaborative-filtering algorithms have been widely adopted in many popular recommender-systems , although these approaches all suffer from data-sparsity and poor prediction-quality problems . usually , the user-item-matrix is quite sparse , which directly leads to inaccurate recommendations . this paper focuses the memory-based collaborative-filtering problems on two crucial factors : (1) similarity-computation between users or items and (2) missing-data prediction algorithms . first , we use the enhanced pearson-correlation-coefficient (pcc) algorithm by adding one parameter which overcomes the potential decrease of accuracy when computing the similarity of users or items . second , we propose an effective missing-data prediction-algorithm , in which information of both users and items is taken into account . in this algorithm , we set the similarity-threshold for users and items respectively , and the prediction-algorithm will determine whether predicting the missing-data or not . we also address how to predict the missing-data by employing a combination of user and item information . finally , empirical-studies on dataset movielens have shown that our newly proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art collaborative-filtering algorithms and it is more robust against data-sparsity .
