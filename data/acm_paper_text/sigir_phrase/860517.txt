a unified-model for metasearch and the efficient evaluation of retrieval-systems via the hedge algorithm we present a unified-framework for simultaneously solving both the pooling problem (the construction of efficient document pools for the evaluation of retrieval-systems) and metasearch (the fusion of ranked-lists returned by retrieval-systems in order to increase performance) . the implementation is based on the hedge algorithm for online-learning , which has the advantage of convergence to bounded error-rates approaching the performance of the best linear-combination of the underlying systems . the choice of a loss-function closely related to the average-precision measure of system-performance ensures that the judged document-set performs well , both in constructing a metasearch list and as a pool for the accurate evaluation of retrieval-systems . our experimental-results on trec-data demonstrate excellent performance in all measures -- evaluation of systems , retrieval of relevant documents , and generation of metasearch lists .
