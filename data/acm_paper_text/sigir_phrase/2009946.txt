mining tags using social-endorsement networks entities on social-systems , such as users on twitter , and images on flickr , are at the core of many interesting applications : they can be ranked in search-results , recommended to users , or used in contextual-advertising . such applications assume knowledge of an entity 's nature and characteristic attributes . an effective way to encode such knowledge is in the form of tags . an untagged entity is practically inaccessible , since it is hard to retrieve or interact with . to address this , some platforms allow users to manually tag entities . however , while such tags can be informative , they can oftentimes be inadequate , trivial , ambiguous , or even plain false . numerous automated-tagging methods have been proposed to address these issues . however , most of them require pre-existing high-quality tags or descriptive texts for every entity that needs to be tagged . in our work , we propose a method based on social endorsements that is free from such constraints . virtually every major social-networking platform allows users to endorse entities that they find appealing . examples include `` following '' twitter users or `` favoriting '' flickr photos . these endorsements are abundant and directly capture the preferences of users . in this paper , we pose and solve the problem of using the underlying social-endorsement network to extract useful tags for entities in a social-system . our work leverages techniques from topic-modeling to capture the interests of users and then uses them to extract relevant and descriptive tags for the entities they endorse . we perform an extensive evaluation of our proposed approach on real large-scale-datasets from both twitter and flickr , and show that it significantly outperforms meaningful and competitive baselines .
