knowledge-transformation from word-space to document space in most ir clustering problems , we directly cluster the documents , working in the document space , using cosine-similarity between documents as the similarity-measure . in many real-world-applications , however , we usually have knowledge on the word side and wish to transform this knowledge to the document (concept) side . in this paper , we provide a mechanism for this knowledge-transformation . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first model for such type of knowledge-transformation . this model uses a nonnegative-matrix-factorization model x = fsg t , where x is the word document semantic matrix , f is the posterior-probability of a word belonging to a word cluster and represents knowledge in the word-space , g is the posterior-probability of a document belonging to a document-cluster and represents knowledge in the document space , and s is a scaled matrix factor which provides a condensed view of x . we show how knowledge on words can improve document-clustering , i.e , knowledge in the word-space is transformed into the document space . we perform extensive experiments to validate our approach .
