where to start filtering redundancy ? : a cluster-based approach novelty-detection is a difficult task , particularly at sentence-level . most of the approaches proposed in the past consist of re-ordering all sentences following their novelty scores . however , this re-ordering has usually little value . in fact , a naive baseline with no novelty-detection capabilities yields often better performance than any state-of-the-art novelty-detection mechanism . we argue here that this is because current methods initiate too early the novelty-detection process . when few sentences have been seen , it is unlikely that the user is negatively affected by redundancy . therefore , re-ordering the first sentences may be harmful in terms of performance . we propose here a query-dependent method based on cluster-analysis to determine where we must start filtering redundancy .
