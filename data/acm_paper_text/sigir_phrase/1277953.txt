query-suggestion based on user landing-pages this poster investigates a novel query-suggestion technique that selects query-refinements through a combination of many users ' post-query navigation-patterns and the query-logs of a large search-engine . we compare this technique , which uses the queries that retrieve in the top-ranked search-results places where searchers end up after post-query browsing (i.e. , the landing-pages) , with an approach based on query-refinements from user-search sessions extracted from query-logs . our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using landing-pages for the direct generation of query-suggestions , as well as the complementary nature of the suggestions it generates with regard to traditional query-log_based refinement methodologies .
