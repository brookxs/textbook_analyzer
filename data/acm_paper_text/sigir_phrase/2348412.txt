improving tweet stream-classification by detecting changes in word probability we propose a classification-model of tweet streams in twitter , which are representative of document streams whose statistical-properties will change over time . our model solves several problems that hinder the classification of tweets ; in particular , the problem that the probabilities of word occurrence change at different rates for different words . our model switches between two probability-estimates based on full and recent data for each word when detecting changes in word probability . this switching enables our model to achieve both accurate learning of stationary words and quick response to bursty words . we then explain how to implement our model by using a word suffix array , which is a full-text-search index . using the word suffix array allows our model to handle the temporal attributes of word n-grams effectively . experiments on three tweet data-sets demonstrate that our model offers statistically significant higher topic-classification accuracy than conventional temporally-aware classification-models .
