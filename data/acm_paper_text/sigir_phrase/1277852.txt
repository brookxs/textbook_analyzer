detecting , categorizing and clustering entity-mentions-in-chinese text the work presented in this paper is motivated by the practical need for content-extraction , and the available data source and evaluation-benchmark from the ace program . the chinese entity-detection and recognition (edr) task is of particular interest to us . this task presents us several language-independent and language-dependent challenges , e.g. rising from the complication of extraction targets and the problem of word-segmentation , etc. . in this paper , we propose a novel solution to alleviate the problems special in the task . mention-detection takes advantages of machine-learning-approaches and character-based models . it manipulates different types of entities being mentioned and different constitution units (i.e. extents and heads) separately . mentions referring to the same entity are linked together by integrating most-specific-first and closest-first rule-based pairwise-clustering algorithms . types of mentions and entities are determined by head-driven classification approaches . the implemented system achieves ace value of 66.1 when evaluated on the edr 2005 chinese-corpus , which has been one of the top-tier results . alternative approaches to mention-detection and clustering are also discussed and analyzed .
