sentiment-analysis of user-comments for one-class-collaborative-filtering over ted talks user-generated texts such as reviews , comments or discussions are valuable indicators of users ' preferences . unlike previous works which focus on labeled-data from user-contributed reviews , we focus here on user-comments which are not accompanied by explicit rating labels . we investigate their utility for a one-class-collaborative-filtering task such as bookmarking , where only the user actions are given as ground-truth . we propose a sentiment-aware nearest-neighbor model (sann) for multimedia recommendations over ted talks , which makes use of user-comments . the model outperforms significantly , by more than 25 % on unseen data , several competitive baselines .
