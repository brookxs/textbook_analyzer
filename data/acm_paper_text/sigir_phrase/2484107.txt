estimating query representativeness for query-performance-prediction the query-performance-prediction (qpp) task is estimating retrieval-effectiveness with no relevance-judgments . we present a novel probabilistic-framework for qpp that gives rise to an important aspect that was not addressed in previous work ; namely , the extent to which the query effectively represents the information-need for retrieval . accordingly , we devise a few query-representativeness measures that utilize relevance language-models . experiments show that integrating the most effective measures with state-of-the-art predictors in our framework often yields prediction-quality that significantly transcends that of using the predictors alone .
