tagcloud-based explanation with feedback for recommender-systems personalized recommender-systems aim to push only the relevant items and information directly to the users without requiring them to browse through millions of web-resources . the challenge of these systems is to achieve a high user-acceptance rate on their recommendations . in this paper , we aim to increase the user-acceptance of recommendations by providing more intuitive tag-based explanations of why the items are recommended . tags are used as intermediary entities that not only relate target users to the recommended items but also understand users ' intents . our system also allows tag-based online relevance-feedback . experiment results on the movielens dataset show that the proposed approach is able to increase the acceptance rate of recommendations and improve user-satisfaction .
