a graph-based framework for relation-propagation and its application to multi-label-learning label-propagation exploits the structure of the unlabeled documents by propagating the label-information of the training-documents to the unlabeled documents . the limitation with the existing label-propagation approaches is that they can only deal with a single type of objects . we propose a framework , named '' relation-propagation '' , that allows for information propagated among multiple-types of objects . empirical-studies with multi-label text-categorization showed that the proposed algorithm is more effective than several semi-supervised-learning algorithms in that it is capable of exploring the correlation among different categories and the structure of unlabeled documents simultaneously .
