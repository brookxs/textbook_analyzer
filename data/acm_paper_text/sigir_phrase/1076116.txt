an exploration of axiomatic approaches to information-retrieval existing retrieval-models generally do not offer any guarantee for optimal retrieval-performance . indeed , it is even difficult , if not impossible , to predict a model 's empirical performance analytically . this limitation is at least partly caused by the way existing retrieval-models are developed where relevance is only coarsely modeled at the level of documents and queries as opposed to a finer granularity-level of terms . in this paper , we present a new axiomatic-approach to developing retrieval-models based on direct-modeling of relevance with formalized retrieval-constraints defined at the level of terms . the basic idea of this axiomatic-approach is to search in a space of candidate retrieval functions for one that can satisfy a set of reasonable retrieval-constraints . to constrain the search-space , we propose to define a retrieval-function inductively and decompose a retrieval-function into three component functions . inspired by the analysis of the existing retrieval functions with the inductive definition , we derive several new retrieval functions using the axiomatic retrieval-framework . experiment results show that the derived new retrieval functions are more robust and less sensitive to parameter-settings than the existing retrieval functions with comparable optimal-performance .
