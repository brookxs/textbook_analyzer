vertical-selection in the presence of unlabeled verticals vertical aggregation is the task of incorporating results from specialized-search-engines or verticals (e.g. , images , video , news) into web-search-results . vertical-selection is the subtask of deciding , given a query , which verticals , if any , are relevant . state-of-the-art approaches use machine-learned-models to predict which verticals are relevant to a query . when trained using a large set of labeled-data , a machine learned vertical-selection model outperforms baselines which require no training-data . unfortunately , whenever a new vertical is introduced , a costly new set of editorial data must be gathered . in this paper , we propose methods for reusing training-data from a set of existing (source) verticals to learn a predictive-model for a new (target) vertical . we study-methods for learning robust , portable , and adaptive cross-vertical models . experiments show the need to focus on different types of features when maximizing portability (the ability for a single model to make accurate predictions across multiple verticals) than when maximizing adaptability (the ability for a single model to make accurate predictions for a specific vertical) . we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through extensive experimentation for 11 verticals
