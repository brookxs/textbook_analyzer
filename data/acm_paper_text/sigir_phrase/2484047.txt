modeling user 's receptiveness over time for recommendation existing recommender-systems model user-interests and the social influences independently . in reality , user-interests may change over time , and as the interests change , new friends may be added while old friends grow apart and the new friendships formed may cause further interests change . this complex interaction requires the joint-modeling of user-interest and social-relationships over time . in this paper , we propose a probabilistic-generative-model , called receptiveness over time-model (rtm) , to capture this interaction . we design a gibbs-sampling algorithm to learn the receptiveness and interest distributions among users over time . the results of experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that rtm-based recommendation outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation-methods . case-studies also show that rtm is able to discover the user-interest shift and receptiveness change over time
