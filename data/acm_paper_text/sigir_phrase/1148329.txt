strict and vague interpretation of xml-retrieval queries structural hints in xml-retrieval queries can be used to specify both the granularity of the search result (the target element) and where in a document to search (support elements) . these hints might be interpreted either strictly or vaguely , but does it matter if an xml-search-engine interprets these in one way and the user in another ? the performance of all runs submitted to inex 2005 content-and-structure (cas) tasks were measured for each of four different interpretations of cas . runs that perform well for one interpretation of target elements do so regardless of the interpretation of support elements ; but how to interpret the target element does matter . this suggests that to perform well on all cas queries it is necessary to know how the target structure specification should be interpreted . we extend the nexi query-language to include this , and hypothesize that using this will increase the overall performance of search-engines .
