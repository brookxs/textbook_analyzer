quantifying performance and quality gains in distributed-web-search engines distributed-search-engines based on geographical partitioning of a central web index emerge as a feasible solution to the immense growth of the-web , user bases , and query traffic . however , there is still lack of research in quantifying the performance and quality gains that can be achieved by such architectures . in this paper , we develop various cost-models to evaluate the performance benefits of a geographically distributed search-engine-architecture based on partial index-replication and query-forwarding . specifically , we focus on possible performance gains due to the distributed nature of query-processing and web-crawling processes . we show that any response-time gain achieved by distributed-query-processing can be utilized to improve search-relevance as the use of complex but more accurate algorithms can now be enabled for document-ranking . we also show that distributed-web-crawling leads to better web-coverage and try to see if this improves the search-quality . we verify the validity of our claims over large , real-life datasets via simulations .
