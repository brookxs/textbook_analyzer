a financial cost metric for result-caching web-search-engines cache results of frequent and/or recent queries . result-caching strategies can be evaluated using different metrics , hit-rate being the most well-known . recent works take the processing overhead of queries into account when evaluating the performance of result-caching strategies and propose cost-aware caching-strategies . in this paper , we propose a financial cost metric that goes one step beyond and takes also the hourly electricity prices into account when computing the cost . we evaluate the most well-known static , dynamic , and hybrid result-caching strategies under this new metric . moreover , we propose a financial-cost-aware version of the well-known lru strategy and show that it outperforms the original lru strategy in terms of the financial cost metric .
