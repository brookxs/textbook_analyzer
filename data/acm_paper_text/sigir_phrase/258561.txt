passage-retrieval revisited ranking based on passages addresses some of the shortcomings of whole-document ranking . it provides convenient units of text to return to the user , avoids the difficulties of comparing documents of different length , and enables identification of short blocks of relevant material amongst otherwise irrelevant text . in this paper we explore the potential of passage-retrieval , based on an experimental-evaluation of the ability of passages to identify relevant documents . we compare our scheme of arbitrary passage-retrieval to several other document-retrieval and passage-retrieval methods ; we show experimentally that , compared to these methods , ranking via fixed-length passages is robust and effective . our experiments also show that , compared to whole-document ranking , ranking via fixed-length arbitrary passages significantly improves retrieval-effectiveness , by 8 \ % for trec disks 2 and 4 and by 18 \ % -37 \ % for the federal register collection .
