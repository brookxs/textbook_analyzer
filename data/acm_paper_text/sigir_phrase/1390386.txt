multi-document-summarization using cluster-based-link-analysis the markov random-walk-model has been recently exploited for multi-document-summarization by making use of the link-relationships between sentences in the document-set , under the assumption that all the sentences are indistinguishable from each other . however , a given document-set usually covers a few topic-themes with each theme represented by a cluster of sentences . the topic-themes are usually not equally important and the sentences in an important theme cluster are deemed more salient than the sentences in a trivial theme cluster . this paper proposes the cluster-based conditional-markov-random-walk-model (clustercmrw) and the cluster-based hits model (clusterhits) to fully leverage the cluster-level information . experimental-results on the duc2001 and duc2002 datasets demonstrate the good effectiveness of our proposed summarization models . the results also demonstrate that the clustercmrw model is more robust than the clusterhits model , with respect to different cluster numbers .
