a latent-topic model for linked documents documents in many corpora , such as digital-libraries and webpages , contain both content and link information . to explicitly consider the document relations represented by links , in this paper we propose a citation-topic (ct) model which assumes a probabilistic generative process for corpora . in the ct model a given document is modeled as a mixture of a set of topic distributions , each of which is borrowed (cited) from a document that is related to the given document . moreover , the ct model contains a random-process for selecting the related documents according to the structure of the generative-model determined by links and therefore , the transitivity of the relations among documents is captured . we apply the ct model on the document-clustering task and the experimental comparisons against several state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate very promising performances .
