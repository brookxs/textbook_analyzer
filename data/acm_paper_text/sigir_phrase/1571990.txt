a 2-poisson-model for probabilistic coreference of named-entities for improved text-retrieval text-retrieval queries frequently contain named-entities . the standard approach of term-frequency weighting does not work well when estimating the term-frequency of a named-entity , since anaphoric-expressions (like he , she , the movie , etc) are frequently used to refer to named-entities in a document , and the use of anaphoric-expressions causes the term-frequency of named-entities to be underestimated . in this paper , we propose a novel 2-poisson-model to estimate the frequency of anaphoric-expressions of a named-entity , without explicitly resolving the anaphoric-expressions . our key assumption is that the frequency of anaphoric-expressions is distributed over named-entities in a document according to the probabilities of whether the document is elite for the named-entities . this assumption leads us to formulate our proposed co-referentially enhanced entity frequency (ceef) . experimental-results on the text-collection of trec blog track show that ceef achieves significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art retrieval-methods using standard term frequency-estimation . in particular , we achieve a 3 \ % increase of map over the best performing run of trec 2008 blog track .
