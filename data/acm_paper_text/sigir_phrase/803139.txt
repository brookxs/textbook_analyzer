a tree-algorithm for nearest-neighbor-searching in document-retrieval systems the problem of finding nearest-neighbors to a query in a document-collection is a special case of associative-retrieval , in which searches are performed using more than one key . a nearest-neighbors associative-retrieval algorithm , suitable for document-retrieval using similarity-matching , is described . the basic structure used is a binary-tree , at each node a set of keys (concepts) is tested to select the most promising branch . backtracking to initially rejected branches is allowed and often necessary . under certain conditions , the search-time required by this algorithm is 0 (log 2 n) k . n is the number of documents , and k is a system-dependent parameter . a series of experiments with a small collection confirm the predictions made using the analytic-model ; k is approximately 4 in this situation . this algorithm is compared with two other searching algorithms ; sequential search and clustered search . for large-collections , the average search-time for this algorithm is less than that for a sequential search and greater than that for a clustered search . however , the clustered search , unlike the sequential search and this algorithm , does not guarantee that the near neighbors found are actually the nearest-neighbors .
