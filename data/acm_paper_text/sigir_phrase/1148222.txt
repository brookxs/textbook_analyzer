finding near-duplicate web pages : a large-scale evaluation of algorithms broder et al. 's [3] shingling algorithm and charikar 's [4] random-projection_based approach are considered `` state-of-the-art '' algorithms for finding near-duplicate web pages . both algorithms were either developed at or used by popular web-search-engines . we compare the two algorithms on a very-large scale , namely on a set of 1.6 b distinct web-pages . the results show that neither of the algorithms works well for finding near-duplicate pairs on the same site , while both achieve high precision for near-duplicate pairs on different sites . since charikar 's algorithm finds more near-duplicate pairs on different sites , it achieves a better precision overall , namely 0.50 versus 0.38 for broder et al. 's algorithm . we present a combined algorithm which achieves precision 0.79 with 79 \ % of the recall of the other algorithms .
