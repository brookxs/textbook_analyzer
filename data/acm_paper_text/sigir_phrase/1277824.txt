hits hits trec : exploring ir-evaluation results with network-analysis we propose a novel method of analysing data gathered fromtrec or similar information-retrieval-evaluation experiments . we define two normalized versions of average-precision , that we use to construct a weighted bipartite graph of trec systems and topics . we analyze the meaning of well known - and somewhat generalized - indicators fromsocial network-analysis on the systems-topics graph . we apply this method to an analysis of trec 8 data ; amongthe results , we find that authority measures systems performance , that hubness of topics reveals that some topics are better than others at distinguishing more or less effective systems , that with current measures a system that wants to be effective in trec needs to be effective on easy topics , and that by using different effectiveness-measures this is no longer the case .
