summary-evaluation and text-categorization in general terms the evaluation of a summary depends on how close it is to the chief points in the source-text . this begets the question as to what are the chief points in the source-text and how is this information used in itself in identifying the source-text . this is crucially important when we discuss automatic-evaluation of summaries . so the question of main points is the source-text . typically , this would be around a nucleus of keywords . however , the salience , the frequency , and the relationship of the text with other texts in the collection (of these keywords is perhaps) are important . text-categorisation using neural-networks explicates these points well and also has a practical impact .
