efficient in-memory top-k document-retrieval for over forty years the dominant data-structure for ranked document-retrieval has been the inverted-index . inverted-indexes are effective for a variety of document-retrieval tasks , and particularly efficient for large-data collection scenarios that require disk access and storage . however , many efficiency-bound search-tasks can now easily be supported entirely in memory as a result of recent hardware advances . in this paper we present a hybrid algorithmic-framework for in-memory bag of-words ranked document-retrieval using a self-index derived from the fm-index , wavelet tree , and the compressed suffix-tree data-structures , and evaluate the various algorithmic trade-offs for performing efficient queries entirely in-memory . we compare our approach with two classic approaches to bag-of-words queries using inverted-indexes , term-at-a-time (taat) and document-at-a-time (daat) query-processing . we show that our framework is competitive with state-of-the-art indexing-structures , and describe new capabilities provided by our algorithms that can be leveraged by future systems to improve effectiveness and efficiency for a variety of fundamental search operations .
