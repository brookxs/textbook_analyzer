probabilistic latent query-analysis for combining multiple retrieval sources combining the output from multiple retrieval sources over the same document-collection is of great importance to a number of retrieval tasks such as multimedia-retrieval , web-retrieval and meta-search . to merge retrieval sources adaptively according to query topics , we propose a series of new approaches called probabilistic latent query-analysis (plqa) , which can associate non-identical combination weights with latent classes underlying the query space . compared with previous query independent and query-class based combination methods , the proposed approaches have the advantage of being able to discover latent query classes automatically without using prior human-knowledge , to assign one query to a mixture of query classes , and to determine the number of query classes under a model-selection principle . experimental-results on two retrieval tasks , i.e. , multimedia-retrieval and meta-search , demonstrate that the proposed methods can uncover sensible latent classes from training-data , and can achieve considerable performance gains .
