evaluation-measures for preference-judgments there has been recent interest in collecting user or assessor preferences , rather than absolute judgments of relevance , for the evaluation or learning of ranking-algorithms . since measures like precision , recall , and dcg are defined over absolute judgments , evaluation over preferences will require new evaluation-measures that explicitly model them . we describe a class of such measures and compare absolute and preference measures over a large trec collection .
