extending bm25 with multiple query operators traditional probabilistic relevance frameworks for informational-retrieval refrain from taking positional-information into account , due to the hurdles of developing a sound model while avoiding an explosion in the number of parameters . nonetheless , the well-known bm25f extension of the successful okapi ranking-function can be seen as an embryonic attempt in that direction . in this paper , we proceed along the same line , defining the notion of virtual region : a virtual region is a part of the document that , like a bm25f-field , can provide a (larger or smaller , depending on a tunable weighting parameter) evidence of relevance of the document ; differently from bm25f fields , though , virtual regions are generated implicitly by applying suitable (usually , but not necessarily , positional-aware) operators to the query . this technique fits nicely in the eliteness model behind bm25 and provides a principled explanation to bm25f ; it specializes to bm25 (f) for some trivial operators , but has a much more general appeal . our experiments (both on standard collections , such as trec , and on web-like repertoires) show that the use of virtual regions is beneficial for retrieval-effectiveness .
