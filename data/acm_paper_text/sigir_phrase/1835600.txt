has portfolio-theory got any principles ? recently , portfolio-theory (pt) has been proposed for information-retrieval . however , under non-trivial conditions pt violates the original probability-ranking-principle (prp) . in this poster , we shall explore whether pt upholds a different ranking principle based on quantum-theory , i.e. the quantum-probability-ranking-principle (qprp) , and examine the relationship between this new model and the new ranking principle . we make a significant contribution to the theoretical-development of pt and show that under certain circumstances pt upholds the qprp , and thus guarantees an optimal-ranking according to the qprp . a practical implication of this finding is that the parameters of pt can be automatically estimated via the qprp , instead of resorting to extensive parameter-tuning .
