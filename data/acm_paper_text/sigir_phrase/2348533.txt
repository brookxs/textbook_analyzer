aspect-based opinion-mining from product-reviews `` what other people think '' has always been an important piece of information for most of us during the decision-making-process . today people tend to make their opinions available to other people via the-internet . as a result , the-web has become an excellent source of consumer opinions . there are now numerous web-resources containing such opinions , e.g. , product-reviews forums , discussion-groups , and blogs . but , it is really difficult for a customer to read all of the reviews and make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product . it is also difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and manage customer opinions . also , focusing on just user-ratings (stars) is not a sufficient source of information for a user or the manufacturer to make decisions . therefore , mining online-reviews (opinion-mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction . extracting aspects and the corresponding ratings is an important challenge in opinion-mining . an aspect is an attribute or component of a product , e.g. ` zoom ' for a-digital camera . a rating is an intended interpretation of the user-satisfaction in terms of numerical values . reviewers usually express the rating of an aspect by a set of sentiments , e.g. ` great zoom ' . in this tutorial we cover opinion-mining in online-product-reviews with the focus on aspect-based opinion-mining . this problem is a key task in the area of opinion-mining and has attracted a lot of researchers in the information-retrieval-community recently . several opinion related information-retrieval-tasks can benefit from the results of aspect-based opinion-mining and therefore it is considered as a fundamental problem . this tutorial covers not only general opinion-mining and retrieval tasks , but also state-of-the-art methods , challenges , applications , and also future-research directions of aspect-based opinion-mining .
