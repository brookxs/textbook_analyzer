the economics in interactive-information-retrieval searching is inherently an interactive-process usually requiring numerous iterations of querying and assessing in order to find the desired amount of relevant-information . essentially , the search-process can be viewed as a combination of inputs (queries and assessments) which are used to `` produce '' output (relevance) . under this view , it is possible to adapt microeconomic theory to analyze and understand the dynamics of interactive-information-retrieval . in this paper , we approach the search-process as an economics problem and conduct extensive simulations on trec test-collections analyzing various combinations of inputs in the `` production '' of relevance . the analysis reveals that the total cumulative-gain (output) obtained during the course of a search-session is functionally related to querying and assessing (inputs) , and this can be characterized mathematically by the cobbs-douglas production-function . further analysis using cost-models , that are grounded using cognitive-load as the cost , reveals which search-strategies minimize the cost of interaction for a given level of output . this paper demonstrates how economics can be applied to formally model the search-process . this development establishes the theoretical-foundations of interactive-information-retrieval , providing numerous directions for empirical experimentation that are motivated directly from theory .
