concept-representation_based video-indexing this poster introduces a novel concept-based-video-indexing approach . it is developed based on a rich set of base concepts , of which the models are available . then , for a given concept with several labeled samples , we combine the base concepts to fit it and its model can thus be obtained accordingly . empirical-results demonstrate that this method can achieve great performance even with very limited labeled-data . we have compared different representation approaches including both sparse and non-sparse methods . our conclusion is that the sparse method will lead to much better performance .
