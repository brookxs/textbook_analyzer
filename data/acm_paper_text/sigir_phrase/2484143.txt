time-aware structured-query suggestion most commercial search engines have a query-suggestion feature , which is designed to capture various possible search-intents behind the user 's original query . however , even though different search-intents behind a given query may have been popular at different time periods in the past , existing query-suggestion methods neither utilize nor present such information . in this study , we propose time-aware structured-query suggestion (tasqs) which clusters query-suggestions along a timeline so that the user can narrow down his search from a temporal point-of-view . moreover , when a suggested query is clicked , tasqs presents web-pages from query-url bipartite-graphs after ranking them according to the click counts within a particular time period . our experiments using data from a commercial-search-engine log show that the time-aware clustering and the time-aware document-ranking features of tasqs are both effective .
