using query-term-order for result summarisation we report on two experiments performed to test the importance of term-order in automatic-summarisation . experiment one was undertaken as part of duc 2004 to which three systems were submitted , each with a different summarisation approach . the system that used document term-order outperformed those that did not use term-order in the rouge-evaluation . experiment two made use of human evaluations of search-engine-results , comparing our query-term-order summaries with a simulation of current google-search-engine result summaries in terms of summary-quality . our qto system 's summaries aided users ' relevance-judgements to a significantly greater extent than google 's .
