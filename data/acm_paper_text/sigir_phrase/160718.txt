viewing morphology as an inference-process morphology is the area of linguistics concerned with the internal-structure of words . information-retrieval has generally not paid much attention to word-structure , other than to account for some of the variability in word forms via the use of stemmers . this paper will describe our experiments to determine the importance of morphology , and the effect that it has on performance . we will also describe the role of morphological-analysis in word-sense-disambiguation , and in identifying lexical-semantic relationships in a machine-readable-dictionary . we will first provide a brief overview of morphological phenomena , and then describe the experiments themselves .
