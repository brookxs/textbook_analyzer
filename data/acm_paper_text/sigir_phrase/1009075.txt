discovery of aggregate-usage-profiles based on clustering-information-needs we present an alternative technique for discovering aggregate-usage-profiles from web-access logs . the technique is based on clustering-information-needs inferred from users ' browsing paths . browsing paths are extracted from users ' access logs . information-need is inferred from each browsing-path by using the ostensive-model [1] . the technique is evaluated in a document-recommendation application . we compare the performance of our technique against the well-established transaction-based technique proposed in [2] . based on an initial evaluation , the results are encouraging .
