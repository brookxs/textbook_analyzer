a parallel multiprocessor machine dedicated to relational and deductive-data-bases efficiency in databases is a major requirement . this paper presents some solutions to cope with this problem . one solution is to execute operations in parallel : this is done in the delta driven computer ddc , which is a multiprocessor machine with distributed-memory dedicated to relational and deductive-databases . in ddc , relations are distributed among the nodes of the machine , and the data are processed asynchronously in each node . to do that in an efficient way , a coprocessor , specialized for relational operations , is also proposed . it is called & mgr ; syc , for microprogrammable symbolic coprocessor . this paper is divided into two parts . the first part describes ddc , presenting the architecture , the languages , and an original computational-model . the second part describes & mgr ; syc , its architecture , instruction-set and the data-structures used at the & mgr ; syc level .
