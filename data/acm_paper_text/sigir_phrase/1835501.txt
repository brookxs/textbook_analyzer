sed : supervised-experimental-design and its application to text-classification in recent years , active-learning methods based on experimental-design achieve state-of-the-art performance in text-classification applications . although these methods can exploit the distribution of unlabeled-data and support batch-selection , they can not make use of labeled-data which often carry useful information for active-learning . in this paper , we propose a novel active-learning method for text-classification , called supervised-experimental-design (sed) , which seamlessly incorporates label-information into experimental-design . experimental-results show that sed outperforms its counterparts which either discard the label-information even when it is available or fail to exploit the distribution of unlabeled-data .
