late-fusion of compact composite descriptors for retrieval from heterogeneous image-databases compact composite descriptors (ccds) are global image-features , capturing more than one types of information at the same time in a very compact-representation . their quality has so far been evaluated in retrieval from several homogeneous-databases containing images of only the type that each ccd is intended for , and has been found better than other descriptors in the literature such as the mpeg-7 descriptors . in this study , we consider heterogeneous-databases and investigate query-time fusion techniques for ccds . the results show that fusion is beneficial , even with simple score-normalization and combination methods due to the compatibility of the score distributions produced by the ccds considered .
