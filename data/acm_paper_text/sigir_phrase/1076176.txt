noun-sense-induction using web-search-results this paper presents an algorithm for unsupervised noun-sense-induction , based on clustering of web-search-results . the algorithm does not utilize labeled training instances or any other external-knowledge-source . preliminary results on a small dataset show that this technique provides two advantages over other techniques in the literature : it detects real-world senses not found in dictionaries or other lexical-resources , and it does not require that the number of word-senses be specified in advance .
