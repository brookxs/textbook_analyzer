adaptive label-driven scaling for latent-semantic-indexing this paper targets on enhancing latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) by exploiting category labels . specifically , in the term-document-matrix , the vector for each term either appearing in labels or semantically close to labels is scaled before performing singular-value-decomposition (svd) to boost its impact on the generated left singular vectors . as a result , the similarities among documents in the same category are increased . furthermore , an adaptive scaling strategy is designed to better utilize the hierarchical-structure of categories . experimental-results show that the proposed approach is able to significantly improve the performance of hierarchical-text-categorization .
