a model for expert-finding in social-networks expert-finding is a task of finding knowledgeable people on a given topic . state-of-the-art expertise-retrieval algorithms identify matching experts based on analysis of textual content of documents experts are associated with . while powerful , these models ignore social-structure that might be available . in this paper , we develop a bayesian-hierarchical-model for expert-finding that accounts for both social-relationships and content . the model assumes that social-links are determined by expertise similarity between candidates . we demonstrate the improved retrieval-performance of our model over the baseline on a realistic data-set .
