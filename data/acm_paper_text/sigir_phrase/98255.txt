extended boolean-retrieval : a heuristic-approach ? we show that the similarity-measures for p-norm-retrieval , as defined by salton , fox and wu have some undesirable mathematical properties . we propose a new function that remedies some of these drawbacks . still , even for this new similarity-measure the extended boolean-model has some properties which can only be described as ` heuristic ' .
