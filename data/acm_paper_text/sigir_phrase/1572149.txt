what queries are likely to recur in web-search ? we study the recurrence dynamics of queries in web-search by analysing a large real-world query-log dataset . we find that query frequency is more useful in predicting collective query recurrence whereas query recency is more useful in predicting individual query recurrence . our findings provide valuable insights for understanding and improving web-search .
