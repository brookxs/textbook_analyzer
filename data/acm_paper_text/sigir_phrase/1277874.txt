confluence : enhancing contextual desktop-search we present confluence , an enhancement to a desktop file-search tool called confluence which extracts conceptual-relationships between files by their temporal access patterns in the file-system . a limitation of a purely file-based approach is that as file operations are increasingly abstracted by applications , their correlation to a user 's activity weakens and thereby reduces the applicability of their temporal-patterns . to deal with this problem , we augment the file event-stream with a stream of window focus events from the ui layer . we present 3 algorithms that analyze this new stream , extracting the user 's task information which informs the existing confluence algorithms . we present results and conclusions from a preliminary user-study on confluence .
