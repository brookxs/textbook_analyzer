personalized-ranking model-adaptation for web-search search-engines train and apply a single ranking-model across all users , but searchers ' information-needs are diverse and cover a broad range of topics . hence , a single user-independent ranking-model is insufficient to satisfy different users ' result preferences . conventional personalization methods learn separate models-of-user interests and use those to re-rank the results from the generic-model . those methods require significant user-history information to learn user-preferences , have low coverage in the case of memory-based methods that learn direct associations between query-url pairs , and have limited opportunity to markedly affect the ranking given that they only re-order top-ranked items . in this paper , we propose a general ranking-model adaptation-framework for personalized-search . using a given user-independent ranking-model trained offline and limited number of adaptation queries from individual users , the framework quickly learns to apply a series of linear-transformations , e.g. , scaling and shifting , over the parameters of the given global-ranking model such that the adapted model can better fit each individual user 's search preferences . extensive experimentation based on a large set of search-logs from a major commercial web-search-engine confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art ranking-model adaptation methods .
