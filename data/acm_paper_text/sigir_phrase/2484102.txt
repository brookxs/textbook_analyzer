modeling the uniqueness of the user-preferences for recommendation-systems in this paper we propose a novel framework for modeling the uniqueness of the user-preferences for recommendation-systems . user uniqueness is determined by learning to what extent the user 's item preferences deviate from those of an `` average user '' in the system . based on this framework , we suggest three different recommendation-strategies that trade between uniqueness and conformity . using two real item datasets , we demonstrate the effectiveness of our uniqueness_based recommendation framework .
