fast nonparametric matrix-factorization for large-scale collaborative filtering with the sheer growth of online user data , it becomes challenging to develop preference-learning algorithms that are sufficiently flexible in modeling but also affordable in computation . in this paper we develop nonparametric matrix-factorization methods by allowing the latent-factors of two low-rank-matrix factorization methods , the singular-value-decomposition (svd) and probabilistic principal component-analysis (ppca) , to be data-driven , with the dimensionality increasing with data size . we show that the formulations of the two nonparametric-models are very similar , and their optimizations share similar procedures . compared to traditional parametric low-rank methods , nonparametric-models are appealing for their flexibility in modeling complex-data dependencies . however , this modeling advantage comes at a computational price -- it is highly challenging to scale them to large-scale-problems , hampering their application to applications such as collaborative-filtering . in this paper we introduce novel optimization-algorithms , which are simple to implement , which allow learning both nonparametric matrix-factorization models to be highly efficient on large-scale-problems . our experiments on eachmovie and netflix , the two largest public benchmarks to date , demonstrate that the nonparametric-models make more accurate predictions of user-ratings , and are computationally comparable or sometimes even faster in training , in comparison with previous state-of-the-art parametric matrix-factorization models .
