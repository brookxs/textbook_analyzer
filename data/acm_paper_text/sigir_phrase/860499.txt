automatic-transliteration for japanese-to-english text-retrieval for cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) based on bilingual translation dictionaries , good performance depends upon lexical-coverage in the dictionary . this is especially true for languages possessing few inter-language cognates , such as between japanese and english . in this paper , we describe a method for automatically creating and validating candidate japanese transliterated terms of english words . a phonetic english-dictionary and a set of probabilistic mapping-rules are used for automatically generating transliteration candidates . a monolingual japanese-corpus is then used for automatically validating the transliterated terms . we evaluate the usage of the extracted english-japanese-transliteration pairs with japanese to english-retrieval experiments over the clef bilingual test-collections . the use of our automatically derived extension to a bilingual translation-dictionary improves average-precision , both before and after pseudo-relevance-feedback , with gains ranging from 2.5 \ % to 64.8 \ % .
