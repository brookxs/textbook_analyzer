ready to buy or just browsing ? : detecting web searcher goals from interaction data an improved understanding of the relationship between search-intent , result quality , and searcher-behavior is crucial for improving the effectiveness of web-search . while recent progress in user-behavior-mining has been largely focused on aggregate server-side click-logs , we present a new class of search-behavior models that also exploit fine-grained user-interactions with the search-results . we show that mining these interactions , such as mouse-movements and scrolling , can enable more effective detection of the user 's search goals . potential applications include automatic search-evaluation , improving search-ranking , result-presentation , and search-advertising . we describe extensive experimental-evaluation over both controlled user-studies , and logs of interaction data collected from hundreds of real-users . the results show that our method is more effective than the current state-of-the-art techniques , both for detection of searcher goals , and for an important practical application of predicting ad clicks for a given search-session .
