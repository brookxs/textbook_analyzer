shared-processing with an advanced intelligent-terminal we have built a prototype distributed-information-retrieval system known as tbird , based on an inverted-file and shared between a personal-computer , acting as an advanced intelligent-terminal , and a timeshared mainframe . it was developed to study the response and cost in comparison with a conventional system based on an unintelligent terminal . it is shown , by the transfer of most of the processing to the personal-computer , that the computing costs can be reduced by a substantial factor and that the response-time need not be degraded except when the mainframe is lightly used or when the communications-channel between the processors is slow (< 2,400 bps) .
