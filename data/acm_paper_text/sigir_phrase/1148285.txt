term-proximity scoring for ad-hoc-retrieval on very-large text-collections we propose an integration of term-proximity scoring into okapi-bm25 . the relative retrieval-effectiveness of our retrieval-method , compared to pure bm25 , varies from collection to collection.we present an experimental-evaluation of our method and show that the gains achieved over bm25 as the size of the underlying text-collection increases . we also show that for stemmed queries the impact of term-proximity scoring is larger than for unstemmed queries .
