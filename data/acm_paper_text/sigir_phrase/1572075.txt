evolutionary document-summarization for disaster-management in this poster , we develop an evolutionary document-summarization system for discovering the changes and differences in each phase of a disaster evolution . given a collection of document streams describing an event , our system generates a short summary delivering the main development theme of the event by extracting the most representative and discriminative sentences at each phase . experimental-results on the collection of press releases for hurricane wilma in 2005 demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal .
