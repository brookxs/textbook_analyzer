building a filtering test-collection for trec 2002 test-collections for the filtering track in trec have typically used either past sets of relevance-judgments , or categorized collections such as reuters-corpus volume 1 or ohsumed , because filtering systems need relevance-judgments during the experiment for training and adaptation . for trec 2002 , we constructed an entirely new set of search topics for the reuters-corpus for measuring filtering systems . our method for building the topics involved multiple iterations of feedback from assessors , and fusion of results from multiple search systems using different search-algorithms . we also developed a second set of `` inexpensive '' topics based on categories in the document-collection . we found that the initial judgments made for the experiment were sufficient ; subsequent pooled judging changed system rankings very little . we also found that systems performed very differently on the category topics than on the assessor-built topics .
