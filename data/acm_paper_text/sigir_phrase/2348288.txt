adaptation of the concept-hierarchy model with search-logs for query-recommendation on intranets a concept-hierarchy created from a document-collection can be used for query-recommendation on intranets by ranking terms according to the strength of their links to the query within the hierarchy . a major limitation is that this model produces the same recommendations for identical queries and rebuilding it from scratch periodically can be extremely inefficient due to the high computational costs . we propose to adapt the model by incorporating query-refinements from search-logs . our intuition is that the concept-hierarchy built from the collection and the search-logs provide complementary conceptual views on the same search domain , and their integration should continually improve the effectiveness of recommended terms . two adaptation approaches using query-logs with and without click information are compared . we evaluate the concept-hierarchy models (static and adapted versions) built from the intranet collections of two academic institutions and compare them with a state-of-the-art log-based query recommender , the query-flow-graph , built from the same logs . our adaptive-model significantly outperforms its static version and the query-flow-graph when tested over a period of time on data (documents and search-logs) from two institutions ' intranets .
