context-aware-ranking in web-search the context of a search-query often provides a search-engine meaningful hints for answering the current query better . previous studies on context-aware-search were either focused on the development of context-models or limited to a relatively small scale investigation under a controlled laboratory setting . particularly , about context-aware-ranking for web-search , the following two critical problems are largely remained unsolved . first , how can we take advantage of different types of contexts in ranking ? second , how can we integrate context-information into a ranking-model ? in this paper , we tackle the above two essential problems analytically and empirically . we develop different ranking principles for different types of contexts . moreover , we adopt a learning-to-rank approach and integrate the ranking principles into a state-of-the-art ranking-model by encoding the context-information as features of the model . we empirically test our approach using a large search-log data-set obtained from a major commercial-search-engine . our evaluation uses both human-judgments and implicit user click-data . the experimental-results clearly show that our context-aware-ranking approach improves the ranking of a commercial-search-engine which ignores context-information . furthermore , our method outperforms a baseline method which considers context-information in ranking .
