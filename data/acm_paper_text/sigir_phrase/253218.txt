an automatic and tunable document-indexing system in this article we present an interactive automatic document indexing software together with various index tuning/optimization strategies . after stems are generated from the raw text , the initial index vocabulary is narrowed down and tuned with the use of indexing versus clustering theory relationships . the narrowed down vocabulary is further optimized with the inclusion of term phrases and virtual-terms corresponding to high and low frequency terms respectively . the results of performance experimentation which proved significant improvements of index vocabulary optimization are presented . the exploitation of the term discrimination value concept in index and retrieval-system tuning and optimization is discussed .
