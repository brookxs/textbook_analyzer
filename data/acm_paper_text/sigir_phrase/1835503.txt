multilabel-classification with meta-level features effective learning in multi-label-classification (mlc) requires an appropriate level of abstraction for representing the relationship between each instance and multiple categories . current mlc methods have been focused on learning-to-map from instances to ranked-lists of categories in a relatively high-dimensional-space . the fine-grained features in such a space may not be sufficiently expressive for characterizing discriminative patterns , and worse , make the model-complexity unnecessarily high . this paper proposes an alternative approach by transforming conventional representations of instances and categories into a relatively small set of link-based meta-level features , and leveraging successful learning-to-rank retrieval algorithms (e.g. , svm-map) over this reduced feature-space . controlled-experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show strong empirical evidence for the strength of the proposed approach , as it significantly outperformed several state-of-the-art methods , including rank-svm , ml-knn and iblr-ml (instance-based logistic-regression for multi-label-classification) in most cases .
