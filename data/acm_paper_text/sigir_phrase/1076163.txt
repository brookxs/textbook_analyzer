profile-based event-tracking in this research , we focus on tracking topics that originate and evolve from a specific event . intuitively , a few key elements of a target event , such as date , location , and persons involved , would be enough for making a decision on whether a test story is on-topic . consequently , a profile-based event-tracking method is proposed . we attempt to build an event profile from the given on-topic stories by robust information-retrieval technologies . a feature-selection metric and a recognized event clause are utilized to determine most (if not all) key semantic elements of the target event . preliminary experiments on the tdt2 mandarin corpus show that this profile-based event-tracking method is promising .
