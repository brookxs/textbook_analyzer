varying approaches to topical web-query-classification topical classification of web-queries has drawn recent interest because of the promise it offers in improving retrieval-effectiveness and efficiency . however , much of this promise depends on whether classification is performed before or after the query is used to retrieve documents . we examine two previously unaddressed issues in query-classification : pre versus post-retrieval classification effectiveness and the effect of training explicitly from classified queries versus bridging a classifier trained using a document taxonomy . bridging classifiers map the categories of a document taxonomy onto those of a query-classification problem to provide sufficient training-data . we find that training classifiers explicitly from manually classified queries outperforms the bridged classifier by 48 \ % in f1 score . also , a pre-retrieval classifier using only the query terms performs merely 11 \ % worse than the bridged classifier which requires snippets from retrieved documents .
