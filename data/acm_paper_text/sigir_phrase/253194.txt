calin : a user-interface based on a simple natural-language in the framework of an application dealing with classified advertisement matching , a dedicated user-interface has been designed and implemented . its major originality relies on the user 's language which is neither an artificial one , nor the usual natural-language , but in fact the ad language . beyond the language itself , the interface provides some facilities such as paraphrasing or explanations when needed . an expert-system approach has been adopted and the interface is built up from the knowledge given by experts . they are in charge of describing what are acceptable ads , from both syntax-and-semantics points of view although designed in the context of ad matching , that interface may interestingly be adapted to other retrieving systems . we especially think that an adlike language is well-suited to ask questions since it is based on natural simple expressions . a given sentence involves terms that stand for elementary conditions applying to instances of a logical object contained inside the information-system . this approach defines a complete interface , involving both a language and aiding capabilities . moreover , the query-language , although less powerful , represents a compromise between artificial-languages and the usual natural-language , with respect to ergonomics and analysis complexity .
