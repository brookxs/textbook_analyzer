timedtextrank : adding the temporal-dimension to multi-document-summarization graph-ranking_based algorithms (e.g. textrank) have been proposed for multi-document-summarization in recent years . however , these algorithms miss an important dimension , the temporal-dimension , for summarizing evolving topics . for an evolving topic , recent-documents are usually more important than earlier documents because recent-documents contain much more novel information than earlier documents and a novelty-oriented summary should be more appropriate to reflect the changing topic . we propose the timedtextrank algorithm to make use of the temporal-information of documents based on the graph-ranking based algorithm . a preliminary study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed timedtextrank algorithm for dynamic multi-document-summarization .
