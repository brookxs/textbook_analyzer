pseudo-frequency method (poster session) : an efficient document-ranking retrieval-method for n-gram-indexing although n-gram (n successive characters) indexing is widely used in retrieval-systems for documents in japanese and other asian-languages , it is difficult to process ranking retrieval efficiently using n-gram-indexing . this is because frequency information for query words needs to be computed using indexed data since this information is not directly available from the n-gram index . to reduce processing costs , this paper proposes a pseudo-frequency method , which uses a word 's estimated frequencies instead of precise ones . the results of experiments on ntcir , a japanese ir test collection , showed that the proposed method speeded up retrieval without degrading retrieval-effectiveness .
