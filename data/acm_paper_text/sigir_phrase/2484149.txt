extractive-summarisation via sentence removal : condensing relevant-sentences into a short summary many on-line services allow users to describe their opinions about a product or a service through a review . in order to help other users to find out the major opinion about a given topic , without the effort to read several reviews , multi-document-summarisation is required . this research proposes an approach for extractive-summarisation , supporting different scoring-techniques , such as cosine-similarity or divergence , as a method for finding representative sentences . the main contribution of this paper is the definition of an algorithm for sentence removal , developed to maximise the score between the summary and the original document . instead of ranking the sentences and selecting the most important ones , the algorithm iteratively removes unimportant sentences until a desired compression-rate is reached . experimental-results show that variations of the sentence removal-algorithm provide good performance .
