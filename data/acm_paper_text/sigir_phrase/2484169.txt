temporal variance of intents in multi-faceted event-driven information-needs time is often important for understanding user-intent during search activity , especially for information-needs related to event-driven topics . diversity for multi-faceted information-needs ensures that ranked documents optimally cover multiple facets when a user 's intent is uncertain . effective diversity is reliant on methods to (i) discover and represent facets , and (ii) determine how likely each facet is the user 's intent (i.e. , its popularity) . past work has developed several techniques addressing these issues , however , they have concentrated on static approaches which do not consider the temporal nature of new and evolving intents and their popularity . in many cases , what a user expects may change dramatically over time as events develop . in this work we study the temporal variance of search-intents for event-driven information-needs using wikipedia . first , we model intents based upon the structure represented by the section hierarchy of wikipedia articles closely related to the information-need . using this technique , we investigate whether temporal-changes in the content-structure , i.e. in a section 's text , reflect the temporal popularity of the intent . we map intents taken from a query-log (as ground-truth) to wikipedia article sections and found that a large proportion are indeed reflected in topic-related article structure . by correlating the change activity of each section with the use of the intent query over time , we found that section change activity does reflect temporal popularity of many intents . furthermore , we show that popularity between intents changes over time for event-driven topics .
