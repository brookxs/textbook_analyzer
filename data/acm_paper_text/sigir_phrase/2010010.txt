multimedia answering : enriching text qa with media information existing community-question-answering forums usually provide only textual answers . however , for many questions , pure texts can not provide intuitive information , while image or video contents are more appropriate . in this paper , we introduce a scheme that is able to enrich text answers with image and video information . our scheme investigates a rich set of techniques including question/answer classification , query-generation , image-and-video-search reranking , etc. . given a question and the community-contributed answer , our approach is able to determine which type of media information should be added , and then automatically collects data from internet to enrich the textual answer . different from some efforts that attempt to directly answer questions with image and video data , our approach is built based on the community-contributed textual answers and thus it is more feasible and able to deal with more complex questions . we have conducted empirical-study on more than 3,000 qa-pairs and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .
