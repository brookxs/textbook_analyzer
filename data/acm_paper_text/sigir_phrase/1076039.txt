orthogonal-locality-preserving-indexing we consider the problem of document-indexing and representation . recently , locality-preserving-indexing (lpi) was proposed for learning a compact document subspace . different from latent-semantic-indexing which is optimal in the sense of global euclidean structure , lpi is optimal in the sense of local manifold structure . however , lpi is extremely sensitive to the number of dimensions . this makes it difficult to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality , while inaccurately estimated dimensionality would drastically degrade its performance . one reason leading to this problem is that lpi is non-orthogonal . non-orthogonality distorts the metric structure of the document space . in this paper , we propose a new algorithm called orthogonal lpi . orthogonal lpi iteratively computes the mutually orthogonal basis functions which respect the local geometrical structure . moreover , our empirical-study shows that olpi can have more locality-preserving power than lpi . we compare the new algorithm to lsi and lpi . extensive experimental-results show that orthogonal lpi obtains better performance than both lsi and lpi . more crucially , it is insensitive to the number of dimensions , which makes it an efficient data-preprocessing method for text-clustering , classification , retrieval , etc. .
