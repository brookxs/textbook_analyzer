ambiguous-queries : test-collections need more sense although there are many papers examining ambiguity in information-retrieval , this paper shows that there is a whole class of ambiguous-word that past research has barely explored . it is shown that the class is more ambiguous than other word-types and is commonly used in queries . the lack of test-collections containing ambiguous-queries is highlighted and a method for creating collections from existing resources is described . tests using the new collection show the impact of query-ambiguity on an ir-system : it is shown that conventional systems are incapable of dealing effectively with such queries and that current assumptions about how to improve search-effectiveness do not hold when searching on this common query type .
