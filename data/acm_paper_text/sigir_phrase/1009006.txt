discriminative-models for information-retrieval discriminative-models have been preferred over generative-models in many machine-learning problems in the recent past owing to some of their attractive theoretical properties . in this paper , we explore the applicability of discriminative classifiers for ir . we have compared the performance of two popular discriminative-models , namely the maximum-entropy-model and support-vector-machines with that of language-modeling , the state-of-the-art generative-model for ir . our experiments on ad-hoc-retrieval indicate that although maximum-entropy is significantly worse than language-models , support-vector-machines are on par with language-models . we argue that the main reason to prefer svms over language-models is their ability to learn arbitrary features automatically as demonstrated by our experiments on the home-page finding task of trec-10 .
