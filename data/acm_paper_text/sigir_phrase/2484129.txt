question-retrieval with user-intent community-question-answering (cqa) services , such as yahoo!-answers and wikianswers , have become popular with users as one of the central paradigms for satisfying users ' information-needs . the task of question-retrieval in cqa aims to resolve one 's query directly by finding the most relevant questions (together with their answers) from an archive of past questions . however , as users can ask any question that they like , a large number of questions in cqa are not about objective (factual) knowledge , but about subjective (sentiment-based) opinions or social-interactions . the inhomogeneous nature of cqa leads to reduced performance of standard retrieval-models . to address this problem , we present a hybrid-approach that blends several language-modelling techniques for question-retrieval , namely , the classic (query-likelihood) language-model , the state-of-the-art translation-based language-model , and our proposed intent-based language-model . the user-intent of each candidate question (objective/subjective/social) is given by a probabilistic-classifier which makes use of both textual-features and metadata features . our experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach can significantly outperform existing ones .
