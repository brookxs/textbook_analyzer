crosslingual location-search address-geocoding , the process of finding the map location for a structured postal address , is a relatively well-studied problem . in this paper we consider the more general problem of crosslingual location-search , where the queries are not limited to postal addresses , and the language and script used in the search-query is different from the one in which the underlying data is stored . to the best of our knowledge , our system is the first crosslingual location-search system that is able to geocode complex addresses . we use a statistical machine-transliteration system to convert location-names from the script of the query to that of the stored data . however , we show that it is not sufficient to simply feed the resulting transliterations into a monolingual geocoding system , as the ambiguity inherent in the conversion drastically expands the location-search space and significantly lowers the quality of results . the strength of our approach lies in its integrated , end-to-end nature : we use abstraction and fuzzy-search (in the text domain) to achieve maximum-coverage despite transliteration ambiguities , while applying spatial-constraints (in the geographic domain) to focus only on viable interpretations of the query . our experiments with structured and unstructured queries in a set of diverse languages and scripts (arabic , english , hindi and japanese) searching for locations in different regions of the world , show full crosslingual location-search accuracy at levels comparable to that of commercial monolingual systems . we achieve these levels of performance using techniques that may be applied to crosslingual searches in any language/script , and over arbitrary spatial-data .
