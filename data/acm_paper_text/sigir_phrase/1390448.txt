intuition-supporting visualization of user 's performance based on explicit negative higher-order relevance-modeling the beyond-topical aspects of relevance are currently gaining popularity in ir-evaluation . for example , the discounted-cumulated-gain (dcg) measure implicitly models some aspects of higher-order relevance via diminishing the value of relevant documents seen later during retrieval (e.g. , due to information cumulated , redundancy , and effort) . in this paper , we focus on the concept of negative higher-order relevance (nhor) made explicit via negative gain values in ir-evaluation . we extend the computation of dcg to allow negative gain values , perform an experiment in a laboratory setting , and demonstrate the characteristics of nhor in evaluation . the approach leads to intuitively reasonable performance curves emphasizing , from the user 's point-of-view , the progression of retrieval towards success or failure . we discuss normalization issues when both positive and negative gain values are allowed and conclude by discussing the usage of nhor to characterize test-collections .
