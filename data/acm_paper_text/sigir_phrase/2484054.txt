query-representation for cross-temporal information-retrieval this paper addresses the problem of long-term language change in information-retrieval (ir) systems . ir research has often ignored lexical drift . but in the emerging domain of massive digitized book collections , the risk of vocabulary mismatch due to language-change is high . collections such as google-books and the hathi trust contain text written in the vernaculars of many centuries . with respect to ir , changes in vocabulary and orthography make 14th-century english qualitatively different from 21st-century english . this challenges retrieval-models that rely on keyword-matching . with this challenge in mind , we ask : given a query written in contemporary-english , how can we retrieve relevant documents that were written in early english ? we argue that search in historically diverse corpora is similar to cross-language-retrieval (clir) . by considering `` modern '' english and `` archaic '' english as distinct languages , clir techniques can improve what we call cross-temporal ir (ctir) . we focus on ways to combine evidence to improve ctir effectiveness , proposing and testing several ways to handle language-change during book-search . we find that a principled combination of three sources of evidence during relevance-feedback yields strong ctir performance .
