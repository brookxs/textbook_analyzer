3d viewpoint-based photo search and information-browsing we propose a new photo search-method that uses three-dimensional (3d) viewpoints as queries . 3d viewpoint-based-image-retrieval is especially useful for searching collections of archaeological photographs , which contain many different images of the same object . our method is designed to enable users to retrieve images that contain the same object but show a different view , and to browse groups of images taken from a similar viewpoint . we also propose using 3d scenes to query-by-example , which means that users do not have the problem of trying to formulate appropriate queries . this combination gives users an easy way of accessing not only photographs but also archived information .
