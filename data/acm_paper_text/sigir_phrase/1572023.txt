an improved markov-random-field-model for supporting verbose-queries recent work in supervised-learning of term-based-retrieval models has shown significantly improved accuracy can often be achieved via better model-estimation . in this paper , we show retrieval-accuracy with metzler and croft 's markov-random-field (mrf) approach can be similarly improved via supervised-learning . while the original mrf method estimates a parameter for each of its three feature classes from data , parameters within each class are set via a uniform weighting-scheme adopted from the standard unigram . we conjecture greater mrf retrieval-accuracy should be possible by better estimating within-class parameters , particularly for verbose-queries employing natural-language terms . retrieval experiments with these queries on three trec document-collections show our improved mrf consistently out-performs both the original mrf and supervised unigram baselines . additional experiments using blind-feedback and evaluation with optimal weighting demonstrate both the immediate value and further potential of our method .
