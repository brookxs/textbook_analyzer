automatic video tagging using content-redundancy the analysis of the leading social-video sharing platform youtube reveals a high amount of redundancy , in the form of videos with overlapping or duplicated content . in this paper , we show that this redundancy can provide useful information about connections between videos . we reveal these links using robust content-based-video-analysis techniques and exploit them for generating new tag assignments . to this end , we propose different tag-propagation methods for automatically obtaining richer video-annotations . our techniques provide the user with additional-information about videos , and lead to enhanced feature representations for applications such as automatic data organization and search . experiments on video-clustering and classification as well as a user-evaluation demonstrate the viability of our approach .
