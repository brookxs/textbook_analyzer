using flickr geotags to predict user travel behaviour we propose a method to predict a user 's favourite locations in a city , based on his flickr geotags in other cities . we define a similarity between the geotag distributions of two users based on a gaussian kernel convolution . the geotags of the most similar users are then combined to rerank the popular locations in the target city personalised for this user . we show that this method can give personalised travel recommendations for users with a clear preference for a specific type of landmark .
