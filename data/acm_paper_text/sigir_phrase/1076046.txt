user-term-feedback in interactive text-based-image-retrieval to alleviate the vocabulary problem , this paper investigates the role of user-term-feedback in interactive text-based-image-retrieval . term-feedback refers to the feedback from a user on specific terms regarding their relevance to a target image . previous studies have indicated the effectiveness of term-feedback in interactive-text-retrieval [14] . however , the term-feedback has not shown to be effective in our experiments on text-based-image-retrieval . our results indicate that , although term-feedback has a positive effect by allowing users to identify more relevant terms , it also has a strong negative effect by providing more opportunities for users to specify irrelevant terms . to understand these different effects and their implications on the potential of term-feedback , this paper further presents analysis of important factors that contribute to the utility of term-feedback and discusses the outlook of term-feedback in interactive text-based-image-retrieval .
