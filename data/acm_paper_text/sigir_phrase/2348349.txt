predicting the ratings of multimedia items for making personalized recommendations existing multimedia recommenders suggest a specific type of multimedia items rather than items of different types personalized for a user based on his/her preference . assume that a user is interested in a particular family movie , it is appealing if a multimedia recommendation-system can suggest other movies , music , books , and paintings closely related to the movie . we propose a comprehensive , personalized-multimedia recommendation-system , denoted mudrecs , which makes recommendations on movies , music , books , and paintings similar in content to other movies , music , books , and/or paintings that a mudrecs user is interested in . mudrecs does not rely on users ' access patterns/histories , connection information extracted from social-networking-sites , collaborated filtering methods , or user personal attributes (such as gender and age) to perform the recommendation task . it simply considers the users ' ratings , genres , role players (authors or artists) , and reviews of different multimedia items , which are abundant and easy to find on the web . mudrecs predicts the ratings of multimedia items that match the interests of a user to make recommendations . the performance ofmudrecs has been compared with current state-of-the-art multimedia recommenders using various multimedia datasets , and the experimental-results show that mudrecs significantly outperforms other systems in accurately predicting the ratings of multimedia items to be recommended .
