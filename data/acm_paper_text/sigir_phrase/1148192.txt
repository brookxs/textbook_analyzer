a parallel derivation of probabilistic-information-retrieval models this paper investigates in a stringent athematical formalism the parallel derivation of three grand probabilistic-retrieval-models : binary independent retrieval (bir) , poisson model (pm) , and language-modelling (lm) . the investigation has been motivated by a number of questions . firstly , though sharing the same origin , namely the probability of relevance , the models differ with respect to event spaces . how can this be captured in a consistent notation , and can we relate the event spaces ? secondly , bir and pm are closely related , but how does lm fit in ? thirdly , how are tf-idf and probabilistic-models related ? . the parallel investigation of the models leads to a number of formalised results : bir and pm assume the collection to be a set of non-relevant documents , whereas lm assumes the collection to be a set of terms from relevant documents . pm can be viewed as a bridge connecting bir and lm . a bir-lm equivalence explains bir as a special lm case . pm explains tf-idf , and both , bir and lm probabilities express tf-idf in a dual way . .
