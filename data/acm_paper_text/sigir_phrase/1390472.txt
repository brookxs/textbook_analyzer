exploiting subjectivity-analysis in blogs to improve political-leaning-categorization in this paper , we address a relatively new and interesting text-categorization-problem : classify a political blog as either liberal or conservative , based on its political leaning . our subjectivity-analysis_based method is twofold : 1) we identify subjective sentences that contain at least two strong subjective clues based on the general inquirer dictionary ; 2) from subjective sentences identified , we extract opinion expressions and other features to build political leaning classifiers . experimental-results with a political blog corpus we built show that by using features from subjective sentences can significantly improve the classification-performance . in addition , by extracting opinion expressions from subjective sentences , we are able to reveal opinions that are characteristic of a specific political leaning to some extent .
