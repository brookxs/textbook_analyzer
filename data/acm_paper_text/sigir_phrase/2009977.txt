mining topics-on-participations for community-discovery community-discovery on large-scale linked document corpora has been a hot research-topic for decades . there are two types of links . the first one , which we call d2d-link , indicates connectiveness among different documents , such as blog references and research-paper citations . the other one , which we call u2u-link , represents co-occurrences or simultaneous participations of different users in one document and typically each document from u2u-link corpus has more than one user/author . examples of u2u-link data covers email-archives and research-paper co-authorship-networks . community-discovery in d2d-link data has achieved much success , while methods for that in u2u-link data either make no use of the textual content of the documents or make oversimplified assumptions about the users and the textual content . in this paper we propose a general approach of community-discovery for u2u-link data , i.e. , multiple user data , by placing topical variables on multiple authors ' participations in documents . experiments on a research proceeding co-authorship corpus and a new york times news-corpus show the effectiveness of our model .
