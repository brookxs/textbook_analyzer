pagerank-based-clustering of hypertext document collections clustering hypertext document collection is an important task in information-retrieval . most clustering-methods are based on document-content and do not take into account the hyper-text links . here we propose a novel pagerank-based-clustering (prc) algorithm which uses the hypertext-structure . the prc algorithm produces graph-partitioning with high modularity and coverage . the comparison of the prc algorithm with two content-based clustering-algorithms shows that there is a good match between prc clustering and content-based clustering .
