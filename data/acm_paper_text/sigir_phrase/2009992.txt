inverted-indexes for phrases and strings inverted-indexes are the most fundamental and widely used data-structures in information-retrieval . for each unique word occurring in a document-collection , the inverted-index stores a list of the documents in which this word occurs . compression techniques are often applied to further reduce the space requirement of these lists . however , the index has a shortcoming , in that only predefined pattern queries can be supported efficiently . in terms of string documents where word-boundaries are undefined , if we have to index all the substrings of a given document , then the storage quickly becomes quadratic in the data size . also , if we want to apply the same type of indexes for querying phrases or sequence of words , then the inverted-index will end up storing redundant-information . in this paper , we show the first set of inverted-indexes which work naturally for strings as well as phrase-searching . the central idea is to exclude document d in the inverted list of a string p if every occurrence of p in d is subsumed by another string of which p is a prefix . with this we show that our space-utilization is close to the optimal . techniques from succinct-data-structures are deployed to achieve compression while allowing fast access in terms of frequency and document id_based retrieval . compression and speed trade-offs are evaluated for different variants of the proposed index . for phrase-searching , we show that our indexes compare favorably against a typical inverted-index deploying position-wise intersections . we also show efficient top - k_based retrieval under relevance-metrics like frequency and tf-idf .
