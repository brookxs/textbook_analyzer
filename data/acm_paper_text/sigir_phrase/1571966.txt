simultaneously modeling semantics and structure of threaded-discussions : a sparse-coding approach and its-applications the huge amount of knowledge in web-communities has motivated the research interests in threaded-discussions . the dynamic nature of threaded-discussions poses lots of challenging problems for computer scientists . although techniques such as semantic-models and structural-models have been shown to be useful in a number of areas , they are inefficient in understanding threaded-discussions due to three reasons : (i) as most of users read existing messages before posting , posts in a discussion thread are temporally dependent on the previous ones ; it causes the semantics and structure to be coupled with each other in threaded-discussions ; (ii) in online-discussion threads , there are a lot of junk posts which are useless and may disturb content-analysis ; and (iii) it is very hard to judge the quality of a post . in this paper , we propose a sparse coding-based model named smss to simultaneously model semantics and structure of threaded-discussions . the model projects each post into a topic-space , and approximates each post by a linear combination of previous posts in the same discussion thread . meanwhile , the model also imposes two sparse constraints to force a sparse post reconstruction in the topic-space and a sparse post approximation from previous posts . the sparse properties effectively take into account the characteristics of threaded-discussions . towards the above three problems , we demonstrate the competency of our model in three applications : reconstructing reply structure of threaded-discussions , identifying junk posts , and finding experts in a given board/sub-board in web-communities . experimental-results show encouraging performance of the proposed smss model in all these applications .
