a regression framework for learning ranking-functions using relative relevance judgments effective ranking-functions are an essential part of commercial search engines . we focus on developing a regression framework for learning ranking-functions for improving relevance of search-engines serving diverse streams of user queries . we explore supervised-learning methodology from machine-learning , and we distinguish two types of relevance-judgments used as the training-data : 1) absolute relevance judgments arising from explicit labeling of search-results ; and 2) relative relevance judgments extracted from user click throughs of search-results or converted from the absolute relevance judgments . we propose a novel optimization framework emphasizing the use of relative relevance judgments . the main contribution is the development of an algorithm based on regression that can be applied to objective-functions involving preference data , i.e. , data indicating that a document is more relevant than another with respect to a query . experimental-results are carried out using data sets obtained from a commercial-search-engine . our results show significant improvements of our proposed methods over some existing methods .
