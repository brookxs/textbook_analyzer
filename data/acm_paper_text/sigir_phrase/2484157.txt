author-disambiguation by hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering with adaptive stopping-criterion entity-disambiguation is an important step in many information-retrieval applications . this paper proposes new research for entity-disambiguation with the focus of name-disambiguation in digital-libraries . in particular , pairwise similarity is first learned for publications that share the same author name string (ans) and then a novel hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering approach with adaptive stopping-criterion (hacasc) is proposed to adaptively cluster a set of publications that share a same ans to individual clusters of publications with different author identities . the hacasc approach utilizes a mixture of kernel ridge regressions to intelligently determine the threshold in clustering . this obtains more appropriate clustering granularity than non-adaptive stopping-criterion . we conduct a large-scale empirical-study with a dataset of more than 2 million publication record pairs to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed hacasc approach .
