temporal-collaborative-filtering with adaptive neighbourhoods collaborative-filtering aims to predict user tastes , by minimising the mean error produced when predicting hidden user-ratings . the aim of a deployed recommender-system is to iteratively predict users ' preferences over a dynamic , growing dataset , and system-administrators are confronted with the problem of having to continuously tune the parameters calibrating their cf algorithm . in this work , we formalise cf as a time-dependent , iterative prediction problem . we then perform a temporal-analysis of the netflix dataset , and evaluate the temporal performance of two cf algorithms . we show that , due to the dynamic nature of the data , certain prediction methods that improve prediction-accuracy on the netflix probe set do not show similar improvements over a set of iterative train-test experiments with growing data . we then address the problem of parameter-selection and update , and propose a method to automatically assign and update per-user neighbourhood sizes that (on the temporal scale) outperforms setting global parameters .
