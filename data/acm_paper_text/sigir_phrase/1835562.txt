efficient partial-duplicate-detection based on sequence-matching with the ever-increasing growth of the-internet , numerous copies of documents become serious problem for search-engine , opinion-mining and many other web-applications . since partial-duplicates only contain a small piece of text taken from other sources and most existing near-duplicate-detection approaches focus on document level , partial duplicates can not be dealt with well . in this paper , we propose a novel algorithm to realize the partial-duplicate-detection task . besides the similarities between documents , our proposed algorithm can simultaneously locate the duplicated parts . the main idea is to divide the partial-duplicate-detection task into two subtasks : sentence-level near-duplicate-detection and sequence-matching . for evaluation , we compare the proposed method with other approaches on both english and chinese-web collections . experimental-results appear to support that our proposed method is effectively and efficiently to detect both partial-duplicates on large web collections .
