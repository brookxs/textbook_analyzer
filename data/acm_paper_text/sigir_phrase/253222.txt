probabilistic-models for document-retrieval : a comparison of perfromance on exterimental and synthetic-data bases probabilistic document-retrieval systems consistent with the two poisson independence-model outperforms the binary independence-model if the terms are distributed as described by the model 's assumptions . the two poisson effectiveness hypothesis suggests that retrieval-models based upon the two poisson model will outperform binary independent models when used on a real-world database , where independence and two poisson term occurrence distributions fail to hold , because the added information obtained from incorporating term-frequency information will more than compensate for the non-poisson distributions of terms . searches of the med1033 database suggest that if terms are not independent and frequencies of term occurrence are not distributed in a two poisson manner , the binary independence sequential retrieval-model outperforms the two poisson independence retrieval-model .
