inferring missing relevance-judgments from crowd workers via probabilistic-matrix-factorization in crowdsourced relevance judging , each crowd worker typically judges only a small number of examples , yielding a sparse and imbalanced set of judgments in which relatively few workers influence output consensus labels , particularly with simple consensus methods like majority-voting . we show how probabilistic-matrix-factorization , a standard approach in collaborative-filtering , can be used to infer missing worker judgments such that all workers influence output labels . given complete worker judgments inferred by pmf , we evaluate impact in unsupervised and supervised scenarios . in the supervised case , we consider both weighted-voting and worker selection-strategies based on worker accuracy . experiments on crowd judgments from the 2010 trec relevance feedback track show promise of the pmf approach merits further investigation and analysis .
