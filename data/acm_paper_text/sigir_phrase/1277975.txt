text-categorization for streams we describe a novel system for evaluating and performing stream-based text-categorization . stream-based text-categorization considers the text being categorized as a stream of symbols , which differs from the traditional feature-based-approach which relies on extracting features from the text . the system implements character-based languages models -- specifically models based on the ppm text-compression scheme -- as well as count-based measures such as r-measure and c-measure . use of the system demonstrates that all of these techniques outperform svm , a feature-based classifier , at stream-related classification-tasks such as authorship ascription .
