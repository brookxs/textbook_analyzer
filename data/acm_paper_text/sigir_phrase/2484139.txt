building a web test collection using social-media community-question-answering (cqa) platforms contain a large number of questions and associated answers . answerers sometimes include urls as part of the answers to provide further information . this paper describes a novel way of building a test-collection for web-search by exploiting the link-information from this type of social-media-data . we propose to build the test-collection by regarding cqa questions as queries and the associated linked web-pages as relevant documents . to evaluate this approach , we collect approximately ten thousand cqa queries , whose answers contained links to clueweb09 documents after spam-filtering . experimental-results using this collection show that the relative effectiveness between different retrieval-models on the clueweb-cqa query set is consistent with that on the trec web track query sets , confirming the reliability of our test-collection . further analysis shows that the large number of queries generated through this approach compensates for the sparse relevance-judgments in determining significant differences .
