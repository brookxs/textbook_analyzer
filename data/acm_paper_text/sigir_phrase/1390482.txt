semi-supervised spam-filtering : does it work ? the results of the 2006 ecml/pkdd discovery challenge suggest that semi-supervised-learning methods work well for spam-filtering when the source of available labeled examples differs from those to be classified . we have attempted to reproduce these results using data from the 2005 and 2007 trec spam track , and have found the opposite effect : methods like self-training and transductive support-vector-machines yield inferior classifiers to those constructed using supervised-learning on the labeled-data alone . we investigate differences between the ecml/pkdd and trec-data sets and methodologies that may account for the opposite results .
