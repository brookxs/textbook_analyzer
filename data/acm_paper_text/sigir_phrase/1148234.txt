type less , find more : fast autocompletion search with a succinct index we consider the following full-text-search autocompletion feature . imagine a user of a search-engine typing a query . then with every letter being typed , we would like an instant display of completions of the last query word which would lead to good hits . at the same time , the best hits for any of these completions should be displayed . known indexing data-structures that apply to this problem either incur large processing times for a substantial class of queries , or they use a lot of space . we present a new indexing data-structure that uses no more space than a state-of-the-art compressed inverted-index , but with 10 times faster query-processing times . even on the large trec terabyte collection , which comprises over 25 million documents , we achieve , on a single-machine and with the index on disk , average response times of one tenth of a second . we have built a full-fledged , interactive-search engine that realizes the proposed autocompletion feature combined with support for proximity-search , semi-structured (xml) text , subword and phrase-completion , and semantic-tags .
