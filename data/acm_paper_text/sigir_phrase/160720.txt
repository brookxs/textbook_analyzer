structured answers for a large structured-document collection there is a simple method for integrating information-retrieval and hypertext . this consists of treating nodes as isolated documents and retrieving them in order of similarity . if the nodes are structured , in particular , if sets of nodes collectively constitute documents , we can do better . this paper shows how the formation of the hypertext , the retrieval of nodes in response to content-based queries , and the presentation of the nodes can be achieved in a way that exploits the knowledge encoded as the structure of the documents . the ideas are then exemplified in an sgml_based hypertext-information-retrieval system .
