linear-discriminant model for information-retrieval this paper presents a new discriminative-model for information-retrieval (ir) , referred to as linear-discriminant model (ldm) , which provides a flexible framework to incorporate arbitrary features . ldm is different from most existing models in that it takes into account a variety of linguistic-features that are derived from the component-models of hmm that is widely used in language-modeling approaches to ir . therefore , ldm is a means of melding discriminative and generative-models for ir . we present two algorithms of parameter-learning for ldm . one is to optimize the average-precision (ap) directly using an iterative-procedure . the other is a perceptron-based algorithm that minimizes the number of discordant document-pairs in a rank list . the effectiveness of our approach has been evaluated on the task of ad-hoc-retrieval using six english and chinese trec test-sets . results show that (1) in most test-sets , ldm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art language-modeling approaches and the classical probabilistic-retrieval-model ; (2) it is more appropriate to train ldm using a measure of ap rather than likelihood if the ir-system is graded on ap ; and (3) linguistic-features (e.g. phrases and dependences) are effective for ir if they are incorporated properly .
