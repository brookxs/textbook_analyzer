optimizing positional index-structures for versioned document-collections versioned document-collections are collections that contain multiple versions of each document . important examples are web-archives , wikipedia and other wikis , or source-code and documents maintained in revision-control systems . versioned document-collections can become very-large , due to the need to retain past versions , but there is also a lot of redundancy between versions that can be exploited . thus , versioned document-collections are usually stored using special differential (delta) compression techniques , and a number of researchers have recently studied how to exploit this redundancy to obtain more succinct full-text index-structures . in this paper , we study index organization and compression techniques for such versioned full-text index-structures . in particular , we focus on the case of positional index-structures , while most previous work has focused on the non-positional case . building on earlier work in [zs : redun] , we propose a framework for indexing and querying in versioned document-collections that integrates non-positional and positional indexes to enable fast top-k-query-processing . within this framework , we define and study the problem of minimizing positional index-size through optimal substring partitioning . experiments on wikipedia and web-archive data show that our techniques achieve significant reductions in index-size over previous work while supporting very fast-query processing .
