latent-semantic-indexing is an optimal special case of multidimensional-scaling latent-semantic-indexing (lsi) is a technique for representing documents , queries , and terms as vectors in a multidimensional real-valued space . the representtions are approximations to the original term space encoding , and are found using the-matrix technique of singular-value-decomposition . in comparison multidimensional-scaling (mds) is a class of data-analysis techniques for representing data points as points in a multidimensional real-valued space . the objects are represented so that inter-point similarities in the space match inter-object similarity information provided by the researcher . we illustrate how the document representations given by lsi are equivalent to the optimal representations found when solving a particular mds problem in which the given inter-object similarity information is provided by the inner-product similarities between the documents themselves . we further analyze a more general mds problem in which the interdocument similarity information , although still in inner-product form is arbitrary with respect to the vector-space encoding of the documents .
