Getting work done on the web: supporting transactional queries
Many searches on the web have a transactional intent. We argue that pages satisfying transactional needs can be distinguished from the more common pages that have some information and links, but cannot be used to execute a transaction. Based on this hypothesis, we provide a recipe for constructing a transaction annotator. By constructing an annotator with one corpus and then demonstrating its classification performance on another,we establish its robustness. Finally, we show experimentally that a search procedure that exploits such pre-annotation greatly outperforms traditional search for retrieving transactional pages.
