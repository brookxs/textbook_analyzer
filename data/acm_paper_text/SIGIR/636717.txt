The implementation of a document retrieval system
The significant advances made in theoretical and experimental research in information retrieval have many implications for system design. One possible design for a document retrieval system based on these advances is presented. A major part of this system design has been implemented as a bibliography filing and retrieval system for the Computer Science department at the University of Massachusetts. The implementation issues considered here are functionality, user interface and file organization. The main point of this implementation was to demonstrate that an efficient, effective and flexible system can be constructed using modern techniques.
