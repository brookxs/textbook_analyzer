Information retrieval by voice input and output
Voice recognition and synthesis will become increasinglyimportant in the 1980's for both data input and output to many computer systems. However, they are still only successful for special applications where the syntax of the language is precisely defined and the number of words in the language is limited. Such a case is a modified form of the Query Language for an Information Retrieval System. Some early experience with a micro-based Information Retrieval system developed at Belfast, called Micro-BIRD, shows that it is not difficult to build a simple voice interface at low cost, but its usefulness is still limited with current technology.
