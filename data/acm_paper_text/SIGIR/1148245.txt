Less is more: probabilistic models for retrieving fewer relevant documents
Traditionally, information retrieval systems aim to maximize the number of relevant documents returned to a user within some window of the top. For that goal, the probability ranking principle, which ranks documents in decreasing order of probability of relevance, is provably optimal. However, there are many scenarios in which that ranking does not optimize for the users information need. One example is when the user would be satisfied with some limited number of relevant documents, rather than needing all relevant documents. We show that in such a scenario, an attempt to return many relevant documents can actually reduce the chances of finding any relevant documents. We consider a number of information retrieval metrics from the literature, including the rank of the first relevant result, the \%no metric that penalizes a system only for retrieving no relevant results near the top, and the diversity of retrieved results when queries have multiple interpretations. We observe that given a probabilistic model of relevance, it is appropriate to rank so as to directly optimize these metrics in expectation. While doing so may be computationally intractable, we show that a simple greedy optimization algorithm that approximately optimizes the given objectives produces rankings for TREC queries that outperform the standard approach based on the probability ranking principle.
