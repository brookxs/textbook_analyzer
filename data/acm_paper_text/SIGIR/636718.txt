An intelligent terminal for implementing relevance feedback on large operational retrieval systems
Research has shown that document retrieval based on weighting functions and incorporating relevance feedback may be more effective than retrieval based on Boolean combinations. These novel methods have not been adopted by the large operational systems. In this paper, a software implementation of an 'intelligent terminal' is described. It overcomes many of the objections to non-Boolean retrieval. It is linked to an operational database via EURONET, and includes such features as the weighting of search terms, the construction and submission of search statements in the Common Command Language of EURONET, and the use of relevance feedback information to improve retrieval.
