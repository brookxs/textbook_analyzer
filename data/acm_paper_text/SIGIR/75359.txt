Settings and the setting structure: the description and automated propagation of networks for perusing videodisk image states
This paper describes a system for formally representing spatial relationships between videodisc image states called settings . A number of setting relations are defined, these being based on the manipulations of the camera typically used in the production of the moving film: zooming in or out, panning etc.. An algorithm is presented which, given a limited level of initial specification by a describer, will constrain, where possible, the setting relations holding between all pairs of settings. The resulting network is called the settings structure . The paper begins by placing the settings structure into the context of its being one part of the CLORIS system.
