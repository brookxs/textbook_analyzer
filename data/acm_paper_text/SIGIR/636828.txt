Computing text constituency: an algorithmic approach to the generation of text graphs
An algorithm for text summarization (automatic abstracting) is presented which constitutes the text condensation component of TOPIC, a knowledge-based text information system. Based on the results of text parsing knowledge representation structures of text segments are evaluated in order to determine dominant concepts. By means of an interpretation schema dominant concepts are related in terms of thematic units indicative of the topic(s) of the text segment under consideration. The mutual compatibility of topics of adjacent text segments is determined and corresponding text constituents are constructed. Finally, a text graph is generated linking appropriate text constituents on various levels of text constituency. Accordingly, facilities for text-oriented information retrieval will be based on the manipulation of these text graphs.
