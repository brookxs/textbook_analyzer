TF-IDF uncovered: a study of theories and probabilities
Interpretations of TF-IDF are based on binary independence retrieval, Poisson, information theory, and language modelling. This paper contributes a review of existing interpretations, and then, TF-IDF is systematically related to the probabilities P ( q | d ) and P ( d | q ). Two approaches are explored: a space of independent , and a space of disjoint terms. For independent terms, an "extreme" query/non-query term assumption uncovers TF-IDF, and an analogy of P ( d | q ) and the probabilistic odds O ( r | d , q ) mirrors relevance feedback. For disjoint terms, a relationship between probability theory and TF-IDF is established through the integral + 1/ x d x = log x . This study uncovers components such as divergence from randomness and pivoted document length to be inherent parts of a document-query independence (DQI) measure, and interestingly, an integral of the DQI over the term occurrence probability leads to TF-IDF.
