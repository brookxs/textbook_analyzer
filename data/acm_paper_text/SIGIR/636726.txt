An evaluation of term dependence models in information retrieval
In Practical retrieval environments the assumption is normally made that the terms assigned to the documents of a collection occur independently of each other. The term independence assumption is unrealistic in many cases, but its use leads to a simple retrieval algorithm. More realistic retrieval systems take into account dependencies between certain term pairs and possibly between term triples. In this study, methods are outlined for generating dependency factors for term pairs and term triples and for using them in retrieval. Evaluation output is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested methodologies.
