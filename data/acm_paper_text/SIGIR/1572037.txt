Query side evaluation: an empirical analysis of effectiveness and effort
Typically, Information Retrieval evaluation focuses on measuring the performance of the system's ability at retrieving relevant information, and not the query's ability. However, the effectiveness of a retrieval system is strongly influenced by the quality of the query submitted. In this paper, the effectiveness and effort of querying is empirically examined in the context of the Principle of Least Effort, Zipf's Law and the Law of Diminishing Returns. This query focused investigation leads to a number of novel findings which should prove useful in the development of future retrieval methods and evaluation techniques. While, also motivating further research into query side evaluation.
