A decision theory approach to optimal automatic indexing
A decision theory approach to the development of retrieval systems is presented. Within this framework, optimalindexing is defined. Both the searching and the indexing problem turn out to have a common structure which is described using the concept of a 'recognition problem'. A knowledge based approach to an approximately optimalindexing, strictly related to the information need of user is outlined. The theory and the used approximation methods are illustrated by a brief description of WAI/AIR projects and some of their results.
