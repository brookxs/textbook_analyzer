 6__________  Inference beyond  the Index  The Index, that critical mapping between documents and descriptive keywords, has dominated our approach to FOA in all the preceding chapters. But there is of course a larger context of available information: FOA can be accomplished by showing a user relations among keywords, by acquainting him or her with important authors, by pointing to important journals where relevant documents are often published, and so on. Retrieval of all these information resources, especially when structured in meaningful interfaces, can tell a user much more than a simple list of relevant documents.  This chapter is concerned with exploiting a variety of other clues we might have about documents (and keywords, authors, etc.), above and beyond the statistical, word-frequency information that has been at the heart of the Index relation. In all cases, these techniques identify some new source of data, represent it efficiently, and then perform some kind of inference over the representation.  AI is a subdiscipline of computer science that is centrally concerned with questions of knowledge representation and inference over those representations, especially when these algorithms arguably lead to "intelligent" behaviors. (In many ways the best characterization of the AI domain is the extensional one provided by the AIT corpus of Ph.D. dissertations.) We could expect, therefore, that there would be a great deal of cross-fertilization between AI methods and IR methods, both having  182 INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      183  grown up within computer science during the same period. But for complicated reasons, until recently there has been very little interaction.^         History: AI xor  By and large, AI has defined its notions of inference in logical terms, IR? originally based on automatic theorem-proving results. Chapter 5 discussed IR's probabilistic foundations, and one immediate axis of difference between AI and IR is the distinction between primarily logical and primarily probabilistic modes of inference. Nevertheless, some in IR perceived early on the advantages offered by AFs knowledge representations [Smith, 1981] and expert systems techniques [Fox and France, 1987; McCune et al, 1985; Fidel, 1986].  Today, the fields of AI and IR align much more closely. For example, both machine learning and natural language processing have always been considered central issues within AI. The next chapter will discuss at length machine learning techniques as they have been applied to document corpora. Section 8.2 can only sketch another large intersection, corpus-based linguistics, where natural language issues and IR techniques also merge.  The advantages of applying AI knowledge representation techniques become especially obvious when additional structured attributes are associated with documents, keywords, and authors. Early on, Kochen [Kochen, 1975] considered a broad range of these forms of information as shown in Figure 6.1. Even more inclusive lists have since been proposed [Katzer et al., 1982; Hanson, 1988].  This shows the primary Index relation in the larger context of other information we might have available. What all of these additional forms of information have in common is their ability to shed new light on the semantic questions of what the documents are about. Information on the publication details of documents, for example, the journal date or page numbers of documents, can help provide a context within which individual documents can be better understood. Much of this data-about-data document is now referred to as meta-data. This additional modeling of document structure, in languages like XML and codified in standards like the Dublin Coreyl is one of the most important ways in which database and IR technologies now interact. This constructively blurs many of the database/search engine differences mentioned earlier (cf. Section 1.6). Techniques for performing fact extraction - building database relations 184      FINDING OUT ABOUT  Broader/narrower term  Publication  FIGURE 6,1 Other Information Available for FOA (after [Kochen, 1975])  from analysis of textual WWW pages [Craven et al, 1998] - suggest a broad range of new ways that structured attributes may enter into the retrieval task.  Section 6.1 discusses one of the most important ways in which documents can be understood independent of their keywords. In science, in the common law tradition, more recently in email newsgroups, and now with HTML hyperlinks, the ability to link one document to another can provide vital information about how the arguments of one document relate to those contained in another.  Section 6.3 will discuss some of the special representation techniques that have been used to organize keywords in the vocabulary. It is also INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      185  possible to reason about authors of documents. Section 6.4.1 discusses Ph.D. "genealogies" in which dissertation authors are related to one another by shared advisors. Coauthorship and membership in the same research institution have also been proposed as ways to provide context on a particular author's words. In some cases, characterizations of expertise of the authors, independent of the documents themselves, are available.  The chapter concludes with several suggestions of how these varied information sources can become integrated as part of next-generation FOA tools. Section 6.5 considers several "modes of inference" by which new conclusions about keywords and documents can be reached from elementary facts. Section 6.6 suggests a few of the new interface techniques that become available as richer data streams are provided by and presented back to a user. Sections 6.7 and 6.8 look at two domains of discourse in particular - the law and science surrounding molecular genetics - as examples of how such techniques can be marshaled toward particular FOA purposes. After considering all these ways that the methods of AI can be used to help with FOA, Section 6.9 concludes by speculating about how the problem of intelligence itself might be changed as we take seriously the prospect of basing it on textual representations.
