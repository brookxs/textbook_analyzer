 12.5    Two-dimensional Color Images GEMINI has also been applied for color images, within the QBIC project of IBM. The QBIC (Query By Image Content) project studies methods to query large online image databases using the images' content as the basis of the queries. Examples of the content include color, texture, shape, position, and dominant edges of image items and regions. Potential applications include medical ("Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photojournalism ('Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom"), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Here we will discuss methods on databases of still images, with two main datatypes: images' (= "scenes') and 'items.' A scene is a (color) image, and an item is a part of a scene, for example, a person, a piece of outlined texture, or an apple. Each scene has zero or more items. The identification and extraction of items is beyond the scope of this discussion (see [603] for more details). In this section we give an overview of the indexing aspects of QBIC, and specifically the distance functions and the application of the GEMINI approach. More details about the algorithms and the implementation of QBIC are in [257].
