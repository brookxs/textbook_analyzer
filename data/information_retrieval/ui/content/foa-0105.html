 5.5.3 Odds Calculation  In addition to evidence the features provide to show that a document is Rational world      Rel, Pr(Rel |x), they may also provide evidence that it is not: Pr(Rel | x)J An odds calculation balances both probabilities as a ratio:  (5.38)  Pr(Rel\x) The Bayes rule can also be applied to this ratio:  Pr(Rel\x)      Pr(Rel)    Pr(x\Rel)  Pr(Rel\x)      Pr(Rel)    Pr(x\Rel)  Pr(ic\Rpl)  (5.39)  Odds(Rel | x) =  Pr(x\Rel)  The first term will be small; the odds of picking a relevant versus irrelevant document independent of any features of the document are not good. Still, Odds(Rel) can be expected to be a characteristic of an entire corpus or the generality of the current query but insensitive to any analysis we  might perform on a particular document.  In order to calculate the second term, we need a more refined model  of how documents are "constructed" from their features.
