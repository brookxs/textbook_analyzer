 8.8    Compression In this section we discuss the issues of searching compressed text directly and of searching compressed indices. Compression is important when available storage is a limiting factor, as is the case of indexing the Web. Searching and compression were traditionally regarded as exclusive operations. Texts which were not to be searched could be compressed, and to search COMPRESSION        223 a compressed text it had to be decompressed first. In recent years, very efficient compression techniques have appeared that allow searching directly in the compressed text. Moreover, the search performance is improved, since the CPU times are similar but the disk times are largely reduced. This leads to a win-win situation. Discussion on how common text and lists of numbers can be compressed has been covered in Chapter 7.
