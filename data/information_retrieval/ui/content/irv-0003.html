 Outline  Chapter 2: Automatic Text Analysis - contains a straightforward discussion of how the text of a document is represented inside a computer. This is a superficial chapter but I think it is adequate in the context of this book.  Chapter 3: Automatic Classification - looks at automatic classification methods in general and then takes a deeper look at the use of these methods in information retrieval.  Chapter 4: File Structures - here we try and discuss file structures from the point of view of someone primarily interested in information retrieval.  Chapter 5: Search Strategies - gives an account of some search strategies when applied to document collections structured in different ways. It also discusses the use of feedback.  Chapter 6: Probabilistic Retrieval - describes a formal model for enhancing retrieval effectiveness by using sample information about the frequency of occurrence and co-occurrence of index terms in the relevant and non-relevant documents.  Chapter 7: Evaluation - here I give a traditional view of the measurement of effectiveness followed by an explanation of some of the more promising attempts at improving the art. I also attempt to provide foundations for a theory of evaluation.  Chapter 8: The Future - contains some speculation about the future of IR and tries to pinpoint some areas of research where further work is desperately needed.
