 4.7.2 Hypertext History  Although information sciences is just starting to address the impact of the hypertext data structure, the concept of hypertext has been around for over 50 years.    In  1945 an article written by Vannevar Bush in  1933 was published  describing the Memex (memory extender) system (Bush-67). It was a microfilm based system that would allow the user to store much of the information from the scientific explosion of the 1940s on microfilm and retrieve it at multiple readers at the user's desk via individual links. The term "hypertext" came from Ted Nelson in 1965 (Nelson-74). Nelson's vision of all the world's literature being interlinked via hypertext references is part of his Xanadu System. The lack of cost effective computers with sufficient speed and memory to implement hypertext effectively 98                                                                                                Chapter 4  was one of the main inhibitors to its development. One of the first commercial uses of a hypertext system was the mainframe system, Hypertext Editing System, developed at Brown University by Andres van Dam and later sold to Houston Manned Spacecraft Center where it was used for Apollo mission documentation (van Dam-88). Other systems such as the Aspen system at MIT, the KMS system at Carnegie Mellon, the Hyperties system at the University of Maryland and the Notecards system developed at Xerox PARC advanced the hypertext concepts providing hypertext (and hypermedia) systems. HyperCard, delivered with Macintosh computers, was the first widespread hypertext production product. It had a simple metalanguage (HyperTalk) that facilitated authoring hypertext items. It also provided a large number of graphical user interface elements (e.g., buttons, hands,) that facilitated the production of sophisticated items.  Hypertext became more available in the early 1990's via its use in CDROMs for a variety of educational and entertainment products. Its current high level of popularity originated with it being part of the specification of the World Wide Web by the CERN (the European Center for Nuclear Physics Research) in Geneva, Switzerland. The Mosaic browser, freely available from CERN on the Internet, gave everyone who had access the ability to receive and display hypertext documents.
