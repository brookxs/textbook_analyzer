 3.5.2 Cosine Similarity  We will focus here on the cosine measure of similarity. Not only does this respect the useful mathematical properties mentioned at the beginning of this section, but it is consistent with a geometric interpretation of the 96      FINDING OUT ABOUT  vector space that many find insightful: Sim(q, d) = cos(qZd)  q d  wkd  yjkd Â¶  =====                (3.39)  ked             V keq
