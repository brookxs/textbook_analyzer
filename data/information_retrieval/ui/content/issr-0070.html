 5.2 Statistical Indexing  Statistical indexing uses frequency of occurrence of events to calculate a number that is used to indicate the potential relevance of an item. One approach used in search of older systems does not use the statistics to aid in the initial selection, but uses them to assist in calculating a relevance value of each item for ranking. The documents are found by a normal Boolean search and then statistical calculations are performed on the Hit file, ranking the output (e.g., term frequency algorithms). Since the index does not contain any special data, these techniques are discussed in Chapter 7 under ranking.  Probabilistic systems attempt to calculate a probability value that should be invariant to both calculation method and text corpora. This allows easy integration of the final results when searches are performed across multiple databases and use different search algorithms. A probability of 50 per cent would mean that if enough items are reviewed, on the average one half of the reviewed items are relevant. The Bayesian and Vector approaches calculate a relative relevance value (e.g., confidence level) that a particular item is relevant. Quite often term distributions across the searchable database are used in the calculations. An issue that continues to be researched is how to merge results, even from the same search algorithm, from multiple databases. The problem is compounded when an attempt is made to merge the results from different search algorithms. This would not be a problem if true probabilities were calculated.
