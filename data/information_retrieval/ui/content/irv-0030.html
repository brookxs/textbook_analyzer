 Conclusion  Let me briefly summarise the logical structure of this chapter. It started very generally with a descriptive look at automatic classification and its uses. It then discussed association measures which form the basis of an important class of classification methods. Next came a breakdown of classification methods. This was followed by a statement of the hypothesis underlying the use of automatic classification in document clustering. It went on to examine in some detail the use of classification methods in IR leading up to recommendation of single-link for document clustering. Finally we made some practical points about implementation.  This chapter ended on a rather practical note. We continue in this vein in the next chapter where we discuss file structures. These are important if we are to appreciate how it is that we can get dictionaries, document clustering, search strategies, and such like to work inside a computer.
