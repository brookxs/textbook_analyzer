 13.3.1    Measuring the Web Measuring the Internet and in particular the Web, is a difficult task due to its highly dynamic nature. Nowadays, there are more than 40 million computers in more than 200 countries connected to the Internet, many of them hosting Web servers. The estimated number of Web servers ranges from 2.4 million according to NetSizer [597] (November 1998) to over three million according to the Netcraft Web survey [596] (October 1998). This wide range might be explained when we consider that there are many Web sites that share the same Web server using virtual hosts, that not all of them are fully accessible, that many of them are provisional, etc. Other estimations were made by sampling 0.1% of all Internet numeric addresses obtaining about 2 million unique Web sites [619] or by counting domain names starting with www which in July 1998 were 780,000 according to the Internet Domain survey [599]. However, since not all Web servers have this prefix, the real number is even higher. Considering that in July 1998 the number of Internet hosts was estimated at 36.7 million [599], there is about one Web server per every ten computers connected to the 370 SEARCHING THE WEB Internet. The characterization of the Web is a new task of the Web Consortium [797]. In two interesting articles, already (sadly) outdated, Bray [114] and Woodruff et al. [834] studied different statistical measures of the Web. The first study uses 11 million pages while the second uses 2.6 million pages, with both sets gathered in November 1995. Their characterization of Web pages is partially reproduced in the following paragraphs. A first question is how many different institutions (not Web servers) maintain Web data. This number is smaller than the number of servers, because many places have multiple servers. The exact number is unknown, but should be more than 40% of the number of Web servers (this percentage was the value back in 1995). The exact number of Web pages is also not known. Estimates at the beginning of 1998 ranged from 200 to 320 million, with 350 million as the best current estimate (July 1998 [91]). The latter study used 20,000 random queries based on a lexicon of 400,000 words extracted from Yahoo!. Those queries were submitted to four search engines and the union of all the answers covered about 70% of the Web. Figure 13.1 gives an approximation of how the number of Web servers and the number of pages have changed in recent years. Between 1997 and 1998, the size of the Web doubled in nine months and is currently growing at a rate of 20 million pages per month. On the other hand, it is estimated that the 30,000 largest Web sites (about 1% of the Web) account for approximately 50% of all Web pages [619]. The most popular formats for Web documents are HTML, followed by GIF and JPG (both for images), ASCII text, and Postscript, in that order. The most popular compression tools used are GNU zip, Zip, and Compress. What is a typical HTML page? First, most HTML pages are not standard, meaning that they do not comply with all the HTML specifications.

CHARACTERIZING THE WEB        371 dition, although HTML is an instance of SGML, HTML documents seldom start with a formal document type definition. Second, they are small (around 5 Kbs on average with a median of 2 Kbs) and usually contain few images (between one and two on average with an average size of 14 Kb). The pages that have images use them for presentation issues such as colored bullets and lines. An average page has between five and 15 hyperlinks (more than eight links on average) and most of them are local (that is, they point to pages in their own Web server hierarchy). On average, no external server points to any given page (typically, there are only local links pointing to a given page). This is true even for home pages of Web sites. In fact, in 1995, around 80% of these home pages had fewer than ten external links pointing to each of them. The top ten most referenced sites are Microsoft, Netscape, Yahoo!, and top US universities. In these cases we are talking about sites which are referenced by at least 100,000 places. On the other hand, the site with most links to outside sites is Yahoo!. In some sense, Yahoo! and other directories are the glue of the Web. Without them we would have many isolated portions (which is the case with many personal Web pages). If we assume that the average HTML page has 5 Kb and that there are 300 million Web pages, we have at least 1.5 terabytes of text. This is consistent with other measures obtained from search engines. Note that this volume does not include non-textual documents. Regarding the languages used in Web pages, there have been three studies made. The first study was done by Funredes [637] from 1996 to 1998. It uses the AltaVista search engine and is based on searching different words in different languages. This technique might not be significant statistically, but the results are consistent with the second study wrhich was carried out by Alis Technology [11] and is based on automatic software that can detect the language used. One of the goals of the study was to test such software (done in 8000 Web servers). The last study was done by OCLC in June of 1998 [619] by sampling Internet numeric addresses and using the SILC language identification software. Table 13.1 gives the percentages of Web pages written in each language (with the exception of the OCLC data that counts Web sites), as well as the number of people (millions) who speak the language. The variations for Japanese might be due to an inability to detect pages written in Kanji. Some languages, in particular Spanish and Portuguese, are growing fast and will surpass French in the near future. The total number of languages exceeds 100.
