 12.4.1    Distance Function According to GEMINI (algorithm 2), the first step is to determine the distance measure between two time series. A typical distance function is the Euclidean distance (equation 12.2), which is routinely used in financial and forecasting applications. Additional, more elaborate distance functions, that, for example, include time-warping, are discussed in section 12.8.
