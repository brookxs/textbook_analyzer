 Discrimination power of an index term  On p. 120 I defined  and in fact there made the comment that it was a measure of the power of term i to discriminate between relevant and non-relevant documents. The weights in the weighting function derived from the independence assumption A1 are exactly these Ki's. Now if we forget for the moment that these weights are a consequence of a particular model and instead consider the notion of discrimination power of an index term on its own merits. Certainly this is not a novel thing to do, Salton in some of his work has sought effective ways of measuring the 'discrimination value' of index terms[24]. It seems reasonable to attach to any index term that enters into the retrieval process a weight related to its discrimination power. Ki as a measure of this power is slightly awkward in that it becomes undefined when the argument of the log function becomes zero. We therefore seek a more 'robust' function for measuring discrimination power. The function I am about to recommend for this purpose is indeed more robust, has an interesting interpretation, and enables me to derive a general result of considerable interest in the next section. However, it must be emphasised that it is only an example of a function which enables some sense to be make of the notion 'discrimination power' in this and the next section. It should therefore not be considered unique although it is my opinion that any alternative way of measuring discrimination power in this context would come very close to the measure I suggest here.  Instead of Ki I suggest using the information radius, defined in Chapter 3 on p. 42, as a measure of the discrimination power of an index term. It is a close cousin of the expected mutual information measure a relationship that will come in useful later on. Using u and v as positive weights such as u + v = 1 and the usual notation for the probability functions we can write the information radius as follows:  The interesting interpretation of the information radius that I referred to above is illustrated most easily in terms of continuous probability functions. Instead of using the densities p(./w1) and p(./w2) I shall use the corresponding probability measure u1 and u2. First we define the average of two directed divergencies[25],  R (u1, u2/v) = uI (u1/v) +vI (u2/v)  where I(ui/v) measures the expectation on ui of the information in favour of rejecting v for ui given by making an observation; it may be regarded as the information gained from being told to reject v in favour of ui. Now the information radius is the minimum  thereby removing the arbitrary v. In fact it turns out that the minimum is achieved when  v = u u1 + v u2  that is, an average of the two distributions to be discriminated. If we now adopt u and v as the prior probabilities then v is in fact given by the density  p(x) = p(x/w1) P(w1) + p(x/w2) P(w2)  defined over the entire collection without regard to relevance. Now of this distribution we are reasonably sure, the distribution u1 and u2 we are only guessing at; therefore it is reasonable when measuring the difference between u1 and u2 that v should incorporate as much of the information that is available. The information radius does just this.  There is one technical problem associated with the use of the information radius, or any other 'discrimination measure' based on all four cells of the contingency table, which is rather difficult to resolve. As a measure of discrimination power it does not distinguish between the different contributions made to the measure by the different cells. So, for example, an index term might be a good discriminator because it occurs frequently in the non-relevant documents and infrequently in the relevant documents. Therefore, to weight an index term proportional to the discrimination measure whenever it is present in a document is exactly the wrong thing to do. It follows that the data contained in the contingency table must be used when deciding on a weighting scheme.
