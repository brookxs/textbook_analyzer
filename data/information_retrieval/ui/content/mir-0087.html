 5.2.3    A Variant of Probabilistic Term Reweighting The discussion above on term reweighting is based on the classic probabilistic niodel introduced by Robertson and Sparck Jones in 1976. In 1983, Croft extended this weighting scheme by suggesting distinct initial search methods 122        QUERY OPERATIONS and by adapting the probabilistic formula to include within-document frequency weights. This variant of probabilistic term reweighting is more flexible (and also more powerful) and is briefly reviewed in this section. The formula 5.2 for probabilistic ranking can be rewritten as sim(dj,q) a where Fij,q is interpreted as a factor which depends on the triple [K,d3,q]. In the classic formulation, FMilt;7 is computed as a function of P(ki\R) and P(kt\R) (see equation 5.2). In his variant, Croft proposed that the initial search and the feedback searches use distinct formulations. For the initial search, he suggested Juj    = max(fij) where fx j is a normalized within-document frequency. The parameters C and K should be adjusted according to the collection. For automatically indexed collections, C should be initially set to 0. For the feedback searches, Croft suggested the following formulation for F.        fc I log   P(W     iloc1^*'^   7 IJlt;9"VC+   gl-P(h\R) +1âˆžg    P(kt\R)   )   ^ where P(kt\R) and P{kt\R) are computed as in equation 5.4. This variant of probabilistic term reweighting has the following advantages: (1) it takes into account the within-document frequencies; (2) it adopts a normalized version of these frequencies; and (3) it introduces the constants C and K which provide for greater flexibility. However, it constitutes a more complex formulation and, as before, it operates solely on the terms originally in the query (without query expansion).
