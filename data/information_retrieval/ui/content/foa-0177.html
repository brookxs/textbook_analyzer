 8.3.1 Authors  Note first the new precision/recall-like trade-offs facing authors: If they are aggressively selling their documents, then putting spam-like descriptors on them will make them be retrieved in the most possible situations. Getting your document into the hands of only those readers you anticipate finding it relevant means anticipating their queries and how they'll describe their information need. Who is the audience? What words are familiar to this audience? What words in this document will be unfamiliar to them? How might you describe the unfamiliar concepts using familiar words? At their core, these questions are no different from what authors have needed to ask since the beginning.  The tendency of authors to oversell their documents is exactly what makes checkpoints in the publication process valuable. We value news editors, publishers, reviewers, and all others whose profession it is to apply discretion.  Authors should think about FOA because they need to have their documents found. Publishers have traditionally helped with this process, but only for those authors they choose to publish. The WWW opens a much larger number of useful communication channels to potential authors. Not all of this authoring activity is healthy, however. Moderation of newsgroups and the peer review process are two important checks on the flow of information that have worked traditionally in UseNet and scientific exchanges.  Authors need to know how to write to be found. The ability to separate documents explicitly with meta-data about the documents means that there is no need to compromise the work itself to publicize it to an audience. It is true, of course, that the most effective ways of automatically producing meta-descriptions of a document still involve FOA-style statistical keyword analysis. But many authors are willing to manually add useful keywords or connect their documents to relevant Web pages or search engines. For many authors and artists this explicit analysis of potential readerships is an important part of their art. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS       309  Of course, authors may or may not be aware of all of the ways potential readers might be interested in their work. This is where a third-party editorial role becomes most valuable. Good editors are able to span the gap between what an author is trying to say and what an audience is interested in hearing.
