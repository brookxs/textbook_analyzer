 14.3    Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs) Library catalogs serve as lists of the library's holdings, organized as finding tools for the collection. For many years the card catalog served this function, and later computer-produced catalogs in book, microfilm, and microfiche form. Online catalogs were implemented in libraries during the 1970s, although these first catalogs were usually modules linked to the automated circulation system and had brief catalog records and very limited functionality. (The circulation system was the first component of what are now called library management systems (LMSs) or integrated library systems (ILSs) to be introduced). By the 1980s, true online public access catalogs had been implemented. Hildreth [372] has described the history of online catalogs by classifying them according to three generations. In the first generation, OPACs were largely known-item finding tools, typically searchable by author, title, and control number, and contained relatively short, non-standard bibliographic records. As is typical of technologies in their infancy, they were basically an old technology (the card catalog) in an automated form. In the second generation, increased search functionality included access by subject headings and, latterly, keyword, 408        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS some basic Boolean search capability, and ability to browse subject headings. Second generation catalogs also offered a choice of display formats (e.g., short, medium, long) and improved usability (for instance, different dialogs for novices and experts, more informative error messages, etc.). According to Hildreth, problems with second generation systems included failed searches, navigational confusion, problems with the subject indexing vocabulary and excessively large, badly organized retrieval sets. Needed enhancements for third generation systems, as delineated by Hildreth, included search strategy assistance, integrated free text/controlled vocabulary approaches, augmented cataloging records, cross-database access, natural language input, individualized displays and context-sensitive error correction. For many years library catalogs remained on what Hildreth referred to as the 'second generation plateau.' One of the barriers to innovation in OPAC development has been the cost of developing new systems and the need for a reliable customer base. Prom the perspective of the library, selecting and migrating to a new system is a costly process, and with library budgets traditionally squeezed, libraries have been cautious in selecting new and untried systems. They have learned to be wary of the 'it's in the next release; syndrome, while system developers have required a stable customer base to fund new systems. Third generation systems are now appearing, and with features not envisioned by Hildreth, who was speaking in a pre-Web environment. The availability of electronic resources on the Web has blurred the distinction between local and global resources, and between cataloging information and other electronic databases. According to a recent vendor survey [632], Automated system vendors have a vested interest in the transition of libraries to a mixed digital/print environment. Many see their own survival dependent upon their ability to help libraries thrive in this mixed arena, (p.47) Therefore, much of the emphasis in recent library systems development has been on the deployment of functionality for library management systems within new open systems architectures [351]. Features appearing in these new systems include improved graphical user interfaces (GUIs), support for Z39.50, electronic forms, hypertext links and Dublin Core (a developing metadata standard for multimedia materials), and incorporation of Java programming. Systems are also beginning to move beyond the basic Boolean search functionality, and some, like EGSFs Q series (described in section 14.3.3) have advanced search features.
