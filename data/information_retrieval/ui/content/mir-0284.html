 14.3.3    OPACs: Vendors and Products The OPAC market is a specialized one, and products are developed and marketed by a limited number of vendors who compete for market position. While it is rare to find a library of any size that does not have a library management system, libraries are constantly in a state of flux, upgrading their systems as old ones become obsolete or unsupported, and introducing new systems. For example, many academic libraries had OPACs based on the venerable mainframe-based NOTIS software, and have undertaken to identify a suitable replacement. Most of the vendors target niche markets: academic libraries, public libraries, and school and special libraries. Profiles of three such vendors are found in Figure 14.9. Fuller details of these and other systems can be found in [351] and [61].
