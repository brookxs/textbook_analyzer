 1.6 FOA versus Database Retrieval  Within the field of computer science, the sub fields of databases and IR are often closely aligned. Databases have well-developed theoretic underpinnings [Abiteboul et al., 1995] that have generated efficient algorithms [McFadden and Hoffer, 1994] and become the foundation for one of the most successful elements of the computer industry.  Both databases and search engines attempt to characterize a particular class of queries by which many users are expected to attempt to get information from computers. Historically, database systems and theory have been perceived as central to the discipline of computer science, probably more so than the IR techniques that are the core technologies for FOA. Things may be changing, however.  The general public's discovery of the Internet and subsequent interest in search engines like Alta Vista, InfoSeek, and Yahoo! suggest that many users find value in the lists of Web pages returned in response to searches. These search engines are clearly doing an important job for many people. It is also a quantitatively different job from organizing their address book (or record collection or baseball statistics) databases. How are IR and database technologies to be distinguished?  To make the distinctions more concrete, let's imagine a particular information need and think about how both a database and a search engine might attempt to satisfy it. An example query might be as follows.  QUERY 3   What is the best SCSI disk drive to buy? 30      FINDING OUT ABOUT   TABLE 1.1 Hypothetical Database       Size  Price Speed  Model number Manufacturer Vendor (GB) Interface ($) (msec)  123 Seag JR 2.4 SCSI 162 12  123 Seag Fry 2.4 SCSI 159 12  456 Metrop AB 2.5 IDE 0 12.5  789 Seag JR 1.5 EIDE 121 10.5  In the case of databases, strong assumptions must first be made about structure among attributes of individual records. Good database design demands that the fundamental elements of data, their format, and logical relations among them be carefully analyzed and anticipated in a logical data model long before any data are actually collected and maintained within a physical implementation. These assumptions allow specification of a syntax for the query language, strategies for optimizing the query's use of computational resources, and efficient storage of the data on physical devices.  Now let's assume that a logical data model has been constructed and that a large catalog of information from various hard drive manufacturers and vendors has been collated. We will also make the larger and problematic assumption that the users can translate the natural language of Query 3 into the somewhat baroque syntax of a query language such as SQL. The result of the database search might look something like  NLPfor              Table 1.1.1"  databases                  Creating an example relation like this and populating it with a few  instances is simple, but performing the necessary data modeling, collating the data from all of the manufacturers and vendors, and keeping it all up to date are much more daunting tasks. If the database catalog is out of date or missing data from important vendors, users might leave the database badly informed.  Now let's imagine using a search engine on the same query. When run against a UseNet news search engine like DejaNews, this query results in the retrieval shown in Figure 1.8 with the most highly ranked posting shown in Figure 1.9.  Users of this search engine will read about many issues related to hard disks, some of which may be relevant to their particular situation.

Can users choose between IDE and SCSI, or are they restricted to SCSI? Depending on what kind of users they are, some of the information retrieved may be 32       FINDING OUT ABOUT  TABLE 1.2 IR versus Database Retrieval   IR Database  System provides Pointer to data Data item  User's query General Specific  Retrieval method Probabilistic Deterministic  Success criteria Utility (Correctness)    Efficiency,    User-friendliness,...  immediately applicable to the purchase being considered, while other parts of it are better considered collateral knowledge (D. E. Rose, personal communication) that simply leaves users better informed.  A very different set of assumptions from those we made about the database system are necessary to imagine the search engine working. For example, who wrote these postings? Are they a credible source of good information; what is their authority? Well-trained database users should ask equally skeptical questions about the data retrieved, but rarely are authority, data integrity, and the like considered part of database analysis.  But the key assumption for our IR users is that they can "listen in" on this previous "conversation" and interpret the text that has been left behind as containing potential answers to the current question. The search engine is charged with retrieving textual passages that are likely to answer the users' questions. Once presented with these retrievals, FOA users have more humble expectations and are willing to do more interpretive work. Because FOA searches are often even less concrete than Query 3 and are issued by users simply trying to learn about a topic, semantic issues central to the interpretation of a textual passage and its context, validity, and so on are at the heart of the FOA enterprise.  Van Rijsbergen, p. 2, table 1.1 has summarized these issues along a number of dimensions by which IR and database systems can be distinguished, and several of these are duplicated in Table 1.2. Database systems are almost always assumed to provide data items directly. Search engines provide a level of indirection, a pointer to textual passages that contain many facts, hopefully including some of interest. The information need of the users is quite vague when compared to that of database OVERVIEW       33  users. The search engine users are searching for information about a topic they don't completely understand. Typical database users have a fairly specific question, like Query 3, in mind. It might even be that the database is missing some data; for example, the special null value 0 in Table 1.1 shows that the price of the third disk drive is not known. Even in this case, however, the database system "knows that it doesn't know" this information. FOA queries are rarely brought to such a sharp point; ambiguity is intrinsic to the users5 expectations.  Because the queries are so general, an FOA retrieval must be described in probabilistic terms. If a particular hard disk's price is part of our database, we are certain, with probability = 1.0, of its value. Never would a database system reply with "This hard disk might cost about $300." As discussed in depth in Section 5.5, a search engine can use sophisticated methods for reasoning probabilistically, and available evidence might even allow it to be quite confident that retrieved items will be perceived as relevant. But never will we be entirely certain that a document is what users want; we can only have high confidence that it may be.  Finally, one of the problems in evaluating search engines is just what success criteria are to be used. We typically assume that information we get back from a database system is correct. (Try to find an ad for a database system that boasts, "Our system retrieves only right answers"!) One database system claims to be more efficient, cheaper, easier to integrate into existing code, and more user-friendly than others.  This list of ways that search engines might be distinguished from databases is far from exhaustive; Blair has proposed a more extensive analysis [Blair, 1984]. More recently, as search engine technology and WWW-inspired applications have both burgeoned, hybrids of databases and search engines have blurred the historical differences further. Some bases of database/search engine interaction are mentioned in Chapter 6.  Chapter 4 discusses the evaluation of search engines in great detail, but typically the bottom line is: Does the system help you? If you are writing a research paper, did this search engine help you find material that was useful in your research? If you are a lawyer preparing a case and you want to find every relevant judicial opinion, does the search engine offer an advantage over an equivalent amount of time combing 34      FINDING OUT ABOUT  through books in a law library? Such squishy, qualitative judgments are notoriously difficult to measure, and especially to measure consistently across broad populations of users. The next section provides a quick preview of several precise measurements that have proven useful to the IR community but would not be found persuasive within the database community.
