 7.3    Document Clustering Document clustering is the operation of grouping together similar (or related) documents in classes. In this regard, document clustering is not really an operation on the text but an operation on the collection of documents. The operation of clustering documents is usually of two types: global and local. In a global clustering strategy, the documents are grouped accordingly to their occurrence in the wrhole collection. In a local clustering strategy, the grouping of documents is affected by the context defined by the current query and its local set of retrieved documents. Clustering methods are usually used in IR to transform the original query in an attempt to better represent the user information need. From this perspective, clustering is an operation which is more related to the transformation of the user query than to the transformation of the text of the documents. In this book, document clustering techniques are treated as query operations and thus, are covered in Chapter 5 (instead of here).
