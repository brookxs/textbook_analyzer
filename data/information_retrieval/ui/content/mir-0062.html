 3.3.1    The TREC Collection Research in information retrieval has frequently been criticized on two fronts. First, that it lacks a solid formal framework as a basic foundation. Second, that it lacks robust and consistent testbeds and benchmarks. The first of these criticisms is difficult to dismiss entirely due to the Inherent degree of psychological suhjectiveness associated with the task of deciding on the relevance of a given document (which characterizes information, as opposed to data, retrieval). Thus, at least for now, research in information retrieval will have to proceed without a solid formal underpinning. The second of these criticisms, however, can be acted upon. For three decades, experimentation in information retrieval was based on relatively small test collections which did not reflect the main issues present in a large bibliographical environment. Further, comparisons between various retrieval systems were difficult to make because distinct groups conducted experiments focused on distinct aspects of retrieval (even when the same test collection was used) and there were no widely accepted benchmarks. REFERENCE COLLECTIONS        85 In the early 1990s, a reaction to this state of disarray was initiated under the leadership of Donna Harman at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in Maryland. Such an effort consisted of promoting a yearly conference, named TREC for Text REtrieval Conference, dedicated to experimentation with a large test collection comprising over a million documents. For each TREC conference, a set of reference experiments is designed. The research groups which participate in the conference use these reference experiments for comparing their retrieval systems. A clear statement of the purpose of the TREC conferences can be found in the NIST TREC Web site [768] and reads as follows. The TREC conference series is co-sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Information Technology Office of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as part of the TIPSTER Text Program. The goal of the conference series is to encourage research in information retrieval from large text applications by providing a large test collection, uniform scoring procedures, and a forum for organizations interested in comparing their results. Attendance at TREC conferences is restricted to those researchers and developers who have performed the TREC retrieval tasks and to selected government personnel from sponsoring agencies. Participants in a TREC conference employ a wide variety of retrieval techniques, including methods using automatic thesauri, sophisticated term weighting, natural language techniques, relevance feedback, and advanced pattern matching. Each system works with the same test collection that consists of about 2 gigabytes of text (over 1 million documents) and a given set of information needs called "topics.' Results are run through a common evaluation package so that groups can compare the effectiveness of different techniques and can determine how differences between systems affect performance. Since the collection was built under the TIPSTER program, it is frequently referred to as the TIPSTER or the TIPSTER/TREC test collection.    Here, however, for simplicity we refer to it as the TREC collection. The first TREC conference was held at NIST in November 1992, while the second TREC conference occurred in August 1993. In November 1997, the sixth TREC conference was held (also at NIST) and counted the following participating organizations (extracted from [794]): Apple Computer                                      City Univ., London ATT Labs Research                               CLARITECH Corporation Australian National Univ.

In the following, we briefly discuss the TREC document collection and the (benchmark) tasks at the TREC conferences. As with most test collections, the TREC collection is composed of three parts: the documents, the example information requests (called topics in the TREC nomenclature), and a set of relevant documents for each example information request. Further, the TREC conferences also include a set of tasks to be used as a benchmark. The Document Collection The TREC collection has been growing steadily over the years. At TREC-3, the collection size was roughly 2 gigabytes while at TREC-6 it had gone up to roughly 5.8 gigabytes. In the beginning, copyright restrictions prevented free distribution of the collection and, as a result, the distribution CD-ROM disks had to be bought. In 1998, however, an arrangement was made which allows free access to the documents used in the most recent TREC conferences. As a result, TREC disk 4 and TREC disk 5 are now available from NIST at a small fee (US$200 in 1998) to cover distribution costs. Information on how to obtain the collection (which comes with the disks) and the topics with their relevant document sets (which have to be retrieved through the network) can be obtained directly from the NIST TREC Web site [768]. The TREC collection is distributed in six CD-ROM disks of roughly 1 gigabyte of compressed text each- The documents come from the following sources: WSJ        -?

Stopwords are not removed and no stemming is performed (see Chapter 7 for details on stemming). tagged with SGML (see Chapter 6) to allow easy parsing (which implies simple coding for the groups participating at TREC conferences). Major structures such as a field for the document number (identified by lt;DOCNOgt;) and a field for the document text (identified by lt;TEXTgt;) are common to all documents. Minor structures might be different across subcollections to preserve parts of the structure in the original document. This has been the philosophy for formatting decisions at NIST: preserve as much of the original structure as possible while providing a common framework which allows simple decoding of the data. An example of a TREC document is the document numbered 880406-0090 RETRIEVAL EVALUATION lt;docgt; lt;docnogt; WSJ880406-0090 lt;/docnogt; lt;hlgt; ATT Unveils Services to Upgrade Phone Networks Under Global Plan lt;/hlgt; lt;authorgt; Janet Guyon (WSJ Staff) lt;/authorgt; lt; dateline gt; New York lt;/dateline gt; lt;textgt; American Telephone ; Telegraph Co. introduced the first of a new generation of phone services with broad ... lt;/textgt; lt;/docgt; Figure 3.7   TREC document numbered WSJ880406-0090. in the Wall Street Journal subcollection which is shown in Figure 3.7 (extracted from [342]). Further details on the TREC document collection can be obtained from [794, 768]. The Example Information Requests (Topics) The TREC collection includes a set of example information requests which can be used for testing a new ranking algorithm. Each request is a description of an information need in natural language. In the TREC nomenclature, each test information request is referred to as a topic. An example of an information request in TREC is the topic numbered 168 (prepared for the TREC-3 conference) which is illustrated in Figure 3.8 (extracted from [342]). The task of converting an information request (topic) into a system query (i.e., a set of index terms, a Boolean expression, a fuzzy expression, etc.) must be done by the system itself and is considered to be an integral part of the evaluation procedure. The number of topics prepared for the first six TREC conferences goes up to 350. The topics numbered 1 to 150 were prepared for use with the TREC-1 and TREC-2 conferences. They were written by people who were experienced users of real systems and represented long-standing information needs. The topics numbered 151 to 200 were prepared for use with the TREC-3 conference, are shorter, and have a simpler structure which includes only three subfields (named Title, Description, and Narrative as illustrated in the topic 168 above). The topics numbered 201 to 250 were prepared for use with the TREC-4 conference and are even shorter. At the TREC-5 (which included topics 251-300) and TREC-6 (which included topics 301-350) conferences, the topics were prepared with a composition similar to the topics in TREC-3 (i.e., they were expanded with respect to the topics in TREC-4 which were considered to be too short). REFERENCE COLLECTIONS        89 lt;topgt; lt;numgt; Number: 168 lt;titlegt; Topic: Financing AMTRAK lt;descgt; Description: A document will address the role of the Federal Government in financing the operation of the National Railroad Transportation Corporation (AMTRAK). lt;narrgt; Narrative: A relevant document must provide information on the government's responsibility to make AMTRAK an economically viable entity. It could also discuss the privatization of AMTRAK as an alternative to continuing government subsidies. Documents comparing government subsidies given to air and bus transportation with those provided to AMTRAK would also be relevant. lt;/topgt; Figure 3.8    Topic numbered 168 in the TREC collection. The Relevant Documents for Each Example Information Request At the TREC conferences, the set of relevant documents for each example information request (topic) is obtained from a pool of possible relevant documents. This pool is created by taking the top K documents (usually, K = 100) in the rankings generated by the various participating retrieval systems. The documents in the pool are then shown to human assessors who ultimately decide on the relevance of each document. This technique for assessing relevance is called the pooling method [794] and is based on two assumptions. First, that the vast majority of the relevant documents is collected in the assembled pool. Second, that the documents which are not in the pool can be considered to be not relevant. Both assumptions have been verified to be accurate in tests done at the TREC conferences. A detailed description of these relevance assessments can be found in [342, 794]. The (Benchmark) Tasks at the TREC Conferences The TREC conferences include two main information retrieval tasks [342]. In the first, called ad hoc task, a set of new (conventional) requests are run against a fixed document database. This is the situation which normally occurs in a library where a user is asking new queries against a set of static documents. In the second, called routing task, a set of fixed requests are run against a database whose documents are continually changing. This is like a filtering task in which the same questions are always being asked against a set of dynamic documents (for instance, news clipping services). Unlike a pure filtering task, however, the retrieved documents must be ranked. 90        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION For the ad hoc task, the participant systems receive the test information requests and execute them on a pre-specified document collection. For the routing task, the participant systems receive the test information requests and two distinct document collections. The first collection is used for training and allows the tuning of the retrieval algorithm. The second collection is used for testing the tuned retrieval algorithm. Starting at the TREC-4 conference, new secondary tasks, besides the ad hoc and routing tasks, were introduced with the purpose of allowing more specific comparisons among the various systems. At TREC-6, eight (specific) secondary tasks were added in as follows. ª Chinese Ad hoc task in which both the documents and the topics are in Chinese. ï  Filtering Routing task in which the retrieval algorithm has only to decide whether a new incoming document is relevant (in which case it is taken) or not (in which case it is discarded). No ranking of the documents taken needs to be provided. The test data (incoming documents) is processed in time-stamp order. ï  Interactive Task in which a human searcher interacts with the retrieval system to determine the relevant documents. Documents are ruled relevant or not relevant (i.e., no ranking is provided). ï  NLP Task aimed at verifying whether retrieval algorithms based on natural language processing offer advantages when compared to the more traditional retrieval algorithms based on index terms. ï  Cross languages Ad hoc task in wrhich the documents are in one language but the topics are in a different language. ï  High precision Task in which the user of a retrieval system is asked to retrieve ten documents that answer a given (and previously unknown) information request within five minutes (wall clock time). ï  Spoken document retrieval Task in which the documents are written transcripts of radio broadcast news shows. Intended to stimulate research on retrieval techniques for spoken documents. ï  Very large corpus Ad hoc task in which the retrieval systems have to deal with collections of size 20 gigabytes (7.5 million documents). For TREC-7, the NLP and the Chinese secondary tasks were discontinued. Additionally, the routing task was retired as a main task because there is a consensus that the filtering task is a more realistic type of routing task. TREC-7 also included a new task called Query Task in which several distinct query versions were created for each example information request [794]. The main goal of this task is to allow investigation of query-dependent retrieval strategies, a well known problem with the TREC collection due to the sparsity of the given information requests (which present very little overlap) used in past TREC conferences. REFERENCE COLLECTIONS        91 Besides providing detailed descriptions of the tasks to be executed, the TREC conferences also make a clear distinction between two basic techniques for transforming the information requests (which are in natural language) into query statements (which might be in vector form, in Boolean form, etc.). In the TREC-6 conference, the allowable query construction methods were divided into automatic methods, in which the queries were derived completely automatically from the test information requests, and manual methods, in which the queries were derived using any means other than the fully automatic method [794]. Evaluation Measures at the TREC Conferences At the TREC conferences, four basic types of evaluation measures are used: summary table statistics, recall-precision averages, document level averages, and average precision histograms. Briefly, these measures can be described as follows (see further details on these measures in Section 3.2). ï  Summary table statistics Consists of a table which summarizes statistics relative to a given task. The statistics included are: the number of topics (information requests) used in the task, the number of documents retrieved over all topics, the number of relevant documents which were effectively retrieved for all topics, and the number of relevant documents which could have been retrieved for all topics. ï  Recall-precision averages Consists of a table or graph with average precision (over all topics) at 11 standard recall levels.   Since the recall levels of the individual queries are seldom equal to the standard recall levels, interpolation is used to define the precision at the standard recall levels.   Further, a non-interpolated average precision over seen relevant documents (and over all topics) might be included. ï  Document level averages In this case, average precision (over all topics) is computed at specified document cutoff values (instead of standard recall levels).   For instance, the average precision might be computed when 5, 10, 20, 100 relevant documents have been seen.   Further, the average R-precision value (over all queries) might also be provided. ï  Average precision histogram Consists of a graph which includes a single measure for each separate topic. This measure (for a topic ti) is given, for instance, by the difference between the R-precision (for topic tz) for a target retrieval algorithm and the average R-precision (for topic t%) computed from the results of all participating retrieval systems.
