 Discrimination and/or representation  There are two conflicting ways of looking at the problem of characterising documents for retrieval. One is to characterise a document through a representation of its contents, regardless of the way in which other documents may be described, this might be called representation without discrimination. The other way is to insist that in characterising a document one is discriminating it from all, or potentially all, other documents in the collection, this we might call discrimination without representation. Naturally, neither of these extreme positions is assumed in practice, although identifying the two is useful when thinking about the problem of characterisation.  In practice, one seeks some sort of optimal trade-off between representation and discrimination. Traditionally this has been attempted through balancing indexing exhaustively against specificity. Most automatic methods of indexing can be seen to be a mix of representation versus discrimination. In the simple case of removing high frequency words by means of a 'stop' word list we are attempting to increase the level of discrimination between document. Salton's methods based on the discrimination value attempts the same thing. However, it should be clear that when removing possible index terms there must come a stage when the remaining ones cannot adequately represent the contents of documents any more. Bookstein-Swanson-Harter's formal model can be looked upon as one in which the importance of a term in representing the contents of a document is balanced against its importance as a discriminator. They, in fact, attempt to attach a cost function to the trade-ff between the two.  The emphasis on representation leads to what one might call a document-orientation: that is, a total preoccupation with modelling what the document is about. This approach will tend to shade into work on artificial intelligence, particularly of the kind concerned with constructing computer models of the contents of any given piece of natural language text. The relevance of this work in AI, as well as other work, has been conveniently summarised by Smith[36].  This point of view is also adopted by those concerned with defining a concept of 'information', they assume that once this notion is properly explicated a document can be represented by the 'information' it contains[37].  The emphasis on discrimination leads to a query-orientation. This way of looking at things presupposes that one can predict the population of queries likely to be submitted to the IR system. In the light of data about this population of queries, one can then try and characterise documents in the optimal fashion. Recent work attempting to formalise this approach in terms of utility theory has been done by Maron and Cooper[38, 39], although it is difficult to see at this stage how it might be automated.
