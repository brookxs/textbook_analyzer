 11.1    Introduction The need for an integrated management for multimedia data is rapidly growing in several application environments such as offices, CAD/CAM applications, and medical applications. For this reason, multimedia information systems are widely recognized to be one of the most promising fields in the area of information management. The most important characteristic of a multimedia information system is the variety of data it must be able to support. Multimedia systems must have the capability to store, retrieve, transport, and present data with very heterogeneous characteristics such as text, images (both still and moving), graphs, and sound. For this reason, the development of a multimedia system is considerably more complex than a traditional information system. Conventional systems only deal with simple data types, such as strings or integers. On the contrary, the underlying data model, the query language, and the access and storage mechanisms of a multimedia system must be able to support objects with a very complex structure. The need then arises for developing Multimedia Information Retrieval (Multimedia IB. for short) systems specifically for handling multimedia data. Traditional IR systems (see Chapter 2) only deal with textual unstructured data; therefore, they are unable to support the mix of structured and unstructured data, and different kinds of media, typical of a Multimedia IR system. For instance, a traditional IR system does not support metadata information such as that provided by database schema, which is a fundamental component in a database management system (DBMS). On the other hand, Multimedia IR systems require some form of database schema because several multimedia applications need to structure their data at least partially. However, the notion of schema may need to be weakened with respect to the traditional notion to ensure a higher degree of flexibility in structuring data.   Moreover, 325 326        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES a Multimedia IR system requires handling metadata which is crucial for data retrieval, whereas traditional IR systems do not have such requirement. The architecture of a Multimedia IR system depends on two main factors: first, the peculiar characteristics of multimedia data, and second, the kinds of operations to be performed on such data. In what follows, we briefly deal with both these aspects. Data Modeling A Multimedia IR system should be able to represent and store multimedia objects in a way that ensures their fast retrieval. The system should be therefore able to deal with different kinds of media and with semi-structured data, i.e., data whose structure may not match, or only partially match, the structure prescribed by the data schema. In order to represent semi-structured data, the system must typically extract some features from the multimedia objects. A related issue is how these features are extracted and efficiently maintained by the system. Data Retrieval The main goal of a Multimedia IR system is to efficiently perform retrieval based on user requests, exploiting not only data attributes, as in traditional DBMSs, but also the content of multimedia objects. This poses several interesting challenges, due to the heterogeneity of data, the fuzziness of information, the loss of information in the creation of indexes, and the need of an interactive refinement of the query result. Data retrieval relies on the following basic steps: (1)   Query specification.   In this step, the user specifies the request.   The query interface should allow the user to express fuzzy predicates for proximity searches (for example, "Find all images similar to a car"), content-based predicates (for example, 'Find multimedia objects containing an apple'), conventional predicates on the object attributes (for example, conditions on the attribute 'color of an image, such as 'Find all red images"), and structural predicates (for example, vFind ail multimedia objects containing a video clip'). (2)  Query processing and optimization. Similarly to traditional systems, the query is parsed and compiled into an internal form. In generating this internal representation, the query is also optimized, choosing the best evaluation plan. Note that, due to the presence of fuzzy terms, content-based predicates, and structural predicates, query processing is a very complex activity. A great amount of work has been done on query processing both in traditional [402] and spatial databases [247, 82, 118, 361, 623].  However, little work lias been done on query processing strategies for multimedia databases. The main problem is the heterogeneity of data: different query processing strategies, one for each data type, should be combined together in some wav. INTRODUCTION        327 (3)  Query answer. The retrieved objects are returned to the user in decreasing order of relevance. Relevance is measured as a distance function from the query object to the stored ones. (4)  Query iteration. In traditional DBMSs, the query process ends when the system returns the answer to the user.  In a Multimedia IR system, due to the inevitable lack of precision in the user request, the query execution is iterated until the user is satisfied.   At each iteration the user supplies the system with additional information by which the request is refined, reducing or increasing the number of returned answers. From the previous discussion it follows that a Multimedia IR system differs from a traditional IR system in two main aspects. First, the structure of multimedia objects is more complex than the structure of typical textual data, handled by traditional IR systems. This complexity requires the integration of traditional IR technology with the technology of multimedia database management systems to adequately represent, manage, and store multimedia objects. Note that the use of a DBMS also provides update functionalities and transaction management which are in general not covered by typical IR systems. Second, object retrieval is mainly based on a similarity approach. Moreover, the objects retrieved by a query are usually returned to the user in a ranked form. These aspects are successfully handled by IR techniques (see Chapter 2). However, IR systems have initially been developed to support libraries of articles, journals, and encyclopedic knowledge bases (see Chapter 2). In those systems, the fundamental unit is the textual document Thus, the techniques developed for traditional IR systems should be extended to deal with documents containing other media. Multimedia IR systems should therefore combine both the DBMS and the IR technology, to integrate the data modeling capabilities of DBMSs with the advanced and similarity-based query capabilities of IR systems. The resulting system will be able to answer attribute-based queries as well as content-based queries. The whole architecture of the resulting system, in particular the query optimizer, must take this aspect into account in order to efficiently support user requests. In this chapter, we discuss modeling and query language issues for multimedia objects, pointing out the differences and the analogies between a traditional IR system and a multimedia one. Problems related to feature extraction and searching are covered by Chapter 12. The first part of the chapter is devoted to the presentation of the most relevant models proposed in the literature for multimedia data, with particular attention to commercial proposals. The second part of the chapter investigates the peculiarities of multimedia query languages with respect to traditional ones. Then, as an example, two different language proposals are presented. Also in this case, we focus on commercial proposals and we discuss how the new standard SQL3 could be iLsed to deal with multimedia data retrieval. 328        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES
