 8.3 Information Visualization Technologies  The theories associated with information visualization are being applied in commercial and experimental systems to determine the best way to improve the user interface, facilitating the localization of information. They have been applied to many different situations and environments (e.g., weather forecasting to architectural design). The ones focused on Information Retrieval Systems are investigating how best to display the results of searches, structured data from DBMSs and the results of link analysis correlating data. The goals for displaying the result from searches fall into two major classes: document clustering and search statement analysis. The goal of document clustering is to present the user with a visual representation of the document space constrained by the search criteria. Within this constrained space there exist clusters of documents defined by the document content. Visualization tools in this area attempt to display the clusters, with an indication of their size and topic, as a basis for users to navigate to items of interest. This is equivalent to searching the index at a library and then pursuing all the books on the different shelf locations that are retrieved by the search. The second goal is to assist the user in understanding why items were retrieved, thereby providing information needed to refine the query. Unlike the traditional Boolean systems where the user can easily correlate the query to the retrieved set of items, modern search algorithms and their associated ranking techniques make it difficult to understand the impacts of the expanded words in the search statement. Visualization techniques approach this problem by displaying the total set of terms, including additional terms from relevance feedback or thesaurus expansion, along with documents retrieved and indicate the importance of the term to the retrieval and ranking process.  Structured databases are important to information retrieval because structured files are the best implementation to hold certain citation and semantic Information Visualization                                                                          209  data that describe documents. Link analysis is also important because it provides aggregate-level information within an information system. Rather than treating each item as independent, link analysis considers information flowing between documents with value in the correlation between multiple documents. For example, a time/event link analysis correlates multiple documents discussing a oil spill caused by a tanker. Even if all of the items retrieved on the topic are relevant, displaying the documents correlated by time may show dependencies of events that are of information importance and are not described in any specific document. This section summarizes some of the major techniques being applied. This can assist in correlating the theory of visual perception to the practice of implementing systems.  One way of organizing information is hierarchical. A tree structure is useful in representing information that ranges over time (e.g., genealogical lineage), constituents of a larger unit (e.g., organization structures, mechanical device definitions) and aggregates from the higher to lower level (e.g., hierarchical clustering of documents). A two-dimensional representation becomes difficult for a user to understand as the hierarchy becomes large. One of the earliest experiments in information visualization was the Information Visualizer developed by XEROX PARC. It incorporates various visualization formats such as DataMap, InfoGrid, ConeTree, and the Perspective wall. The Cone-Tree is a 3-Dimensional representation of data, where one node of the tree is represented at the apex and all the information subordinate to it is arranged in a circular structure at its base. Any child node may also be the parent of another cone. Selecting a particular node, rotates it to the front of the display. Compared to other hierarchical representations (e.g., node and link trees) the cone makes the maximum information available to the user providing a perspective on size of each of the subtrees (Gershon-95a, Robertson-93). An example of a Cone-Tree is shown in Figure 8.4. The squares at the leaf nodes in tree are the actual documents. Higher level nodes can be considered centroids representing the semantic of the child nodes. Where the database is large, the boxes may represent a cluster of related items versus a single item. These clusters could be expanded to lower levels of the tree. The perspective wall divides the information into three visual areas with the area being focused on in the front and other areas out of focus to each side (see Figure 8.5). This allows the user to keep all of the information in perspective while focusing on a perticular area.  Another technique used in display of hierarchical information is tree maps (Johnson-91). This technique makes maximum use of the display screen space by using rectangular boxes that are recursively subdivided based upon parent-child relationships between the data. A particular information work space focused on articles on computers may appear as shown in Figure 8.6. The size of the boxes can represent the number of items on a particular topic. The location of the boxes can indicate a relationship between the topics. In Figure 8.6, the CPU, OS, Memory, and Network management articles are all related to a general category of computer operating systems versus computer applications which are shown in the rest of the figure. 210  Chapter 8  ?

Both the Vineta and Bead systems display clustering patterns using a three-dimensional scatterplot (Krohn95, Chalmers-92 respectively). Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory correlates documents and performs multidimensional scaling to plot each as a point in Euclidean vector space. The difficulty of representing all of the axis is overcome by projecting the space onto a plane and using elevation to indicate the frequency of occurrence and importance of a theme (concept) creating a semantic landscape (Wise-95 Card-96). The detailed relationships between items and their composite themes can be seen by the valleys, cliffs and ranges shown on the terrain map. One way of overcoming the multidimensional space representation in a hierarchical environment is to create embedded coordinate spaces. In this technique the larger coordinate space is redefined with coordinates inside of other coordinates. Thus a six-dimensional coordinate space may have three of the coordinates defined as a subspace within the other three coordinate spaces. This has been called Feiner's "worlds within worlds" approach (Feiner-90). Other techniques suggested to solve this representation problem can be found in semantic regions suggested by Kohonen, linked trees or graphs in the Narcissus system, or a non-Euclidean landscape suggested by Lamping and Rao (Munzner-95, Lin-91 and Lin-92, Hendley-95, Lamping-95 respectively). When searches are used to define the user's infospace of interest and provide additional focusing of semantic interest, the "information crystal" (similar to a VENN diagram) assists the user in detecting patterns of term relationships in the constrained Hit file (Spoerri-93). The CyberWorld system constrains its clustering visualization to a threedimensional sphere (Hemmje-94). Another clustering system that uses statistical information for a small number of items (50 - 120) to show term relationships via spatial positioning is the VIBE system (OIsen-93). The VIBE system allows users to associate query terms with different locations in the visual display. Documents are distributed to show their relevance to the different terms.   Lin has taken the 212  Chapter 8  self-organization concept further by using Kohonen's algorithm to automatically determine a table of contents (TOC) and display the results in a map display (Lin96).  The goal of many visualization techniques is to show the semantic relationships between individual items to assist the user in locating those groups of items of interest. Another objective of visualization is in assisting the users in refining their search statements. It is difficult for users in systems using similarity measures to determine what are the primary causes for the selection and ranking of items in a Hit file. The automatic expansion of terms and intricacies of the similarity algorithms can make it difficult to determine the effects that the various words in the search statement are having on creating the Hit file. Visualization tools need to assist the user in understanding the effects of his search statement even to the level of identifying important terms that are not contributing to the  File     Edit    Query  Edit     Results  New Ouªry[ [  Query History:                     Do Search 1  CM    Found    Query-Short form  ¶¶]['-.......""ffl'oó 2         100 T.docuaent retrieval ´     Authors: Qu´ry#3                   f  Sal ton ti;  Word* In Trtte:   l^ctoc docu processing ¶ent text                        B i rotrtaval                        i    ;  Content Words   1   Bast 50 Item* Found  Find Icon     [           Icon Label: Relevance Rank *l                      Icon Size:  Icon Color.

One solution is a graphical display of the characteristics of the  retrieved items which contributed to their selection.    This is effected in the Envision system when index terms are selected as an axis.  The Envision system not only displays the relevance rank and estimated relevance of each item found by a query, but also simultaneously presents other  query information.   The design is intentionally graphical and simple using twoInformation Visualization  213  dimensional visualization. This allows a larger variety of user computer platforms to have access to their system (Nowell-96). Figure 8.7 shows Envision's three interactive windows to display search results: Query window, Graphic View window, and Item Summary window. The Query window provides an editable version of the query. The Item Summary window provides bibliographic citation information on items selected in the Graphic View window. The Graphic View window is similar to scatterplot graphs. Each item in the Hit file is represented by an icon in the window. Selecting an item in the window provides bibliographic information on the same display. Circles represent single items with the relevance weights displayed below them. Ellipses represent clusters of multiple items that are located at the same point in the scatterplot with the number of items in the  *    ||f|  affecr  llillfll It!  construct*           li*BlillillH  project*  i ll   II I      I       I I    I.

In this example, estimated relevance is on the X-axis and author's name is on the Y-axis. This type of interface provides a  very user friendly environment but encounters problems when the number of relevant items and entries for an axis becomes very large. Envision plans to address this issue by a "zoom" feature that will allow seeing larger areas of the scatterplot at lesser detail. 214  Chapter 8  A similar technique is used by Veerasamy and Belkin (Veerasamy-96). They use a series of vertical columns of bars. The columns of bars represent documents, and the rows represent index terms. The height of the bar corresponds to the weight of the corresponding term (row) in the corresponding item (column). In addition to the query terms, the system shows the additional words added to the system by relevance feedback. Figure 8.8 provides an example for a search statement of "How affirmative action affected the construction industry." This approach quickly allows a user to determine which terms had the most effect on retrieving a specific item (i.e. by scanning down the column). It also allows the user to determine how the various terms contributed to the retrieval process (i.e. by scanning a row). This latter process is very important because it allows a user to determine if what he considers to be an important search term is not contributing strongly or not found at all in the items being retrieved. It also shows search terms that are causing items to be retrieved allowing their removal or reduction in query weight if they are causing false hits. In the Boolean environment this function was accomplished by vocabulary browsing (see Chapter 2) that allows for a user to see the number of items a particular term is in prior to including it in a search.

Their system is designed to augment the RetrievalWare search product. They display the query results as a histogram with the items as rows and each term's contribution to the selection indicated by the width of a tile bar on the row (see Figure 8.9). DCARS provides a friendly user interface that indicates why a particular item was found, but it is much harder to use the information in determining how to modiiy search statements to improve them.  Another representation that is widely used for both hierarchical and network related information is the "cityscape" which uses the metaphor of movement within a city. In lieu of using hills, as in the terrain approach, skyscrapers represent the theme (concept) area as shown in Figure 8.10. This is similar to extending bar charts to three dimensions. Buildings can be connected by lines which can vary in representation to describe interrelationships between themes. Colors or fill designs can be used for the visualization presenting another layer of information (e.g., the building having the same color may be members of a higher concept). Movement within the cityscape (or terrain) of the viewer perspective allows zooming in on specific information areas that will bring into view additional structures that might have been hidden by the previous viewpoint. 216                                                                                               Chapter 8  An easily understood metaphor for users is that of a library. Information content can be represented as areas within a library that the user can navigate through. Once in a particular "information room" the user can view the virtual "books" available within that space as if they are sitting on a bookshelf. Once the book is accessed, the user can scan a group of related items with each item represented as a page within the book. The user can fan the pages out. This is exemplified by the WebBook (Card-96a).  Correlating items or words within items was described in detail in Chapter 6 to cluster items or create statistical thesauri. When the complete term relationship method is used, a very large matrix is created. Each cell in the matrix defines the similarity between two terms (or items). Meaningful display of the table is not possible in table form. Mitre Corporation has developed an interface that displays the complete matrix using clusters of dots to represent correlation's. Once the user zooms in on a particular area of correlation, the specific words become visible along with clusters showing their correlation to other words (Gershon-96). Anther approach to representing thesaurus and contents is being tested by Zizi and Pediotakis (Zizi-96). They build a thesaurus automatically from the abstracts of the items extracting both single and two-word expressions. They create a presentation view and a document view. They divide the display space, based upon thesaurus classes, into regions. Each area is sized proportionally to the importance of the class for the collection. Once the presentation view is defined, the document view is created. The documents are placed on ellipses corresponding to the presentation view, and the weight of the document is reflected by the radius of the ellipse.  Another task in information systems is the visualization of specific text within an item versus between items. In some situations, items are allowed to change over time via editing. Thus, there is both the static representation and a time varying representation. Text changing representations are very important when the text being represented is a software program of millions of lines of code. ATT Bell laboratories created the SeeSoft system which uses columns and color codes to show when different lines of code have been changed. This technique was used as a basis for a similar code visualization tool, DEC FUSE/SoftVis (Zaremba95). They created small pictures of files that represent the code in the file with the size of the picture scaled to the number of lines of code in the file. Color coding indicates different characteristics of the code (e.g., green is comments). A user can quickly see the relative structure of all of the code files composing a system along with the complexity of each of the modules. The TileBars tool from Xerox PARC provides the user with a visualization of the distribution of query terms within each item in a Hit file. Using this tool, the user can quickly locate the section of the item that is most likely to be of interest.  Although information retrieval focuses on the unstructured text, another aspect of informational items is the citation data and structured aspects of indexing items. This data structure can be manipulated via structured databases as well as traditional information systems. Visualization tools have also been constructed for databases.   The first visualization tool was the Query By Example user interface Information Visualization                                                                         217  developed by IBM (Zloof-75). The interface presented the user with twodimensional tables on the display screen and based upon the user is defining values of interest on the tables, the system would complete the search. Current visual query languages use visual representations of the database structure and contents (Catarci-96). The Information Visualization and Exploration Environment (IVEE) makes use of the three dimensional representation of the structured database as constrained by the user's search statement (Ahlberg-95). In one representation a three-dimensional box represents a larger space and smaller boxes within the space represent realizations of specific values (e.g., the box represents a department and the smaller boxes represent employees in the department). It has additional visualizations of data as maps and starfields. The user is provided with sliders and toggles to manipulate the search. Another specialized tool for displaying homes for sale in a database is the HomeFinder system. It presents a starfield display of homes for sale and overlays it with a city map showing the geographic location for each icon that represents a home (Ahlberg-94).  When hyperlinks are used as the information retrieval basis for locating relevant items, the user encounters orientation problems associated with the path the user followed to get to the current location. This is effect getting "lost in cyberspace." One solution is providing the user with a view of the information space. The user can user a pointing device to indicate the item the user would like to navigate to. MITRE Corporation has developed a tool used with web browsers that enables a user to see a tree structure visual representation of the information space they have navigated through (Gershon-96).  Another area in information visualization is the representation of pattern and linkage analysis. A system that incorporates many information visualization techniques including those used to represent linkage analysis is the Pathfinder Project sponsored by the Army (Rose-96). It contains the Document Browser, CAMEO, Counts, CrossField Matrix, OILSTOCK and SPIRE tools. The Document Browser uses different colors and their density for words in the text of items to indicate the relative importance of the item to their profile of interest. CAMEO models an analytic process by creating nodes and links to represent a problem. Queries are associated with the nodes. The color of the nodes change based on how well the found items satisfy the query. Counts uses statistical information on words and phrases and plots them over time. Time is used as a parameter to show trends in development of events. The display uses a threedimensional cityscape representation of the data. The Cross Field Matrix creates a two-dimensional matrix of two fields in a dataset. Selected values in each of the datasets will be in each row and column for the two fields. Colors are used to represent time span. For example, countries could be on one axis and products on the other axis. The colors would indicate how long the country has been producing a particular product. Intersection can be used to access all the items that supported the particular product in a particular country. OILSTOCK allows the placement of data on a geographic mapping tool. The relationship of data to maps is a different use of information visualization. Discussion of this area is left to the many sources on  Geographic  Information   Systems  (GIS).     The  SPIRE  tool   is  a  type of 218                                                                                                Chapter 8  scattergraph of information. Items are clustered and displayed in a star chart configuration. Distance between two points is indicative of their similarity based upon concurrence of terms.
