 Classification methods  Let me start with a description of the kind of data for which classification methods are appropriate. The data consists of objects and their corresponding descriptions. The objects may be documents, keywords, hand written characters, or species (in the last case the objects themselves are classes as opposed to individuals). The descriptors come under various names depending on their structure:  (1) multi-state attributes (e.g. colour)  (2) binary-state (e.g. keywords)  (3) numerical (e.g. hardness scale, or weighted keywords)  (4) probability distributions.  The fourth category of descriptors is applicable when the objects are classes. For example, the leaf width of a species of plants may be described by a normal distribution of a certain mean and variance. It is in an attempt to summarise and simplify this kind of data that classification methods are used.  Some excellent surveys of classification methods now exist, to name but a few, Ball[21], Cormack[14] and Dorofeyuk[22]. In fact, methods of classification are now so numerous, that Good[23] has found it necessary to give a classification of classification.  Sparck Jones[24]has provided a very clear intuitive break down of classification methods in terms of some general characteristics of the resulting classificatory system. In what follows the primitive notion of 'property' will mean feature of an object. I quote:  (1) Relation between properties and classes  (a) monothetic  (b) polythetic  (2) Relation between objects and classes  (a) exclusive  (b) overlapping  (3) Relation between classes and classes  (a) ordered  (b) unordered  The first category has been explored thoroughly by numerical taxonomists. An early statement of the distinction between monothetic and polythetic is given by Beckner[25]: 'A class is ordinarily defined by reference to a set of properties which are both necessary and sufficient (by stipulation) for membership in the class. It is possible, however, to define a group K in terms of a set G of properties f1, f2, . . . , fn in a different manner. Suppose we have an aggregate of individuals (we shall not yet call them a class) such that  (1) each one possesses a large (but unspecified) number of the properties in G;  (2) each f in G is possessed by large number of these individuals; and  (3) no f in G is possessed by every individual in the aggregate.'  The first sentence of Beckner's statement refers to the classical Aristotelian definition of a class, which is now termed monothetic. The second part defines polythetic.  To illustrate the basic distinction consider the following example (Figure 3.1) of 8 individuals (1-8) and 8 properties (A-H). The possession of a property is indicated by a plus sign. The individuals 1-4 constitute a polythetic group each individual possessing three out of four of the properties A,B,C,D. The other 4 individuals can be split into two monothetic classes {5,6} and {7,8}. The distinction between monothetic and polythetic is a particularly easy one to make providing the properties are of a simple kind, e.g. binary-state attributes. When the properties are more complex the definitions are rather more difficult to apply, and in any case are rather arbitrary.  The distinction between overlapping and exclusive is important both from a theoretical and practical point of view. Many classification methods can be viewed as data-simplification methods. In the process of classification information is discarded so that the members of one class are indistinguishable. It is in an attempt to minimise the amount of information thrown away, or to put it differently, to have a classification which is in some sense 'closest' to the original data, that overlapping classes are allowed. Unfortunately this plays havoc with the efficiency of implementation for a particular application. A compromise can be adopted in which the classification methods generates overlapping classes in the first instance and is finally 'tidied up' to give exclusive classes.  An example of an ordered classification is a hierarchy. The classes are ordered by inclusion, e.g. the classes at one level are nested in the classes at the next level. To give a simple example of unordered classification is more difficult. Unordered classes generally crop up in automatic thesaurus construction. The classes sought for a thesaurus are those which satisfy certain homogeneity and isolation conditions but in general cannot be simply related to each other. (See for example the use and definition of clumps in Needham[26].) For certain applications ordering is irrelevant, whereas for others such as document clustering it is of vital importance. The ordering enables efficient search strategies to be devised.  The discussion about classification has been purposely vague up to this point. Although the break down scheme discussed gives some insight into classification method. Like all categorisations it isolates some ideal types; but any particular instance will often fall between categories or be a member of a large proportion of categories.  Let me know be more specific about current (and past) approaches to classification, particularly in the context of information retrieval.
