 272      FINDING OUT ABOUT  7.43 Priors  When we are attempting to estimate 0ckgt; the most common prior applied within text classification is the m-estimate [Mitchell, 1997, p. 179]. This corresponds to pretending that the actual training data in T are augmented by NKw = \Vocab\ pseudo-trials uniformly distributed across all the keywords in Vocab. Operationally, this simply means that all keyword counters are "primed" (initialized to) one before real statistics are collected. With the priors specified, we can estimate 9ck under each of the two models discussed in Section 7.4.1.  Recall that the multivariate Bernoulli model associates a single biased coin 0ck with each keyword used by a class. The Bernoulli assumption is then that a document in the class will contain at least one occurrence of the keyword with probability 9ck but also with probability 1 ó 8ck that it will not contain any instances of the keyword. Using a Boolean indicator function Bdk to signal the presence or absence of a keyword in a document and another BC(i to signal whether the document is classified with respect to class cf  ^       1 + £ BdkBdc  Note that in this statistic the "nonoccurrence" of keywords not present in the document also affects our estimate. This somewhat odd Mark of Zero [Lewis et al., 1996] should make us feel less sanguine about what is captured by any Bernoulli model.  The multinomial alternatives (assuming the same priors as before) for these estimates are:  _            1 + £ fcdBdc  Ock = KJjr    JeJ, Ñ  ,   p                      (7.17)  NKw+ £ £ fcdBdc kevdeT  Empirically, the multinomial model seems to support better classification performance, especially when larger vocabulary sizes are considered [McCallum and Nigam, 1998].  Bdk = 1 if" A: occurs at least once in d and is zero otherwise; Bcd = liid is classified  as an instance of class c and is zero otherwise.
