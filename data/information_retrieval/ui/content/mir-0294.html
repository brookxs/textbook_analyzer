 15.4.1    Multilingual Documents One social issue with documents relates to culture and language [633]. Whereas there are many causes of the movement toward English as a basis for global DOCUMENT MODELS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND ACCESS        421 scientific and technical interchange, digital librarys may actually lead to an increase in availability of non-English content. Because digital librarys can be constructed for a particular institution or nation, it is likely that the expansion of digital librarys will increase access to documents in a variety of languages. Some of that may occur since many users of information desire it from all appropriate sources, regardless of origin, and so will wish to carry out a parallel (federated) search across a (distributed) multilingual collection. The key aspects of this matter are surveyed in [613]. At the foundation, there are issues of character encoding. Unicode provides a single 16-bit coding scheme suitable for all natural languages [783]. However, a less costly implementation may result from downloading fonts as needed from a special server or gateway, or from a collection of such gateways, one for each special collection [208]. The next crucial problem is searching multilingual collections. The simplest approach is to locate words or phrases in dictionaries and to use the translated terms to search in collections in other languages [387]. However, properly serving many users in many languages calls for more sophisticated processing [612]. It is likely that research in this area will continue to be of great importance to both the IR and digital library communities.
