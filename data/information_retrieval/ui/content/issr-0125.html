 10.6 Summary  This chapter addresses content-based access to multimedia. Multimedia retrieval encompasses a range of media types including text, speech and non-speech audio, and video. This chapter illustrates multiple systems that provide contentbased retrieval of media, some of which have become commercial software. This chapter summarizes, where results have been reported, empirical evaluation of these advances.  Impressive as these initial systems may be, they serve as pathfinders in new subfields of multimedia retrieval research. Many unanswered research questions remain which offer fertile ground for research. For example, imagery retrieval is presently based on shallow image feature analyses (e.g., color, shape, texture) and so integration of these results with those from deeper semantic analysis of text documents remains a challenge. Higher level intentional models of media (e.g., what is the purpose of a clip of non-speech audio or a graphic?) require even more sophisticated analytic methods but promise even deeper representations of media and correspondingly more powerful retrieval. In addition, enhanced interfaces promise to enhance retrieval performance and user satisfaction. Finally, techniques for rapidly creating multimedia corpora so scientists can create machine learned systems as well as develop metrics, measures, and methods for effective 256                                                                                              Chapter 10  community evaluations will remain important for fostering continued progress in the field.
