 5.2.2.4 Discrimination Value  Another approach to creating a weighting algorithm is to base it upon the discrimination value of a term. To achieve the objective of finding relevant items, it is important that the index discriminates among items. The more all items appear the same, the harder it is to identify those that are needed. Salton and Yang (Salton-73) proposed a weighting algorithm that takes into consideration the ability for a search term to discriminate among items. They proposed use of a discrimination value for each term *i":  DISCRIM, = AVESIM, - AVESiM 120                                                                                              Chapter 5  where AVESIM is the average similarity between every item in the database and AVESIM, is the same calculation except that term "i" is removed from all items. There are three possibilities with the DISCRIMi value being positive, close to zero or negative. A positive value indicates that removal of term "i" has increased the similarity between items. In this case, leaving the term in the database assists in discriminating between items and is of value. A value close to zero implies that the term's removal or inclusion does not change the similarity between items. If the value of DISCRIM, is negative, the term's effect on the database is to make the items appear more similar since their average similarity decreased with its removal Once the value of DISCRMj is normalized as a positive number, it can be used in the standard weighting formula as:  Weight* = TFlk * DISCRIMk
