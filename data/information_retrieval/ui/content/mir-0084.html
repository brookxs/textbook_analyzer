 5-2    User Relevance Feedback Relevance feedback is the most popular query reformulation strategy. In a relevance feedback cycle, the user is presented with a list of the retrieved documents and, after examining them, marks those which are relevant. In practice, only the top 10 (or 20) ranked documents need to be examined. The main idea consists of selecting important terms, or expressions, attached to the documents that have been identified as relevant by the user, and of enhancing the importance of these terms in a new query formulation. The expected effect is that the new query will be moved towards the relevant documents and away from the non-relevant ones. Early experiments using the Smart system [695] and later experiments using the probabilistic weighting model [677] have shown good improvements in precision for small test collections when relevance feedback is used. Such improvements come from the use of two basic techniques: query expansion (addition of new terms from relevant documents) and term reweighting (modification of term weights based on the user relevance judgement). Relevance feedback presents the following main advantages over other query reformulation strategies: (a) it shields the user from the details of the query reformulation process because all the user has to provide is a relevance judgement on documents; (b) it breaks down the whole searching task into a sequence of small steps which are easier to grasp; and (c) it provides a controlled process designed to emphasize some terms (relevant ones) and de-emphasize others (non-relevant ones). In the following three subsections, we discuss the usage of user relevance feedback to (a) expand queries with the vector model, (b) reweight query terms with the probabilistic model, and (c) reweight query terms with a variant of the probabilistic model.
