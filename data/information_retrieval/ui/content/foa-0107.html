 5.5.5 Linear Discriminators  The retrieval problem is made simpler by noting that all we really need is a simple discrimination threshold, above which the evidence for Rel is sufficient that our retrieval system elects to show a user the document as part of a hitlist. We reflect this by making the Ran A: function proportional  to the odds of relevance given the document:  Rank(x)o:      FT     ^n " *!  Assuming the features x,- are stochastically independent is very helpful, but manipulating the product of terms is still awkward. For example, 174      FINDING OUT ABOUT  we might reasonably want to regress (train) the feature variables against known Rel documents to compute weights for their relative contributions [Cooper et al., 1992; Gey, 1994]. While nonlinear regression algorithms (e.g., neural networks) do exist, regression with respect to a linear combination of features is most straightforward.  Logarithmic functions perform just this transformation (i.e., transforming products to sums) and are also guaranteed to be monotonic. Monotonicity guarantees that if a lt; b then log(a) lt; log(b)gt; and the ranking scores we use to order our hitlist will not change the relative order of any two documents on our hitlist. The two steps of  ï  first comparing two probabilities in an Odds ratio and then  ï  taking logarithms to form linear combinations rather than products  arise so frequently that the two operators are often composed and conWeighting           sidered a single LogOdds calculation.^ evidence                   por our discrimination purposes, then, LogOdds will suffice:  LogOdds(Rel\x) = LogOdds(Rel) + J^ loB  f "----~ )  LogOdds(Rel) reflects the prior probability that we are likely to find a relevant document in our corpus, independent of any features of the query/document. This could vary, for example, between very general and very specific queries, but again, it should not alter our ranking of documents pertaining to a particular query. Focusing exclusively on those factors that will be useful in discriminating one document from another, with respect to a particular query, Equation 5.52 simplifies considerably, and we come up with a Rank measure:  Rank(x) =     ]P    a + k                         (5.53)  xt GQCiD  where the weight a associated with each feature  c = log fJlzM                     lSM)  q(l     q) MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS       175  is called the relevance weight (also known as retrieval status value (RSV)) of this feature, and k is the query-invariant constant:  k = LogOdds(Rel) + ]T LllL                 (5.55)  1      q  corresponding to the log of the first two document-insensitive terms of Equation 5.52.
