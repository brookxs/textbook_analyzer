 2.4 Z39.50 and WAIS Standards  There are two potential sources for any standard, those agreed to by an official standards organization and a de facto standard based upon high usage across a large user population. The standards organization most involved in Information Systems standards in the United States is the American National Standards Institute/ National Information Standards Organization (ANSI/NISO) in generating its Z39.50, Information Retrieval Application Service Definition and Protocol Specification. NISO is the only organization accredited by ANSI to approve and maintain standards for information services, libraries and publishers. This standard is one of many standards they generated to support interconnection of computer systems. Its relationship to other standards can be seen in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) basic reference model (ISO 7498). In addition to the formal standard, a second de facto standard is the WAIS standard based upon its usage in the INTERNET.  In addition to standards associated with specific language interfaces of Information Retrieval Systems, there are attempts being made to standardize the architecture of information systems. The largest de facto information system is the Internet and the Internet Engineering Task Force is focusing on how the architecture of the Internet should be modified to allow future scalability and addressability  of items on  the  Internet.     This  architecture  directly  affects Information Retrieval System Capabilities                                                     45  commercial information systems usage on the Internet and the integratability of future research into this environment.  The Z39.50 standard does not specify an implementation, but the capabilities within an application (Application Service) and the protocol used to communicate between applications (Information Retrieval Application Protocol). It is a computer to computer communications standard for database searching and record retrieval. Its objective is to overcome different system incompatibilities associated with multiple database searching (e.g., unique user interfaces, command language, and basic search functions). The first version of Z39.50 was approved in 1992. An international version of Z39.50, called the Search and Retrieve Standard (SR), was approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1991. Z39.50-1995, the latest version of Z39.50, replaces SR as the international information retrieval standard.  The standard describes eight operation types: Init (initialization), Search, Present, Delete, Scan, Sort, Resource-report, and Extended Services. There are five types of queries (Types 0, 1,2, 100, 101, and 102). Type 101 extends previous types allowing for proximity and Type-102 is a Ranked List Query (yet to be defined). The Extended Services include saving query results, queries, and updating the database.  The client is identified as the "Origin" and performs the communications functions relating to initiating a search, translation of the query into a standardized format, sending a query, and requesting return records. The server is identified as the "Target" and interfaces to the database at the remote responding to requests from the Origin (e.g., pass query to database, return records in a standardized format and status). The end user does not have to be aware of the details of the standard since the Origin function performs the mapping from the user's query interface into Z39.50 format. This makes the dissimilarities of different database systems transparent to the user and facilitates issuing one query against multiple databases at different sites returning to the user a single integrated Hit file.  The communications between the Origin and Target utilize a dialogue known as Z39.50 association. Z39.50 not only standardizes the messages to be exchanged between the Origin and Target systems, but also the structure and the semantics of the search query, the sequence of message exchange, and the mechanism for returning records (Turner-95, Kunze-95). The 1992 version of Z39.50 was focused on library functions such as database searching, cataloguing and interlibrary loan (primarily MARC bibliographic record structure). Z39.50 version 3 (in Z39.50-1995) addresses additional functions to support nonbibliographic data such as fiill text documents and images. It also begins to address some of the functions being defined as necessary to information systems such as ranking values. Z39.50-1995 has just been approved by NISO and is published as the new standard (the latest information on Z39.5Q is available on the Worldwide Web at http://ds.internic.net/z3950/z3950.html).  Wide Area Information Service (WAIS) is the de facto standard for many search environments on the INTERNET.      WAIS was developed by a project 46                                                                                                Chapter 2  started in 1989 by three commercial companies (Apple, Thinking Machines, and Dow Jones). The original idea was to create a program that would act as a personal librarian. It would act like a personal agent keeping track of significant amounts of data and filtering it for the information most relevant to the user. The interface concept was user entered natural language statements of topics the user had interest. In addition it provided the capability to communicate to the computer that a particular item was of interest and have the computer automatically find similar items (i.e., relevance feedback). The original corporate interest was in Apple providing the user interface, Thinking Machines providing the processing power, and Dow Jones providing the data.  The developers of WAIS pursued a generalized system of information retrieval that could access data collections all around the world (Hahn-94, Levine94) on the Internet. Like other Internet services, free versions of WAIS were originally provided. Some of the initial products migrated to a commercial company that sells and supports a WAIS system. A free version of WAIS is still available via the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval (CINDIR) called "FreeWAIS."  The original development of WAIS started with the 1988 Z39.50 protocol as a base following the client/server architecture concept. At that time Z39.50 was focused on a bibliographic MARC record structure against structured files. Numerous deficiencies were identified in the Z39.50 protocol forcing the developers of WAIS to vary from the Z39.50 standard (ORION-93). The developers incorporated the information retrieval concepts that allow for ranking, relevance feedback and natural language processing functions that apply to full text searchable databases. Since they were diverging from the standard, they decided to simplify their client server interface. In particular they decided to have a nonMarkovian process. Thus state information is not kept between requests between clients and servers. This is one of the major differences between WAIS and Z39.50 compliant systems.  The availability of FreeWAIS in the public domain made it the method of choice for implementing databases on the INTERNET. The architecture gained significant momentum from the mandate that all U.S. Government Agencies publish their material electronically and make it accessible to the general public. WAIS and the INTERNET became the standard approach for answering the mandate. Additionally, many organizations are using WAIS as the engine to archive and access large amounts of textual information. The appeal for WAIS is that, for public domain software, it represents a well tested and documented product that can be trusted with data. A substantial community continues to test, fix and enhance the basic system. The current trend is away from WAIS and to a standard Internet interface (WEB interface) and using one of the more powerful search systems.  Another activity being driven by the publishing and Digital Libraries efforts is the creation of a unique way of identifying, naming and controlling documents in an information retrieval environment.  It has the same paradigm as Information Retrieval System Capabilities                                                    47  the TIPSTER architecture of separating the indexes and surrogate search structures from storing the actual item. The leader in this effort is the Center for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) that is working with the Department of Defense and also the American Association of Publishers (AAP), focusing on an Internet implementation that allows for control of electronic published and copyright material. The CNRI concept is based upon using a "handle" system where the handle is the unique network identifier of a digital object. The AAP prefers the term Digital Object Identifier over the term handle (CNRI-97). Most computer systems identify an item by the location it is stored (e.g., Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) on the Internet - see Section 4.7 for more detail). From a library and large information system perspective it is far more efficient to refer to items by name rather than location. There is still significant debate over whether the name should be just a unique identifier (e.g., a number) or also have semantic content to the user. The term "handle" refers to this unique name. A Handle server (similar to document manager in TIPSTER) ensures persistence, location independence and multiple instance management. Persistence ensures that the handle is available to locate information potentially past the life of the organization that created the item to identify any locations of the item. Location independence allows for the movement of items with a mechanism for knowing their current location. Multiple instance allows keeping track of the location of duplicates of an item. Inherent in this architecture is a unique "Handle" naming authority(s) and servers to assign names and keep track of locations. This is similar to the Domain Name Servers used in networks, but is designed to handle orders of magnitude more objects in efficient fashion.  In addition to the Handle Server architecture, CNRI is also advocating a communications protocol to retrieve items from existing systems. This protocol call Repository Archive Protocol (RAP) defines the mechanisms for Clients to use the handles to retrieve items. It also includes other administrative functions such as privilege validation. The Handle system is designed to meet the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) requirements for naming Internet objects via Uniform Resource Names to replace URLs as defined in the Internet's RFC-1737 (IETF-96).
