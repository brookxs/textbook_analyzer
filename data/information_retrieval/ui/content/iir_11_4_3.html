    Okapi BM25: a non-binary model The BIM was originally designed for short catalog records and abstracts of fairly consistent length, and it works reasonably in these contexts, but for modern full-text search collections, it seems clear that a model should pay attention to term frequency and document length, as in Chapter 6 . The BM25 weighting scheme , often called Okapi weighting , after the system in which it was first implemented, was developed as a way of building a probabilistic model sensitive to these quantities while not introducing too many additional parameters into the model (Spärck Jones et al., 2000). We will not develop the full theory behind the model here, but just present a series of forms that build up to the standard form now used for document scoring. The simplest score for document is just idf weighting of the query terms present, as in Equation 76: (84)   idf 75    (85)  We can improve on Equation 84 by factoring in the frequency of each term and document length: (86)               If the query is long, then we might also use similar weighting for query terms. This is appropriate if the queries are paragraph long information needs, but unnecessary for short queries. (87)       8.1    If we have relevance judgments available, then we can use the full form of smoothed-rf in place of the approximation introduced in prob-idf: (88)     (89)      11.3.4 Rather than just providing a term weighting method for terms in a user's query, relevance feedback can also involve augmenting the query (automatically or with manual review) with some (say, 10-20) of the top terms in the known-relevant documents as ordered by the relevance factor from Equation 75, and the above formula can then be used with such an augmented query vector . The BM25 term weighting formulas have been used quite widely and quite successfully across a range of collections and search tasks. Especially in the TREC evaluations, they performed well and were widely adopted by many groups. See Spärck Jones et al. (2000) for extensive motivation and discussion of experimental results.
