 2.10.3    The Hypertext Model One fundamental concept related to the task of writing down text is the notion of sequencing. Written text is usually conceived to be read sequentially. The reader should not expect to fully understand the message conveyed by the writer by randomly reading pieces of text here and there. One might rely on the text structure to skip portions of the text but this might result in miscommunication between reader and writer. Thus, a sequenced organizational structure lies underneath most written text. When the reader fails to perceive such a structure and abide by it, he frequently is unable to capture the essence of the writer's message. Sometimes, however, we are looking for information which is subsumed by the whole text but which cannot be easily captured through sequential reading. For instance, while glancing at a book about the history of the wars fought by man, we might be momentarily interested solely in the regional wars in Europe. We know that this information is in the book, but we might have a hard time finding it because the writer did not organize his writings with this purpose (he might have organized the wars chronologically). In such a situation, a different organization of the text is desired. However, there is no point in rewriting the whole text. Thus, the solution is to define a new organizational structure besides the one already in existence. One way to accomplish such a goal is through the design of a hypertext. MODELS FOR BROWSING        67 Hypertext Definition and the Navigational Task A hypertext is a high level interactive navigational structure which allows us to browse text non-sequentially on a computer screen. It consists basically of nodes which are correlated by directed links in a graph structure. To each node is associated a text region which might be a chapter in a book, a section in an article, or a Web page. Two nodes A and B might be connected by a directed link Iab which correlates the texts associated with these two nodes. In this case, the reader might move to the node B while reading the text associated with the node A. In its most conventional form, a hypertext link Iab is attached to a specific string inside the text for node A. Such a string is marked specially (for instance, its characters might appear in a different color or underlined) to indicate the presence of the underlying link. While reading the text, the user might come across a marked string. If the user clicks on that string, the underlying directed link is followed, and a new text region (associated with the node at the destination) is displayed on the screen. The process of navigating the hypertext can be understood as a traversal of a directed graph. The linked nodes of the graph represent text nodes which are semantically related. While traversing this graph the reader visualizes a flow of information which was conceived by the designer of the hypertext. Consider our previous example regarding a book on the wars fought by man. One might design a hypertext composed of two distinct webs (here, a web is simply a connected component formed by a subset of all links in the hypertext). While the first web might be designed to provide access to the local wars fought in Europe in chronological order, the second web might be designed to provide access to the local wars fought by each European country. In this way, the user of this hypertext can access the information according to his particular need. When the hypertext is large, the user might lose track of the organizational structure of the hypertext. The effect is that the user might start to take bad navigational decisions which might sidetrack him from his main goal (which usually consists of finding a piece of information in the hypertext). When this happens, the user is said to be lost in hyperspace [604]. To avoid this problem, it is desirable that the hypertext include a hypertext map which shows where the user is at all times. In its simplest form, this map is a directed graph which displays the current node being visited. Additionally, such a map could include information on the paths the user has traveled so far. This can be used to remind the user of the uselessness of following paths which have been explored already. While navigating a hypertext, the user is restricted to the intended flow of information previously conceived by the hypertext designer. Thus, the task of designing a hypertext should take into account the needs of its potential users. This implies the execution of a requirement analysis phase before starting the actual implementation of the hypertext. Such a requirement analysis is critically important but is frequently overlooked. Furthermore, during the hypertext navigation, the user might find it difficult to orient himself. This difficulty arises even in the presence of a guiding 68        MODELING tool such as the hypertext map discussed above. One possible reason is an excessively complex hypertext organization with too many links which allow the user to travel back and forth. To avoid this problem, the hypertext can have a simpler structure which can be quickly remembered by the user at all times. For instance, the hypertext can be organized hierarchically to facilitate the navigational task. Definition of the structure of the hypertext should be accomplished in a domain modeling phase (done after a requirement analysis phase). Further, after the modeling of the domain, a user interface design should be concluded prior to implementation. Only then, can we say that we have a proper hypertext structure for the application at hand. In the Web, however, pages are usually implemented with no attention paid to requirement analysis, domain modeling, and user interface design. As a result, Web pages are frequently poorly conceived and often fail to provide the user with a proper hypertext structure for assistance with the information seeking task. With large hypertexts, it might be difficult for the user to position himself in the part of the whole graph which is of most interest to him. To facilitate this initial positioning step, a search based on index terms might be used. In [540], Manber discusses the advantages of this approach. Hypertexts provided the basis for the conception and design of the hypertext markup language (HTML) and the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) which originated the World Wide Web (which we simply refer to as the Web). In Chapter 13, we discuss the Web in detail. We briefly discuss some of its features below. About the Web When one talks about the Web, the first concept which comes to mind is that of a hypertext. In fact, we frequently think of the WTeb as a huge distributed hypertext domain. However, the Web is not exactly a proper hypertext because it lacks an underlying data model, it lacks a navigational plan, and it lacks a consistently designed user interface. Each one of the millions of Web page designers devises his own interface with its own peculiar characteristics. Many times we visit a Web site simply looking for a phone number and cannot find it because it is buried in the least expected place of the local hypertext structure. Thus, the Web user has no underlying metaphor to assist him in the search for information of interest. Instead of saying that the Web is a hypertext, we prefer to say that it is a pool of (partially) interconnected webs. Some of these webs might be characterized as a local hypertext (in the sense that they have an underlying structure which enjoys some consistency) but others might be simply a collection of pages designed separately (for instance, the web of a university department whose professors design their own pages). Despite not being exactly a hypertext, the Web has provided us with a new dimension in communication functionality because it is easily accessible world wide at very low cost. And maybe most important, the Web has no control body setting up regulations and censorship rules. As a BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        69 result, for the first time in the history of mankind, any one person can publish his writings through a large medium without being subjected to the filtering of an editorial board. For a more thorough discussion of these and many other issues related to the Web, the user is referred to Chapter 13.
