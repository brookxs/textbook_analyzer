 7.7 Summary  Creating the index to an Information Retrieval System defines the searchable concepts that represent the items received by a system. The user search process is the mechanism that correlates the user's search statement with the index via a similarity function. There are a number of techniques to define the indexes to an item. It is typically more efficient to incur system overhead at index creation time than search time. An item is processed once at index time, but there will be millions of searches against the index. Also, the user is directly affected by the response time of a search but, in general, is not aware of how long it takes from receipt of an item to its being available in the index. The selection and implementation of similarity algorithms for search must be optimized for performance and scaleable to accommodate very large databases.  It is typical during search parsing that the user's initial search statement is expanded via a thesaurus or semantic net to account for vocabulary differences between the user and the authors. But excessive expansion takes significantly more processing and increases the response time due to the number of terms that have to be processed. Most systems have default limits on the number of new terms added to a search statement. Chapter 7 describes some of the basic algorithms that can be used as similarity measures. These algorithms are still in a state of evolution and are continually being modified to improve their performance. The search algorithms in a probabilistic indexing and search system are much more complex than the similarity measures described. For systems based upon natural language processing, once the initial similarity comparisons are completed, there is an additional search processing step to make use of discourse level information, adding additional precision to the final results.  Relevance feedback is an alternative to thesaurus expansion to assist the user in creating a search statement that will return the needed information. Thesaurus and semantic net expansions are dependent upon the user's ability to use the appropriate vocabulary in the search statement that represents the required information. If the user selects poor terms, they will be expanded with many more poor terms. Thesaurus expansion does not introduce new concepts that are relevant to the users information need, it just expands the description of existing concepts. Relevance feedback starts with the text of an item that the user has identified as meeting his information need; incorporating it into a revised search User Search Techniques                                                                             195  statement.     The vocabulary  in  the relevant  item  text  has the potential  for introducing new concepts that better reflect the user's information need along with adding additional terms related to existing search terms and adjusting the weights (importance) of existing terms.  Selective Dissemination of Information search is different from searches against the persistent information database in that it is assumed there is no information from a large corpus available to determine parameters in determining a temporary index for the item to use in the similarity comparison process (e.g., inverse document frequency factors.) An aspect of dissemination systems that helps in the search process is the tendency for the profiles to have significantly more terms than ad hoc queries. The additional information helps to identify relevant items and increase the precision of the search process. Relevance feedback can also be used with profiles with some constraints. Relevance feedback used with ad hoc queries against an existing database tends to move the terminology defining the search concepts towards the information need of the user that is available in the current database. Concepts in the initial search statement will eventually lose importance in the revised queries if they are not in the database. The goal of profiles is to define the coverage of concepts that the user cares about if they are ever found in new items. Relevance feedback applied to profiles aides the user by enhancing the search profile with new terminology about areas of interest. But, even though a concept has not been found in any items received, that area may still be of critical importance to the user if it ever is found in any new items. Thus weighting of original terms takes on added significance over the ad hoc situation.  Searching the Internet for information has brought into focus the deficiencies in the search algorithms developed to date. The ad hoc queries are extremely short (usually less than three terms) and most users do not know how to use the advanced features associated with most search sites. Until recently research had focused on a larger more sophisticated query. With the Internet being the largest most available information system supporting information retrieval search, algorithms are in the process of being modified to account for the lack of information provided by the users in their queries. Intelligent Agents are being proposed as a potential mechanism to assist users in locating the information they require. The requirements for autonomy and the need for reasoning in the agents will lead to the merging of information retrieval algorithms and the learning processes associated with Artificial Intelligence. The use of hyperlinks is adding another level of ambiguity in what should be defined as an item. When similarity measures are being applied to identify the relevance weight, how much of the hyperlinked information should be considered part of the item? The impacts on the definition of information retrieval boundaries are just starting to be analyzed while experimental products are being developed in Web years and immediately being made available.
