 5.1    Introduction Without detailed knowledge of the collection make-up and of the retrieval environment, most users find it difficult to formulate queries which are well designed for retrieval purposes. In fact, as observed with Web search engines, the users might need to spend large amounts of time reformulating their queries to accomplish effective retrieval. This difficulty suggests that the first query formulation should be treated as an initial (naive) attempt to retrieve relevant information. Following that, the documents initially retrieved could be examined for relevance and new improved query formulations could then be constructed in the hope of retrieving additional useful documents. Such query reformulation involves two basic steps: expanding the original query with new terms and reweighting the terms in the expanded query. In this chapter, we examine a variety of approaches for improving the initial query formulation through query expansion and term reweighting. These approaches are grouped in three categories: (a) approaches based on feedback information from the user; (b) approaches based on information derived from the set of documents initially retrieved (called the local set of documents); and (c) approaches based on global information derived from the document collection. In the first category, user relevance feedback methods for the vector and probabilistic models are discussed. In the second category, two approaches for local analysis (i.e., analysis based on the set of documents initially retrieved) are presented. In the third category, two approaches for global analysis are covered. Our discussion is not aimed at completely covering the area, neither does it intend to present an exhaustive survey of query operations. Instead, our discussion is based on a selected bibliography which, we believe, is broad enough to allow an overview of the main issues and tradeoffs involved in query operations. Local and global analysis are highly dependent on clustering algorithms. Thus, clustering is covered throughout our discussion. However, there is no intention of providing a complete survey of clustering algorithms for information retrieval. 117 118        QUERY OPERATIONS
