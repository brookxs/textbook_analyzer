 5.5    Trends and Research Issues The relevance feedback strategies discussed here can be directly applied to the graphical interfaces of modern information systems. However, since interactivity is now of greater importance, new techniques for capturing feedback information from the user are desirable. For instance, there is great interest in graphical interfaces which display the documents in the answer set as points in a 2D or 3D space. The motivation is to allow the user to quickly identify (by visual inspection) relationships among the documents in the answer. In this scenario, a rather distinct strategy for quantifying feedback information might be required. Thus, relevance strategies for dealing with visual displays are an important research problem. In the past, global analysis was viewed as an approach which did not yield good improvements in retrieval performance. However, new results obtained at the beginning of the 1990s changed this perception. Further, the Web has provided evidence that techniques based on global analysis might be of interest to the users. For instance, this is the case with the highly popular 'Yahoo!' software which uses a manually built hierarchy of concepts to assist the user with forming the query. This suggests that investigating the utilization of global analysis techniques in the Web is a promising research problem. Local analysis techniques are interesting because they take advantage of the local context provided with the query. In this regard, they seem more appropriate than global analysis techniques. Furthermore, many positive results have been reported in the literature. The application of local analysis techniques to the Web, however, has not been explored and is a promising research direction. The main challenge is the computational burden imposed on the search engine site due to the need to process document texts at query time. Thus, a related research problem of relevance is the development of techniques for speeding up query processing at the search engine site. In truth, this problem is of interest even if one considers only the normal processing of the queries because the search engines depend on processing as many queries as possible for economic survival. The combination of local analysis, global analysis, visual displays, and interactive interfaces is also a current and important research problem. Allowing the user to visually explore the document space and providing him with clues which assist with the query formulation process are highly relevant issues. Positive results in this area might become a turning point regarding the design of user interfaces and are likely to attract wide attention. 138        QUERY OPERATIONS
