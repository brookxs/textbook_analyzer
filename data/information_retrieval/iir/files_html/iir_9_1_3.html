  <h2><a name="SECTION001413000000000000000"> When does relevance feedback work?</a> </h2> 
  <p> The success of relevance feedback depends on certain assumptions. Firstly, the user has to have sufficient knowledge to be able to make an initial query which is at least somewhere close to the documents they desire. This is needed anyhow for successful information retrieval in the basic case, but it is important to see the kinds of problems that relevance feedback cannot solve alone. Cases where relevance feedback alone is not sufficient include: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Misspellings. If the user spells a term in a different way to the way it is spelled in any document in the collection, then relevance feedback is unlikely to be effective. This can be addressed by the spelling correction techniques of Chapter <a href="dictionaries-and-tolerant-retrieval-1.html#ch:spell">3</a> . </li> 
   <li>Cross-language information retrieval. Documents in another language are not nearby in a vector space based on term distribution. Rather, documents in the same language cluster more closely together. </li> 
   <li>Mismatch of searcher's vocabulary versus collection vocabulary. If the user searches for laptop but all the documents use the term notebook computer, then the query will fail, and relevance feedback is again most likely ineffective. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> <a name="p:multimodal"></a> </p> 
  <p> Secondly, the relevance feedback approach requires relevant documents to be similar to each other. That is, they should cluster. Ideally, the term distribution in all relevant documents will be similar to that in the documents marked by the users, while the term distribution in all nonrelevant documents will be different from those in relevant documents. Things will work well if all relevant documents are tightly clustered around a single prototype, or, at least, if there are different prototypes, if the relevant documents have significant vocabulary overlap, while similarities between relevant and nonrelevant documents are small. Implicitly, the Rocchio relevance feedback model treats relevant documents as a single <a name="11602"></a><i>cluster</i>, which it models via the centroid of the cluster. This approach does not work as well if the relevant documents are a multimodal class, that is, they consist of several clusters of documents within the vector space. This can happen with: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Subsets of the documents using different vocabulary, such as Burma vs. Myanmar </li> 
   <li>A query for which the answer set is inherently disjunctive, such as Pop stars who once worked at Burger King. </li> 
   <li>Instances of a general concept, which often appear as a disjunction of more specific concepts, for example, felines. </li> 
  </ul> Good editorial content in the collection can often provide a solution to this problem. For example, an article on the attitudes of different groups to the situation in Burma could introduce the terminology used by different parties, thus linking the document clusters. 
  <p> Relevance feedback is not necessarily popular with users. Users are often reluctant to provide explicit feedback, or in general do not wish to prolong the search interaction. Furthermore, it is often harder to understand why a particular document was retrieved after relevance feedback is applied. </p> 
  <p> Relevance feedback can also have practical problems. The long queries that are generated by straightforward application of relevance feedback techniques are inefficient for a typical IR system. This results in a high computing cost for the retrieval and potentially long response times for the user. A partial solution to this is to only reweight certain prominent terms in the relevant documents, such as perhaps the top 20 terms by term frequency. Some experimental results have also suggested that using a limited number of terms like this may give better results (<a href="bibliography-1.html#harman92revisited">Harman, 1992</a>) though other work has suggested that using more terms is better in terms of retrieved document quality (<a href="bibliography-1.html#buckley94relevance">Buckley et&nbsp;al., 1994b</a>). </p>
