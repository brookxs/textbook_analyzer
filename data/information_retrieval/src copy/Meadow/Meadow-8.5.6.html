Part of the reason for this is that they are designed poorly.  The help system is usually used by the user to understand the most recent system message.  It is important to give the user a specific explanation.  The best help systems are able to analyze what the user has done and what the system response was.  The next step should then be explained to the user.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-8.5.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <IMG SRC="images/norightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0> <A HREF="Meadow-8.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
