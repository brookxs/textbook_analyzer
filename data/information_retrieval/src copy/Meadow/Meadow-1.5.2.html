It makes design more difficult.  In some cases it is difficult to get the user to understand the information structure.  It is also hard to get the users to articulate their information needs.  Translating information needs into queries that the system can understand is also difficult for some users.  Lastly, it is difficult for users to evaluate the information returned by the system.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="Meadow-1.5.1.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.6.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow-1.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="Meadow.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
