It is almost an axiom that the security of a computer-based system is imperfect - that the best that can be done is to make it extremely difficult and expensive to gain illegal access either to information within the system or to information about the system. The individual user and the system itself face loss if the system security is lax. <p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-13.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <IMG SRC="images/norightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-12.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
