In this situation it is useful to present a graphic display of the output, indicating to the user the choices between quality and quantity. Graphic representation of retrieval results, if used, must clarify the retrieval for the user. However, graphical representation of results is not a full substitute for the original numerical or textual data since the graphs may lack the detail and accuracy of the data but it serves an important information filtering function.<p>In addition to the usual output media of hard copy and a computer monitor display, the possibility of magnetic computer-readable media such as diskettes and optically readable media such as writable CD-ROMs must also be considered. The option of audio output is also viable when working with voice or sound databases.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-11.3.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-11.5.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-10.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
