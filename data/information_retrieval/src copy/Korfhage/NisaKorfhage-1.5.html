Types of retrieval system design and evaluation include formal modeling, analytical studies, simulations and user tests.<p>Common basis for information retrieval systems is matching documents in the system and queries efficiently. Documents in the system is prepared at the lexical level, determining the number of words and phrases in a document before it can be matched to the query presented. The linguistic, pragmatic and heuristic techniques are used to determine the significance of a document in relation to the information need presented through the query given by the user.<p>Performance of the system is consistently measured by improved algorithms and structures created by researchers. The most commonly used algorithm is the relevance feedback that involves direct evaluation of retrieved documents by the user.<p>Deeper analysis of the natural language of document and query is carried out as well. World Wide Web documents which contain hypertext links of large volume of data introduces data filtering or data mining to the information retrieval world. This information filtering refers to rapid, inexpensive selection of documents to be processed in more detail for retrieval. Finally, the interface through which the user interacts with the system also plays a major factor in any retrieval system.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-1.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
