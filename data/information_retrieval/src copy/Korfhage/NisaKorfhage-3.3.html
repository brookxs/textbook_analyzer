The vector model uses evaluation methods based on a 0,1-vector, where each component is either 0 if the corresponding term is absent or 1 if the corresponding term is present in the document or query being represented. Evaluation methods can also be based on a weight vector whose components are the weights or values assigned to each term in the document.<p>The key to success using this model is to maintain dimensional compatibility. That is, the system must be designed to ensure that the comparison of two documents (or a document and a query) is always based on comparing the same terms in each document.<p>Assigning a weight to document terms in a vector is a complex process. Weight can be assigned based on the frequency of terms in the document. The more frequent a term is the more important it is to the document.<p>A user can also assign the weight of a term based on the terms importance in regards to the perceived information that will have no relation to the frequency of the term in the document. This process raises judging dilemma on situation where if a term is assigned as weight 1.0, user finds another more important term. Therefore, the dilemma is to assign the more important item the appropriate weight.<p><P><hr size=4><A HREF="NisaKorfhage-3.2.html"><IMG SRC="images/leftg.gif" ALT="previous" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-3.4.html"><IMG SRC="images/rightg.gif" ALT="next" border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage-Chapter-2.html"><IMG SRC="images/upg.gif" ALT="Up " border=0></A> <A HREF="NisaKorfhage.html"><IMG SRC="images/topg.gif" ALT="Title " border=0></A></body></html>
