 7.2.4    Index Terms Selection If a full text representation of the text is adopted then all words in the text are used as index terms. The alternative is to adopt a more abstract view in which not all words are used as index terms. This implies that the set of terms used as indices must be selected. In the area of bibliographic sciences, such a selection of index terms is usually done by a specialist. An alternative approach is to select candidates for index terms automatically. Distinct automatic approaches for selecting index terms can be used. A good approach is the identification of noun groups (as done in the Inquery system [122]) which we now discuss. A sentence in natural language text is usually composed of nouns, pronouns, articles, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and connectives. While the words in each grammatical class are used with a particular purpose, it can be argued that most of the semantics is carried by the noun words. Thus, an intuitively promising strategy for selecting index terms automatically is to use the nouns in the text. This can be done through the systematic elimination of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, connectives, articles, and pronouns. Since it is common to combine two or three nouns in a single component (e.g., computer science), it makes sense to cluster nouns which appear nearby in the text into a single indexing component (or concept). Thus, instead of simply 170        TEXT OPERATIONS using nouns as index terms, we adopt noun groups. A noun group is a set of nouns whose syntactic distance in the text (measured in terms of number of words between two nouns) does not exceed a predefined threshold (for instance, 3). When noun groups are adopted as indexing terms, we obtain a conceptual logical view of the documents in terms of sets of non-elementary index terms.
