 4.4    Structural Qyeries Up to now we have considered the text collection as a set of documents which can be queried with regard to their text content. This model is unable to take advantage of novel text features which are becoming commonplace, such as the (a) STRUCTURAL QUERIES (c) 107 Figure 4.2    The three main structures:   (a) form-like fixed structure, (6) hypertext structure, and (c) hierarchical structure. text structure. The text collections tend to have some structure built into them, and allowing the user to query those texts based on their structure (and not only their content) is becoming attractive. The standardization of languages to represent structured texts such as HTML has pushed forward in this direction (see Chapter 6). As discussed in Chapter 2, mixing contents and structure in queries allows us to pose very powerful queries, which are much more expressive than each query mechanism by itself. By using a query language that integrates both types of queries, the retrieval quality of textual databases can be improved. This mechanism is built on top of the basic queries, so that they select a set of documents that satisfy certain constraints on their content (expressed using words, phrases, or patterns that the documents must contain). On top of this, some structural constraints can be expressed using containment, proximity, or other restrictions on the structural elements (e.g., chapters, sections, etc.) present in the documents. The Boolean queries can be built on top of the structural queries, so that they combine the sets of documents delivered by those queries. In the Boolean syntax tree (recall the example of Figure 4.1) the structural queries form the leaves of the tree. On the other hand, structural queries can themselves have a complex syntax. We divide this section according to the type of structures found in text databases. Figure 4.2 illustrates them. Although structured query languages should be amenable for ranking, this is still an open problem. In what follows it is important to distinguish the difference between the structure that a text may have and what can be queried about that structure. In general, natural language texts may have any desired structure. However, different models allow the querying of only some aspects of the real structure. When we say that the structure allowed is restricted in some way, we mean that only the aspects which follow this restriction can be queried, albeit the text may have more structural information. For instance, it is possible that an article has a nested structure of sections and subsections, but the query model does not accept recursive structures. In this case we will not be able to query for sections included in others, although this may be the case in the texts documents under consideration. 108        QUERY LANGUAGES
