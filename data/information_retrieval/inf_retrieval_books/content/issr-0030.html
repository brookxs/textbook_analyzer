 2.3.2 Iterative Search and Search History Log  Frequently a search returns a Hit file containing many more items than the user wants to review. Rather than typing in a complete new query, the results of the previous search can be used as a constraining list to create a new query that is applied against it.   This has the same effect as taking the original query and  adding additional search statement against it in an AND condition. This process of refining the results of a previous search to focus on relevant items is called iterative search. This also applies when a user uses relevance feedback to enhance a previous search.  During a login session, a user could execute many queries to locate the needed information. To facilitate locating previous searches as starting points for new searches, search history logs are available. The search history log is the capability to display all the previous searches that were executed during the current session. The query along with the search completion status showing number of hits is displayed.
