 6.4.1    SGML SGML stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language (ISO 8879) and is a metalanguage for tagging text developed by a group led by Goldfarb [303] based on earlier work done at IBM. That is, SGML provides the rules for defining a markup language based on tags. Each instance of SGML includes a description of the document structure called a document type definition. Hence, an SGML document is defined by: (1) a description of the structure of the document and (2) the text itself marked with tags which describe the structure. We will explain later the syntax associated with the tags. The document type definition is used to describe and name the pieces that a document is composed of and define how those pieces relate to each other. Part of the definition can be specified by an SGML document type declaration (DTD). 150        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES Other parts, such as the semantics of elements and attributes, or application conventions, cannot be expressed formally in SGML. Comments can be used, however, to express them informally. This means that all of the rules for applying SGML markup to documents are part of the definition, and those that can be expressed in SGML syntax are represented in the DTD. The DTD does not define the semantics (that is, the meaning, presentation, and behavior), or intended use, of the tags. However, some semantic information can be included in comments embedded in the DTD, while more complete information is usually present in separate documentation. This additional documentation typically describes the elements, or logical pieces of data, the attributes, and information about those pieces of data. For example, two tags can have the same name but different semantics in two different applications. Tags are denoted by angle brackets (lt;tagnamegt;). Tags are used to identify the beginning and ending of pieces of the document, for example a quote in a literary text. Ending tags are specified by adding a slash before the tag name (e.g., lt;/tagnamegt;). For example, the tag lt;/authoxgt; could be used to identify the element 'name of author,' which appears in italics and generates a link to a biographic sketch. Tag attributes are specified at the beginning of the element, inside the angle brackets and after the nametag using the syntax attname=value. Figure 6.3 gives an example of a simple DTD and a document using it. While we do not intend to discuss SGML syntax here, we give a brief description of the example such that the reader can grasp the main ideas. Each ELEMENT represents a tag denoted by its name. The two following characters indicate if the starting and ending tags are compulsory (-) or optional (0). For example, the ending tag for prolog is necessary while for sender it is not. Following that, the inside portion of the content tag is specified using a regular expression style syntax where V stands for concatenation, 4|' stands for logical or, '?' stands for zero or one occurrence, '*' stands for zero or more occurrences, and k+' stands for one or more occurrences of the preceding element. The content tag can be composed of the combination of other tag contents, ASCII characters (PCDATA), and binary data (NDATA), or EMPTY. The possible attributes of a tag are given in an attribute list (ATTLIST) identified by the tag name, followed by the name of each attribute, its type, and if it is required or not (otherwise, the default value is given). An SGML document instance is associated with the DTD so that the various tools working with the data know which are the correct tags and how they are organized. The document description generally does not specify how a document should look, for example when it is printed on paper or displayed on a screen. Because SGML separates content from format, we can create very good models of data that have no mechanism for describing the format, hence, no standard way to output the data in a formatted fashion. Therefore, output specifications, which are directions on how to format a document, are often added to SGML documents. For this purpose, output specification standards such as DSSSL (Document Style Semantic Specification Language) and FOSI (Formatted Output Specification Instance) were devised. Both of these standards define mechanisms for associating style information with SGML document instances.

They are the components of an SGML system used for defining, for instance, that the data identified by a tag should be typeset in italics. One important use of SGML is in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). The TEI is a cooperative project that started in 1987 and includes several US associations related to the humanities and linguistics. The main goal is to generate guidelines for the preparation and interchange of electronic texts for scholarly 152        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES research, as well as for industry. In addition to the guidelines, TEI provides several document formats through SGML DTDs. One of the most used formats is TEI Lite. The TEI Lite DTD can be used stand-alone or together with the full set of TEI DTD files.
