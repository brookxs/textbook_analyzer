 6.4.2    HTML HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is an instance of SGML. HTML was created in 1992 and has evolved during the past years, 4.0 being the latest version, released as a recommendation at the end of 1997. Currently it is being extended in many ways to solve its many limitations, for example, to be able to write mathematical formulas. Most documents on the Web are stored and transmitted in HTML. HTML is a simple language well suited for hypertext, multimedia, and the display of small and simple documents. HTML is based on SGML, and although there is an HTML DTD (Document Type Definition), most HTML instances do not explicitly make reference to the DTD. The HTML tags follow all the SGML conventions and also include formatting directives. HTML documents can have other media embedded within them, such as images or audio in different formats. HTML also has fields for metadata, which can be used for different applications and purposes. If we also add programs (for example, using Javascript) inside a page, some people call it dynamic HTML (or DHTML). This should not be confused with a Microsoft proposal (also called dynamic HTML) of an Application Programming Interface (API) for accessing and manipulating HTML documents. Figure 6.4 gives an example of an HTML document together with its output in a Web browser. Because HTML does not fix the presentation style of a document, in 1997, Cascade Style Sheets (CSS) were introduced. CSS offer a powerful and manageable way for authors, artists, and typographers to create visual effects that improve the aesthetics of HTML pages in the Web. Style sheets can be used one after another (called cascading) to define the presentation style for different elements of an HTML page. Style sheets separate information about presentation from document content, which in turn simplifies Web site maintenance, promotes Web page accessibility, and makes the Web faster. However, CSS support In current browsers is still modest. Another disadvantage is that two style sheets do not have to be consistent nor complete, so the stylistic result might not be good, in particular regarding color. CSS are supposed to balance the expectations of the author and of the reader regarding presentation Issues. Nevertheless, it is not clear who or in which cases the author or the reader should define the presentation. The evolution of HTML implies support for backward compatibility and also for forward compatibility, because people should also be able to see new documents with old browsers. HTML 4.0 has been specified in three flavors: strict, transitional, and frameset. Strict HTML only worries about non-presentational MARKUP LANGUAGES   153 lt;htmlgt; lt;headgt; lt;titlegt;HTML Examplelt;/titlegt; lt;meta naine=rby content="Just an example"gt; lt;/headgt; lt;bodygt; lt;hlgt;HTML Examplelt;/hlgt; lt;pgt; lt;hrgt; lt;pgt; HTML has many lt;igt;tagslt;/igt;, among them: lt;ligt; links to other lt;a href=http://www.w3c.org/gt;pageslt;/agt; (a from anchor), lt;ligt; paragraphs (p) , headings (hi, h2, etc), font types (b, i), lt;ligt; horizontal rules (hr), indented lists and items (ul, li), lt;ligt; images (img), tables, forms, etc. lt;hrgt; lt;Pgt; lt;img align=left src="at_work.gif"gt; This page is lt;bgt;alwayslt;/bgt; under construction. lt;/bodygt; lt;/htmlgt; HTML Example HTML has many tags, among them: ¶ links to other gag^.

Transitional HTML uses all the presentational features for pages that should be read for old browsers that do not understand CSS. Frameset HTML is used when you want to partition the browser window in two or more frames. HTML 4.0 includes support for style sheets, internationalization, frames, richer tables and forms, and accessibility options for people with disabilities. Typical HTML applications use a fixed small set of tags in conformance with a single SGML specification. Fixing a small set of tags allows users to leave the language specification out of the document and makes it much easier to build applications, but this advantage comes at the cost of severely limiting HTML in several important aspects. In particular, HTML does not: ï  allow users to specify their own tags or attributes in order to parameterize or otherwise semantically qualify their data; ï  support the specification of nested structures needed to represent database schemas or object-oriented hierarchies; ï  support the kind of language specification that allows consuming applications to check data for structural validity on importation. In contrast to HTML stands generic SGML. A generic SGML application is one that supports SGML language specifications of arbitrary complexity and makes possible the qualities of extensibility, structure, and validation missing in HTML. SGML makes it possible to define your own formats for your own documents, to handle large and complex documents, and to manage large information repositories. However, full SGML contains many optional features that are not needed for Web applications and have proven to have a cost/benefit ratio unattractive to current vendors of Web browsers. All these reasons led to the development of XML, a simpler metalanguage that is described in the next section.
