 15.3    Architectural Issues Since digital librarys are part of the global information infrastructure, many discussions of them focus on high level architectural issues [611]. On the one hand, digital librarys can be just part of the 'middleware' of the Internet, providing various services that can be embedded in other task-support systems. In this regard they can be treated separately from their content, allowing development to proceed without entanglement in problems of economics, censorship, or other social concerns. On the other hand, digital librarys can be independent systems and so must have an architecture of their own in order to be built. Thus, many current digital librarys are cobbled together from pre-existing pieces, such as search engines, Web browsers, database management systems, and tools for handling multimedia documents. From either perspective, it is helpful to extend definitions into more operational forms that can lead to specification of protocols when various components are involved. Such has been one of the goals of efforts at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), as illustrated in Figure 15.1. Thus, Kahn and Wilensky proposed one important framework [426]. Anns et at have extended this work into digital library architectures [28, 31]. One element is a digital object, which has content (bits) and a handle (a type of name or identifier) [189], and also may have properties, a signature, and a log of transactions that involve it. Digital objects have associated metadata, that can be managed in sets [472]. Repositories of digital objects can provide security and can respond to a repository access protocol [30]. Significant progress has been niade toward adopting a scheme of digital object identifiers, first illustrated by the Online Handles are used to access Digital Objects ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES        419 Handle system Repository Handle__ (metadata) Signature -(optional) Signature ó (optional) 1 Transaction log Digital Object Digital Object Handle(metadata)	X Properties j----- Content ógt; (bits)		222		wm	¶i Signature-----* (optional)	ó	_	ó 1 Transaction log Handle Digital Object Content -(bits) Signature ó (optional) J Transacti ion log I Handle Digital Object Signature ó (optional) 1 Transaction log Digital Object Security provided by Repository Figure 15.1    Digital objects, handles, and repositories (adapted from [428, 28, 31, 30]). 420        DIGITAL LIBRARIES Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLCs) Persistent URLs (PURLs) [654], and agreement seems likely on a standard for Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) [396]. Other implementation efforts have focused more on services [473] and security [475]. A useful testbed for this work has been computer science reports [210], most recently through the Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library, NCSTRL [471]. Two large Digital Libraries Initiative (digital libraryI) projects have devoted a good deal of attention to architecture, taking radically different approaches. At Stanford, the key concern has been interoperability [624]. Their 'InfoBus' [625] allows a variety of information resources to be connected through suitable mediators and then used via the shared bus through diverse interfaces. At the University of Michigan, the emphasis has been on agent technologies [97]. This approach can have a number of classes of entities involved in far-flung distributed processing. It is still unknown how efficiently an agent-based digital library can operate or even be built. Ultimately, software to use in digital librarys will be selected as a result of comparisons. One basis for such comparisons is the underlying conceptual model [820]. Another basis is the use of metrics, which is the subject of recent efforts towards definition and consensus building [499]. In addition to metrics traditionally used in IR, dealing with efficiency, effectiveness, and usability, a variety of others must be selected, according to agreed-upon scenarios. Also important to understand is the ability of digital librarys to handle a variety of document types (combinations of streams and structures), to accurately and economically represent their content and relationships (structures), and to support a range of access approaches and constraints (scenarios).
