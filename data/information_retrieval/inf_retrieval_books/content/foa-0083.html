 4.5 Summary  In this chapter we began by making some assumptions about users of a search engine in order to figure out how well the system is satisfying users' information needs. We focused on two separate notions of assessment: first, assessing the relevance of documents retrieved by the system in response to a particular query, and second, assessing the search engine's overall utility through aggregating relevance judgments provided by many users performing many queries.  Section 4.1 discussed both metric and nonmetric relevance feedback and the difficulties in getting users to provide relevance judgments for documents in the retrieved set. We saw, however, that relevance feedback could be used to either suggest query refinements to the users or to modify the underlying document representations to improve future system performance.  The concept of consensual relevance introduced in Section 4.2 addresses an issue raised in Chapter 1 , where we asked what success criteria can be used in evaluating a search engine. Consensual relevance tells us that relevant documents are those documents that many users find to be useful. We can ask how useful a particular search engine is, or compare one search engine with another, by posing the question: How useful (relevant) do users find the documents retrieved in response to queries?  To answer that question we quantified several measures of system performance. The generality of a query is a measure of what fraction of documents in the corpus is relevant to the query. Fallout measures the fraction of irrelevant documents found in the retrieved set of a given query. The key notions of recall, the fraction of relevant documents in the retrieved set, and precision, the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant, allow us to make direct comparisons between two search engines' performances on any query.
