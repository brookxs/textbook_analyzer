 The cluster hypothesis  Before describing the battery of classification methods that are now used in information retrieval, I should like to discuss the underlying hypothesis for their use in document clustering. This hypothesis may be simply stated as follows: closely associated documents tend to be relevant to the same requests. I shall refer to this hypothesis as the Cluster Hypothesis.  A basic assumption in retrieval systems is that documents relevant to a request are separated from those which are not relevant, i.e. that the relevant documents are more like one another than they are like non-relevant documents. Whether this is true for a collection can be tested as follows. Compute the association between all pairs of documents:  (a) both of which are relevant to a request, and  (b) one of which is relevant and the other non-relevant.  Summing over a set of requests gives the relative distribution of relevant-relevant (R-R) and relevant-non-relevant (R-N-R) associations of a collection. Plotting the relative frequency against strength of association for two hypothetical collections X and Y we might get distributions as shown in Figure 3.2.  From these it is apparent:  (a) that the separation for collection X is good while for Y it is poor; and  (b) that the strength of the association between relevant documents is greater for X than for Y.  Figure 3.2. R-R is the distribution of relevant-relevant associations, and R-N-R is the distribution of relevant-non-relevant associations.  It is this separation between the distributions that one attempts to exploit in document clustering. It is on the basis of this separation that I would claim that document clustering can lead to more effective retrieval than say a linear search. A linear search ignores the relationship that exists between documents. If the hypothesis is satisfied for a particular collection (some promising results have been published in Jardine and van Rijsbergen[10], and van Rijsbergen and Sparck Jones[27] for three test collections), then it is clear that structuring the collection in such a way that the closely associated documents appear in one class, will not only speed up the retrieval but may also make it more effective, since a class once found will tend to contain only relevant and no non-relevant documents.  I should add that these conclusions can only be verified, finally, by experimental work on a large number of collections. One reason for this is that although it may be possible to structure a document collection so that relevant documents are brought together there is no guarantee that a search strategy will infallibly find the class of documents containing the relevant documents. It is a matter for experimentation whether one can design search strategies which will do the job. So far most experiments in document clustering have been moderately successful but by no means conclusive.  Note that the Cluster Hypothesis refers to given document descriptions. The object of making permanent or temporary changes to a description by such techniques as keyword classifications can therefore be expressed as an attempt to increase the distance between the two distributions R-R and R-N-R. That is, we want to make it more likely that we will retrieve relevant documents and less likely that we will retrieve non-relevant ones.  As can be seen from the above, the Cluster Hypothesis is a convenient way of expressing the aim of such operations as document clustering. Of course, it does not say anything about how the separation is to be exploited.
