 15.6    Standards Since there are many digital library projects worldwide, involving diverse research, development, and commercial approaches, it is imperative that standards are employed so as to make interoperability and data exchange possible. Since by tradition any library can buy any book, and any library patron can read anything in the library, digital librarys must make differences in representation transparent to their users. In online searching as well, data that can be understood by clients as well as other digital librarys should be what is transferred from each information source. At the heart of supporting federated digital librarys, especially, is agreement on protocols for computer-computer communication.
