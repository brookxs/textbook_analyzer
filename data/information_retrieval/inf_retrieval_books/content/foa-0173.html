 8.2.2 Sperber and Wilson's "Relevance"  The notion of relevance has been at the heart of much of the FOA enterprise, particularly its evaluation (cf. Chapter 4). By making connections to foundational theories of language games and speech acts, Sperber and Wilson offer one of the soundest definitions of what "relevance" might mean [Sperber and Wilson, 1986].  Their principle of relevance puts the onus on the communicator: Ostensive behaviors (i.e., those in which there is a manifest intention to inform another) should be taken as guarantees that the sender believes them to be relevant to the receiver. They then provide a pragmatics for the communication, i.e., why a reader or listener should pay attention: viz., to improve their knowledge. Then the most relevant information we might convey has two properties: It must be new, or we have not improved the state of knowledge. But it also must be connected to other information, or this new factoid really adds almost nothing.  The value of connected information can be made most clear in terms of a logical theorem-proving model (cf. Section 6.5). Assuming again that the user already "knows" the contents of an intitial knowledge base E and has a question whether the proposition r is true or false, relevant documents are those that most extend what they know. Sperber and Wilson's notion of connected information corresponds exactly to the set of new inferences that are now allowed.  Sperber and Wilson also draw our attention to the importance of the context within which any communicative act occurs. One aspect of this context is the mutual knowledge that sender and receiver must have in order for communication to proceed efficiently:  MutualKnowil U) = {k \Know(h k) lt;-+ Know(U, k)}          (8.1)  Mutual knowledge is that knowledge k that if I know it, you know it too. This deep knowing what you mean, and your knowing that I know, CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS       305  and my knowing that you know that I know, etc., is what we seek in eye contact, in email responses, and in "active" listening. Relevance feedback is the fundamental communicative act that this text proposes for the process of assuring mutual knowledge.  The context within which any particular communicative act occurs has many other dimensions, too. As the earlier MPI example suggested, one of the fundamental issues in WWW searching is the confounding of contexts. The author of a journal article from the multimedia community can use MPI with his colleagues and students without any problem or confusion, because they share the same context. But when these journal articles are mingled with those from the parallel computing community, using MPI as a sign causes it to straddle two different contexts.  In summary, then, the FOA language game seems to propose a ternary predicate about connecting keywords and a document with a person who believes that the relation holds.
