    Frequency-based feature selection  frequency-based feature selection       Frequency-based feature selection selects some frequent terms that have no specific information about the class, for example, the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...), which are frequent across classes in newswire text. When many thousands of features are selected, then frequency-based feature selection often does well. Thus, if somewhat suboptimal accuracy is acceptable, then frequency-based feature selection can be a good alternative to more complex methods. However, Figure 13.8 is a case where frequency-based feature selection performs a lot worse than MI and and should not be used.
