 11.3.4    Some Proposals In the following we briefly survey some query languages supporting retrieval of multimedia objects. In order to describe how standard languages are evolving to support multimedia applications, we first describe the facilities provided by the upcoming standard SQL3 to support such kinds of applications. Then, we present the query language supported by the MULTOS system [90], introduced in section 11.2.2. The SQL3 Query Language As we have seen in section 11.2.1, the extensible type system and in general the ability to deal with complex objects make SQL3 suitable for modeling multimedia data. From the query language point of view, the major improvements of SQL3 with respect to SQL-92 can be summarized as follows: ï  Functions and stored procedures.  SQL3 allows the user to integrate external functionalities with data manipulation. This means that functions of an external library can be introduced into a database system as external functions. Such functions can be either implemented by using an external language, and in this case SQL3 only specifies which is the language and where the function can be found, or can be directly implemented by using SQL3 itself. In this way, impedance mismatch between two different programming languages and type systems is avoided. Of course, this approach requires an extension of SQL with imperative programming languages constructs. ï  Active database facilities. Another important property of SQL3 is the support of active rules, by which the database is able to react to some system- or user-dependent events by executing specific actions.   Active rules, or triggers, are very useful to enforce integrity constraints. From the multimedia perspective point of view, the aspects described make SQL3 suitable for being used as an interface language for multimedia applications, in particular, the ability to deal with external functions and user-defined data types enables the language to deal with objects with a complex structure, as multimedia objects. Note that, without this characteristic, the ability to deal with BLOB would have been useless since it reduces the view of multimedia data to single large uninterpreted data values, which are not adequate for the rich semantics of multimedia data. By the use of triggers, spatial and temporal constraints can be enforced, thus preserving the database consistency. Finally, as SQL3 is a widespread standard, it allows one to model multimedia objects in the framework of a well understood technology. QUERY LANGUAGES        339 Though the above facilities make SQL3 suitable for use as an interface for multimedia applications, there are also some limitations. The main drawback is related to retrieval support and, as a consequence, optimization. Indeed, no IR techniques are integrated into the SQL3 query processor. This means that the ability to perform content-based search is application dependent. As a consequence, objects are not ranked and are therefore returned to the application as a unique set. Moreover, specialized indexing techniques can be used but they are not transparent to the user. Bearing in mind the previous limitations, several projects have already been started with the aim of integrating SQL3 with IR facilities. An example of such a project is represented by SQL/MM Pull Text [190]. Text is in this case considered as a nested sequence of words, sentences, and paragraphs. In order to precisely capture the structure and the meaning of the words, SQL/MM Full Text is also able to view the text as a tree structure entity. The structure of this entity is controlled by a grammar. These facilities allow one to easily express queries to perform selection on the basis of the text content and/or text structure. There have also been several proposals for introducing spatial data types and predicates into the SQL framework. Among them, we recall Probe [623], Spatial SQL [231], Pictorial SQL [687], and QBE [418]. The MULTOS Query Language The development of the MULTOS query language has been driven by a number of requirements: first, it should be possible to easily navigate through the document structure. Path-names can be used for this purpose. Path-names can be total, if the path identifies only one component, or partial, if several components are identified by the path. Path-names are similar to object-oriented path expressions. Queries both on the content and on document structure must be supported. Query predicates on complex components must be supported. In this case, the predicate applies to all the document subcomponents that have a type compatible with the type required by the query. This possibility is very useful when a user does not recall the structure of a complex component. In general, a MULTOS query has the form: FIND DOCUMENTS VERSION version-clause SCOPE scope-clause TYPE type-clause WHERE condition-clause WITH component where: The version-clause specifies which versions of the documents should be considered by the query. 340        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES Æ The scope-clause restricts the query to a particular set of documents. This set of documents is either a user-defined document collection or a set of documents retrieved by a previous query. ï  The type-clause allows the restriction of a query to documents belonging to a prespecifled set of types. The conditions expressed by the condition-clause only apply to the documents belonging to these types and their subtypes. When no type is specified, the query is applied to all document types. Æ The condition-clause is a Boolean combination of simple conditions (i.e., predicates) on documents components. Predicates are expressed on conceptual components of documents. Conceptual components are referenced by path-names. The general form of a predicate is: component restriction where component is a path-name and restriction is an operator followed by an expression. ï  The with-clause allows one to express structural predicates. Component is a path-name and the clause looks for all documents structurally containing such a component. Different types of conditions can be specified in order to query different types of media. In particular, MULTOS supports three main classes of predicates: predicates on data attributes, on which an exact match search is performed; predicates on textual components, determining all objects containing some specific strings; and predicates on images, specifying conditions on the image content. Image predicates allow one to specify conditions on the class to which an image should belong or conditions on the existence of a specified object within an image and on the number of occurrences of an object within an image. The following example illustrates the basic features of the MULTOS query language. Example 2  Consider the conceptual structure GenericJLetter, presented in example 1.  The following is an example of query: FIND DOCUMENT VERSIONS LAST WHERE Document.Date gt;  1/1/1998 AND (*Sendei\Name = "Olivetti" OR *Product_Presentation CONTAINS  "Olivetti")  AMD *ProdTict_Description CONTAINS  "Personal Computer11  AND (?Address.Country =  "Italy"  OR TEXT CONTAINS  "Italy")  AND WITH *Company_Logo. According to this query, the user looks for the last version of all documents, dated after January 1998, containing a company logo, having the word 'Olivetti' either as sender name or in the product presentation (which is a textual component), with the word 'Personal Computer' in the product description section TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        341 (which is another textual component) and with the word 'Italy' either constituting the country in the address or contained in any part of the entire document. Symbol '*' indicates that the path-name is not complete, that is, it could identify more than one component. The query language provided by MULTOS also supports the specification of imprecise queries that can be used when the user has an uncertain knowledge about the content of the documents he/she is seeking [657]. Such uncertainty is expressed by associating both a preference and an importance value with the attributes in the query. Such values are then used for ranking the retrieved documents. The following example illustrates the discussion. Example 3  The query: FIND DOCUMENT VERSIONS LAST WHERE (Document.Date BETWEEN   (12/31/1998,1/31/98)   PREFERRED BETWEEN   (2/1/1998,2/15/98)   ACCEPTABLE)   HIGH AND (*Sender.Name =  "Olivetti"  OR *Product_Presentation CONTAINS "Olivetti") HIGH AND (*ProductJ)escription CONTAINS "Personal Computer") HIGH AND (*ProductJDescription CONTAINS "good ergonomics") LOW AND (?Address.Country = "Italy" OR TEXT CONTAINS "Italy") HIGH AND WITH *CompanyJLogo HIGH (IMAGE MATCHES screen HIGH keyboard HIGH AT LEAST 2 floppy .drives LOW)  HIGH finds the last versions of all documents written in January, but possibly even at the beginning of February 1998, containing a company logo, having the word 'Olivetti' either as sender name or in the product presentation, with the word 'Personal Computer' in the product description section, and with the word 'Italy' either constituting the country in the address or contained in any part of the entire document. Personal Computers are described in the product description section as products having good ergonomics. Moreover, the document should contain a picture of the Personal Computer, complete with screen and keyboard, with at least two floppy drives. The value fL0W3 associated with the condition on 'good ergonomics7 indicates that the user formulating the query is not completely sure about this description of PC. By contrast, he/she is sure of all the conditions whose associated value is HIGH.7
