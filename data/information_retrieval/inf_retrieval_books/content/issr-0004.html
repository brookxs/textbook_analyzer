 1.3 Functional Overview  A total Information Storage and Retrieval System is composed of four major functional processes: Item Normalization, Selective Dissemination of Information (i.e., "Mail"), archival Document Database Search, and an Index Database Search along with the Automatic File Build process that supports Index Files. Commercial systems have not integrated these capabilities into a single system but supply them as independent capabilities. Figure 1.4 shows the logical view of these capabilities in a single integrated Information Retrieval System. Boxes are used in the diagram to represent Jdinctions while disks represent data storage.
