 6.2.2.3 One Pass Assignments  This technique has the minimum overhead in that only one pass of all of the terms is used to assign terms to classes. The first term is assigned to the first class. Each additional term is compared to the centroids of the existing classes. A threshold is chosen. If the item is greater than the threshold, it is assigned to the class with the highest similarity. A new centroid has to be calculated for the modified class. If the similarity to all of the existing centroids is less than the threshold, the term is the first item in a new class. This process continues until all items are assigned to classes. Using the system defined in Figure 6.3, with a threshold of 10 the following classes would be generated:  Class 1 = Term 1, Term 3, Term 4 Class 2 = Term 2, Term 6, Term 8 154                                                                                              Chapter 6  Class 3 = Term 5 Class 4 = Term 7  NOTE: the centroid values used during the one-pass process:  Class 1 (TermI, Term3) = 0, 7/2, 3/2, 0, 4/2  Classl (Terml, Term3, Term4) = 0, 10/3, 3/3, 3/3, 7/3  Class2 (Term2, Term6) = 6/2, 3/2, 0/2, 1/2, 6/2  Although this process has minimal computation on the order of O(n), it does not produce optimum clustered classes. The different classes can be produced if the order in which the items are analyzed changes. Items that would have been in the same cluster could appear in different clusters due to the averaging nature of centroids.
