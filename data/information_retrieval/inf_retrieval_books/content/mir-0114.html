 6.6    Trends and Research issues Many changes and proposals are happening, and very rapidly, in particular due to the advent of the Web. At this point, the reader must be lost in a salad of acronyms (we were ton!), in spite of the fact that we have only mentioned the most important languages and formats. The most important of these are included in the Glossary at the end of this book.

Only the future will tell. Figure 6.6 illustrates a taxonomy of the main languages considered. Solid lines indicate instances of a metalanguage (for example, HTML is an instance of SGML), while dashed lines indicate derived languages. The main trend is the convergence and integration of the different efforts, the Web being the main application. A European alternative to SGML is the Open Document Architecture (ODA) which is also a standard (ISO 8613 [398]). ODA was designed to share documents electronically without losing control over the content, structure, and layout of those documents. ODA defines a logical structure (like SGML), a layout and the content (including vector and raster graphics). An ODA file can also be formatted, processable, or formatted processable. Formatted files cannot be edited and have information about content and layout. The other two types can be edited. Processable files also have logical information in addition to content, while formatted processable files have everything. ODA is not used very much nowadays (see also Chapter 11). Recent developments include: ï  An object model is being defined:   the document object model (DOM). DOM will provide an interoperable set of classes and methods to manipulate HTML and XML objects from programming languages such as Java. ï  Integration between VRML and Dynamic HTML, providing a set of evolving features aod architecture extensions to HTML and Web browsers that includes cascading style sheets and document object models. ï  Integration between the Standard Exchange for Product Data format (STEP,  ISO   10303)   and  SGML.   STEP  covers  product  data from  a broad range of industries, and provides extensive support for modeling. 162        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES automated storage schema generation, life-cycle maintenance, and other management facilities. ï  Efforts to convert MARC to SGML by denning a DTD, as well as converting MARC to XML. This has potential possibilities for enhanced access and navigation and presentation of MARC record data and the associated information. ï  CGM has become of interest to Web researchers and commercial vendors for its use on the Internet, by developing a new encoding which can be parsed by XML. ï  Several new proposals have appeared. Among them we can mention SDML (Signed Document Markup Language), VML (Vector Markup Language), and PGML (Precision Graphics Markup Language).   The latter is based on the 2D imaging model of Postscript and PDF.
