 5.3    Automatic Local Analysis In a user relevance feedback cycle, the user examines the top ranked documents and separates them into two classes: the relevant ones and the non-relevant ones. This information is then used to select new terms for query expansion. The reasoning is that the expanded query will retrieve more relevant documents. Thus, there is an underlying notion of clustering supporting the feedback strategy. According to this notion, known relevant documents contain terms which can be used to describe a larger cluster of relevant documents. In this case, the description of this larger cluster of relevant documents is built interactively with assistance from the user. A distinct approach is to attempt to obtain a description for a larger cluster of relevant documents automatically. This usually involves identifying terms which are related to the query terms. Such terms might be synonyms, stemming variations, or terms which are close to the query terms in the text (i.e., terms with a distance of at most k words from a query term). Two basic types of strategies can be attempted: global ones and local ones. In a global strategy, all documents in the collection are used to determine a global thesaurus-like structure which defines term relationships. This structure is then shown to the user who selects terms for query expansion. Global strategies are discussed in section 5.4. In a local strategy, the documents retrieved for a given query q are examined at query time to determine terms for query expansion. This is similar to a relevance feedback cycle but might be done without assistance from the user (i.e., the approach might be fully automatic). Two local strategies are discussed below: local clustering and local context analysis. The first is based on the work done by Attar and Fraenkel in 1977 and is used here to establish many of the fundamental ideas and concepts regarding the usage of clustering for query expansion. The second is a recent work done by Xu and Croft in 1996 and illustrates the advantages of combining techniques from both local and global analysis. 124        QUERY OPERATIONS
