 9.4    Trends and Research Issues Parallel computing holds great potential for tackling the performance and scale issues associated with the large and growing document collections currently available online. In this chapter we have surveyed a number of techniques for exploiting modern parallel architectures. The trend in parallel hardware is the development of general MIMD machines. Coincident with this trend is the availability of features in modern programming languages, such as threads and associated synchronization constructs, that greatly facilitate the task of developing programs for these architectures. In spite of this trend, research in parallel IR algorithms on MIMD machines is relatively young, with few standard results to draw on. Much of the early work in parallel IR was aimed at supporting signature files on SIMD architectures. Although SIMD machines are well suited to processing signature files, both SIMD machines and signature files have fallen out of favor in their respective communities. SIMD machines are difficult to program and are well suited to a relatively small class of problems. As Chapter 8 points out, signature files provide poor support for document ranking and hold few, if any, advantages over inverted files in terms of functionality, index size, and processing speed [851]. Distributed computing can be viewed as a form of MIMD computing with relatively high interprocessor communication costs. Most of the parallel IR algorithms discussed in this chapter, however, have a high ratio of computation to communication, and are well suited to both symmetric multiprocessor and distributed implementations. In fact, by using an appropriate abstraction layer for inter-process communication, we can easily implement a parallel system that works well on both multiprocessor and distributed architectures with relatively little modification. Many challenges remain in the area of parallel and distributed text retrieval. While we have presented a number of approaches in this chapter, none stand out as the definitive solution for building parallel or distributed information retrieval systems. In addition to the continued development and investigation of parallel indexing and search techniques for systems based on inverted files and suffix arrays, two specific challenges stand out. The first challenge is measuring retrieval effectiveness on large text collections. Although we can easily measure the speedup achieved by a given parallel system, measuring the quality of the results produced by that system is another story. This challenge, of course, is not unique to parallel IR systems. Large collections pose problems particularly when it comes to generating relevance judgments for queries. The pooling techniques used in TREC (see Chapter 3) may not work. There, ranked result lists are combined from multiple systems to produce a relatively small set of documents for human evaluation. The assumption is that most, if not all, of the relevant documents will be included in the pool. With large collections, this assumption may not hold. Moreover, it is unclear how important recall is in this context. The second significant challenge is interoperability, or building distributed IR systems from heterogeneous components. The need for distributed systems 256        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR comprising heterogeneous back-end search servers is clear from the popularity of meta search services on the Web. The functionality of these systems is limited, however, due to the lack of term statistics from the back-end search servers, which would otherwise allow for accurate reranking and result list merging. Moreover, each search server employs its own, custom query language, opening up the possibility that the original intent of the query is lost when it is translated to the back-end query languages. Protocol standardization efforts, such as STARTS [317], attempt to address these problems, but commitment to these standards by the entire community of search providers is required.
