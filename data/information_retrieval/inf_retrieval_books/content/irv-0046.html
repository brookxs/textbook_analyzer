 Clustered files  It is now common practice to refer to a file processed by a clustering algorithm as a clustered file, and to refer to the resulting structure as a file structure. For example Salton[34] (p. 288) lists a clustered file as an alternative organisation to inverted, serial, chained files, etc. Although it may be convenient terminologically, it does disguise the real status of cluster methods. Cluster methods (or automatic classification methods) are more profitably discussed at the level of abstraction at which relations are discussed in connection with data bases, that is, in a thoroughly data independent way. In other words, selecting an appropriate cluster method and implementing it are two separate problems. Unfortunately not all users of clustering techniques see it this way, and so the current scene is rather confused. One factor contributing to the confusion is that clustering techniques have been used at a very low level of implementation of system software, for example, to reduce the number of page exceptions in a virtual memory. Therefore, those who use clustering merely to increase retrieval efficiency (in terms of storage and speed) will tend to see a classification structure as a file structure, whereas those who see clustering as a means of discovering (or summarising) some inherent structure in the data will look upon the same structure as a description of the data. Of course, this description may be used to achieve more efficient retrieval (and in IR more effective retrieval in terms of say precision and recall). Furthermore, if one looks carefully at some of the implementations of cluster methods one discovers that the classificatory system is represented inside the computer by one of the more conventional file structures.
