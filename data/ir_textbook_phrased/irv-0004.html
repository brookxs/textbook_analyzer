information-retrieval since the 1940s the problem of information-storage-and-retrieval has attracted increasing attention . it is simply stated : we have vast amounts of information to which accurate and speedy access is becoming ever more difficult . one effect of this is that relevant-information gets ignored since it is never uncovered , which in turn leads to much duplication of work and effort . with the advent of computers , a great deal of thought has been given to using them to provide rapid and intelligent retrieval-systems . in libraries , many of which certainly have an information-storage-and-retrieval problem , some of the more mundane tasks , such as cataloguing and general administration , have successfully been taken over by computers . however , the problem of effective retrieval remains largely unsolved . in principle , information-storage-and-retrieval is simple . suppose there is a store of documents and a person (user of the store) formulates a question (request or query) to which the answer is a set of documents satisfying the information-need expressed by his question . he can obtain the set by reading all the documents in the store , retaining the relevant documents and discarding all the others . in a sense , this constitutes ` perfect ' retrieval . this solution is obviously impracticable . a user either does not have the time or does not wish to spend the time reading the entire document-collection , apart from the fact that it may be physically impossible for him to do so . when high-speed computers became available for non-numerical work , many thought that a computer would be able to ` read ' an entire document-collection to extract the relevant documents . it soon became apparent that using the natural-language-text of a document not only caused input and storage problems (it still does) but also left unsolved the intellectual problem of characterising the document content . it is conceivable that future hardware developments may make natural-language-input and storage more feasible . but automatic characterisation in which the software attempts to duplicate the human process of ` reading ' is a very sticky problem indeed . more specifically , ` reading ' involves attempting to extract information , both syntactic and semantic , from the text and using it to decide whether each document is relevant or not to a particular request . the difficulty is not only knowing how to extract the information but also how to use it to decide relevance . the comparatively slow progress of modern linguistics on the semantic front and the conspicuous failure of machine-translation (bar-hillel [5]) show that these problems are largely unsolved . the reader will have noticed that already , the idea of ` relevance ' has slipped into the discussion . it is this notion which is at the centre of information-retrieval . the purpose of an automatic-retrieval strategy is to retrieve all the relevant documents at the same time retrieving as few of the non-relevant as possible . when the characterisation of a document is worked out , it should be such that when the document it represents is relevant to a query , it will enable the document to be retrieved in response to that query . human indexers have traditionally characterised documents in this way when assigning index-terms to documents . the indexer attempts to anticipate the kind of index-terms a user would employ to retrieve each document whose content he is about to describe . implicitly he is constructing queries for which the document is relevant . when the indexing is done automatically it is assumed that by pushing the text of a document or query through the same automatic-analysis , the output will be a representation of the content , and if the document is relevant to the query , a computational procedure will show this . intellectually it is possible for a human to establish the relevance of a document to a query . for a computer to do this we need to construct a model within which relevance decisions can be quantified . it is interesting to note that most research in information-retrieval can be shown to have been concerned with different aspects of such a model .
