14.2.3 ir in online retrieval-systems since the inception of these online retrieval services , their retrieval functionality has been based primarily on the boolean-model for retrieval , in contrast to research in the ir field which has focused on improving retrieval-performance through non-boolean models , such as the vector-space-model (see chapter 2) . a number of factors guided the choice of the boolean-model as the basis for these services . research in indexing-and-retrieval at the time , particularly the cran-field studies , a series of experiments comparing natural and controlled-vocabulary-indexing , suggested that ` natural-language ' retrieval provided a level of retrieval-performance comparable to manual-indexing . boolean-logic was already being used in some libraries for manual retrieval-systems , such as edge-notched cards and optical coincidence cards , and seemed to offer a natural mechanism for implementing retrieval based on combinations of words in documents . research on alternate retrieval-models was in its infancy , and the effectiveness of these models had not been proven for large-databases . most significantly , perhaps , the limited processing and storage capability of the computers of the time , while enough to support the inverted-file structures and logical operations required for boolean-retrieval in an online-environment , could not provide real-time-retrieval performance for other retrieval-models which were more computationally intensive . despite developments in ir research which suggested that alternative models might provide improved retrieval-performance , boolean-retrieval has remained the commonest access-method offered by database vendors , although in recent years some systems have added a form of natural-language-input with ranked output processing as an alternative access-method . reasons that have been suggested for the predominance of boolean searching include financial considerations (cost of major changes in search software and database structures) , service issues (a client community trained on existing systems) , and lack of evidence in online ir systems and document-databases 405 support of viable alternatives in operational environments [662] . in general , database vendors use proprietary search software which is specific to their system , so that information-professionals who search multiple systems are required to learn a different command vocabulary for each . a standard has been developed for a common command-language , niso z39 .58 or iso 8777 , as described in chapter 4 , but it does not substitute for the advanced-search-features which are unique to individual search systems . the basic functionality for an ir search-system is the ability to search for single terms or phrases , or boolean combinations of them , to create sets of documents that can be further manipulated , then printed or displayed . typically the system will also offer the option of using proximity operators to specify term-relationships (a adjacent to b , a within n words of b , etc.) as discussed in chapter 5 , and to specify the location of the search-term within the record (a occurring in title field , b occurring in the descriptor field , etc.) . of course , these capabilities require the storage of a significant amount of positional-information within the inverted-index . other functions that may be available are the ability to browse the database-index to select search-terms (see chapter 10) or to follow the term-relationships within a database thesaurus to find candidate search-terms (see chapter 7) . other , more sophisticated functions , perhaps associated with a specific category of database , are also available , such as the ability to conduct structural searches for compounds in a chemistry database . as a term is entered by a searcher , the system creates a ` set ' corresponding to all documents containing that term , and assigns a set number for the searcher 's use . multiple sets of retrieved documents are maintained in temporary storage . these set numbers serve as surrogates for the document set when issuing search commands , and boolean-logic can be used to manipulate existing sets . a display command allows the searcher to review the search-history and return to previous sets . based on data about the size of a set retrieved with search-term or expression , and a review of the associated documents and their indexing , searchers continually revise a search until they feel they have achieved the best possible outcome . this iterative-process is as much art as science , and its success is highly dependent on the skill and subject knowledge of the searcher . a typical boolean search on dialog is shown in figure 14.6 . in this search , the user requests a specific database (file 61 , library-and-information-science abstracts) and then uses the ` select steps ' or ss command to create sets of records . the ' (w) 1 represents a proximity operator , so set 5 (s5) will contain all records containing the phrases ` document-retrieval ' or ` text-retrieval * 1 or ` information-retrieval .1 set 13 (s13) will contain all records containing the term ` opac or the phrase ` online public access catalog . ' the k ? ' is a truncation operator , and l ? ? ' limits truncation to one letter , so alternate spellings and plural of `` catalog ' and the singular or plural of ` opac will be retrieved . the two sets are combined with a boolean and operator , and finally the set is further limited to records that contain the terms in the title (ti) or descriptor (de) field , resulting in 100 records for review . 406 libraries and bibliographical systems begin 61 file 61 : lisa (libraryinf0sci) 1969-1998 / may (c) 1998 reed reference publishing set items description ? ss (document or information or text) (w) retrieval si 7363 document s2 92299 information s3 6219 text s4 29302 retrieval s5 15338 (document or information or text) (w) retrieval ? ss opac ? ? or online (w) public (w) access (w) catalog ? s6 1111 opac ? ? s7 20922 online s8 32238 public s9 16388 access s10 18798 catalog ? sll 424 online (w) public (w) access (w) catalog ? s12 1246 opac ? ? or online (w) public (w) access (w) catalog ? ? s s5 and sl2 15338 s5 1246 s12 s13 146 s5 and s12 ? s sl3/ti de s14 100 s13/ti , de figure 14.6 a dialog search .
