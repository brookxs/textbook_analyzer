tf-idf-weighting we now combine the definitions of term-frequency and inverse-document-frequency , to produce a composite weight for each term in each document . the tf-idf-weighting scheme assigns to term a weight in document given by (22) in other words , assigns to term a weight in document that is highest when occurs many times within a small number of documents (thus lending high discriminating power to those documents) ; lower when the term occurs fewer times in a document , or occurs in many documents (thus offering a less pronounced relevance signal) ; lowest when the term occurs in virtually all documents . at this point , we may view each document as a vector with one component corresponding to each term in the dictionary , together with a weight for each component that is given by (22) . for dictionary terms that do not occur in a document , this weight is zero . this vector form will prove to be crucial to scoring-and-ranking ; we will develop these ideas in section 6.3 . as a first step , we introduce the overlap score-measure : the score of a document is the sum , over all query terms , of the number of times each of the query terms occurs in . we can refine this idea so that we add up not the number of occurrences of each query-term in , but instead the tf-idf weight of each term in . (23) 6.3 23 exercises . why is the idf of a term always finite ? what is the idf of a term that occurs in every document ? compare this with the use of stop word lists . consider the table of term frequencies for 3 documents denoted doc1 , doc2 , doc3 in figure 6.9 . figure 6.9 : table of tf values for exercise 6.2.2 . compute the tf-idf weights for the terms car , auto , insurance , best , for each document , using the idf values from figure 6.8 . can the tf-idf weight of a term in a document exceed 1 ? how does the base of the logarithm in (21) affect the score-calculation in (23) ? how does the base of the logarithm affect the relative scores of two documents on a given query ? if the logarithm in (21) is computed base 2 , suggest a simple approximation to the idf of a term .
