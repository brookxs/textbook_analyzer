1.1.2 information-retrieval at the center of the stage in the past 20 years , the area of information-retrieval has grown well beyond its primary goals of indexing text and searching for useful documents in a collection . nowadays , research in ir includes modeling , document-classification-and-categorization , systems-architecture , user-interfaces , data-visualization , filtering , languages , etc. . despite its maturity , until recently , ir was seen as a narrow area-of-interest mainly to librarians and information experts . such a tendentious vision prevailed for many years , despite the rapid dissemination , among users of modern personal-computers , of ir tools for multimedia and hypertext-applications . in the beginning of the 1990s , a single fact changed once and for all these perceptions รณ the introduction of the world-wide-web . the-web is becoming a universal-repository of human-knowledge and culture which has allowed unprecedent sharing of ideas and information in a scale never seen before . its success is based on the conception of a standard user-interface which is always the same no matter what computational environment is used to run the interface . as a result , the user is shielded from details of communication-protocols , machine location , and operating-systems . further , any user can create his own web-documents and make them point to any other web-documents without restrictions . this is a key aspect because it turns the-web into a new publishing medium accessible to everybody . as an immediate basic concepts 3 consequence , any web user can push his personal agenda with little effort and almost at no cost . this universe without frontiers has attracted tremendous attention from millions of people everywhere since the very beginning . furthermore , it is causing a revolution in the way people use computers and perform their daily tasks . for instance , home shopping and home banking are becoming very popular and have generated several hundred million dollars in revenues . despite so much success , the-web has introduced new problems of its own . finding useful information on the web is frequently a tedious and difficult task . for instance , to satisfy his information-need , the user might navigate the space of web-links (i.e. , the hyperspace) searching for information of interest . however , since the hyperspace is vast and almost unknown , such a navigation task is usually inefficient . for naive users , the problem becomes harder , which might entirely frustrate all their efforts . the main obstacle is the absence of a well defined underlying data-model for the-web , which implies that information definition and structure is frequently of low quality . these difficulties have attracted renewed interest in ir and its techniques as promising solutions . as a result , almost overnight , ir has gained a place with other technologies at the center of the stage .
