1.1 finding out about - a cognitive-activity we are all forced to make decisions regularly , sometimes on the spur of the moment . but the rest of the time we have enough warning that it is possible to collect our thoughts and do some research that makes our * robert mankoff , 0 the new yorker , 26 january 1998 . finding out about decision as sound as it can be . this book is a closer look at the process of finding out about (foa) , research activities that allow a decision-maker to draw on others ' knowledge . it is written from a technical perspective , in terms of computational tools that speed the foa activity in the modern era of the distributed-networks of knowledge collectively known as the world-wide-web (www) . it shows you how to build many of the tools that are useful for searching collections of text and other media . the primary argument advanced is that progress requires that we appreciate the cognitive foundation we bring to this task as academics , as language users , and even as adaptive organisms . as organisms , we have evolved a wide range of strategies for seeking useful information about our environment . we use the term `` cognitive '' to highlight the use of internal representations that help even the simplest organisms perceive and respond to their world ; as the organisms get less simple , their cognitive structures increase in complexity . whether done by simple or complex organisms , however , the process of finding out about is a very active one - making initial guesses about good paths , using complex sets of features to decide if we seem to be on the right path , and proceeding forward . as humans , we are especially expert at searching through one of the most complex-environments of all : language . its system of linguistic-features is not derived from the natural world , at least not directly . it is a constructed , cultural system that has worked well since (by definition !) prehistoric times . in part , languages remain useful because they are capable of change when necessary . new features and new objects are noticed , and it becomes necessary for us to express new things about them , to form our reactions to them , and to express these reactions to one another . our first experience of language , as children and as a species , was oral - we spoke and listened . as children we learn sprachspiele (word or language-games) [wittgenstein , 1953] - how to use language to get what we want . a baby saying `` juice ! '' is using the exclamation as a tool to make adults move ; that 's what a word means . such a functional notion of language , in terms of the jobs it accomplishes , will prove central to our conception of what keywords in documents and queries mean as part of the foa task . beyond the oral uses of language , as a species we have also learned the advantages of writing down important facts we might otherwise forget . overview writing down a list of things to do , which we might forget tomorrow , extends our limited-memory . some of these advantages accrue to even a single individual : we use language personally , to organize our thoughts and to conceive strategies . even more important , we use writing to say things to others . writing down important , memorable facts in a consistent , conventional manner , so that others can understand what we mean and vice versa , further amplifies the linguistic advantage . as a society , we value reading and writing skills because they let us interpret shared symbols and coordinate our actions . in advanced cultures ' scholarship , entire curricula can be defined in terms of what robert mchenry (editor-in-chief of encyclopedia-britannica) calls `` knowinghow to know `` 1 it is easiest to think of the organism 's or human 's search as being for a valuable object , sweet pieces of fruit in the jungle , or (in modern times) a grocer that sells them . but as language has played an increasingly important role in our society , searching for valuable written passages becomes an end unto itself . especially as members of the academic community , we are likely to go to libraries seeking others ' writings as part of our search . here we find rows upon rows of books , each full of facts the author thought important , and endorsed by a librarian who has selected it . the authors are typically people far from our own time and place , using language similar but not identical to our own . of course the library contains many such books on many , many topics . we must find out about a topic of special interest , looking only for those things that are relevant to our search . this basic skill is a fundamental part of an academic 's job : ï we look for references in order to write a term paper . ï we read a textbook , looking for help in answering an exercise . ï we comb through scientific journals to see if a question has already been answered . we know that if we find the right reference , the right paper , the right paragraph , our job will be made much easier . language has become not only the means of our search , but its object as well wwwjustanother . com/howtoknow finding out about today we can also search the world-wide-web (www) for others ' opinions of music , movies , or software . of course these examples are much less of an `` academic exercise '' ; finding out about such information commodities , and doing it consistently and well , is a skill on which the modern information society places high value indeed . but while the infrastructure forming the modern www is quite recent , the promise offered by truly connecting all the world 's knowledge has been anticipated for some time , for example , by h. g. wells [wells , 1938] . many of the foa searching techniques we will discuss in this text have been designed to operate on vast collections of apparently `` dead '' linguistic objects : files full of old email-messages , cd-roms full of manuals or literature , web-servers fiill of technical reports , and so on . but at their core , each of these collections is evidence of real , vital attempts to communicate . typically an author (explicitly or implicitly) anticipates the interests of some imagined audience and produces text that is a balance between what the author wants to say and what he or she thinks the audience wants to hear . a textual corpus will contain many such documents , written by many different authors , in many styles and for many different purposes . a person searching through such a corpus comes with his or her own purposes and may well use language in a different way from any of the authors . but each individual linguistic-expression - the authors ' attempts to write , the searchers ' attempts to express their questions and then read the authors ' documents - must be appreciated for the word games [wittgenstein , 1953] that they are . foa is centrally concerned with meaning : the semantics of the words , sentences , questions , and documents involved . we can not tell if a document is about a topic unless we understand (at least something of) the semantics of the document and the topic . this is the notion of about-ness most typical within the tradition of library-science [hutchins , 1978] . this means that our attempts to engineer good technical solutions must be informed by , and can contribute to , a broader philosophy of language . for examples it will turn out that foa 's concern with the semantics of entire documents is well complemented by techniques from computational-linguistics , which have tended to focus on syntactic-analysis of individual sentences . but even more exciting is the fact that the recent overview 5 questioner question answerer question answer assessment figure 1.1 the foa conversation loop . availability of new types of electronic artifacts - from email-messages and www corpora to the browsing-behaviors of millions of users all trying to foa - brings an empirical grounding for new theories of language that may well be revolutionary . at its core , the foa process of browsing readers can be imagined to involve three phases : 1 . asking a question ; 2 . constructing an answer ; and 3 . assessing the answer . this conversational loop is sketched in figure 1.1 . step 1 . asking a question the first step is initiated by people who (anticipating our interest in building a search-engine) we 'll call users , and their questions . we do n't know a lot about these people , but we do know they are in a particular frame of mind , a special cognitive state ; they may be aware ^ of a specific gap in their knowledge (or they be only vaguely puzzled) , and they 're motivated to fill it . they want to foa ... some topic . supposing for a moment that we were there to ask , the users may not even be able to characterize the topic , that is , to articulate their knowledge gap . more precisely , they may not be able to fully define characteristics of the `` answer '' they seek . a paradoxical feature of the foa problem is meta-cognition about ignorance finding out about that if users knew their question , precisely , they might not even need the search-engine we are designing : forming a clearly posed question is often the hardest part of answering it ! in any case , well call this somewhat befuddled but not uncommon cognitive-state the users ' information-need . while a bit confused about their particular question , the users are not without resources . first , they can typically take their ill-defined , internal cognitive-state and turn it into an external expression of their question , in some language . we 'll call their expression the query , and the language in which it is constructed the query-language . step 2 . constructing an answer so much for the source of the question ; whence the answer ? if the question is being asked of a person , we must worry about equally complex characteristics of the answerer 's cognitive-state : ï can they translate the user 's ill-formed question into a better one ? ï do they know the answer themselves ? ï are they able to verbalize this answer ? ï can they give the answer in terms the user will understand ? ï can they provide the necessary background-knowledge for the user to understand the answer itself ? we will refer to the question-answerer as the search-engine , a computer program that algorithmically performs this task . immediately each of the concerns (just listed) regarding the human answerer 's cognitive-state translates into extremely ambitious demands we might make of our computer-system . throughout most of this book , we will avoid such ambitious issues and instead consider a very restricted form of the foa problem : we will assume that the search-engine has available to it only a set of preexisting , `` canned '' passages of text and that its response is limited to identifying one or more of these passages and presenting them to the users ; see figure 1.2 . we will call each of these passages a document and the entire set of documents the corpus . especially when the corpus is very-large (e.g. , assume it contains millions or even billions of documents) , selecting a very small set (say 10 to 20) of these as potentially good answers to overview corpus figure 1.2 retrieval of documents in response to a query be retrieved will prove sufficiently difficult (and practically important) that we will focus on it for the first few chapters of this book . in the final chapters however , we will consider how this basic functionality can be extended towards tools for `` searching for an education '' (cf. section 8.3.9) . step 3 . assessing the answer imagine a special instance of the foa problem : you are the user , waiting in line to ask a question of a professor . you 're confused about a topic that is sure to be on the final exam . when you finally get your chance to ask your question , we 'll assume that the professor does nothing but select the three or four preformed pearls of wisdom he or she thinks come closest to your need , delivers these `` documents , '' and sends you on your way . `` but wait ! '' you want to say . `` that is n't what i meant '' or , `` let me ask it another way . '' or , `` that helps , but i still have this problem . '' the third and equally important phase of the foa process `` closes the loop '' between asker and answerer , whereby the user (asker) provides an assessment of how relevant they find the answer provided . if after your first question and the professor 's initial answer you are summarily ushered out of the office , you have a perfect right to be angry because the foa process has been violated . foa is a dialog between asker and answerer ; it does not end with the search-engine 's first delivery of an answer . this initial exchange is only the first iteration of an ongoing conversation by which asker and answerer mutually negotiate a satisfactory exchange . in the process , the asker may recognize elements of the answer he or she 8 finding out about figure 1.3 assessment of the retrieval what foa data can we observe ? seeks and be able to reexpress the information-need in terms of threads taken from previous answers . because the question-answerer has been restricted to a simple set of documents , the asker 's relevance-feedback must be similarly constrained ; for each of the documents retrieved by the search-engine , the asker reacts by saying whether or not the document is relevant . returning to the student/professor scenario , we can imagine this as the student saying `` thanks , that helps '' after those pearls that do and remaining silent or saying , `` huh ? '' or `` what does that have to do with anything ?! '' or `` no , that 's not what i meant ! '' otherwise . more precisely , relevance-feedback gives askers the opportunity to provide more information with their reaction to each retrieved document - whether it is relevant (©) , irrelevant (©) , or neutral (#) . this is shown as a venn diagram-like labeling of the set of retrieved documents in figure 1.3 . we 'll worry about just how to solicit and make use of relevance-feedback judgments in chapter 4 . t
