11.3 query-languages queries in relational or object-oriented-database-systems are based on an exact-match mechanism , by which the system is able to return exactly those tuples or objects satisfying some well specified criteria given in the query expression and nothing more . in general , query predicates specify which values the object attributes must contain . because of the semi-structured nature of multimedia objects , the previous approach is no longer adequate in a multimedia-ir system . in this context , the user should still be able to query the content of multimedia objects by specifying values of semantic-attributes but he/she should also be able to specify additional conditions about the content of multimedia-data . thus , the exact-match is only one of the possible ways of querying multimedia objects . more often , a similarity-based approach is applied that considers both the structure and the content of the objects . queries of the latter type are called content-based-queries since they retrieve multimedia objects depending on their global content . information on the global content of an object is not represented as attribute values in the database-system . rather , as we have already remarked in section 11.2 , a set of information , called features , is extracted and maintained for each object . when the query is submitted , the features of the query object are matched with respect to the features of the objects stored in the database and only the objects that are more similar to the query one are returned to the user (see chapter 12) . the characteristics of content-based query-processing impacts the definition of a multimedia-query-language and , in general , of the user-interface . in particular , in designing a multimedia-query-language , three main aspects require attention : ï how the user enters his/her request to the system , i.e. , which interfaces are provided to the user for query-formulation . ï which conditions on multimedia objects can be specified in the user request . the conditions that can be expressed depend on the support the system provides for content-based-retrieval (see chapter 12) . ï how uncertainty , proximity , and weights impact the design of the query-language . in the following , we discuss the above aspects in detail . then , we present two examples of multimedia-query languages . first , we illustrate how traditional relational-query languages can be extended to deal with multimedia-data , discussing the main characteristics of the upcoming sql3 query-language . then . as an example of a research proposal , we introduce4 the query-language supported by multos (see section 11.2.2) . query-languages 335
