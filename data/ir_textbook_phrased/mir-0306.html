15.7 trends and research-issues there are many remaining challenges in the digital-library field . while tei provides guidance in complex encoding situations , and has been advocated by the university of michigan for electronic-theses-and-dissertations , it is unclear how far the rest of the scholarly community will move towards the thorough markup and description of digital-objects that characterize humanistic study [670] . though such markup is valuable to support context-dependent queries as well as electronic-document preservation , it will only be generally feasible when there are less expensive tools and more efficient methods for adding in such markup and description , which may occur as xml usage expands . then , too , the ir community must provide guidance regarding automatic-indexing of marked up documents , metadata , full-text , multimedia-streams , and complex hypermedia networks so that the rich and varied content of digital librarys can be searched . on a grander scale are the problems of handling worldwide digital librarys , in the context of varying collection principles , enormous difference in response-time between local and remote servers , and the needs of users for different views [474] . thus , one type of scenario might deal with searching all dissertations worldwide , another might be concerned with finding recent results from a particular research group , a third might consider only freely available works in a particular specialty area , a fourth might deal with seeking the new works recently highly rated by a distributed-group of close friends , and yet another might involve the most 432 digital-libraries readable overviews in an unknown area . other key research-challenges have been highlighted in various workshops aimed at establishing an agenda for investigation [525] . of central concern is covering the range from personal to global digital librarys , the so-called ` scaling ' problem . at the same time , the problem of interoperability must be faced [624] . as argued earlier , we view the solution to these problems to be the acknowledgement of the role of 5s in the digital-library arena and the focus of research-and-development on treating streams , structures , spaces , scenarios , and societies as first class objects and building-blocks for digital librarys . we will continue to explore this approach in future work , and believe that , to the extent that integrated support for 5s is developed , real progress will be made towards the next generation of digital-libraries .
