4.4.3 interactive rave the interactive portion of rave is an html-document , as shown in figure 4.19 . the top of rave 's window displays the three queries against which the subject is to judge each document . two queries are short sentences or phrases , in this case reasonimg about uncertainty 144 finding out about * ; j back forward reload home search guide images print security slop m title : design of a the need for a reliable method of measuring the depth , of ± recognition-system for anesthesia has existed since the introduction of s monitoring the depth of anesthesia . hemodynamic variables are most commonly used anesthesia , based on the as a measure of anesthetic depth by anesthesiologists in autoregressiye modeling the operating-room . it has besn found that the and neural-network hemodynamic variables by themselves may not be providing analysis of the eeg enough information to predict the depth , of anesthesia . signals since the system most affected by anesthetic agents is author : sharma , the central nervous system , electroencephalograms (eeg) , ashutosh a record of brain-activity , can be used to monitor the year : 1993 anesthetic depth . this thesis establishes the institution : rensselaer feasibility of using a computer-based eeg recognition polytechnic institute ; system to monitor anesthetic depth during halothane 0185 anesthesia . the spectral information contained in the eeg-signals `` vas represented using a tenth , order autoregxessive (ar) model . a four layer perception feedforward type of network tsras used in designing the recognition-system . the system im trained and its costofca ftnm asmal experiments , lie-input features to | : ï !

'' beneath each query the rave window contains four radio buttons labeled `` not '' (relevant) , `` possibly '' (relevant) , `` relevant , '' and `` critically '' (relevant) . because we asked our subjects to spend two hours each but could not assume their participation would be continuous , there is a `` quit '' button that allows the subject to suspend the session ; when the subject launches rave again , the session is resumed where he or she left off . finally , the `` next '' button is pressed after the subject has read and recorded his or her relevance-assessments for a document .
