2.1.7 concept/thesaurus expansion associated with both boolean and natural-language queries is the ability to expand the search-terms via thesaurus or concept class database reference tool . a thesaurus is typically a one-level or two-level expansion of a term to other terms that are similar in meaning . a concept class is a tree-structure that expands each meaning of a word into potential concepts that are related to the initial term (e.g. , in the topic system) . concept classes are sometimes implemented as a network-structure that links word stems (e.g. , in the retrievalware system) . an example of thesaurus and concept class structures are shown in figure 2.4 (thesaurus-93) and figure 2.5 . concept class representations assist a user who has minimal knowledge of a concept domain by allowing the user to expand upon a particular concept showing related concepts . a concept_based database shows associations that are not normally found in a language_based thesaurus . for example , `` negative advertising '' may be linked to `` elections '' in a concept database , but are hopefully not synonyms to be found in a thesaurus . generalization is associated with the user viewing concepts logically higher in a hierarchy that have more general meaning . specificity is going lower in the thesaurus looking at concepts that are more specific . thesauri are either semantic or based upon statistics . a semantic thesaurus is a listing of words and then other words that are semantically similar . electronic versions of thesauri are commercially available and are language based (e.g. , english , spanish , etc.) . systems such as retrievalware and topic provide them as part of the search-system . in executing a query , a term can be expanded to all related terms in the thesaurus or concept-tree . optionally , the user may display the thesaurus or concept-tree and indicate which related terms should be used in a query . this function is essential to eliminate synonyms which introduce meanings that are not in the user 's search statement . for example , a user searching on `` pasture lands '' and `` fields '' would not want all of the terms associated with `` magnetic-fields '' included in the expanded search statement . the capability usually exists to browse the thesaurus or concept-trees and add additional terms and term-relationships in the case of concept-trees . this allows users to enhance the thesaurus or concept-tree with jargon specific to their area-of-interest . information-retrieval-system capabilities 35 computer 7 7 \ data-processor mainframe pc multitasking computer '' ~ รณ - . cpu minicomputer figure 2.4 thesaurus for term `` computer '' computer-hardware / \ processor peripheral computer software operating-system application network figure 2.5 hierarchical concept class structure for `` computer '' the problem with thesauri is that they are generic to a language and can introduce many search-terms that are not found in the document-database . an alternative uses the database or a representative sample of it to create statistically related terms . it is conceptually a thesaurus in that words that are statistically related to other words by their frequently occurring together in the same items . this type of thesaurus is very dependent upon the database being searched and may not be portable to other databases . the statistical-techniques for generating a thesaurus are discussed in detail in chapter 6 . irs a statistical thesaurus it is very difficult to name a thesaurus class or understand by viewing it 36 chapter 2 what caused its creation (i.e. , there is not a semantic basis defining the classes) . as such , statistical thesauri are frequently used as automatic expansions of user 's searches without the user directly interacting with the thesaurus . theoretically thesauri and concept-trees could be used to either expand a search statement with additional terms or make it more specific but substituting more specific terms . from this perspective expanding the terms increases the recall of the search with a possible decrease in precision . going to more specific terms increases precision and possibly reduce recall . in most cases the generalization process is used in expanding a search statement with more terms .
