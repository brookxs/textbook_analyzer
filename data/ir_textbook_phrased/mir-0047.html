2.9 structured-text retrieval-models consider a user with a superior visual-memory . such a user might then recall that the specific document he is interested in contains a page in which the string ` atomic holocaust appears in italic in the text surrounding a figure whose label contains the word ` earth . ' with a classic information-retrieval-model , this query could be expressed as [` atomic holocaust ' and ` earth '] which retrieves all the documents containing both strings . clearly , however , this answer contains many more documents than desired by this user . in this particular case , the user would like to express his query through a richer expression such as same-page (near (`` atomic holocausts figure (label (`` earth ')))) which conveys the details in his visual recollection . further , the user might be interested in an advanced interface which simplifies the task of specifying this (now complex) query . this example illustrates the appeal of a query-language which allows us to combine the specification of strings (or patterns) with the 62 modeling specification of structural components of the document . retrieval-models which combine information on text-content with information on the document-structure are called structured-text retrieval-models . for a query such as the one illustrated above , a structured-text retrieval-system searches for all the documents which satisfy the query . thus , there is no notion of relevance attached to the retrieval-task . in this sense , the current structured-text retrieval-models are data (instead of information) retrieval-models . however , the retrieval-system could search for documents which match the query conditions only partially . in this situation , the matching would be approximate and some ranking would have to be used for ordering the approximate answers . thus , a structured-text retrieval algorithm can be seen as an information-retrieval algorithm for which the issue of appropriate ranking is not well established . in fact , this is an actual , interesting , and open-research problem . at the end of the 1980s and throughout the 1990s , various structured-text retrieval-models have appeared in the literature . usually , the more expressive the model , the less efficient is its query-evaluation strategy . thus , selection of a structured model for a given application must be exercised with care . a good policy is to select the most efficient model which supports the functionality required by the application in view . here , we do not survey all the structured-text retrieval-models . instead , we briefly discuss the main features of two of them , namely , a model based on non-overlapping lists and a model based on proximal nodes . these two models should provide a good overview of the main issues and tradeoffs in structured-text retrieval . we use the term match point to refer to the position in the text of a sequence of words which matches (or satisfies) the user-query . thus , if the user specifies the simple query [` atomic holocaust in hiroshima '] and this string appears in three positions in the text of a document dj , we say that the document dj contains three match points . further , we use the term region to refer to a contiguous portion of the text and the term node to refer to a structural component of the document such as a chapter , a section , a subsection , etc. . thus , a node is a region with predefined topological-properties which are known both to the author of the document and to the user who searches the document system .
