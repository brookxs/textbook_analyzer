deriving a ranking-function for query terms given a query , we wish to order returned documents by descending . under the bim , this is modeled as ordering by . rather than estimating this probability directly , because we are interested only in the ranking of documents , we work with some other quantities which are easier to compute and which give the same ordering of documents . in particular , we can rank documents by their odds of relevance (as the odds of relevance is monotonic with the probability of relevance) . this makes things easier , because we can ignore the common denominator in rxq-bayes , giving : (66) the left term in the rightmost expression of equation 66 is a constant for a given query . since we are only ranking documents , there is thus no need for us to estimate it . the right-hand term does , however , require estimation , and this initially appears to be difficult : how can we accurately estimate the probability of an entire term incidence vector occurring ? it is at this point that we make the naive-bayes conditional-independence assumption that the presence or absence of a word in a document is independent of the presence or absence of any other word (given the query) : (67) (68) (69) let us make an additional simplifying assumption that terms not occurring in the query are equally likely to occur in relevant and nonrelevant documents : that is , if then . (this assumption can be changed , as when doing relevance-feedback in section 11.3.4 .) then we need only consider terms in the products that appear in the query , and so , (70) we can manipulate this expression by including the query terms found in the document into the right product , but simultaneously dividing through by them in the left product , so the value is unchanged . then we have : (71) retrieval status value (72) so everything comes down to computing the . define : (73) odds ratio 7.1
