relevance-feedback and query-expansion in most collections , the same concept may be referred to using different words . this issue , known as synonymy , has an impact on the recall of most information-retrieval-systems . for example , you would want a search for aircraft to match plane (but only for references to an airplane , not a woodworking plane) , and for a search on thermodynamics to match references to heat in appropriate discussions . users often attempt to address this problem themselves by manually refining a query , as was discussed in section 1.4 ; in this chapter we discuss ways in which a system can help with query-refinement , either fully automatically or with the user in the loop . the methods for tackling this problem split into two major classes : global methods and local methods . global methods are techniques for expanding or reformulating query terms independent of the query and results returned from it , so that changes in the query wording will cause the new query to match other semantically similar terms . global methods include : query expansion/reformulation with a thesaurus or wordnet (section 9.2.2) query-expansion via automatic-thesaurus-generation (section 9.2.3) techniques like spelling-correction (discussed in chapter 3) relevance-feedback (section 9.1) pseudo-relevance-feedback , also known as blind-relevance-feedback (section 9.1.6) (global) indirect relevance-feedback (section 9.1.7) subsections relevance-feedback and pseudo-relevance-feedback the rocchio-algorithm for relevance-feedback the underlying theory . the rocchio (1971) algorithm . probabilistic relevance feedback when does relevance-feedback work ? relevance-feedback on the web-evaluation of relevance-feedback strategies pseudo-relevance-feedback indirect relevance-feedback summary global methods for query-reformulation vocabulary tools for query-reformulation query-expansion automatic-thesaurus-generation references and further reading
