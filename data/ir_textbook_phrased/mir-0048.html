2.9.1 mode ! based on non-overlapping lists burkowski [132 , 133] proposes to divide the whole text of each document in non-overlapping text regions which are collected in a list since there are multiple ways to divide a text in non-overlapping regions , multiple lists are generated . for instance , we might have a list of all chapters in the document , a second list of all sections in the document , and a third list of all subsections in the document . these lists are kept as separate and distinct data-structures . while the text regions in the same (flat) list have no overlapping , text regions from distinct lists might overlap . figure 2.11 illustrates four separate lists for the same document . structured-text retrieval-models 63 chapter Ã± sections subsections subsubsections figure 2.11 representation of the structure in the text of a document through four separate (flat) indexing lists . to allow searching for index-terms and for text regions , a single inverted-file (see chapter 8 for a definition of inverted-files) is built in which each structural component stands as an entry in the index . associated with each entry , there is a list of text regions as a list of occurrences . moreover , such a list could be easily merged with the traditional inverted-file for the words in the text . since the text regions are non-overlapping , the types of queries which can be asked are simple : (a) select a region which contains a given word (and does not contain other regions) ; (b) select a region a which does not contain any other region b (where b belongs to a list distinct from the list for a) ; (c) select a region not contained within any other region , etc. .
