63.1 automatic-thesaurus-construction before considering wordnet , another elaborate thesaurus , it is useful to relate these manually constructed representations with automatic , statistically derived analogs . such comparisons have been part of ir research since its beginnings [joyce and needham , 1958 ; dennis , 1964 ; soergel , 1974] . section 5.2.5 has discussed how the same information used to cluster documents can be used with keywords . the semantics of relations based strictly on cooccurrence frequencies are not obvious [van rijsbergen , 1977] but seem to provide evidence for the rt (related term , or synonymy-relation) discussed earlier . using this information to construct hierarchic relations among keywords corresponds to (hierarchic) clustering-techniques . thesaurusspecific techniques generally exploit a heuristic that high-frequency keywords correspond to broad , general terms while low-frequency keywords correspond to narrow , specific ones [srinivasan , 1992] . this heuristic can be used to organize keywords into levels of a taxonomy , with the hierarchic parent/child relation formed between those keywords with similar document distributions . relevance-feedback can also be used to provide thesaurus structure [guntzer et al , 1989] . whether constructed manually or automatically , thesuarus structures support many new forms of navigation [rada and bicknell , 1989 ; mcmath et al. , 1989] . ellipses are used to elide some parts of this display : other types of lymphoma , moh-hodgkim and the redundant children of lymphoma expanded in the second two tree locations . 212 finding out about netscape : mesh browser i ; back forward reload home search guide images print security islt ; ; # # ^ jlfc ^ eater another mssh term to frrowse a general term for various aeo $ kstic diseases of tta lymjloii tissue . all mesh categorks disease ; cottgorv neoplasms fry histologis type il hot ´ ! te t ´ rm ` lym/pliom * .
