single-link the dissimilarity coefficient is the basic input to a single-link-clustering algorithm . the output is a hierarchy with associated numerical levels called a dendrogram . frequently the hierarchy is represented by a tree-structure such that each node represents a cluster . the two representations are shown side by side in figure 3.5 for the same set of objects {a , b , c , d , e} . the clusters are : {a , b} , {c} , {d} , {e} at level l1 , {a , b} , {c , d , e} at level l2 , and {a , b , c , d , e} at level l3 . at each level of the hierarchy one can identify a set of classes , and as one moves up the hierarchy the classes at the lower levels are nested in the classes at the higher levels . a mathematical definition of a dendrogram exists , but is of little use , so will be omitted . interested readers should consult jardine and sibson [2] . to give the reader a better feel for a single-link classification , there is a worked example (see figure 3.6) . a dc (dissimilarity coefficient) can be characterised by a set of graphs , one for each value taken by the dc . the different values taken by the dc in the example are l = .1 , .2 , .3 , .4 . the graph at each level is given by a set of vertices corresponding to the objects to be clustered , and any two vertices are linked if their dissimilarity is at most equal to the value of the level l . it should be clear that these graphs characterise the dc completely . given the graphs and their interpretation a dc can be recovered , and vice versa . graphs at values other than those taken by the dc are simply the same as at the next smallest value actually taken by the dc , for example , compare the graphs at l = .15 and l = .1 . it is now a simple matter to define single-link in terms of these graphs ; at any level a single-link cluster is precisely the set of vertices of a connected-component of the graph at that level . in the diagram i have enclosed each cluster with a dotted line . note that whereas the graphs at any two distinct values taken by the dc will be different , this is not necessarily the case for the corresponding clusters at those levels . it may be that by increasing the level the links introduced between vertices do not change the total number of connected vertices in a component . for example , the clusters at levels .3 and .4 are the same . the hierarchy is achieved by varying the level from the lowest possible value , increasing it through successive values of the dc until all objects are contained in one cluster . the reason for the name single-link is now apparent : for an object to belong to a cluster it needs to be linked to only one other member of the cluster . this description immediately leads to an inefficient algorithm for the generation of single-link classes . it was demonstrated in the example above . it simply consists of thresholding the dc at increasing levels of dissimilarity . the binary connection matrices are then calculated at each threshold level , from which the connected-components can easily be extracted . this is the basis for many published single-link algorithms . from the point-of-view of ir , where one is trying to construct a searchable tree it is too inefficient (see van rijsbergen [48] for an appropriate implementation) .
