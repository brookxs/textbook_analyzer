4.3.6 normalized recall and precision the best/worst `` envelope '' surrounding an actual re/pre curve is related to a similar comparison known as normalized recall [rocchio , 1966] . imagine plotting the fraction of relevant documents retrieved as a function of the fraction of the total number of documents retrieved . such a function is plotted in figure 4.13 . comparing the area between the actual retrieval and the worst-case (shaded) to the total-area between the assessing the retrieval 129 1.0 nrel recall nrel rj ndoc rank figure 4.13 normalized recall best (hashed) and worst cases (that above the region) is very much like the best/worst-case envelope of figure 4.12 . we can derive expressions for this area . let r j be the hitlist rank of the fth relevant-document . then the area under the curve corresponding to any actual query is (if we define ro = 0) : nrel actual = nrel (4.7) in the best case r ; best = i : nrel + l nrel nrel ^ ' 2 when nrel ógt ; oo . in the worst-case ri = ndoc ó nrel + i : ((ndoc - nrel + i) - (ndoc - nrel + i - 1)) ï i (4.8) worst = nrel = ndoc - nrel (4.9)
