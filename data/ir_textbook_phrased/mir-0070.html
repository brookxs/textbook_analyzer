4.2.1 single-word queries the most elementary query that can be formulated in a text-retrieval-system is a word . text-documents are assumed to be essentially long-sequences of words . although some models present a more general view , virtually all models allow us keyword-based querying 101 to see the text in this perspective and to search words . some models are also able to see the internal division of words into letters . these latter models permit the searching of other types of patterns , which are covered in section 4.3 . the set of words retrieved by these extended queries can then be fed into the word-treating machinery , say to perform thesaurus-expansion or for ranking purposes . a word is normally defined in a rather simple way . the alphabet is split into ` letters ' and ` separators , ' and a word is a sequence of letters surrounded by separators . more complex-models allow us to specify that some characters are not letters but do not split a word , e.g. the hyphen in ` on-line . ' it is good practice to leave the choice of what is a letter and what is a separator to the manager of the text-database . the division of the text into words is not arbitrary , since words carry a lot of meaning in natural-language . because of that , many models (such as the vector-model) are completely structured on the concept of words , and words are the only type of queries allowed (moreover , some systems only allow a small set of words to be extracted from the documents) . the result of word queries is the set of documents containing at least one of the words of the query . further , the resulting documents are ranked according to a degree of similarity to the query . to support ranking , two common statistics on word occurrences inside texts are commonly used : ` term-frequency ' which counts the number of times a word appears inside a document and ` inverse-document-frequency ' which counts the number of documents in which a word appears . see chapter 2 for more details . additionally , the exact positions where a word appears in the text may be required for instance , by an-interface which highlights each occurrence of that word .
