1 . calculation of emim the calculation of the expected mutual-information measure can be simplified . then emim itself can be approximated to reduce the computation-time even further . we take the simplification first . when computing i (xi , xj) for the purpose of constructing an mst we need only to know the rank ordering of the i (xi , xj) 's . the absolute values do not matter . therefore if we use simple maximum-likelihood estimates for the probabilities based on the data contained in the following table (using the same notation as on p. 125) . then i (xi , xj) will be strictly monotone with this is an extremely simple formulation of emim and easy to compute . consider the case when it is p (x) we are trying to calculate . the mst is then based on co-occurrence data derived from the entire collection . once we have this (i.e. [1]) and know the number of documents ([9]) in the file then any inverted-file will contain the rest of the frequency data needed to fill in the counts in the other cells . that is from [5] and [7] given by the inverted-file we can deduce [2] [3] [4] [6] and [8] . the problem of what to do with zero entries in one of the cells 1 to 4 is taken care of by letting 0 log 0 = 0 . the marginals can not be zero since we are only concerned with terms that occur at least once in the documents . next we discuss the possibility of approximation . maron and kuhns [19] in their early work used d (xi , xj) = p (xi = 1 , xj = 1) - p (xi = 1) p (xj = 1) (*) to measure the deviation from independence for any two index-terms i and j. apart from the log this is essentially the first term of the emim expansion . an mst (dependence tree) constructed on the basis of (*) clearly would not lead to an optimal approximation of p (x/wi) but the fit might be good enough and certainly the corresponding tree can be calculated more efficiently based on (*) than one based on the full emim . similarly ivie [20] used as a measure of association . no doubt there are other ways of approximating the emim which are easier to compute , but whether they can be used to find a dependence tree leading to good approximation of the joint-probability function must remain a matter for experimental test .
