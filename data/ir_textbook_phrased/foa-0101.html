5.4.2 clustering-algorithms because of its widespread application , clustering is one of the most wellstudied problems within statistics and computer-science [jain and dubes , 1988 ; griffiths et al. , 1986] . it can be stated in generic terms , in terms of an arbitrary-similarity-measure between items to be clustered . especially in iterative applications of clustering , the relative-frequency of various clustering-techniques matters . the art , therefore , in applying a clustering-method in a particular application depends greatly on the particular features of items to be clustered and the number of partitions within which these items are to be clustered . w. willett has provided an excellent survey of applications of clustering applied to various aspects of the foa task [willett , 1988] . more recently , zamir has considered clusterings of document `` snippets '' (roughly the same as the paragraph units proposed in section 2.3) rather than on complete documents [zamir and etzioni , 1998] . the most typical clustering-method for application within the foa context is single-link hierarchical-clustering . this is considered an agglomerative technique , because it begins with each data point considered to be in its own cluster and then iteratively asks which two clusters should be combined . ^ the most typical method for performing this task builds a minimum-spanning-tree (mst) , iteratively merging the two documents that are closest together and then including the merged nodes . the result is a tree from the finally merged root to each of the documents as a leaf . alternatively , the complete set of interdocument similarity-measures can be progressively `` filtered '' by a gradually increasing threshold , which is used to define whether two documents are considered connected by an edge . we can then ask for certain properties of the emerging graph , for example , stopping when all components become connected . to keep things simple and focused on robust assumptions [van rijsbergen , p. 59] , o (n2) algorithms are assumed . one early motivation for clustering-algorithms was efficient disk access : if documents were preclustered appropriately , it would be likely mathematical foundations 167 that a `` page '' of disk memory containing one document-matching a query might also contain other elements of the same cluster . that is , an efficient physical disk allocation algorithm might try to ensure that clustered documents were written to the same block . this example suggests how mst representations of the documents might also support efficient query/document matching-algorithms . in brief , the mst can be interpreted as a `` decision-tree , '' with a query beginning at the root and comparing itself to a candidate representation (e.g. , centroid) of each cluster . the cluster-hypothesis suggests that if a document that is similar to the query is relevant , then other documents similar to it are likely to also be relevant . by clustering neighboring documents , nearest-neighbor documents should also be retrieved . but as cutting et al. note , for a partitioning cluster to be useful in this application k must be very near jv [cutting et al. , 1992] . we do not want to retrieve more than a linear constant of other documents when we retrieve one . scattergather is an intereseting example of how partitional-clustering can be applied in a provocative way [cutting et al. , 1992 ; hearst and pedersen , 1992] . beginning with a clustering of the entire corpus , initial queries are posed by selecting some of the clusters . documents identified as members of these clusters form a new subcorpus ; clustering is applied across these , and so on . evaluating the utility of such a novel browsing pattern is difficult , but the ability of the scattergather interface (as well as a similar effort applied to the macos interface called piles [rose et al , 1993] to improve retrieval-effectiveness is quite clear . a problematic feature of the scattergather procedure is its sensitivity to the selection of initial `` buckshot '' random seeds . but cutting does n't necessarily see this as a bug : indeed , the lack of determinism might be interpreted as a feature , since the user then had the option of discarding an unrevealing partition in favor of a fresh re-clustering .
