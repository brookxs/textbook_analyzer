8.8 compression in this section we discuss the issues of searching-compressed-text directly and of searching compressed indices . compression is important when available storage is a limiting factor , as is the case of indexing the-web . searching and compression were traditionally regarded as exclusive operations . texts which were not to be searched could be compressed , and to search compression 223 a compressed text it had to be decompressed first . in recent years , very efficient compression techniques have appeared that allow searching directly in the compressed text . moreover , the search-performance is improved , since the cpu times are similar but the disk times are largely reduced . this leads to a win-win situation . discussion on how common text and lists of numbers can be compressed has been covered in chapter 7 .
