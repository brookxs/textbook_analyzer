12.5.3 experiments we now present experimental-results [244] with gemini on color , using the bounding theorem , the experiments compare the relative-performance (in terms of cpu-time and disk accesses) between first , simple sequential evaluation of dhist f ∞ r a ^ database vectors (referred to as ` naive ') , and second , gemini . the experiments report the total and the cpu times required by the methods , by performing simulations on a database of n = 924 color-image histograms , each of a ; = 256 colors , of assorted natural images . results are shown in figure 12.9 , which presents the total response-time as a function of the selectivity (ratio of actual hits over the database-size n) . the figure also shows the cpu-time for each method . notice that , even for a selectivity of 5 % (which would return ~ 50 images to the user) , the gemini method is much faster than the straightforward , sequential computation of the histogram distances . in fact , it requires from a fraction of a second up to ´ 4 seconds , while the naive method requires consistently ´ 10 seconds . moreover , notice that for larger databases , the naive method will have a linearly increasing response-time . thus , the conclusions are the following : ï the gemini approach (i.e. , the idea to extract some features for a quick-and-dirty test) motivated a fast method , using the average rgb distance ; it also motivated a strong theorem (the so-called qdb theorem [244]) which guarantees the correctness in our case . ï in addition to resolving the cross-talk problem , gemini solved the ` dimensionality-curse ' problem at no extra cost , requiring only / = 3 features , as opposed to k = 64 or 256 that dhtst {-rrb- required .
