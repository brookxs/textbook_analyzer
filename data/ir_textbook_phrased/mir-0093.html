5.4.1 query-expansion based on a similarity-thesaurus in this section we discuss a query-expansion model based on a global similarity-thesaurus which is constructed automatically [655] . the similarity-thesaurus is based on term to term-relationships rather than on a matrix of co-occurrence (as discussed in section 5.3) . the distinction is made clear in the discussion below . furthermore , special attention is paid to the selection of terms for expansion and to the reweighting of these terms . in contrast to previous global-analysis approaches , terms for expansion are selected based on their similarity to the whole query rather than on their similarities to individual query terms . a similarity-thesaurus is built considering term to term-relationships . however , such relationships are not derived directly from co-occurrence of terms inside documents . rather , they are obtained by considering that the terms are concepts in a concept-space . in this concept-space , each term is indexed by the documents in which it appears . thus , terms assume the original role of documents while documents are interpreted as indexing elements . the following definitions establish the proper framework . definition as before (see chapter 2) , let t he the number of terms in the collection , n be the number of documents in the collection , and fx j be the frequency 132 query-operations of occurrence of the term k {in the document dj . further , let tj be the number of distinct index-terms in the document dj and itfj be the inverse term-frequency for document dj . then , t itfj = log ó analogously to the definition of inverse-document-frequency . within this framework , to each term k {is associated a vector fc $ given by where , as in chapter 2 , wi0 is a weight associated to the index-document pair [ki , dj] . here , however , these weights are computed in a rather distinct form as follows . where maxj (fij) computes the maximum of all factors / ^ for the i-th term (i.e. , over all documents in the collection) . we notice that the expression above is a variant of tf-idf weights hut one which considers inverse term frequencies instead . the relationship between two terms ku and kv is computed as a correlation factor cu ^ v given by wuj x wvj (5.12) we notice that this is a variation of the correlation-measure used for computing scalar association matrices (defined by equation 5.5) . the main difference is that the weights are based on interpreting documents as indexing elements instead of repositories for term-co-occurrence . the global similarity-thesaurus is built through the computation of the correlation factor cu , v for each pair of indexing terms [ku , kv] in the collection (analogously to the procedure in section 5.3) . of course , this is computationally expensive . however , this global similarity-thesaurus has to be computed only once and can be updated incrementally . given the global similarity-thesaurus , query-expansion is done in three steps as follows . ï first , represent the query in the concept-space used for representation of the index-terms . automatic global-analysis 133 ï second , based on the global similarity-thesaurus , compute a similarity sirn (q , kv) between each term kv correlated to the query terms and the whole query q. ï third , expand the query with the top r ranked terms according to sim (q , kv) . for the first step , the query is represented in the concept-space of index term vectors as follows . definition to the query q is associated a vector q in the term-concept space given by q = y} twliqki where wi , q is a weight associated to the index-query pair [kt , q] . this weight is computed analogously to the index-document weight formula in equation 5.11 . for the second step , a similarity sim (q , kv) between each term kv (correlated to the query terms) and the user-query q is computed as sim (q , kv) = q - kv = kueq where cu , v is the correlation factor given in equation 5.12 . as illustrated in figure 5.2 , a term might be quite close to the whole query while its distances to individual query terms are larger . this implies that the terms selected here for query-expansion might be distinct from those selected by previous global-analysis methods (which adopted a similarity to individual query terms for deciding terms for query-expansion) . for the third step , the top r ranked terms according to sim (q , kv) are added to the original query q to form the expanded query q . to each expansion term kv in the query q is assigned a weight wvq ' given by ^ _ sirnjq.ky) wv , q ~ ~ np the expanded query q is then used to retrieve new documents to the user . this completes the technique for query-expansion based on a similarity-thesaurus . contrary to previous global-analysis approaches , this technique has yielded improved retrieval-performance (in the range of 20 %) with three different collections . it is worthwhile making one final observation . consider a document dj which is represented in the term-concept space by dj = * % 2ktäd u?ij ^ ´ - further , assume that the original query q is expanded to include all tne t index-terms 134 query-operations q = lka , kb) figure 5.2 the distance of a given term kv to the query centroid qc might be quite distinct from the distances of kv to the individual query terms . (properly weighted) in the collection . then , the similarity sim (q ^ dj) between the document dj and the query q can be computed in the term-concept space by e vj x wu , q x cu , v such an expression is analogous to the formula for query-document similarity in the generalized vector-space-model (see chapter 2) . thus , the generalized vector-space-model can be interpreted as a query-expansion technique . the main differences with the term-concept idea are the weight computation and the fact that only the top r ranked terms are used for query-expansion with the term-concept technique .
