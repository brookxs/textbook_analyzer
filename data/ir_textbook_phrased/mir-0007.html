1.2.1 the user task the user of a retrieval-system has to translate his information-need into a query in the language provided by the system . with an information-retrieval-system , this normally implies specifying a set of words which convey the semantics of the information-need . with a data-retrieval-system , a query expression (such as , for instance , a regular-expression) is used to convey the constraints that must be satisfied by objects in the answer set . in both cases , we say that the user searches for useful information executing a retrieval-task . consider now a user who has an interest which is either poorly denned or which is inherently broad . for instance , the user might be interested in documents about car racing in general . in this situation , the user might use an interactive-interface to simply look around in the collection for documents related to car racing . for instance , he might find interesting documents about formula 1 racing , about car manufacturers , or about the '24 hours of le mans .1 furthermore , while reading about the k24 hours of le mans \ he might turn his attention to a document which provides directions to le alans and , from there , to documents which cover tourism in france . in this situation , we say that the user is browsing the documents in the collection , not searching . it is still a process of retrieving information , but one whose main objectives are not clearly defined in the beginning and whose purpose might change during the interaction with the system . in this book , we1 make a clear distinction between the different tasks the liber of t lie retrieval-system might be engaged in . his task might be of two distinct types : information or data-retrieval and browsing . classic information-retrieval-systems normally allow information or data-retrieval . hypertext-systems are usually tuned for providing quick browsing . modern digital-library and web-interfaces might attempt to combine these tasks to provide improved retrieval capabilities . however , combination of retrieval-and-browsing is not yet a well basic concepts 5 established approach and is not the dominant paradigm . figure 1.1 illustrates the interaction of the user through the different tasks we identify . information and data retrieval are usually provided by most modern information retrieval-systems (such as web-interfaces) . further , such systems might also provide some (still limited) form of browsing . while combining information and data retrieval with browsing is not yet a common practice , it might become so in the future . both retrieval-and-browsing are , in the language of the world-wide-web , ` pulling ' actions . that is , the user requests the information in an interactive manner . an alternative is to do retrieval in an automatic and permanent fashion using software-agents which push the information towards the user . for instance , information useful to a user could be extracted periodically from a news-service . in this case , we say that the ir-system is executing a particular retrieval-task which consists of filtering relevant-information for later inspection by the user . we briefly discuss filtering in chapter 2 .
