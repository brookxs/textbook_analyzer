introduction so far very little has been said about the actual process by which the required information is located . in the case of document-retrieval the information is the subset of documents which are deemed to be relevant to the query . in chapter 4 , occasional reference was made to search efficiency , and the appropriateness of a file-structure for searching . the kind of search that is of interest , is not the usual kind where the result of the search is clear cut , either yes , the item is present , or no , the item is absent . good discussions of these may be found in knuth [1] and salton [2] . they are of considerable importance when dictionaries need to be set-up or consulted during text-processing . however , we are more interested in search-strategies in which the documents retrieved may be more or less relevant to the request . all search-strategies are based on comparison between the query and the stored documents . sometimes this comparison is only achieved indirectly when the query is compared with clusters (or more precisely with the profiles representing the clusters) . the distinctions made between different kinds of search-strategies can sometimes be understood by looking at the query-language , that is the language in which the information-need is expressed . the nature of the query-language often dictates the nature of the search-strategy . for example , a query-language which allows search statements to be expressed in terms of logical combinations of keywords normally dictates a boolean search . this is a search which achieves its results by logical (rather than numerical) comparisons of the query with the documents . however , i shall not examine query-languages but instead capture the differences by talking about the search mechanisms .
