13.8.1 web-query-languages up to this point , queries have been based on the content of each page . however , queries can also include the link-structure connecting web-pages . for example , we would like to search for all the-web pages that contain at least one image and are reachable from a given site following at most three links . to be able to pose this type of query , different data-models have been used . the most important are a labeled graph-model to represent web-pages (nodes) and hyperlinks (edges) between web-pages , and a semi-structured-data-model to represent the content of wreb pages . in the latter model , the data schema is not usually known , may change over time , may be large and descriptive , etc. [2 , 129] . although some models and languages for querying hypertext were proposed before the-web appeared [563 , 72 , 184] , the first generation of web query-languages were aimed at combining content with structure (see also chapter 4) . these languages combine patterns that appear within the documents with graph-queries describing link-structure (using path regular-expressions) . they include w3ql [450] , websql [556 , 33] , weblog [476] , and wql [511] . the second generation of languages , called web-data manipulation languages , maintain the emphasis on semi-structured-data . however , they extend the previous languages by providing access to the structure of web-pages (the model also includes the internal-structure) and by allowing the creation of new structures as a result of a query . languages in this category include struql [253] , florid [373] , and weboql [32] . all the languages mentioned are meant to be used by programs , not final users . nevertheless , there are some examples of query-interfaces for these languages . web-query-languages have been extended to other web-tasks , such as extracting and integrating information from web-pages , and constructing and restructuring web-sites . more details about web-query-languages can be found in the excellent survey by florescu , levy , and mendelzon [258] . trends and research-issues 393
