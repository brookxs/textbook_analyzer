4.2.5 conclusions frakes summarized studies of various stemming studies (frakes-92) . he cautions that some of the authors failed to report test-statistics , especially sizes , data-structure 81 making interpretation difficult . also some of the test sample sizes were so small as to make their results questionable . frakes came to the following conclusions : stemming can affect retrieval (recall) and where effects were identified they were positive . there is little difference between retrieval-effectiveness of different frill stemmers with the exception of the hafer and weiss stemmer . stemming is as effective as manual conflation . stemming is dependent upon the nature of the vocabulary . to quantify the impact of stemmers , paice has defined a stemming performance-measure called error-rate relative to truncation (errt) that can be used to compare stemming algorithms (paice-94) . the approach depends upon the ability to partition terms semantically and morphologically related to each other into `` concept groups . '' after applying a stemmer that is not perfect , concept groups may still contain multiple stems rather than one . this introduces an error reflected in the understemming index (ui) . also it is possible that the same stem is found in multiple groups . this error-state is reflected in the overstemming index (01) . the worst-case stemming algorithm is where words are stemmed via truncation to a word length (words shorter than the length are not truncated) . ui and 01 values can be calculated based upon truncated word lengths . the perfect case is where ui and 01 equal zero . errt is then calculated as the distance from the origin to the (ui , 01) coordinate of the stemmer being evaluated (op) versus the distance from the origin to the worst-case intersection of the line generated by pure truncation (ot) (see figure 4-4) . the values calculated are biased by the initial grouping of the test terms . larger errt values occur with looser grouping . for the particular test runs , the ui of the porter algorithm was greater than the ui of the paice/husk algorithms (paice-90) . the 01 was largest for the paice and the least for porter . finally , the errt of the porter was greater than the paice algorithm . these results suggest that the paice algorithm appeared significantly better than the porter algorithm . but the differences in objectives between the stemmers (porter being a light stemmer - tries to avoid overstemming leaving understemming errors and paice being the opposite , a heavy stemmer) makes comparison less meaningful . while this approach to stemmer evaluation requires additional work to remove imprecisions and provide a common comparison framework , it provides a mechanism to develop a baseline to discuss future developments . the comparisons by frakes and paice support the intuitive feeling that stemming as a generalization of processing tokens for a particular concept (word) can only help in recall . in experiments , stemming has never been proven to significantly improve recall (harman-91) . stemming can potentially reduce 82 chapter 4 01 ul figure 4.4 computation of errt value precision . the impact on precision can be minimized by the use of ranking items based upon all the terms in the query , categorization of terms and selective exclusion of some terms from stemming . unless the user is very restrictive in the query , the impact of the other search-terms and those expanded automatically by the system ameliorates the effects of generalization caused by stemming . stemming in large-databases should not be viewed as a significant compression-technique to save on storage . its major advantage is in the significant reduction of dictionary sizes and therefore a possible reduction in the processing-time for each search-term .
