13.4.2 distributed-architecture there are several variants of the crawler-indexer architecture . among them , the most important is harvest [108] . harvest uses a distributed-architecture to gather and distribute data , which is more efficient than the crawler architecture . the main drawback is that harvest requires the coordination of several web-servers . the harvest distributed approach addresses several of the problems of the crawler-indexer architecture , such as : (1) web-servers receive requests from different crawlers , increasing their load ; (2) web-traffic increases because crawlers retrieve entire objects , but most of their content is discarded ; and (3) information is gathered independently by each crawler , without coordination between all the search-engines . to solve these problems , harvest introduces two main elements : gatherers and brokers . a gatherer collects and extracts indexing information from one or more web-servers . gathering times are defined by the system and are periodic (i.e. there are harvesting times as the name of the system suggests) . a broker provides the indexing-mechanism and the query-interface to the data gathered . brokers retrieve information from one or more gatherers or other brokers , updating incrementally their indices . depending on the configuration of gatherers and brokers , different improvements on server load and network-traffic can be 376 searching the-web figure 13.4 harvest architecture . achieved . for example , a gatherer can run on a web-server , generating no external traffic for that server . also , a gatherer can send information to several brokers , avoiding work repetition . brokers can also filter information and send it to other brokers . this design allows the sharing of work and information in a very flexible and generic manner . an example of the harvest architecture is shown in figure 13.4 [108] . one of the goals of harvest is to build topic-specific brokers , focusing the index contents and avoiding many of the vocabulary and scaling problems of generic indices . harvest includes a distinguished broker that allows other brokers to register information about gatherers and brokers . this is useful to search for an appropriate broker or gatherer when building a new system . the harvest architecture also provides replicators and object caches . a replicator can be used to replicate servers , enhancing user-base scalability . for example , the registration broker can be replicated in different geographic regions to allow faster access . replication can also be used to divide the gathering process between many web-servers . finally , the object cache reduces network and server load , as well as response latency when accessing web-pages . more details on the system can be found in [108] . currently , there are hundreds of harvest applications on the web (for example , the cia , nasa , the us national academy of sciences , and the us government printing office) , as this software is on the public domain . ! netscape 's catalog server is a commercial version of harvest and network-appliances * cache is a commercial version of the harvest cache . | information is available at haxvest.transaxc.com . search-engines 377 enter ransyng key-words in i ^ langu ^ e a [flange of dales : frem : if - ; , j count decumettts matching the bo to take advantage of advanced-search-features , please consult the help section . figure 13.5 query-interface for complex-queries in altavista .
