normalisation it is probably useful at this stage to recapitulate and show how a number of levels of normalisation of text is involved in generating document representatives . at the lowest level we have the document which is merely described by a string of words . the first step in normalisation is to remove the ` fluff ' words . we now have what traditionally might have been called the ` keywords ' . the next stage might be to conflate these words into classes and describe documents by sets of class-names which in modern terminology are the keywords or index-terms . the next level is the construction of keyword classes by automatic-classification . strictly speaking this is where the normalisation stops . index-term-weighting can also be thought of as a process of normalisation , if the weighting-scheme takes into account the number of different index-terms per document . for example , we may wish to ensure that a match in one term among ten carries more weight than one among twenty . similarly , the process of weighting by frequency of occurrence in the total document-collection is an attempt to normalise document representatives with respect to expected frequency distributions .
