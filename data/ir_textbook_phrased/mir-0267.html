13.7.2 some examples now we give a couple of search examples . one problem with full-text-retrieval is that although many queries can be effective , many others are a total deception . the main reason is that a set of words does not capture all the semantics of a document . there is too much contextual-information (that can be explicit or even implicit) lost at indexing time , which is essential for proper understanding . for example , suppose that we want to learn an oriental game such as shogi or go . for the first case , searching for shogi will quickly give us good web-pages where we can find what shogi is (a variant of chess) and its rules . however , for go the task is complicated , because unlike shogi , go is not a unique word in english (in particular , because uppercase letters are converted to lowercase letters , see chapter 7) . the problem of having more than one meaning for a word is called polysem , y . we can add more terms to the query , such as game and japanese but still we are out of luck , as the pages found are almost all about japanese games written in english where the common verb go is used . another common problem comes from synonyms . if we are searching for a certain word , but a relevant page uses a synonym , we will not find it . the following example (taken from [152]) better explains the polysemy problem , where the ambiguity comes from the same language . suppose that we want to find the running speed of the jaguar , a big south american cat . a first naive search in altavista would be jaguar speed . the results are pages that talk about the jaguar car , an atari video-game , a us football team , a local-network server , etc. . the first page about the animal is ranked 183 and is a fable , without information about the speed . in a second try , we add the term cat . the answers are about the clans nova cat and smoke jaguar , lmg enterprises , fine cars , etc. . only the page ranked finding the needigital librarye in the haystack 391 25 has some information on jaguars but not the speed . suppose we try yahoo! . we look at ` science : biology : zoology : animals : cats : wild_cats ' and ` science : biology : animal_beliavior . ' no information about jaguars there .
