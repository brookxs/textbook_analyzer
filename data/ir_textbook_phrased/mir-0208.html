10.7.3 fetching relevant-information in the background standard relevance-feedback is predicated on the goal of improving an ad-hoc query or building a profile for a routing query . more recently researchers have begun developing systems that monitor users ' progress and behavior over long interaction periods in an attempt to predict which documents or actions the user is likely to want in future . these systems are called semi-automated assistants or recommender ` agents , ' and often make use of machine-learning-techniques [565] . some of these systems require explicit user input in the form of a goal statement [406] or relevance-judgements [629] , while others quietly record users ' actions and try to make inferences based on these actions . a system developed by kozierok and maes [460 , 536] makes predictions about how users will handle email-messages (what order to read them in , where to file them) and how users will schedule meetings in a calendar manager application . the system ` looks over the shoulder7 of the users , recording every relevant action into a database . after enough data has been accumulated , the system uses a nearest-neighbors method [743] to predict a user 's action based on the similarity of the current-situation to situations already encountered . for example , if the user almost always saves email-messages from a particular person into a particular file , the system can offer to automate this action the next time a message from that person arrives [536] . this system integrates learning from both implicit and explicit user-feedback . if a user ignores the system 's suggestion , the system treats this as negative-feedback , and accordingly adds the overriding action to the action database . after certain types of incorrect predictions , the system asks the user questions that allow it to adjust the weight of the feature that caused the error . finally , the user can explicitly train the system by presenting it with hypothetical examples of input-action pairs . another system , syskill and webert [629] , attempts to learn a user-profile based on explicit relevance judgements of pages explored while browsing the-web . in a sense this is akin to standard relevance-feedback , except the user judgements are retained across sessions and the interaction-model differs : as the user browses a new web page , the links on the page are automatically annotated as to whether or not they should be relevant to the user 's interest . a related system is letizia [518] , whose goal is to bring to the user 's attention a percentage of the available next moves that are most likely to be of interest , given the user 's earlier actions . upon request , letizia provides recommendations for further action on the user 's part , usually in the form of suggestions of links to follow when the user is unsure what to do next . the system monitors the user 's behavior while navigating and reading web-pages , and concurrently evaluates the links reachable from the current page . the system uses only implicit-feedback . thus , saving a page as a bookmark is taken as strong positive evidence for the terms in the corresponding web-page . links skipped are taken as negative support for the information reachable from the link . selected links can indicate positive or negative evidence , depending on how much time the user spends on the resulting page and whether or not the decision to leave a page quickly is later reversed . additionally , the evidence for user-interest remains persistent across 308 user-interfaces and visualization browsing sessions . thus , a user who often reads kayaking pages is at another time reading the home-page of a professional contact and may be alerted to the fact that the colleague 's personal interests page contains a link to a shared hobby . the system uses a best-first-search strategy and heuristics to determine which pages to recommend most strongly . a more user-directed approach to prefetching potentially relevant-information is seen in the butterfly system [531] . this interface helps the user follow a series of citation links from a given reference , an important information-seeking strategy [66] . the system automatically examines the document the user is currently reading and prefetches the bibliographic-citations it refers to . it also retrieves lists of articles that cite the focus document . the underlying assumption is that the services from which the citations are requested do not respond immediately . rather than making the user wait during the delay associated with each request , the system handles many requests in parallel and the interface uses graphics and animations to show the incrementally growing list of available citations . the system does not try to be clever about which cites to bring first ; rather the user can watch the ` organically ' growing visualization of the document and its citations , and based on what looks relevant , direct the system as to which parts of the citation space to spend more time on .
