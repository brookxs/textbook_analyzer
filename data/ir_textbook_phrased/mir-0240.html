12.5 two-dimensional color-images gemini has also been applied for color-images , within the qbic project of ibm . the qbic (query-by-image-content) project studies methods to query large online image databases using the images ' content as the basis of the queries . examples of the content include color , texture , shape , position , and dominant edges of image items and regions . potential applications include medical (`` give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one ') , photojournalism (` give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom '') , and many others in art , fashion , cataloging , retailing , and industry . here we will discuss methods on databases of still-images , with two main datatypes : images ' (= `` scenes ') and ` items . ' a scene is a (color) image , and an item is a part of a scene , for example , a person , a piece of outlined texture , or an apple . each scene has zero or more items . the identification and extraction of items is beyond the scope of this discussion (see [603] for more details) . in this section we give an overview of the indexing aspects of qbic , and specifically the distance-functions and the application of the gemini approach . more details about the algorithms and the implementation of qbic are in [257] .
