bibliographic remarks the book by lancaster and fayen [16] contains details of many operational on-line systems . barraclough [17] has written an interesting survey article about on-line searching . discussions on search-strategies are usually found embedded in more general papers on information-retrieval . there are , however , a few specialist references worth mentioning . anew classic paper on the limitations of a boolean search is verhoeff et al. [18] . miller [19] has tried to get away from a simple boolean search by introducing a form of weighting although maintaining essentially a boolean search . angione [20] discusses the equivalence of boolean and weighted searching . rickman [21] has described a way of introducing automatic feedback into a boolean search . goffman [22] has investigated an interesting search-strategy based on the idea that the relevance of a document to a query is conditional on the relevance of other documents to that query . in an early paper by hyvarinen [23] , one will find an information-theoretic definition of the ` typical member ' cluster representative . negoita [24] gives a theoretical discussion of a bottom-up search-strategy in the context of cluster-based-retrieval . much of the early work on relevance-feedback done on the smart project has now been reprinted in salton [25] . two other independence pieces of work on feedback are stanfel [26] and bono [27] .
