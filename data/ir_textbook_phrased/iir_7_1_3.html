champion lists champion lists fancy lists top docs champion list now , given a query we create a set as follows : we take the union of the champion lists for each of the terms comprising . we now restrict cosine computation to only the documents in . a critical parameter in this scheme is the value , which is highly application dependent . intuitively , should be large compared with , especially if we use any form of the index elimination described in section 7.1.2 . one issue here is that the value is set at the time of index-construction , whereas is application dependent and may not be available until the query is received ; as a result we may (as in the case of index elimination) find ourselves with a set that has fewer than documents . there is no reason to have the same value of for all terms in the dictionary ; it could for instance be set to be higher for rarer terms .
