10.3.3 earlier interface studies the bulk of the literature on studies of human-computer information seeking behavior concerns information-intermediaries using online systems consisting of bibliographic-records (e.g. , [546 , 707 , 104]) , sometimes with costs assessed per time unit . unfortunately , many of the assumptions behind those studies do not reflect the conditions of modern information access [335 , 222] . the differences include the following : ï the text being searched now is often full text rather than bibliographic-citations . because users have access to full text , rather than document surrogates , it is more likely that simple queries will find relevant answers directly as part of the search-process . ï modern systems use statistical-ranking (which is more effective when abstracts and full text are available than when only titles and citations are available) whereas most studies were performed on boolean systems . ï much of modern searching is done by end-users , many new to online searching , rather than professional intermediaries , which were the focus of many of the earlier studies . ï tens of thousands of sources are now available online on networked-information systems , and many are tightly-coupled via hyperlinks , as opposed to being stored in separate collections owned by separate services . earlier studies generally used systems in which moving from one collection to another required prior-knowledge of the collections and considerable time and effort to switch . a near miss is much more useful in this hyperlinked environment than in earlier systems , since hyperlinks allow users to navigate from the near miss directly to the source containing information of interest . in a card catalog environment , where documents are represented as isolated units , a near miss consists of finding a book in the general area-of-interest and then going to the bookshelf in the library to look for related books , or obtaining copies of many issues of a journal and scanning for related articles . ï finally , most users have access to bit-mapped displays allowing for direct-manipulation , or at least form fiuin . most earlier studies arid bibliographic systems were implemented on tty displays , which require command-line_based syntax and do a poor job of retaining context . starting-points 267 despite these significant differences , some general information-seeking strategies have been identified that seem to transfer across systems . additionally , although modern systems have remedied many of the problems of earlier online-public-access-catalogs , they also introduce new problems of their own .
