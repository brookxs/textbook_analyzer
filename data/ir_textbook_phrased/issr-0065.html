4.7.3 xml the extensible-markup-language (xml) is starting to become a standard data-structure on the web . its first recommendation (1.0) was issued on february 10 , 1998 . it is a middle ground between the simplicities but lack of flexibility of html and the complexity but richness of sgml (iso 8879) . its objective is extending html with semantic-information . the logical data structure within xml is defined by a data-type description (dtd) and is not constrained to the 70 defined tags and 50 attributes in the single dtd for html . the user can create any tags needed to describe and manipulate their structure . the w3c (worldwide-web consortium) is redeveloping html as a suite of xml tags . the following is a simple example of xml-tagging : lt ; companygt ; widgets inc.lt ; / companygt ; lt ; citygt ; bostonlt ; / citygt ; lt ; stategt ; masslt ; / stategt ; lt ; prodoctgt ; widgetslt ; / productgt ; the w3c is also developing a resource-description format (rdf) for representing properties of web-resources such as images , documents and relationships between them . this will include the platform for internet-content selection (pics) for attaching labels to material for filtering (e.g. , unsuitable for children) . data-structure 99 hypertext-links for xml are being defined in the xlink (xml linking language) and xpoint (xml pointer language) specifications . this will allow for distinction for different types of links to locations within a document and external to the document . this will allow an application to know if a link is just a repositioning reference within an item or link to another document that is an extension of the existing document . this will help in determining what needs to be retrieved to define the total item to be indexed . finally xml will include an xml style sheet linking definition to define how to display items on a particular style sheet and handle cascading-style-sheets . this will allow designers to limit what is displayed to the user (saving on display screen-space) and allow expansion to the whole item if desired .
