cataloging and indexing 57 3.2.1 scope of indexing when performed manually , the process of reliably and consistently determining the bibliographic terms that represent the concepts in an item is extremely difficult . problems arise from interaction of two sources : the author and the indexer . the vocabulary domain of the author may be different than that of the indexer , causing the indexer to misinterpret the emphasis and possibly even the concepts being presented . the indexer is not an expert on all areas and has different levels of knowledge in the different areas being presented in the item . this results in different quality levels of indexing . the indexer must determine when to stop the indexing process . there are two factors involved in deciding on what level to index the concepts in an item : the exhaustivity and the specificity of indexing desired . exhaustivity of indexing is the extent to which the different concepts in the item are indexed . for example , if two sentences of a 10-page item on microprocessors discusses on-board caches , should this concept be indexed ? specificity relates to the preciseness of the index-terms used in indexing . for example , whether the term `` processor '' or the term `` microcomputer '' or the term `` pentium '' should be used in the index of an item is based upon the specificity decision . indexing an item only on the most important concept in it and using general index-terms yields low exhaustivity and specificity . this approach requires a minimal number of index-terms per item and reduces the cost of generating the index . for example , indexing this paragraph would only use the index term `` indexing . '' high exhaustivity and specificity indexes almost every concept in the item using as many detailed terms as needed . under these parameters this paragraph would have `` indexing , '' `` indexer knowledge , '' `` exhaustivity '' and `` specificity '' as index-terms . low exhaustivity has an adverse effect on both precision-and-recall . if the full text of the item is indexed , then low exhaustivity is used to index the abstract-concepts not explicit in the item with the expectation that the typical query searches both the index and the full item index . low specificity has an adverse effect on precision , but no effect to a potential increase in recall . another decision on indexing is what portions of an item should be indexed . the simplest case is to limit the indexing to the title or title and abstract zones . this indexes the material that the author considers most important and reduces the costs associated with indexing an item . unfortunately this leads to loss of both precision-and-recall . weighting of index-terms is not common in manual-indexing systems . weighting is the process of assigning an importance to an index term 's use in an item . the weight should represent the degree to which the concept associated with the index term is represented in the item . the weight should help in discriminating the extent to which the concept is discussed in items in the database . the manual process of assigning weights adds additional overhead on the indexer and requires a more complex-data structure to store the weights .
