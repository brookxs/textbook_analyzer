272 finding out about 7.43 priors when we are attempting to estimate 0ckgt ; the most common-prior applied within text-classification is the m-estimate [mitchell , 1997 , p. 179] . this corresponds to pretending that the actual training-data in t are augmented by nkw = \ vocab \ pseudo-trials uniformly distributed across all the keywords in vocab . operationally , this simply means that all keyword counters are `` primed '' (initialized to) one before real statistics are collected . with the priors specified , we can estimate 9ck under each of the two models discussed in section 7.4.1 . recall that the multivariate bernoulli model associates a single biased coin 0ck with each keyword used by a class . the bernoulli assumption is then that a document in the class will contain at least one occurrence of the keyword with probability 9ck but also with probability 1 ó 8ck that it will not contain any instances of the keyword . using a boolean indicator function bdk to signal the presence or absence of a keyword in a document and another bc (i to signal whether the document is classified with respect to class cf ^ 1 + # bdkbdc note that in this statistic the `` nonoccurrence '' of keywords not present in the document also affects our estimate . this somewhat odd mark of zero [lewis et al. , 1996] should make us feel less sanguine about what is captured by any bernoulli model . the multinomial alternatives (assuming the same priors as before) for these estimates are : _ 1 + # fcdbdc ock = kjjr jej , ñ , p (7.17) nkw + # # fcdbdc kevdet empirically , the multinomial-model seems to support better classification-performance , especially when larger vocabulary sizes are considered [mccallum and nigam , 1998] . bdk = 1 if '' a : occurs at least once in d and is zero otherwise ; bcd = liid is classified as an instance of class c and is zero otherwise . adaptive-information-retrieval 273 `` ireland '' lt ; - gt ; ireland v (ira . a killed) v (ira a shot) v (ira a out) figure 7.6 ripper classification-rule
