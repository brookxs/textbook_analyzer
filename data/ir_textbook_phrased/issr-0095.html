6.5 summary thesauri , semantic-nets and item clusters are essential tools in information-retrieval-systems , assisting the user in locating relevant items . they provide more benefit to the recall process than in improving precision . thesauri , either humanly generated or statistical , and semantic-nets are used to expand search statements , providing a mapping between the users vocabulary and that of the authors . the number of false hits on non-relevant items retrieved is determined by how tightly-coupled the terms are in the classes . when automatic techniques are used to create a statistical thesaurus , techniques such as cliques produce classes where the items are more likely to be related to the same concept than any of the other approaches . when a manually created thesaurus is used , human-intervention is required to eliminate homonyms that produce false hits . a homonym is when a term has multiple , different meanings (e.g. , the term field meaning an area of grass or an electromagnetic-field) . the longer (more terms) in the search statement , the less important the human-intervention to eliminate homonyms . this is because items identified by the wrong interpretation of the homonym should have a low-weight because the other search-terms are not likely to be found in the item . when search statements are short , significant decreases in precision will occur if homonym pruning is not applied . item clustering also assists the user in identifying relevant items . it is used in two ways : to directly find additional items that may not have been found by the query and to serve as a basis for visualization of the hit file . each item cluster has a common semantic basis containing similar terms and thus similar concepts . to assist the user in understanding the major topics resulting from a search , the items retrieved can be clustered and used to create a visual (e.g. , graphical) representation of the clusters and their topics (see chapter 8 for examples) . this allows a user to navigate between topics , potentially showing topics the user had not considered . the topics are not defined by the query but by the text of the items retrieved . document and term-clustering 161 when items in the database have been clustered , it is possible to retrieve all of the items in a cluster , even if they were not identified by the search statement . when the user retrieves a strongly relevant item , the user can look at other items like it without issuing another search . when relevant items are used to create a new query (i.e. , relevance-feedback discussed in section 7.3) , the retrieved hits are similar to what might be produced by a clustering-algorithm . as with the term-clustering , item clustering assists in mapping between a user 's vocabulary and the vocabulary of the authors . from another perspective term-clustering and item clustering achieve the same objective even though they are the inverse of each other . the objective of both is to determine additional relevant items by a co-ocurrence process . a statistical thesaurus creates a cluster of terms that co-occur in the same set of items . for all of the terms within the same cluster (assuming they are tightly-coupled) there will be significant overlap of the set of items they are found in . item clustering is based upon the same terms being found in the other items in the cluster . thus the set of items that caused a term-clustering has a strong possibility of being in the same item cluster based upon the terms . for example , if a term cluster has 10 terms in it (assuming they are tightly related) , then there will be a set of items where each item contains major subsets of the terms . from the item perspective , the set of items that has the commonality of terms , has a strong possibility to be placed in the same item cluster . hierarchical-clustering of items is of theoretical interest , but has minimal practical application . the major rationale for using hierarchical-clustering is to improve performance in search of clusters . the complexity of maintaining the clusters as new items are added to the system and the possibility of reduced recall (discussed in chapter 7) are examples of why this is not used in commercial systems . hierarchical thesauri are used in operational systems because there is additional knowledge in the human generated hierarchy . they have been historically used as a means to select index-terms when indexing items . it provides a controlled-vocabulary and standards between indexers .
