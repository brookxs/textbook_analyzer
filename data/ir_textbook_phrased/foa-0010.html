1.4 documents when `` documents '' were first introduced as part of the foa process , it was as one of the set of potential , predefined answers to users ' queries . here we will ground this abstract-view in practical terms that can be readily applied , for example , to the searches that are now common on the web . our goal will be to balance this practical description of how search-engines work today with the abstract foa view that goes beyond current practices to other kinds of searches still to come . a useful working definition is that a document is a passage of free-text . it is composed of text , strings of characters from an alphabet . we 'll typically make the (english) assumption that uses the roman-alphabet , arabic numerals , and standard punctuation . complications like font style (italics , bold) and non-roman marked alphabets that add characters like a , q , ij , and ae ; and the iconic characters of asian-languages require even more thought . by `` free '' text we mean it is in natural-language , the sort native readers and writers use easily . good examples of free-text might be a newspaper article , a journal paper , or a dictionary-definition . typically the text will be grammatically well-formed language , in part because this is written language , not oral people are more carefiil when constructing written artifacts that last beyond the moment . informal texts like email-messages , on the other hand , help to point to ways that some texts can retain the spontaneity of oral-communication , for better and worse [ong , 1982] . finally , we will be interested in passages of such text , of arbitrary size . the newspaper example makes us imagine documents of a few thousand words , but journal-articles make us think of samples ten times larger , and email-messages make us think of something only a tenth that size . we can even think of an entire book as a single-document . all such passages satisfy our basic definition ; they might be appropriate answers to a search about some topic . overview 17 the length of the documents will prove to be a critical issue in foa search-engine design , especially when some corpus contains documents of widely varying lengths . this is because longer documents can discuss more topics , so they are capable of being about more . longer documents are more likely to be associated with more keywords , and hence they are more likely to be retrieved (cf. section 3.4.2) . one possible response is to make a simple but very consequential assumption . assumption i all documents have equal about-ness . in other words , if we ask the (a priori) probability of any document in the corpus being considered relevant , we will assume that all are equiprobable . this would lead us to normalize documents ' indices in some way to compensate for differing lengths . the normalization-procedure is a matter of considerable debate ; we will return to consider it in depth later (cf. section 3.4.2) . for now , we will take a different tack toward the issue of document-length , as captured by an alternative pair of assumptions . assumption 2 the smallest unit of text with appreciable about-ness is the paragraph . assumption 3 all manner of longer documents are constructed out of basic paragraph atoms . the first piece of this argument is that the smallest sample of text that can reasonably be expected to satisfy an foa request is a paragraph . the claim is that a word , even a sentence , does not by itself provide enough context for any question to be answered or `` found out about . '' but if the paragraph has been well constructed , as defined by conventional rules of composition , it should answer many such questions . and unless the text comes from james joyce , proust , or jorge luis borges , we can expect paragraphs to occupy about half an average screen page - nicely viewable chunks . assumption 3 alludes to the range of structural-relationships by which the atomic paragraphs can typically be strung together to form longer passages . first and foremost is simple sequential flow , the order 18 finding out about in which an author expects the paragraphs to be read . the sequential nature of traditional printed media , from the first papyrus scrolls to modern books and periodicals , has meant that a sequential ordering over paragraphs has been dominant . it may even be that the modern human is especially capable of understanding rhetoric of this form (cf. section 6.2.3) . in any case , a sequential ordering of paragraphs is just one possible way they might be related . other common relationships include : ï a hierarchical-structure composing paragraphs into subsections , sections , and chapters ; ï footnotes , embellishing the primary theme ; ï bibliographic-citations to other , previous publications ; ï references to other sections of the same document ; and ï pedagogical prerequisite relationships ensuring that conceptual foundations are established prior to subsequent discussion . of course each of these relationships has grown up within the tradition of printed publication . special typographical conventions (boldface , italics , sub - and superscripting , margins , rules) have arisen to represent them and distinguish them from sequential flow . but new , electronic-media now available to readers (and becoming available to authors) need not follow the same strictly linear flow . the new capabilities and problems of traversing text in nonlinear ways - hypertext - have been discussed by some visionaries [bush , 1945 ; nelson , 1987] for decades . this new-technology certainly permits us to make some traversals more easily (e.g. , jumping to a cited reference with the click of a button rather than a trip to the library) , but this same ease may make it more difficult for an author to present a cogent argument . for now we will not worry about how arguments can be formed with nonlinear hypermedia . assumptions 2 and 3 simply allow us to infer assumption 1 : if all the documents are paragraphs , we can expect them to have virtually uniform about-ness . these are also simplifying assumptions , however . in an important sense , a scientific paper 's abstract is about the same content as the rest of the paper , and a newspaper article 's first paragraph attempts to summarize the details of the overview 19 following story . these issues of a text 's level of treatment will be discussed later .
