1.4.4 genre a more subtle characteristic of documents that may need to concern us is their genre - the voice or style in which a document is written . you would , um , like , be pretty darn surprised to find stuff like this in a textbook , but not if it came to you over the phone . the genre of email seems to be settling somewhere between typical printed media and spoken-conversation , with special markings of sarcasm :-rrb- and expletives # ! ? % common . newspaper journalists are carefully trained to produce articles a misleading title , or did the document teach you something ? s 22 finding out about consistent with what newspaper readers expect , and their editors are paid to ensure that these stories maintain a consistent voice . scientific journal-articles are written to be understood by peers in the same field , according to standards that pertain to that community [bayerman , 1988] . an important component of this audience focus is the vocabulary-choice an author makes (cf. section 8.2.1) ; stylistic variations and document-structure may also differ . in a field like psychology , for example , it would be difficult to get a paper accepted in some journals if it is not subdivided into sections like hypothesis , methodology , and subjects . legal briefs are also written in highly conventionalized forms [havard law review association , 1995] , and legislation is drafted to satisfy political realities [allen , 1980 ; goodrich , 1987 ; levi , 1982 ; nerhot , 1991] . in part , these variations in genre are difficult to detect because they remain consistent within any single corpus . that is , the typical email-message would jump out at you as out of place if it appeared in your newspaper , but probably not if it were on the letters to the editor page . these examples highlight how much context about the corpus we bring with us whenever we read a particular document . they also foreshadow problems web searchers are just beginning to appreciate , as www-search engines include every document to which they can crawl , intermixing their very different contexts and writing-styles . without the orienting features of the newspaper 's masthead , the `` letters to the editor '' rubric , or the purposeful selection of a tool that scans only usenet-news , the browsing users ' abilities to understand an arbitrary document is diminished . individual textual passages have been stripped of much of the context that made them sensible . as more and more of us generate content - in new hypermedia forms as well as traditional publications - that more and more of us retrieve , the range of genres we will experience can only increase , and our methods for foa must help to represent not just the document but contextual-information as well .
