the curse-of-dimensionality in deriving the decision-rules i assumed that a document is represented by an n-dimensional vector where n is the size of the index term vocabulary . typically n would be very-large , and so the dimension of the (binary) document-vectors is always likely to be greater than the number of samples used to estimate the parameters in the decision function . that this will lead to problems has been pointed out repeatedly in the pattern-recognition literature . although the analysis of the problem in pattern-recognition applies to ir as well , the solutions are not directly applicable . in pattern-recognition the problem is : given the number of samples that have been used to ` train ' the decision function (our weighting-function) , is there an optimum number of measurements that can be made of an unknown pattern so that the average probability of correct assignment can be maximised ? in our case how many index-terms can we legitimately use to decide on relevance . hughes [18] shows that for a very general probabilistic structure the number of measurements is surprisingly small even though reasonably sized samples are used to ` train ' the decision function . ideally one would like to be able to choose a (small) subset of index-terms to which the weighting-function g (.) would be restricted thereby maximising the average probability of correct assignment . in pattern-recognition there are complicated techniques for doing just that for the equivalent problem . in information-retrieval we are fortunate in that there is a natural way in which the dimensionality of the problem can be reduced . we accept that the query terms are a fair guide to the best features to be used in the application of g (.) to decide between relevance and non-relevance . therefore rather than computing the weighting-function for all possible terms we restrict g (.) to the terms specified in the query and possibly their close associates . this would be as if during the retrieval-process all documents are projected from a high-dimensional-space into a subspace spanned by a small number of terms .
