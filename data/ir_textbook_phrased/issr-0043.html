3.3.1 indexing by term when the terms of the original item are used as a basis of the index process , there are two major techniques for creation of the index : statistical and natural-language . statistical-techniques can be based upon vector models and probabilistic-models with a special case being bayesian-models . they are classified as statistical because their calculation of weights use statistical-information such as the frequency of occurrence of words and their distributions in the searchable database . natural-language techniques also use some statistical-information , but perform more complex parsing to define the final set of index concepts . often weighted systems are discussed as vectorized information-systems . this association comes from the smart system at cornell university created by dr. gerald salton (salton-73 , salton-83) . the system emphasizes weights as a foundation for information-detection and stores these weights in a vector form . each vector represents a document and each position in a vector represents a different unique word (processing token) in the database . the value assigned to each position is the weight of that term in the document . a value of zero indicates that the word was not in the document . the system and its associated research results have been evolving for over 30 years . queries can be translated into the vector form . search is accomplished by calculating the distance between the query-vector and the document vectors . in addition to a vector-model , the other dominant approach uses a probabilistic-model . the model that has been most successful in this area is the bayesian-approach . this approach is natural to information-systems and is based upon the theories of evidential-reasoning (drawing conclusions from evidence) . bayesian-approaches have long been applied to information-systems (maron-60) . the bayesian-approach could be applied as part of index-term-weighting , but usually is applied as part of the retrieval-process by calculating the relationship between an item and a specific query . a bayesian-network is a directed-acyclic-graph in which each node represents a random-variable and the arcs between the nodes represent a probabilistic dependence between the node and its parents 62 chapter 3 (howard-81 , pearl-88) . figure 3.3 shows the basic weighting approach for index-terms or associations between query terms and index-terms . figure 3.3 two-level bayesian-network the nodes c] and c2 represent `` the item contains concept c , '' and the f nodes represent `` the item has feature (e.g. , words) fy . '' the network could also be interpreted as c representing concepts in a query and f representing concepts in an item . the goal is to calculate the probability of q given fy . to perform that calculation two sets of probabilities are needed : 1 . the prior-probability p (q) that an item is relevant to concept c 2 . the conditional-probability p (fjj/q) that the features fy where] = 1 , m are present in an item given that the item contains topic q . the automatic-indexing task is to calculate the posterior-probability p (c , / f , i , ... , fim) , the probability that the item contains concept c , given the presence of features f , j . the bayes inference formula that is used is : p (c/flh ... , fta) = p (c ,) p (f , , , ... , fjcdnhn . Âª , f!m) . if the goal is to provide ranking as the result of a search by the posteriors , the bayes rule can be simplified to a linear decision-rule : where i (flk) is an indicator variable that equals ! only if flk is present in the item (equals zero otherwise) and w is a coefficient corresponding to a specific feature/concept pair . a careful choice of w produces a ranking in decreasing order that is equivalent to the order produced by the posterior probabilities . interpreting the coefficients , w , as weights corresponding to each feature (e.g. , index term) and the function g as the sum of the weights of the features , the result of applying the formula is a set of term-weights (fung-95) . cataloging and indexing 63 another approach to defining indexes to items is via use of natural-language-processing . the dr-link (document-retrieval through linguistic-knowledge) system processes items at the morphological , lexical , semantic , syntactic , and discourse levels (liddy-93 , weiner-95) . each level uses information from the previous level to perform its additional analysis . the discourse-level is abstracting information beyond the sentence-level and can determine abstract-concepts using pre-defined models of event relationships . this allows the indexing to include specific term as well as abstract-concepts such as time (e.g. , differentiates between a company was sold versus a company will be sold) . normal automatic-indexing does a poor job at identifying and extracting `` verbs '' and relationships between objects based upon the verbs .
