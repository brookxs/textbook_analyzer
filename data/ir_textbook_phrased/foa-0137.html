6.8 foa (evolution) for some time the study of evolution has demanded an especially interdisciplinary approach , so it is no wonder that profound difficulties in communication arise as scientists trained in paradigms as varied as biology , psychology , and computer-science attempt to communicate with one another [belew and mitchell , 1996] . now , of course , theories of evolution are increasingly informed by huge volumes of concrete data , generated by the human-genome-project and related efforts . serendipitously , the field of molecular-biology is also one of the first (but quite certainly not the last) disciplines to undergo a qualitative change because of the www . the nearly simultaneous growth of the www and genomic databases has meant that computational-biology as a science has grown up with a very advanced notion of publication . beyond formal publication channels , even beyond informal email and discussion-groups , the genomic databases at the heart of molecular-biology today may point to forms of communication among scientists that are arguably , like image-based www traffic , post-verbal . the flood of biological-sequence data - nucleic acid , proteins , and now gene-expression networks and metabolic-pathways - into sequence-databases , with the related flood of molecular-biology literature , represents an unprecedented opportunity to investigate how concepts learned automatically from various data-sets relate to the words and phrases used by scientists to describe them . learning this linkage - between molecular-biology concepts and the genomic-data relating to them - can be described as annotating the data . it is now possible to learn many of these correspondences automatically , guided by the relevance-feedback of practicing scientists , as a natural by-product of their browsing through genome-data and publications related to them . relevance-feedback provides a key additional piece of information to learning-algorithms , beyond the statistical correlations that may exist within the genome-data or textual-corpora treated independently : it captures the fact that a scientist who understands both the sequence-data and the journal-articles deeply does (or does not) believe that a particular sequence and particular keyword/concept share a common referent . sequences are posted , annotations are often automatically constructed based on homologous relations to other sequences found in the databases . a different variety of `` sequence-search engines , '' specially developed to look for similarities among sequences rather than 246 finding out about query-retrieval relevance-feedback documents figure 6.26 the annotation relation between text and sequence-data among documents , has become the basis for retrievals . these retrievals can - and often do - connect the work of one scientist to that of another without a single verbal expression passing between them . figure 6.26 sketches the basic relations . on the bottom are the most fundamental classes of molecular data , namely , gene and protein-sequences . on the top is a set of scientific documents , such as those found in medigital libraryine . the primary relation connecting the raw genetic-data and textual-corpora are annotation links that scientists have (manually) established between articles and sequences that are both significant and useful . they are significant because they help to establish the construction of the genome as a piece of the scientific enterprise , linking it to the traditions of academic publication . they are also useful to many scientists who , for example , are interested in a particular gene or protein and want to find out all that others might know about it . but annotation is not done consistently by all participating scientists , nor has a precise-semantics for what exactly an annotation should mean been established . the entrez24 interface to medigital libraryine makes it convenient for a user with 24 www.ncbi.nlm.gov / entrez inference beyond the index 247 a particular sequence in mind to find its corresponding publication , and vice versa . together with the mesh thesaurus of medical-terms (cf. section 6.3) , these features make the national-library-of-medicine 's resource one of the most advanced on the www . in addition to expediting the searches of scientists and doctors , the identification of significant patterns in one modality (i.e. , in text or in sequence-data) can be used to suggest hypotheses in the other (similar to suggestions made by swanson (cf. section 6.5.3)) . also shown in figure 6.26 are sim arcs relating `` similar '' data . in the case of genetic or protein sequence data , these similarity-measures are typically based on a notion of `` edit-distance '' generated by string-matching tools such as blast and fasta , but the investigation of new methods for this problem is one of the most active areas within machine-learning (cf. [glasgow et al , 1996]) . the investigation of interdocument similarities has been an important problem within the field of information-retrieval (ir) for many decades . most document-similarity measures are based on correlations between `` keywords '' contained by pairs of documents , but other methods (e.g. , those based on a bibliometric-analysis of shared entries in the documents ' bibliographies) have also received considerable attention .
