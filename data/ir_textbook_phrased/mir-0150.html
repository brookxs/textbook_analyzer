8.5.7 phrases and proximity if a sequence of words is searched to appear in the text exactly as in the pattern (i.e. , with the same separators) the problem is similar to that of exact search of a single pattern , by just forgetting the fact that there are many words . if any separator between words is to be allowed , it is possible to arrange it using an extended pattern or regular-expression-search . the best way to search a phrase element-wise is to search for the element which is less frequent or can be searched faster (both criteria normally match) . for instance , longer patterns are better than shorter ones ; allowing fewer errors is better than allowing more errors . once such an element is found , the neighboring words are checked to see if a complete match is found . a similar algorithm can be used to search a proximity-query .
