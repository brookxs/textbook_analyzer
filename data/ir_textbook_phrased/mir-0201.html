10.6.3 query-term hits between documents other visualization ideas have been developed to show a different kind of information about the relationship between query terms and retrieved documents . rather than showing how query terms appear within individual documents , as is done in kwic interfaces and tilebars , these systems display an overview or summary of the retrieved documents according to which subset of query terms they contain . the following subsections describe variations on this idea . 294 user-interfaces and visualization figure 10.17 a sketch of the infocrystai retrieval results display [738] . infocrystal the infocrystai shows how many documents contain each subset of query terms [738] . this relieves the user from the need to specify boolean ands and ors in their query , while still showing which combinations of terms actually appear in documents that were ordered by a statistical ranking (although beyond four terms the interface becomes difficult to understand) . the infocrystai allows visualization of all possible relations among n user-specified ` concepts ' (or boolean keywords) . the infocrystai displays , in a clever extension of the venn-diagram paradigm , the number of documents retrieved that have each possible subset of the n concepts . figure 10.17 shows a sketch of what the infocrystai might display as the result of a query against four keywords or boolean phrases , labeled a , b , c. and d . the diamond in the center indicates that one document was discovered that contains all four keywords . the triangle marked with * 12 '' indicates that 12 documents were found containing attributes a , b , and d , and so on . the infocrystai does not show proximity among the terms within the documents , nor their relative-frequency . so a document that contains dozens of hits on ` volcano ' and ` lava ' and one hit on ` mars ' will be grouped with documents that contain mainly hits on ` mars ' but just one mention each of ` volcano * and iava .

(see figure 10.18 .) lyberworld presents a 3d version of this idea . lattices several researchers have employed a graphical depiction of a mathematical lattice for the purposes of query-formulation , where the query consists of a set of constraints on a hierarchy of categories (actually , semantic-attributes in these systems) [631 , 147] . this is one solution to the problem of displaying documents in terms of multiple attributes ; a document containing terms a , b , c , and d could be placed at a point in the lattice with these four categories as parents . however , if such a representation were to be applied to retrieval results instead of query-formulation , the lattice layout would in most cases be too complex to allow for readability . none of the displays discussed in this subsection have been evaluated for effectiveness at improving query-specification or understanding of retrieval results , but they are intriguing ideas and perhaps are useful in conjunct ion with other displays . 296 user-interfaces and visualization ¶ 3m ___ d figure 10.19 the superbook interface for showing retrieval results on a large manual in context [481] . 10.6.4 superbook : context via table-of-contents the superbook system [481 , 229 , 230] makes use of the structure of a large document to display query-term hits in context . the table-of-contents (toc) for a book or manual are shown in a hierarchy on the left-hand side of the display , and full text of a page or section is shown on the right-hand-side . the user can manipulate the table-of-contents to expand or contract the view of sections and subsections . a focus-plus-context mechanism is used to expand the viewing area of the sections currently being looked at and compress the remaining sections . when the user moves the cursor to another part of the toc , the display changes dynamically , making the new focus larger and shrinking down the previously observed sections . after the user specifies a query on the book , the search-results are shown in the context of the table-of-contents hierarchy . (see figure 10.19 .) those sections that contain search hits are made larger and the others are compressed . the query terms that appear in chapter or section names are highlighted in reverse video . when the user selects a page from the table-of-contents view , the page itself is displayed on the right-hand-side and the query terms within the page are highlighted in reverse video . the superbook designers created innovative techniques for evaluating its special features . subjects were compared using this system against using paper (iocunieiitatiori and against a more standard online infoririatiori access system . subjects were also compared on different kinds of carefully selected tasks : browsing topics of interest , citation searching , searching to answer questions , and searching and browsing to write summary essays . for most of the tasks context 297 superbook subjects were faster and more accurate or equivalent in speed and accuracy to a standard system . when differences arose between superbook and the standard system , the investigators examined the logs carefully and hypothesized plausible explanations . after the initial studies , they modified superbook according to these hypotheses and usually saw improvements as a result [481] . the user-studies on the improved system showed that users were faster and more accurate at answering questions in which some of the relevant terms were within the section titles themselves , but they were also faster and more accurate at answering questions in which the query terms fell within the full text of the document only , as compared both to a paper manual and to an-interface that did not provide such contextualizing information . superbook was not faster than paper when the query terms did not appear in the document-text or the table-of-contents . this and other evidence from the superbook studies suggests that query-term highlighting is at least partially responsible for improvements seen in the system .
