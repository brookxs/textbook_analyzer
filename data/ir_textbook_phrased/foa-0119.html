6.2.2 hierarchic containment one of the most common features of all document types is that as larger and larger portions are aggregated , an explicit hierarchic structure is used to organize the text . for example , this textbook is broken into chapters , which are broken into sections and subsections , and so on . this is basically a containment relationship , with shorter passages aggregated to form larger ones , but with short textual rubrics providing useful summaries of the themes of the smaller units . typical atomic units of text can be a few sentences [salton et al , 1993 ; salton et al. 5 1994] , but typically they are paragraphs [hearst and plaunt , 1993] , a provocative picture of how the containment relation can be exploited is shown from salton et aus analysis of encyclopedia-text in figure 6.6 . this shows the encyclopedia-text ordered sequentially around a ring . in the top figure , individual pages of the encyclopedia are treated as separate documents , and in the bottom figure larger sections are aggregated . in both cases , links between documents are created when their similarity 202 finding out about award to m. gandhi india (12017) lt ; j \ j ^ mohandas ∞ ^ - n # gandhi v ∞ - (9620) x % ^ struggle for indian independence (1919-1945) independent india (1945-1947) theme 4 mohandas gandhi indira p3-7 gandhi (9619) nehru 5 (16579) indira gandhi prime minister absorption of kashmir (1957) (links from 030 to 0.63 shown) theme 3 indira gandhi # ,9619 . p3 theme 1 nehru theme 2 sikhs and punjab (links below 035 ignored) 16579 : nehru , jawaharlal 12017 : india 9620 : gandhi , mohandas karamchand 9619 : gandhi , indira priyadarshini figure 6.6 containment and document references from [salton et al , 1994] . reproduced with permission of american association for the advancement of science inference beyond the index 203 20 60 30 40 50 sentence gap number figure 6.7 correlation of passages from [hearst and plaunt , 1993] . reproduced with permission 70 80 (as measured according to their vector-space representations ; cf section 3.4) exceeds a threshold . as chapter 3 explained in detail , a vector-space-representation of document-content is very sensitive to length . salton investigated the use of inclusion to aggregate text into larger units (in the bottom of figure 6.6) and various `` global '' versus `` local '' weighting-schemes to manipulate the effects of length-normalization . note also how co-reference to similar topical themes can be seen at different scales within the containment hierarchy . when considering constituent passages of the same document * it becomes possible to ask how much the topic of the prose changes as it goes from one passage to the next . hearst [hearst and plaunt , 1993] analyzed how similarity (usingtf-idfweightingand cosine-similarity) varies across passages .9 the result is the wave of figure 6.7 . also shown in this figure are vertical bars where a human judge has determined that a topical shift has occurred . * www.siixis.berkeley.edu/heaj^/tb-exaniple.hteql 204 finding out about fr8s13-0157 ap ; groups see ! sjmn : wome1 ap : older athllt ; fr : committee fr : october ad fr8s120-0046 fr : chronic dis ap : survey says fr : consolidate sjmn : reseai figure 6.8 visualizing topical distributions from [hearst , 1999] . reproduced with permission of addison-wesley having isolated individual passages as part of retrieval , it becomes important to show the user this additional level of analysis as part of the retrieval of the `` documents '' figure 6.8 shows topical tiling , another visualization-technique hearst developed to highlight shifts in topical focus from one passage to the next . by increasing the resolution of document-analysis , users can see which passages match particular keywords or combinations of keywords in their query . containment relations among documents may also be useful in supporting queries of widely varying generality (cf. section 4.3.4) . if a user-issues a very broad query , it may mean he or she seeks documents with an equally broad overview or level of treatment . one reasonable hypothesis would be that broader queries should correspond to the retrieval of large sections and narrower queries to smaller sections , but only if the assumption that documents in general obey something like a uniform level of treatment . such an assumption would not be unreasonable for the encyclopedia-text considered by salton et ai , because we expect (and encyclopedia editors attempt to ensure) that there is some document about every topic . inference beyond the index 205 contensious boundaries emergent exhaustive tiling a priori legal encyclopedia jsa ?
