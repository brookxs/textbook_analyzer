inference beyond the index 223 to the ph.d. advisor/advisee relationship . david waltz 's taxonomy of ai provides an excellent initial thesaurus over keywords [waltz , 1985 .] 6.4.2 an empirical foundation for a philosophy-of-science one advantage of studying a focused corpus like the ait is that we have an especially good chance of understanding some of these social-relations . a history of ai often begins with a seminal conference that took place at dartmouth in 1956 [mccorduck , 1985 ; russell and norvig , 1995] . t if we alternate treat the attendees at that meeting as `` founding fathers '' (in a population histories genetic sense !) , we can attempt to track their `` genetic '' impact on the current field of ai . ? s in an attempt to capture other significant intellectual influences beyond the advisor , the aig questionnaire asks for committee members other than the chairman . the role of committee members varies a great deal from department to department and from campus to campus . but all of these numbers can be expected to exert some intellectual influence . asking for committee members is a step toward other nonadvisor influencers , and it is also a matter of record . research institutions are another way to capture intellectual interactions among collaborators . even if and when the ai-ph . d. family tree is completed , it will certainly not have captured all of what we mean by `` artificial-intelligence research . '' for example : ï the dartmouth `` founding fathers '' probably provide (direct) lineage for a minority of ai ph.d. s currently working in the field . ï ph.d. theses themselves are probably some of the worst examples of research , in ai and elsewhere . by definition , we are talking about students who are doing some of their first work . they had better improve with time ! ï ph.d. s account for only a fraction of ai-research . nevertheless , science is primarily concerned with accumulating knowledge , at least as much as it is about its initial discovery . a primary argument for interest in the aig is that traditional academic 224 finding out about relationships , as embodied by ph.d. genealogies , form a sort of `` skeleton '' around which the rest of scientific-knowledge coalesces . certainly , individuals can pursue their own research program , and corporations can fund extended investigations into areas that are not represented in academia whatsoever . but it is hard to imagine extended research-programs (like that `` fathered '' by roger schank , for example) that do not involve multiple `` generations '' of investigators ; academia is almost certainly the most successful system for such propagation . further , clear demonstrations of intellectual lineages like this promise much more concrete evidence for memes - the hypothetical analogs of biological genes in cultural systems [dawkins , 1976] - than analyses of text alone [best , 2000] can ever provide . kuhnian [kuhn , 1970] andpost-kuhnian [hull , 1988 ; latour , 1987] analyses highlight the importance of the social-aspects of science . `` paradigms '' are extremely appealing constructs , but they 're also amorphous . for all of its faults , the ai-ph . d. tree represents incontrovertible facts , just as word-frequencies do .
