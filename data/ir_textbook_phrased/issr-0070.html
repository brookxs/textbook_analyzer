5.2 statistical-indexing statistical-indexing uses frequency of occurrence of events to calculate a number that is used to indicate the potential relevance of an item . one approach used in search of older systems does not use the statistics to aid in the initial selection , but uses them to assist in calculating a relevance value of each item for ranking . the documents are found by a normal boolean search and then statistical calculations are performed on the hit file , ranking the output (e.g. , term-frequency algorithms) . since the index does not contain any special data , these techniques are discussed in chapter 7 under ranking . probabilistic systems attempt to calculate a probability-value that should be invariant to both calculation method and text-corpora . this allows easy integration of the final results when searches are performed across multiple databases and use different search-algorithms . a probability of 50 per cent would mean that if enough items are reviewed , on the average one half of the reviewed items are relevant . the bayesian and vector approaches calculate a relative relevance value (e.g. , confidence level) that a particular item is relevant . quite often term distributions across the searchable database are used in the calculations . an issue that continues to be researched is how to merge results , even from the same search-algorithm , from multiple databases . the problem is compounded when an attempt is made to merge the results from different search-algorithms . this would not be a problem if true probabilities were calculated .
