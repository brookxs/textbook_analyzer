10.8.6 integrating scanning , selection , and querying user-interfaces for information-access in general do not do a good job of supporting strategies , or even of sequences of movements from one operation to the next . even something as simple as taking the output of retrieval results from one query and using them as input to another query executed in a later search-session is not well supported in most interfaces . hertzum and frokjaer [368] found that users preferred an integration of scanning and query-specification in their user-interfaces . they did not , however , observe better results with such interactions . they hypothesized that if interactions are too unrestricted this can lead to erroneous or wasteful behavior , and interaction between two different modes requires more guidance . this suggests that more flexibility is needed , but within constraints (this argument was also made in the discussion of the superbook system in section 10.6) . there are exceptions . the new web version of the melyvl system provides ways to take the output of one query and modify it later for re-execution (see figure 10.32) , the workspace-based systems such as digital libraryite and rooms allow storage and reuse of previous state . however , these systems do not integrate the general search-process well with scanning and selection of information from auxiliary structures . scanning , selection , and querying needs to be better integrated in general this discussion will conclude with an example of an interface that does attempt to tightly couple querying and browsing . help interface-support for the search-process 319 personal profile . off [search ! personal author swanson , d j personal author swanson , d [and] title words j literature personal author swanson , d [ancq information item-display : [short find ^ ore j find fewer | diete search j send questions , comments , or suggestions to iridvyl@www mejyyl ucop edu melvylæ is a registered trademark of the regents of the university of california figure 10.32 a view of query-history revision in the web-based version of the melvyl bibliographic catalog . copyright © , the regents of the university of california . the cat-a-cone interface integrates querying and browsing of very-large category hierarchies with their associated text-collections . the prototype-system uses 3d-f animation interface-components from the information-visualizer [144] , applied in a novel way , to support browsing and search of text-collections and their category hierarchies . see figure 10.33 . a key component of the interface is the separation of the graphical-representation of the category-hierarchy from the graphical-representation of the documents . this separation allows for a fluid , flexible interaction between browsing and search , and between categories and documents . it also provides a mechanism by which a set of categories associated with a document can be viewed along with their hierarchical context . another key component of the design is assignment of first-class status to the representation of text-content . the retrieved documents are stored in a 3d-hanimation book representation [144] that allows for compact display of moderate numbers of documents . associated with each retrieved document is a page of links to the category-hierarchy and a page of text showing the document contents . the user can `` ruffle ' the pages of the book of retrieval results and see corresponding changes in the category-hierarchy , which is also represented in 3d + animation . all and only those parts of the category space that reflect the semantics of the retrieved document are shown with the document . the system allows for several different kinds of starting-points . users can start by typing in a name of a category and seeing which parts of the category-hierarchy match it . for example , figure 10.34 shows the results of searching on 320 user-interfaces and visualization i '' . mir j ´ wmei ´ ´ ªï n ïuftm-ntkigittanrkilirc i1 f ! lt ; tªp ftgt ; * k itit.-i ' % jrª hti ?
