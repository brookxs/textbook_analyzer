2.1 search capabilities the objective of the search capability is to allow for a mapping between a user 's specified need and the items in the information database that will answer that need . the search-query statement is the means that the user employs to communicate a description of the needed information to the system . it can consist of natural-language-text in composition style and/or query terms (referred to as terms in this book) with boolean-logic indicators between them . how the system translates the search-query into processing steps to find the potential relevant items is described in later chapters . one concept that has occasionally been implemented in commercial systems (e.g. , retrievalware) , and holds significant potential for assisting in the location and ranking of relevant items , is the `` weighting '' of search-terms . this would allow a user to indicate the importance of search-terms in either a boolean or natural-language-interface . given the following natural-language-query statement where the importance of a particular search-term is indicated by a value in parenthesis between 0.0 and 1.0 with 1.0 being the most important : find articles that discuss automobile emissions (.9) or sulfur dioxide (.3) on the farming industry . the system would recognize in its importance ranking and item selection-process that automobile emissions are far more important than items discussing sulfur dioxide problems . the search statement may apply to the complete item or contain additional parameters limiting it to a logical division of the item (i.e. , to a zone) . as discussed in chapter 1 , this restriction is useful in reducing retrieval of nonrelevant items by limiting the search to those subsets of the item whose use of a particular word is consistent with the user 's search objective . finding a name in a bibliography does not necessarily mean the item is about that person . recent research has shown that for longer items , restricting a query statement to be satisfied within a contiguous subset of the document (passage searching) provides improved precision (buckley-95 , wilkinson-95) . rather than allowing the search statement to be satisfied anywhere within a document it may be required to be satisfied within a 100 word contiguous subset of the item (callan-94) . based upon the algorithms used in a system many different fiinctions are associated with the system 's understanding the search statement . the fiinctions define the relationships between the terms in the search statement (e.g. , boolean , information-retrieval-system capabilities 29 natural-language , proximity , contiguous word phrases , and fuzzy searches) and the interpretation of a particular word (e.g. , term masking , numeric and date range , contiguous word phrases , and concept/thesaurus expansion) . rather than continuing the use of the term-processing token to represent the searchable units extracted from an item , the terminology `` word '' or `` term '' is also used in some contexts as an approximation that is intuitively more meaningful to the reader .
