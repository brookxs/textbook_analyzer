boolean-retrieval the meaning of the term information-retrieval can be very broad . just getting a credit-card out of your wallet so that you can type in the card number is a form of information-retrieval . however , as an academic field of study , information-retrieval might be defined thus : information-retrieval (ir) is finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information-need from within large-collections (usually stored on computers) . ir can also cover other kinds of data and information problems beyond that specified in the core definition above . the term `` unstructured-data '' refers to data which does not have clear , semantically overt , easy-for-a-computer structure . it is the opposite of structured-data , the canonical example of which is a relational-database , of the sort companies usually use to maintain product inventories and personnel records . in reality , almost no data are truly `` unstructured '' . this is definitely true of all text-data if you count the latent linguistic-structure of human languages . but even accepting that the intended notion of structure is overt structure , most text has structure , such as headings and paragraphs and footnotes , which is commonly represented in documents by explicit markup (such as the coding underlying web-pages) . ir is also used to facilitate `` semistructured '' search such as finding a document where the title contains java and the body contains threading . the field of information-retrieval also covers supporting users in browsing or filtering document-collections or further processing a set of retrieved documents . given a set of documents , clustering is the task of coming up with a good grouping of the documents based on their contents . it is similar to arranging books on a bookshelf according to their topic . given a set of topics , standing information-needs , or other categories (such as suitability of texts for different age groups) , classification is the task of deciding which class (es) , if any , each of a set of documents belongs to . it is often approached by first manually classifying some documents and then hoping to be able to classify new documents automatically . information-retrieval-systems can also be distinguished by the scale at which they operate , and it is useful to distinguish three prominent scales . in web-search , the system has to provide search over billions of documents stored on millions of computers . distinctive issues are needing to gather documents for indexing , being able to build-systems that work efficiently at this enormous scale , and handling particular aspects of the-web , such as the exploitation of hypertext and not being fooled by site providers manipulating page content in an attempt to boost their search-engine rankings , given the commercial importance of the-web . we focus on all these issues in webcharlink . at the other extreme is personal-information-retrieval . in the last few years , consumer operating-systems have integrated information retrieval (such as apple 's mac-os-x spotlight or windows-vista 's instant search) . email programs usually not only provide search but also text-classification : they at least provide a spam (junk-mail) filter , and commonly also provide either manual or automatic means for classifying mail so that it can be placed directly into particular folders . distinctive issues here include handling the broad range of document types on a typical personal-computer , and making the search-system maintenance free and sufficiently lightweight in terms of startup , processing , and disk space usage that it can run on one machine without annoying its owner . in between is the space of enterprise , institutional , and domain-specific-search , where retrieval might be provided for collections such as a corporation 's internal documents , a database of patents , or research-articles on biochemistry . in this case , the documents will typically be stored on centralized file-systems and one or a handful of dedicated machines will provide search over the collection . this book contains techniques of value over this whole spectrum , but our coverage of some aspects of parallel and distributed search in web-scale search systems is comparatively light owing to the relatively small published literature on the details of such systems . however , outside of a handful of web-search companies , a software-developer is most likely to encounter the personal-search and enterprise scenarios . in this chapter we begin with a very simple example of an information-retrieval problem , and introduce the idea of a term-document-matrix (section 1.1) and the central inverted-index data-structure (section 1.2) . we will then examine the boolean-retrieval model and how boolean-queries are processed (and 1.4) . subsections an example information-retrieval problem a
