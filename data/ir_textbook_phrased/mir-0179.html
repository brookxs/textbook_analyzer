10.2 human-computer-interaction what makes an effective human-computer-interface ? ben shneiderman , an expert in the field , writes [725 , p. 10] : well designed , effective computer-systems generate positive feelings of success , competence , mastery , and clarity in the user-community . when an interactive-system is well-designed , the interface almost disappears , enabling users to concentrate on their work , exploration , or pleasure . as steps towards achieving these goals , shneiderman lists principles-for-design of user-interfaces . those which are particularly important for information-access include (slightly restated) : provide informative feedback , permit easy reversal of actions , support an internal locus-of-control , reduce working-memory-load , and provide alternative-interfaces for novice and expert-users . each of these principles should be instantiated differently depending on the particular interface application . below we discuss those principles that are of special interest to information-access systems .
