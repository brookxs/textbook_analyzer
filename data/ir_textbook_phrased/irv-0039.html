index-sequential files an index-sequential file is an inverted-file in which for every keyword ki , we have ni = hi = 1 and a11 lt ; a21 ... lt ; am1 . this situation can only arise if each record has just one unique keyword , or one unique attribute-value . in practice therefore , this set of records may be order sequentially by a key . each key value appears in the directory with the associated address of its record . an obvious interpretation of a key of this kind would be the record number . in our example none of the attributes would do the job except the record number . diagrammatically the index-sequential file would therefore appear as shown in figure 4.4 . i have deliberately written ri instead of ki to emphasise the nature of the key . in the literature an index-sequential file is usually thought of as a sequential file with a hierarchy of indices . this does not contradict the previous definition , it merely describes the way in which the directory is implemented . it is not surprising therefore that the indexes (` index ' = ` directory ' here) are often oriented to the characteristics of the storage medium . for example (see figure 4.5) there might be three levels of indexing : track , cylinder and master . each entry in the track index will contain enough information to locate the start of the track , and the key of the last record in the track which is also normally the highest value on that track . there is a track index for each cylinder . each entry in the cylinder index gives the last record on each cylinder and the address of the track index for that cylinder . if the cylinder index itself is stored on tracks , then the master index will give the highest key referenced for each track of the cylinder index and the starting address of that track . no mention has been made of the possibility of overflow during an updating process . normally provision is made in the directory to administer an overflow area . this of course increases the number of book-keeping entries in each entry of the index .
