1.5 organization of the book for ease of comprehension , this book has a straightforward structure in which four main parts are distinguished : text ir , human-computer-interaction (hci) organization of the book 11 for ir , multimedia-ir , and applications of ir . text ir discusses the classic problem of searching a collection of documents for useful information . hci for ir discusses current trends in ir towards improved user-interfaces and better data-visualization tools . multimedia-ir discusses how to index document-images and other binary-data by extracting features from their content and how to search them efficiently . on the other hand , document-images that are predominantly text (rather than pictures) are called textual-images and are amenable to automatic-extraction of keywords through metadescriptors , and can be retrieved using text ir techniques . applications of ir covers modern applications of ir such as the-web , bibliographic systems , and digital-libraries . each part is divided into topics which we now discuss .
