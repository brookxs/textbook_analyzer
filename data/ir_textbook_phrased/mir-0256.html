13.4.3 user-interfaces there are two important aspects of the user-interface of search-engines : the query-interface and the answer interface (see also chapter 10) , the basic query-interface is a box where one or more words can be typed . although a user would expect that a given sequence of words represents the same query in all search-engines , it does not . for example , in altavista a sequence of words is a reference to the union of all the-web pages having at least one of those words , while in hotbot it is a reference to the-web pages having all the words . another problem is that the logical view of the text is not known , that is , some search-engines use stopwords , some do stemming , and some are not case sensitive (see chapter 7) . all search-engines also provide a query-interface for complex-queries as well as a command-language including boolean-operators and other features , such as phrase search , proximity-search , and wild cards . figures 13.5 and 13.6 show the query-interfaces for complex-queries for the three largest search-engines . they provide several filtering functions . the results can be filtered by additional words that must be present or absent from the answer or in a particular field such as the url or title , language , geographic region or internet domain , date range , or inclusion of specific data-types such as images or audio . the answer usually consists of a list of the ten top ranked web-pages . figure 13.7 shows the three top documents for the main four search-engines for the query searching and web and engine . each entry in this list includes some information about the document it represents . typically , the information includes the url , size , the date when the page was indexed , and a couple of lines with its content (title plus first lines or selected headings or sentences) . some search-engines allow the user to change the number of pages returned in the list and the amount of information per page , but in most cases this is fixed or limited to a few choices . the order of the list is typically by relevance , but sorting by url or date is also available in some engines . in addition , most search-engines also have an option to find documents similar to each web-page in the answer . 378 searching the-web k ttte $ 1 rated search-engine return to fewer options lwkfor sweh for pages l , mustcontsin ** | tlie words nsptt not contain - ªi tfaewds limit roisito to after ** i erim s ^ 7t ^ jtem - ª ´ * jlt ; ´ ª jsmme returner v pmmkfm jssssflfislj words an/where . words m title . if publication name '11 words in url p select : vspeaal collection a world-wide-web vall sources fill in . orte dat ´ field oa both to nanowyoui results by daw starttoteff ' `` v ' '' ^ end date | | ^ ; i ^ - '' ' jsoit results by date select sowtces ja11 sources below jjouªuliabuv ´ iws - imon - profit v/eb sivs uwews aatchiwes - jedw ational web-sites jpeiisorial p ^ ges j (milgt ; tajyv/sb sites jcorruruacttl web sit ^ s docuroeats wicittjen in any language - jj alcountnes - j ï ¶ ^ select subjects ja11 s'jbie . ts search dear setting figure 13.6 query-interface for complex-queries for hotbot (left) and northernlight (right) . search-engines 379 ªgt ; altavista round 3,156,580 web-pages for you . refine your search 1 . welcome to pcfriend usa searching engine web-site url : ' . ` aw / fvfrend net/menu 1 htm last modified 23 - feto sb - page see 628 bytes - in english [translate 1 2 . searching engine home | typ databank ! tvp homepages | net trade centerl fair news | leading firms business finance database | new-media database | world trade promotion . . url : topi t ' * n-c ´ niine wdm tw1searchfeincle ; ?
