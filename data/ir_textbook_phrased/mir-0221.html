11.1 introduction the need for an integrated-management for multimedia-data is rapidly growing in several application environments such as offices , cad/cam applications , and medical-applications . for this reason , multimedia-information-systems are widely recognized to be one of the most promising fields in the area of information-management . the most important characteristic of a multimedia-information-system is the variety of data it must be able to support . multimedia-systems must have the capability to store , retrieve , transport , and present data with very heterogeneous characteristics such as text , images (both still and moving) , graphs , and sound . for this reason , the development of a multimedia-system is considerably more complex than a traditional information-system . conventional systems only deal with simple-data-types , such as strings or integers . on the contrary , the underlying data-model , the query-language , and the access and storage mechanisms of a multimedia-system must be able to support objects with a very complex structure . the need then arises for developing multimedia-information-retrieval (multimedia ib . for short) systems specifically for handling multimedia-data . traditional ir systems (see chapter 2) only deal with textual unstructured-data ; therefore , they are unable to support the mix of structured and unstructured-data , and different kinds of media , typical of a multimedia-ir system . for instance , a traditional ir-system does not support metadata information such as that provided by database-schema , which is a fundamental component in a database-management-system (dbms) . on the other hand , multimedia-ir systems require some form of database-schema because several multimedia-applications need to structure their data at least partially . however , the notion of schema may need to be weakened with respect to the traditional notion to ensure a higher degree of flexibility in structuring data . moreover , 325 326 multimedia-ir : models and languages a multimedia-ir system requires handling metadata which is crucial for data-retrieval , whereas traditional ir systems do not have such requirement . the architecture of a multimedia-ir system depends on two main factors : first , the peculiar characteristics of multimedia-data , and second , the kinds of operations to be performed on such data . in what follows , we briefly deal with both these aspects . data-modeling a multimedia-ir system should be able to represent and store multimedia objects in a way that ensures their fast retrieval . the system should be therefore able to deal with different kinds of media and with semi-structured-data , i.e. , data whose structure may not match , or only partially match , the structure prescribed by the data schema . in order to represent semi-structured-data , the system must typically extract some features from the multimedia objects . a related issue is how these features are extracted and efficiently maintained by the system . data-retrieval the main goal of a multimedia-ir system is to efficiently perform retrieval based on user requests , exploiting not only data attributes , as in traditional dbmss , but also the content of multimedia objects . this poses several interesting challenges , due to the heterogeneity of data , the fuzziness of information , the loss of information in the creation of indexes , and the need of an interactive refinement of the query result . data-retrieval relies on the following basic steps : (1) query-specification . in this step , the user specifies the request . the query-interface should allow the user to express fuzzy predicates for proximity searches (for example , `` find all images similar to a car '') , content-based predicates (for example , ` find multimedia objects containing an apple ') , conventional predicates on the object attributes (for example , conditions on the attribute ` color of an image , such as ` find all red images '') , and structural predicates (for example , vfind ail multimedia objects containing a video-clip ') . (2) query-processing-and-optimization . similarly to traditional systems , the query is parsed and compiled into an internal form . in generating this internal-representation , the query is also optimized , choosing the best evaluation plan . note that , due to the presence of fuzzy terms , content-based predicates , and structural predicates , query-processing is a very complex activity . a great amount of work has been done on query-processing both in traditional [402] and spatial-databases [247 , 82 , 118 , 361 , 623] . however , little work lias been done on query-processing strategies for multimedia-databases . the main problem is the heterogeneity of data : different query-processing strategies , one for each data-type , should be combined together in some wav . introduction 327 (3) query answer . the retrieved objects are returned to the user in decreasing order of relevance . relevance is measured as a distance-function from the query object to the stored ones . (4) query iteration . in traditional dbmss , the query process ends when the system returns the answer to the user . in a multimedia-ir system , due to the inevitable lack of precision in the user request , the query-execution is iterated until the user is satisfied . at each iteration the user supplies the system with additional-information by which the request is refined , reducing or increasing the number of returned answers . from the previous discussion it follows that a multimedia-ir system differs from a traditional ir-system in two main aspects . first , the structure of multimedia objects is more complex than the structure of typical textual data , handled by traditional ir systems . this complexity requires the integration of traditional ir technology with the-technology of multimedia-database management-systems to adequately represent , manage , and store multimedia objects . note that the use of a dbms also provides update functionalities and transaction-management which are in general not covered by typical ir systems . second , object-retrieval is mainly based on a similarity approach . moreover , the objects retrieved by a query are usually returned to the user in a ranked form . these aspects are successfully handled by ir techniques (see chapter 2) . however , ir systems have initially been developed to support libraries of articles , journals , and encyclopedic-knowledge bases (see chapter 2) . in those systems , the fundamental unit is the textual document thus , the techniques developed for traditional ir systems should be extended to deal with documents containing other media . multimedia-ir systems should therefore combine both the dbms and the ir technology , to integrate the data-modeling capabilities of dbmss with the advanced and similarity-based query-capabilities of ir systems . the resulting system will be able to answer attribute-based queries as well as content-based-queries . the whole architecture of the resulting system , in particular the query-optimizer , must take this aspect into account in order to efficiently support user requests . in this chapter , we discuss modeling and query-language issues for multimedia objects , pointing out the differences and the analogies between a traditional ir-system and a multimedia one . problems related to feature-extraction and searching are covered by chapter 12 . the first part of the chapter is devoted to the presentation of the most relevant models proposed in the literature for multimedia-data , with particular attention to commercial proposals . the second part of the chapter investigates the peculiarities of multimedia-query languages with respect to traditional ones . then , as an example , two different language proposals are presented . also in this case , we focus on commercial proposals and we discuss how the new standard sql3 could be ilsed to deal with multimedia-data-retrieval . 328 multimedia-ir : models and languages
