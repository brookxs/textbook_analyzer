the appropriateness of stratified hierarchic cluster methods there are many other hierarchic cluster methods , to name but a few : complete-link , average-link , etc. . for a critique of these methods see sibson [49] . my concern here is to indicate their appropriateness for document-retrieval . it is as well to realise that the kind of retrieval intended is one in which the entire cluster is retrieved without any further subsequent processing of the documents in the cluster . this is in contrast with the methods proposed by rocchio , litofsky , and crouch who use clustering purely to help limit the extent of a linear search . stratified systems of clusters are appropriate because the level of a cluster can be used in retrieval-strategies as a parameter analogous to rank position or matching-function threshold in a linear search . retrieval of a cluster which is a good match for a request at a low level in the hierarchy tends to produce high precision * but low recall * ; just as a cut-off at a low rank position in a linear search tends to yield high precision but low recall . similarly , retrieval of a cluster which is a good match for a request at a high level in the hierarchy tends to produce high recall but low precision . hierarchic systems of clusters are appropriate for three reasons . first , very efficient strategies can be devised to search a hierarchic clustering . secondly , construction of a hierarchic systems is much faster than construction of a non-hierarchic (that is , stratified but overlapping) system of clusters . thirdly , the storage requirements for a hierarchic structure are considerably less than for a non-hierarchic structure , particularly during the classification phase . given that hierarchic methods are appropriate for document-clustering the question arises : ` which method ? ' the answer is that under certain conditions (made precise in jardine and sibson [2]) the only acceptable stratified hierarchic cluster method is single-link . let me immediately qualify this by saying that it applies to a method which operates from a dissimilarity coefficient (or some equivalent variant) , and does not take into account methods based directly on the object-descriptions . * see introduction for definition .
