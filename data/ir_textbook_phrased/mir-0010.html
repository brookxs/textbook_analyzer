1.3 past , present , and future 1.3.1 early developments for approximately 4000 years , man has organized information for later retrieval and usage . a typical example is the table-of-contents of a book . since the volume of information eventually grew beyond a few books , it became necessary to build specialized data-structures to ensure faster access to the stored information . an old and popular data-structure for faster information-retrieval is a collection of selected words or concepts with which are associated pointers to the related information (or documents) รณ the index . in one form or another , indexes are at the core of every modern information retrieval-system . they provide faster access to the data and allow the query-processing task to be speeded up . a detailed coverage of indexes and their usage for searching can be found in chapter 8 . for centuries , indexes were created manually as categorization hierarchies . in fact , most libraries still use some form of categorical hierarchy to classify their volumes (or documents) , as discussed in chapter 14 . such hierarchies have usually been conceived by human-subjects from the library sciences field . more recently , the advent of modern computers has made possible the const ruction of large indexes automatically . automatic indexes provide a view of the retrieval problem which is much more related to the system itself than to the user-need . past , present , and future 7 in this respect , it is important to distinguish between two different views of the ir problem : a computer-centered one and a human-centered one . in the computer-centered view , the ir problem consists mainly of building up efficient indexes , processing user queries with high-performance , and developing ranking-algorithms which improve the ` quality ' of the answer set . in the human-centered view , the ir problem consists mainly of studying the behavior of the user , of understanding his main needs , and of determining how such understanding affects the organization and operation of the retrieval-system . according to this view , keyword_based query-processing might be seen as a strategy which is unlikely to yield a good solution to the information-retrieval problem in the long run . in this book , we focus mainly on the computer-centered view of the ir problem because it continues to be dominant in the market place .
