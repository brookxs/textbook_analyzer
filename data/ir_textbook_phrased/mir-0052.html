2.10.2 structure guided browsing to facilitate the task of browsing , the documents might be organized in a structure such as a directory . directories are hierarchies of classes which group documents covering related topics . such hierarchies of classes have been used to classify document-collections for many centuries now . thus , it seems natural to adapt them for use with modern browsing interfaces . in this case , we say that the user performs a structure guided type of browsing . the same idea can be applied to a single-document . for example , if we are browsing an-electronic-book , a first level of content could be the chapters , the second level , all sections , and so on . the last level would be the text itself (flat) . a good user-interface could go down or up those levels in a focused manner , assisting the user with the task of keeping track of the context . besides the structure which directs the browsing task , the interface can also include facilities such as a history map which identifies classes recently visited . this might be quite useful for dealing with very-large structures - an issue discussed in chapters 10 and 13 . when searching , the occurrences can also be displayed showing just the structure (for example , using the table-of-contents) . this allows us to see the occurrences in a global context instead of in a page of text that may have no indication of wthere we are .
