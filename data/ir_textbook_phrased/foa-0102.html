5.5 probabilistic-retrieval it should be clear by now that there are few logical grounds on which we could irrefutably prove that any document is relevant to any query . our best hope is to retrieve relevant documents with high probability ; i.e. , we 168 finding out about can only know about uncertainly . beginning in the early 1970s , the most seminal thinkers within ir have attempted to connect fundamental concepts like `` relevance '' from within ir to probability-theory (see [cooper , 1971 ; cooper , 1973 ; bookstein and swanson , 1974 ; cooper and maron , 1978 ; cooper , 1983] and other references throughout this section) . as typical search-engines moved past simpler boolean-retrieval to ranked retrievals [cooper , 1988] , and more recently as representational languages like bayesian-networks have become widespread within artificial-intelligence (cf. section 5.5.7) , a probabilistic foundation for foa has become an increasingly central concern . the derivation of the basic components of the bayesian decision models presented here follows van rijsbergen , p. 115 quite closely ; the lecture-notes on probabilistic ir2 developed by nobert fuhr provide a similar treatment of this background . who stated the prp ? the prp hides another assumption
