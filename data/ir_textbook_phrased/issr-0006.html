1.3.2 selective-dissemination-of-information the selective-dissemination-of-information (mail) process (see figure 1.4) provides the capability to dynamically compare newly received items in the information-system against standing statements of interest of users and deliver the introduction to information-retrieval-systems 17 item to those users whose statement of interest matches the contents of the item . the mail process is composed of the search-process , user statements of interest (profiles) and user mail files . as each item is received , it is processed against every user 's profile . a profile contains a typically broad search statement along with a list of user mail files that will receive the document if the search statement in the profile is satisfied . user-search profiles are different than ad-hoc queries in that they contain significantly more search-terms (10 to 100 times more terms) and cover a wider range of interests . these profiles define all the areas in which a user is interested versus an ad-hoc query which is frequently focused to answer a specific question . it has been shown in recent studies that automatically expanded user-profiles perform significantly better than human generated profiles (harman95) . when the search statement is satisfied , the item is placed in the mail file (s) associated with the profile . items in mail files are typically viewed in time of receipt order and automatically deleted after a specified time period (e.g. , after one month) or upon command from the user during display . the dynamic asynchronous updating of mail files makes it difficult to present the results of dissemination in estimated order of likelihood of relevance to the user (ranked order) . this is discussed in chapter 2 . very little research has focused exclusively on the mail dissemination process . most systems modify the algorithms they have established for retrospective search of document (item) databases to apply to mail profiles . dissemination differs from the ad-hoc search-process in that thousands of user-profiles are processed against one item versus the inverse and there is not a large relatively static database of items to be used in development of relevance-ranking weights for an item . both implementers and researchers have treated the dissemination process as independent from the rest of the information-system . the general assumption has been that the only knowledge available in making decisions on whether an incoming item is of interest is the user 's profile and the incoming item . this restricted view has produced suboptimal systems forcing the user to receive redundant-information that has little value . if a total information-retrieval-system view is taken , then the existing mail and index-files are also potentially available during the dissemination process . this would allow the dissemination profile to be expanded to include logic against existing files . for example , assume an index file (discussed below) exists that has the price of oil from mexico as a value in a field with a current value of $ 30 . an analyst will be less interested in items that discuss mexico and $ 30 oil prices then items that discuss mexico and prices other than $ 30 (i.e. , looking for changes) . similarly , if a mail file already has many items on a particular topic , it would be useful for a profile to not disseminate additional items on the same topic , or at least reduce the relative-importance that the system assigns to them (i.e. , the rank value) . selective-dissemination-of-information has not yet been applied to multimedia sources . in some cases where the audio is transformed into text , existing 18 chapter 1 textual algorithms have been applied to the transcribed text (e.g. , the darpa 's tides portal) , but little research has gone into dissemination techniques for multimedia sources .
