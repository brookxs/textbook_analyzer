7.1.2 alternative tasks for learning one obvious task we might ask of a learning-algorithm is that it learn the rank (-rrb- function . following the-probability-ranking-principle (section 5.5.1) , we might attempt to learn the probability that a document is relevant , given a set-of-features it contains . recall from section 4.2.1 how relfhk information can be used to modify a query-vector so as to move it closer to those documents a user has marked as relevant . as discussed in section 4.2.2 , the same technique can be used to move documents toward the query ! the radically different consequence of this change is that while query-modification is only useful once to the user benefiting from it , document modification changes the document 's representation for all subsequent users ' queries . we will also be concerned with another task . rather than assigning a single real number to each document (pr (relevance) y for example) , we shall attempt (using the same set of document features) to classify a document into one of a small number of potential categories . most simply , we may be interested in binary-classification of documents into one of two categories . an obvious use of binary-classification would be to classify into relevant and nonreievant classes . more complex classifications 256 finding out about into one of c different classes are also possible . for example , imagine that you would like to have your email client automatically sort your incoming email into various mail folders you have used historically . having decided how many classes to use , we must also determine whether our assignment to these classes is binary or if we should provide the probability that it belongs to a specific class . classification-techniques are discussed in section 7.4 .
