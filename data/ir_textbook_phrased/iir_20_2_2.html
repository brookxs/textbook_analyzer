dns resolution ip-address dns resolution domain-name service dns server en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domain_name_system dns resolution is a well-known bottleneck in web-crawling . due to the distributed nature of the domain-name service , dns resolution may entail multiple requests and round-trips across the-internet , requiring seconds and sometimes even longer . right away , this puts in jeopardy our goal of fetching several hundred documents a second . a standard remedy is to introduce caching : urls for which we have recently performed dns lookups are likely to be found in the dns cache , avoiding the need to go to the dns servers on the internet . however , obeying politeness constraints (see section 20.2.3) limits the of cache hit rate . there is another important difficulty in dns resolution ; the lookup implementations in standard libraries (likely to be used by anyone developing a crawler) are generally synchronous . this means that once a request is made to the domain-name service , other crawler threads at that node are blocked until the first request is completed . to circumvent this , most web-crawlers implement their own dns resolver as a component of the crawler . thread executing the resolver code sends a message to the dns server and then performs a timed wait : it resumes either when being signaled by another thread or when a set time quantum expires . a single , separate dns thread listens on the standard dns port (port 53) for incoming response packets from the name-service . upon receiving a response , it signals the appropriate crawler thread (in this case ,) and hands it the response packet if has not yet resumed because its time quantum has expired . a crawler thread that resumes because its wait time quantum has expired retries for a fixed number of attempts , sending out a new message to the dns server and performing a timed wait each time ; the designers of mercator recommend of the order of five attempts . the time quantum of the wait increases exponentially with each of these attempts ; mercator started with one second and ended with roughly 90 seconds , in consideration of the fact that there are host names that take tens of seconds to resolve .
