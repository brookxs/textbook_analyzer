4.2 extending the dialog with relevance-feedback figure 4.2 focuses on a single instance of relevance-feedback , shown as a labeling over the set of retr documents . but beyond any one reaction to a single * the fact that relevance-feedback is fundamentally nonmetric will have real consequence , for example , in the learning mechanisms that use it ; cf. chapter 7 . 110 finding out about a vquery qo qi q2 irs ret ! ret2 retf figure 4.3 query-session , linked by relevance-feedback retrieved set product , a central premise of the foa process is that users ' reactions to just-retrieved documents provide the pivotal linkage between assessments , to form the foa search dialog . this is perhaps more clear in figure 4.3 , where relevance-feedback is used to link a series of reactions into a query-session . attempts to support this searching process , and then attempts to rigorously evaluate how well software-systems support browsing users as they foa , is one of the most vexing issues within ir-evaluation [daniels et al. , 1985 ; saracevic et al. , 1988 ; larson , 1996 ; oddy et al. , 1992 ; o'day and jeffries , 1993 ; cawsey et al. , 1992 ; russel et al. , 1993 ; koenemann and belkin , 1996] . part of the problem is the misconception that if a search-engine works perfectly and the user-issues the perfect magic bullet query , out will spill all and only relevant documents ! such simplistic definitions of optimality come naturally to computer scientists ; library scientists , who are used to the naturalistic behaviors of real patrons in their libraries , know that a much more extended and nebulous form of support is required . marcia bates 's famous berrypicking metaphor [bates , 1986 ; bates , 1989] is useful here : [a] query is not satisfied by a single final retrieved set , but by a series of selections of individiual references and bits of information at each stage of the ever-modifying search . a bitat-a-time retrieval of this sort is here called berrypicking . this term is used by analogy to picking huckleberries or blueberries in the forest . the berries are scattered on the bushes ; they do not come in bunches . one must pick them one at a time . one could assessing the retrieval 111 do berrypicking of information without the search need itself changing (evolving) but ... [we] consider searches that combine both of these characteristics . [bates , 1989 , p. 410] in addition to highlighting the same iterative browsing-behavior central to foas characterization of the dialog , the `` evolving '' character of the information-need in bates 's metaphor is also important . imagine that you are in the forest on an idyllic day with only one purpose : to fill your bucket with the best blueberries you can find . early in the day , with your whole afternoon in front of you , you are likely to be very choosy . at this juncture , you could bump into a bush full of blueberries that were not as ripe or as large as you imagine must exist somewhere else in the forest , and not drop a single one into your basket . but late in the afternoon , if you have had poor luck and little to show for your efforts , you could come across an even worse bush and grab every single berry , even the shriveled ones ! applying this metaphor to foa is provocative in many respects . for example , it suggests that maintaining an explicit representation of the retrieved document `` basket '' might be a useful addition to any search-engine interface . it predicts a time course to the distribution of users ' relevance-feedback assessments . for now , we simply observe that it seems quite likely that an assessment of one document 's relevance will depend greatly on the `` basket '' of other documents we have already seen . the general idea of thinking of an `` evolutionary ecology of information-foraging '' [pirolli and card , 1997] has become less metaphoric and more concrete as information-search agents (like the infospiders described in section 7.6) explore the `` environment '' of the www .
