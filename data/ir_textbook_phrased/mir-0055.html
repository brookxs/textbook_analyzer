2.12 bibliographic discussion early in 1960 , maron and kuhns [547] had already discussed the issues of relevance and probabilistic indexing in information-retrieval . twenty-three years 70 modeling later , salton and mcgill wrote a book [698] which became a classic in the field . the book provides a thorough coverage of the three classic models in information-retrieval namely , the boolean , the vector , and the probabilistic-models . another landmark reference is the book by van rijsbergen [785] which , besides also covering the three classic models , presents a thorough and enjoyable discussion on the probabilistic-model . the book edited by prakes and baeza-yates [275] presents several data-structures-and-algorithms for ir and is more recent . further , it includes a discussion of ranking-algorithms by harman [340] which provides interesting insights into the history-of-information retrieval from 1960 to 1990 . boolean-operations and their implementation are covered in [803] . the inadequacy of boolean-queries for information-retrieval was characterized early on by verhoeff , goffman , and belzer [786] . the issue of adapting the boolean formalism to operate with other frameworks received great attention . book-stein discusses the problems related with merging boolean and weighted retrieval-systems [101] and the implications of boolean structure for probabilistic-retrieval [103] . losee and bookstein [522] cover the usage of boolean-queries with probabilistic-retrieval . anick et al. [21] propose an-interface based on natural-language for boolean-retrieval . a thesaurus-based boolean-retrieval system is proposed in [493] . the vector-model is maybe the most popular model among the research-community in information-retrieval . much of this popularity is due to the long-term research of salton and his associates [697 , 704] . most of this research revolved around the smart retrieval-system developed at cornell university [695 , 842 , 696] . term-weighting for the vector-model has also been investigated thoroughly . simple term-weighting was used early on by salton and lesk [697] . sparck jones introduced the idf factor [409 , 410] and salton and yang verified its effectiveness for improving retrieval [704] . yu and salton [842] further studied the effects of term-weighting in the final ranking . salton and buckley [696] summarize 20 years of experiments in term-weighting with the smart system . raghavan and wong [665] provide a critical-analysis of the vector-model . the probabilistic-model was introduced by robertson and sparck jones [677] and is thoroughly discussed in [785] . experimental-studies with the model were conducted by sparck jones [411 , 412] which used feedback from the user to estimate the initial probabilities . croft and harper [199] proposed a method to estimate these probabilities without feedback from the user . croft [198] later on added within-document frequency weights into the model . fuhr discusses probabilistic indexing through polynomial retrieval functions [281 , 284] . cooper , gey , and dabney [186] and later on gey [295] propose the use of logistic-regression with probabilistic-retrieval . lee and kantor [494] study the effect of inconsistent expert judgements on probabilistic-retrieval . puhr [282] reviews various variants of the classic probabilistic-model . cooper [187] , in a seminal paper , raises troubling questions on the utilization of the probabilistic-ranking principle in information-retrieval . the inference-network model was introduced by turtle and croft [772 , 771] in 1990 . haines and croft [332] discuss the utilization of inference-networks for user-relevance-feedback (see chapter 5) . callan , lu , and croft [139] use an bibliographic discussion 71 inference-network to search distributed document-collections . callan [138] , in his turn , discusses the application of inference-networks to information-filtering . the belief network-model , due to ribeiro-neto and muntz [674] , generalizes the inference-network model . the extended boolean-model was introduced by salton , fox , and wu [703] . lee , kim , kim , and lee [496] discuss the evaluation of boolean-operators with the extended boolean-model , while properties of the model are discussed in [495] . the generalized vector-space-model was introduced in 1985 by wong , ziarko , and wong [832 , 831] . latent-semantic-indexing was introduced in 1988 by furnas , deerwester , dumais , landauer , harshman , streeter , and lochbaum [287] . in a subsequent paper , bartell , cottrell , and belew [62] show that latent-semantic-indexing can be interpreted as a special case of multidimensional-scaling . regarding neural-network models for information-retrieval , our discussion in this book is based mainly on the work by wilkinson and hingston [815] . but we also benefited from the writings of kwok on the subject and related topics [466 , 467 , 469 , 468] . the fuzzy-set model (for information-retrieval) covered in this book is due to ogawa , morita , and kobayashi [616] . the utilization of fuzzy-theory in information-retrieval goes back to the 1970s with the work of radecki [658 , 659 , 660 , 661] , of sachs [691] , and of tahani [755] . bookstein [102] proposes the utilization of fuzzy operators to deal with weighted boolean searches . kraft and buel [461] utilize fuzzy-sets to generalize a boolean system . miyamoto , miyake , and nakayama [567] discuss the generation of a pseudothesaurus using co-occurrences and fuzzy operators . subsequently , miyamoto and nakayama [568] discuss the utilization of this thesaurus with information-retrieval-systems . our discussion on structured-text is based on the survey by [41] . another survey of interest (an older one though) is the work by macleod [533] . burkowski [132 , 133] proposed a model based on non-overlapping regions . clarke , cormack , and burkowski [173] extended this model with overlapping capabilities . the model based on proximal nodes was proposed by navarro and baeza-yates [589 , 590] . in [534] , macleod introduced a model based on a single hierarchy which also associates attributes with nodes in the hierarchy (for database-like querying) and hypertext-links with pairs of nodes . kilpelainen and mannila [439] discuss the retrieval from hierarchical texts through the specification of partial patterns . in [183] , consens and milo discuss algebras for querying text regions . a classic reference on hypertexts is the book by nielsen [604] , another popular reference is the book by shneiderman and kearsley [727] . conklin [181] presents an introductory survey of the area . the communications of the acm dedicated an special edition [177] to hypermedia which discusses in detail the dexter-model รณ a reference standard on the terminology and semantics of basic hypermedia concepts . a subsequent edition [178] was dedicated to the presentation of various models for supporting the design of hypermedia-applications .
