13.8.2 dynamic search and software-agents dynamic search in the web is equivalent to sequential text-searching . the idea is to use an online-search to discover relevant-information by following links . the main advantage is that you are searching in the current structure of the web , and not in what is stored in the index of a search-engine . while this approach is slow for the entire web , it might be used in small and dynamic subsets of the-web . the first heuristic devised was the fish search [113] , which exploits the intuition that relevant documents often have neighbors that are relevant . hence , the search is guided by following links in relevant documents . this was improved by shark search [366] , which does a better relevance-assessment of neighboring pages . this algorithm has been embedded in mapuccino (see section 13.5.3) , and figure 10.22 shows a web subset generated by this type of search . the main idea of these algorithms is to follow links in some priority , starting from a single page and a given query . at each step , the page with highest priority is analyzed . if it is found to be relevant , a heuristic decides to follow or not to follow the links on that page . if so , new pages are added to the priority list in the appropriate positions . related work includes software-agents for searching specific information on the web [602 , 477] . this implies dealing with heterogeneous-sources of information which have to be combined . important issues in this case are how to determine relevant-sources (see also chapters 9 and 15 , as well as section 10.4.4) and and how to merge the results retrieved (the fusion problem) . examples are shopping robots such as jango [401] , junglee [180] , and express [241] .
