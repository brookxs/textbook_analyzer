2.5.5 brief comparison of classic models in general , the boolean-model is considered to be the weakest classic method . its main problem is the inability to recognize partial-matches which frequently leads to poor performance . there is some controversy as to whether the probabilistic-model outperforms the vector-model . croft performed some experiments and suggested that the probabilistic-model provides a better retrieval-performance . however , experiments done afterwards by salton and buckley refute that claim . through several different measures , salton and buckley showed that the vector-model is expected to outperform the probabilistic-model with general collections . this also seems to be the dominant thought among researchers , practitioners , and the-web community , where the popularity of the vector-model runs high .
