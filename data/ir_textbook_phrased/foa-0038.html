3.2.2 zipfs own explanation to explain his empirical-observations , zipf himself proposed a theoretical-model that described the ultimate purpose of communication between authors and readers . zipfs theory was extraordinarily broad , addressing not only (!) patterns in text but also patterns across all human activities . according weighting and matching against indices 65 to zipf 's fundamental principle-of-least-effort all activities can be viewed as interactions between jobs needing to be done and tools developed to accomplish the jobs . in a mature society in which a variety of jobs and tools have existed for some time , a `` reciprocal economy '' forms . that is , there is a set of tools appropriate for doing certain jobs , and there is a set of jobs requiring certain tools . the principle-of-least-effort asserts that a person attempting to apply a tool to a job does so in order to minimize the probable effort in using that tool for that particular job . in applying this principle to texts , zipf makes an important correspondence - words work as tools , accomplishing jobs we need done . to simplify the situation greatly , imagine that the job an author is attempting to accomplish is simply to `` point '' to some referent , something in the world . '' '' authors would find it most convenient to simply use one pointing word all the time for all the jobs they are trying to accomplish . it makes their task much easier ; picking the right word is effortless . the author has a pressure toward unification of the vocabulary . from the reader 's point-of-view , it would be least ambiguous if a unique term were used for every possible function , every possible interpretation , every meaning . readers therefore have a pressure toward diversification of the vocabulary . this leads to the vocabulary balance we observe in zipf 's rule . zipf hypothesized that interplay between the forces of diversification and unification results in the use of existing words , which does not extend the vocabulary in most situations , together with the inclusion of new words in those novel situations that demand them . the trick is to find an economy of language that best satisfies both writer and reader . note , however , that the maintenance of the balance requires that authors receive feedback from their readers , confirming that they are both `` pointing '' to the same referent . blair has extended zipf 's analysis , considering zipps tool/job setting as it 's applied to our foa task [blair , 1990 ; blair , 1992] . he argues that one of the primary reasons foa systems fail is that the vocabulary balance is upset . the system of descriptors indexing the authors ' works (for example , the library or the-web) , standing between the authors who are writing the books and the searchers attempting to find them , breaks the feedback-channel that keeps the shared vocabulary in balance when author and reader are in direct contact .
