6.7 foa (the law) the careful reader will have noticed that there have been an unusually large number of examples drawn from the legal domain . there are a number of things it can teach us about general principles of foa [belew , 1987a] . the common law tradition is very old and has been connected to an organized corpus of documents in free-text for a very long time . as the doonesbury cartoon (part of gary trudeau 's bicentennial series) in figure 6.25 suggests , legal documents help to demonstrate just how long prose can live beyond its drafting . hafner was one of the first to recognize this , manually representing a wide range of attributes for a small number of documents in the legal domain [hafner , 1978] . this work has now become a part of a larger effort within ai to model the legal-reasoning process (e.g. , reasoning by analogy [ashley , 1990]) . here inference beyond the index 243 `` qoonesbury g.b.trudeau f 1 t # in a position to alien - blackmanftft a7b pinckmb.yortilnwm1 riepimiijsk lt ; mm0 / wrd . mo 80n ∞ ! aciock in anpnota \ j' 20ægt ; wmornim itihitclosdr if ---------------- tdrb501vin6 | ! / ^ # yn ^ ^ p what p0/t5ay about ma c0mmrrm5nt tdsquauty fob alum 5lavw tomcomb inextricably part of atajb , i aqrbe , but 3 z5as0na3l-i 6bor/a and wb carounas wbntalon6 with 7hb # = % sntawqhl comprom15b do you want to risk sbcssioh , jdopardlzihg '' evtrythine thb convbnikm tie tb cbnik has acoqmpushbc ? * \ figure 6.25 the long life of legal documents doonesbury © 1987 g. b. trudeau . reprinted with permission of universal press syndicate . all rights reserved we are most concerned with what we can learn from lawyers who have foa the law , which might generalize to other corpora and searchers . first , the fact that judicial opinions have been written for so long and in such a particular `` voice '' has meant that it is also possible to consider special linguistic characteristics of this legal genre [goodrich , 1987 ; levi , 1982] . second , notions of citation are especially well used within this corpus . simple concepts like impact have been described [shapiro , 1985) , and theories of legal citation proposed [merryman , 1977 ; tapper , 1980 ; ggden , 1993] . obviously , manipulation of access to the legal printed record (for example , by controlling which judges ' opinions are made available !) has enormous political ramifications [brenner , 1992] . this became even more true because recent consolidation of the media 244 finding out about industry means that one or two corporations effectively control the entire process of legal publication . third , the backbone of the legal process is an adversarial argument . this dialectic is often explicit , for example , as marked by the cf. and but of . citation conventions (cf. section 6.1) . the presence of such syntactic markers makes it conceivable to analyze polarization across an entire legal literature . of course , the arguments contained in briefs and opinions have a great deal more structure than simple opposition . the analysis of legal argument-structures , in conjunction with the textual foundations of common law , is perhaps the most important feature of the legal domain to foa . on the one hand , it is possible to model individual documents and their logical features so as to reason about them [hafher , 1978 ; mccarty , 1980] . special deontic logics have been developed especially to deal with the concepts of `` rights '' and `` obligations '' that are at the heart of many legal relations [lowe , 1985] . statistical analyses of large document corpora may seem contrary to logical analyses of the arguments contained in each of them , and in fact this chasm runs very deep . not only does it suggest different technology bases from the arsenal of (roughly inductive versus deductive) ai techniques , but it also reflects a tension within the law itself . rose [rose , 1994 , p. 95] refers to a spectrum of legal philosophies ranging from `` formalism '' to `` realism '' on the one hand , many legal documents certainly seem to function logically , with careful definitions and reasoning that langdell [langdell , 1887] has idealized as `` mechanical jurisprudence . '' at the same time , analyses such as the critical legal studies [unger , 1983] have helped to demonstrate that the law is just another social process . it is exactly this dual nature of the law , and hence of legal-texts , that makes it especially interesting as an example of foa [nerhot , 1991] . individual applications include litigation support-systems , which allow lawyers to search through the truckloads of documents involved in extended trials . on a much larger scale , systems like west group5s westlaw22 and reed elsevier 's lexis23 systems provide access to the bulk of statutory and case-law to all practicing lawyers [cohen , 1991 ; bing , 1987] . 2 * www . westiaw . ogxxl / 23 www.lexis.com inference beyond the index 245
