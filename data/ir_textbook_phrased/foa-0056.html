3.5.2 cosine-similarity we will focus here on the cosine-measure of similarity . not only does this respect the useful mathematical properties mentioned at the beginning of this section , but it is consistent with a geometric interpretation of the 96 finding out about vector-space that many find insightful : sim (q , d) = cos (qzd) q d wkd yjkd Â¶ ===== (3.39) ked v keq
