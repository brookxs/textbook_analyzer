1.5 digital-libraries and data-warehouses two other systems frequently described in the context of information-retrieval are digital-libraries and data-warehouses (or datamarts) . there is 22 chapter 1 significant overlap between these two systems and an information-storage-and-retrieval system . all three systems are repositories of information and their primary goal is to satisfy user-information-needs . information-retrieval easily dates back to vannevar-bush 's 1945 article on thinking (bush-45) that set the stage for many concepts in this area . libraries have been in existence since the beginning of writing and have served as a repository of the intellectual wealth of society . as such , libraries have always been concerned with storing and retrieving information in the media it is created on . as the quantities of information grew exponentially , libraries were forced to make maximum use of electronic tools to facilitate the storage-and-retrieval process . with the worldwide interneting of libraries and information sources (e.g. , publishers , news agencies , wire services , radio broadcasts) via the-internet , more focus has been on the concept of an electronic library . between 1991 and 1993 significant interest was placed on this area because of the interest in u.s. government and private funding for making more information available in digital form (fox-93) . during this time the terminology evolved from electronic libraries to digital-libraries . as the-internet continued its exponential growth and project funding became available , the topic of digital-libraries has grown . by 1995 enough research and pilot efforts had started to support the 1st acm international conference on digital-libraries (fox-96) . there remain significant discussions on what is a-digital library . everyone starts with the metaphor of the traditional library . the question is how do the traditional library-functions change as they migrate into supporting a-digital collection . since the collection is digital and there is a worldwide communications infrastructure available , the library no longer must own a copy of information as long as it can provide access . the existing quantity of hardcopy material guarantees that we will not have all digital-libraries for at least another generation of technology improvements . but there is no question that libraries have started and will continue to expand their focus to digital formats . with direct electronic access available to users the social-aspects of congregating in a library and learning from librarians , friends and colleagues will be lost and new electronic-collaboration equivalencies will come into existence (wiederhold-95) . indexing is one of the critical disciplines in library-science and significant effort has gone into the establishment of indexing and cataloging standards . migration of many of the library products to a-digital format introduces both opportunities and challenges . the fiill text of items available for search makes the index process a value added effort as described in section 1.3 . another important library service is a source of search intermediaries to assist users in finding information . with the proliferation of information available in electronic-form , the role of search intermediary will shift from an expert in search to being an expert in source analysis . searching will identify so much information in the global internet information-space that identification of the `` pedigree '' of information is required to understand its value . this will become the new refereeing role of a library . information-storage-and-retrieval technology has addressed a small subset of the issues associated with digital-libraries . the focus has been on the search-and-retrieval of textual data with no concern for establishing standards on introduction to information-retrieval-systems 23 the contents of the system . it has also ignored the issues of unique-identification and tracking of information required by the legal-aspects of copyright that restrict functions within a library environment . intellectual-property-rights in an environment that is not controlled by any country and their set of laws has become a major problem associated with the-internet . the conversion of existing hardcopy text , images (e.g. , pictures , maps) and analog (e.g. , audio , video) data and the storage-and-retrieval of the digital version is a major concern to digital-libraries . information-retrieval-systems are starting to evolve and incorporate digitized versions of these sources as part of the overall system . but there is also a lot of value placed on the original source (especially printed material) that is an issue to digital-libraries and to a lesser concern to information reteval systems . other issues such as how to continue to provide access to digital-information over many years as digital formats change have to be answered for the long term viability of digital-libraries . the term data-warehouse comes more from the commercial sector than academic sources . it comes from the need for organizations to control the proliferation of digital-information ensuring that it is known and recoverable . its goal is to provide to the decision makers the critical-information to answer future direction questions . frequently a data-warehouse is focused solely on structured databases . a data-warehouse consists of the data , an information directory that describes the contents and meaning of the data being stored , an input function that captures data and moves it to the data-warehouse , data search and manipulation tools that allow users the means to access and analyze the warehouse data and a delivery mechanism to export data to other warehouses , data-marts (small warehouses or subsets of a larger warehouse) , and external systems . data-warehouses are similar to information-storage-and-retrieval systems in that they both have a need for search-and-retrieval of information . but a data-warehouse is more focused on structured-data and decision-support technologies . in addition to the normal search-process , a complete system provides a flexible set of analytical tools to `` mine '' the data . data-mining (originally called knowledge-discovery-in-databases - kdd) is a search-process that automatically analyzes data and extract relationships and dependencies that were not part of the database-design . most of the research focus is on the statistics , pattern-recognition and artificial-intelligence algorithms to detect the hidden relationships of data . in reality the most difficult task is in preprocessing the data from the database for processing by the algorithms . this differs from clustering in information-retrieval in that clustering is based upon known characteristics of items , whereas data-mining does not depend upon known relationships . for more detail on data-mining see the november 1996 communications of the acm (vol . 39 , number 11) that focuses on this topic .
