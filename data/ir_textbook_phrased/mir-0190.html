10.4.3 examples , dialogs , and wizards another way to help users get started is to start them off with an example of interaction with the system . this technique is also known as retrieval by reformulation . an early version of this idea is embodied in the rabbit system [818] which provides graphical-representations of example database queries . a general-framework for a query is shown to the user who then modifies it to construct a partially complete description of what they want . the system then shows an example of the kind of information available that matches this partial description . for instance , if a user searching a computer products database indicates an interest in disks , an example item is retrieved with its disk descriptors filled in . the user can use or modify the displayed descriptors , and iterate the procedure . the idea of retrieval by reformulation has been developed further and extended to the domains of user-interface-development [581] and software-engineering [669] . the helgon system [255] is a modern variant of this idea applied to bibliographic database information . in helgon , users begin by navigating a hierarchy of topics from which they select structured examples , according to their interests . if a feature of an example is inappropriately set , the user can modify the feature to indicate how it would appear in the desired information . unfortunately , in tests with users , the system was found to be problematic . users had problems with the organization of the hierarchy , and found that searching for a useful example by critiquing an existing one to be tedious . this result starting-points 277 underscores an unfortunate difficulty with examples and dialogues : that of getting the user to the right starting dialogue or the right example strategy becomes a search-problem in itself . (how to index prior examples is studied extensively in the case-based-reasoning (cbr) literature [492 , 449] .) a more dynamic variation on this theme is the interactive dialog . dialog-based interfaces have been explored since the early days of information-retrieval-research , in an attempt to mimic the interaction provided by a human-search intermediary (e.g. , a reference librarian) . oddy did early work in the thomas system , which provided a question-and-answer session within a command-line-based interface [615] . more recently , belkin et al have defined quite elaborate dialog interaction-models [75] although these have not been assessed empirically to date . the digital libraryite system-interface [192] uses an animated focus-plus-context dialog as a way to acquaint users with standard sequences of operations within the system . initially an outline of all of the steps of the dialog is shown as a list . the user can expand the explanation of any individual step by clicking on its description . the user can expand out the entire dialog to see what questions are coming next , and then collapse it again in order to focus on the current tactic . a more restricted form of dialog that has become widely used in commercial products is that of the wizard . this tool helps users in time-limited tasks , but does not attempt to overtly teach the processes required to complete the tasks . the wizard presents a step-by-step shortcut through the sequence of menu choices (or tactics) that a user would normally perform in order to get a job done , reducing user-input to just a few choices with default settings [636] . a recent study [145] found wizards to be useful for goals that require many steps , for users who lack necessary domain-knowledge (for example , a restaurant owner installing accounting software) , and when steps must be completed in a fixed sequence (for example , a procedure for hiring personnel) . properties of successful wizards included allowing users to rerun a wizard and modify their previous work , showing an overview of the supported functions , and providing lucid descriptions and understandable outcomes for choices . wizards were found not to be helpful when the interface did not solve a problem effectively (for example , a commercial wizard for setting-up a desktop-search index requests users to specify how large to make the index , but supplies no information about how to make this decision) . wizards were also found not to be helpful when the goal was to teach the user how to use the interface , and when the wizard was not user-tested . it maybe the case that information-access is too variable a process for the use of wizards . a guided-tour leads a user through a sequence of navigational choices through hypertext-links , presenting the nodes in a logical order for some goal . in a dynamic tour , only relevant nodes are displayed , as opposed to the static case where the author decides what is relevant before the users have even formulated their queries [329] . a recent application is the walden paths project which enables teachers to define instructional !} * useful paths through pagers found nn the-web [289] . this approach has not been commonly used to date for 278 user-interfaces and visualization information-access but could be a promising direction for acquainting users with search-strategies in large hyperlinked systems .
