computing scores in a complete-search system chapter 6 developed the theory underlying term-weighting in documents for the purposes of scoring , leading up to vector-space-models and the basic cosine scoring algorithm of section 6.3.3 (page) . in this chapter we begin in section 7.1 with heuristics for speeding up this computation ; many of these heuristics achieve their speed at the risk of not finding quite the top documents matching the query . some of these heuristics generalize beyond cosine scoring . with section 7.1 in place , we have essentially all the components needed for a complete-search engine . we therefore take a step back from cosine scoring , to the more general problem of computing scores in a search-engine . in section 7.2 we outline a complete-search engine , including indexes and structures to support not only cosine scoring but also more general ranking factors such as query-term proximity . we describe how all of the various pieces fit together in section 7.2.4 . we conclude this chapter with section 7.3 , where we discuss how the vector-space-model for free-text queries interacts with common query-operators . subsections efficient scoring-and-ranking inexact top k document-retrieval index elimination champion lists static quality scores and ordering impact ordering cluster pruning components of an information-retrieval-system tiered indexes query-term proximity designing parsing and scoring-functions putting it all together vector-space scoring and query operator interaction boolean-retrieval wildcard queries phrase queries references and further reading
