2.5 implementation the range of potential implementations of the basic techniques discussed in this chapter and subsequent ones is quite remarkable . each depends extracting lexical-features 51 on features of the specific application , available hardware , and so on , such as : ï using a massively-parallel supercomputer of the mid-1980s to provide current news to financial analysts [stanfill and kahle , 1986a] ; ï searching for file names as part of the macos finder on a single personal-computer and then extending to support file-content searching as part of the macos sherlock2 utility ; ï smart3 is a classic software-suite designed to support experimentation into basic ir techniques (see section 3.4.3 for more details) ; ï providing a generic utility for managing gigabytes4 (mg) , for example , building an index for a cd-rom or dvd ; and ï making all of the pages on a www server searchable via web-server search tools5 or information-filtering tools .6 design-decisions depend on features such as corpus-size , available memory , and query response-time . two implementations have been developed to accompany this textbook , an earlier one in c and a more recent one in java ; see the foa web site7 for details .
