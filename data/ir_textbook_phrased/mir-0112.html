6.5.3 graphics and virtual-reality there are many formats proposed for three-dimensional-graphics . although this topic is not fully relevant to information-retrieval , we include some information here for the sake of completeness . our emphasis here is on the web . the computer-graphics metafile (cgm) standard (iso 8632) is defined for the open interchange of structured graphical objects and their associated attributes . cgm specifies a two-dimensional data-interchange standard which allows graphical data to be stored and exchanged between graphics devices , applications , and computer-systems in a device-independent manner . it is a structured format that can represent vector-graphics (for example , polylines or ellipses) , raster-graphics , and text . although initially cgm was a vector-graphics format , it has been extended to include raster capabilities and provides a very useful format for combined raster and vector-images . a metafile is a collection of elements . these elements may be the geometric components of the picture , such as polyline or polygon ; the appearance of these components ; or how to interpret a particular metafile or a particular picture . the cgm standard specifies which elements are allowed to occur in which positions in a metafile . the virtual-reality-modeling-language (vrml , iso/iec 14772-1) is a file-format for describing interactive-3d objects and wrorlds and is a subset of the silicon graphics openlnventor file-format . vrml is also intended to be a universal interchange-format for integrated 3d-graphics and multimedia . vrml may be used in a variety of application areas such as engineering and scientific-visualization , multimedia-presentations , entertainment and educational titles , web-pages , and shared-virtual-worlds . vrml has become the de facto standard modeling-language for the-web .
