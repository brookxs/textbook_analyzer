1.4.5 beyond text our definition of `` documents '' has hewn closely to the printed forms that still dominate the foa retrievals most people now do . but print media are not the only form of answer we might reasonably seek , and we must ensure that our methods generalize to the other media that are overview 23 increasingly part of the net . sound , images , movies , maps , and more are all appearing as part of the www , and they are typically intermixed with textual material . we need to be able to search all of these . one reason for casting the central problem of this text as `` finding out about '' is that many aspects of multimedia-retrieval remain the same from this perspective . we still have users , who have information-needs . we can still reasonably use the term `` document '' to include any potential answer to users ' queries , but now we expand this term to include whatever media are available . most centrally , we must still characterize what each document is about in order to match it to these queries , and users can still assess how well the search-engine has done . at the same time , many parts of the foa problem change as we move away from textual-documents to other media . most important is the increased difficulty of algorithmically extracting clues related to the documents ' semantic-content from their syntactic-features . the primary source of semantic-evidence used within text-based ir is the relative frequencies of keywords in document corpora , and a major portion of this text will show that this is a powerful set of clues indeed . we will also discuss the role other syntactic clues (e.g. , bibliographic links) associated with texts can play in understanding what they are about . as we move to other media , the important question becomes what consistent features these new-media have that we can also process to reliably infer semantic-content . for example , what can we know about an image from the distribution of its pixel values ? do all sunsets share a brightness profile (dark below a horizontal line , symmetrically bright above it) that is reliable enough that this clue can be exploited to identify just these scenes ? ^ if so , can this mode of analysis be generalized sufficiently to allow signature of retrieval of images based on more typical descriptors such as children human feeding animals ? even if we imagine that certain obvious , superficial aspects of some images may be extracted , our hopes must not blind us to the rich vocabulary that many images use every day . consider a query like fidelity as a political issue and consider figure 1.6 . would any reasonable person claim that they could provide an exhaustive list of all the things these pictures `` say '' ? did you include the set of hillary 's jaw ? the angle of bill 's gaze ? the attitudes about divorce prevalent when the doles ' picture was taken and now ? the tacit commentary by the editors of 24 finding out about c : : ^ - ' - ' : ? * % # ^ . . ^ . - ^ \ . . '' '' v figure 1.6 finding out about political fidelity * reproduced by permission of the new york times the new york times produced by the juxtaposition of these two photos ? note also that this picture (and its selection for use in this text !) occurred monica the years before anyone had even heard of monica lewinsky ! ^ meme figure 1.7 gives a second example . this is a photograph of a locking display case , containing a concert performance schedule . pasted over the glass of the case is a sign , saying : `` ignore this calendar : these dates are 3 years old . '' but the photo also reveals a number of more subtle clues - that the key to the case has been lost (for three years !) , that some frustrated teacher finally got tired of dealing with confused parents , that none of the school 's administrators can think of a more imaginative solution . these examples may seem far-fetched . but those of you old enough to remember the cold-war may also remember that there was an entire job category known as `` kremlinologist '' : someone expert at divining various power shifts among the politburo based on evidence such as where various participants were placed within group photos ! the conventional wisdom is that `` a picture is worth a thousand words '' and although some images may not require much explanation , others speak volumes . as we move from still-images to movies , entirely new channels * the new york times , 15 sept. 1996 , week in review , p. 1 . overview 25 figure 1.7 obsolete concert schedule for meaning - conveyed with the camera 's attentional focus , soundtrack , etc. - are available to a skilled director . music itself has an equally rich but distinct vocabulary . the ability to easily record and transmit digital spoken documents (speech) makes this form of audio especially worthy of analysis [sparck jones et al. , 1996] . as with text , music , film , and motion-pictures all predate their representations on computers . the convenience and availability of all these electronic-media make it more possible and even more important to analyze them . once again , text is an excellent place to begin . semiotics is one label for the subfield of linguistics concerned with words as symbols , as conveyors of meaning . words in a language represent a particularly coherent system of symbol use , but so do the symbols used by photo journalists , painters , and movie directors . the meaning of these symbols changes with time ; recall the pictures of the clintons and doles , their interpretation at the time of publication , and their interpretation now . what these pictures mean is different if we ask about the original context of 1996 and its meaning now . and again , complex , shifting meanings are 26 finding out about typical not only of images but of documents as well : watson and crick 's publication of thedna code in nature in 1953 [watson and crick , 1953] was important even then , but what that paper means now could not have been anticipated . yet the prospects for associating contentful descriptors with images and even richer media are not quite as bleak as they might seem . in many important cases (e.g. , the archives of news photos maintained by magazines and newspapers) , images are accompanied by captions , and video streams with transcripts . this additional manually constructed textual data means that techniques for inferring semantic-content directly from images can piggyback on top of text-based ir techniques . in conjunction with the machine-learning-techniques we will discuss (cf. chapter 7) , statistically reliable associations found in captioned image and video corpora can be extrapolated to situations where we have images without captions and video without transcripts . in the interim , we will return to the narrower , text-only notion of a document with which we began and consider foa solutions for this simpler (!) case .
