4.2.1 using relevance-feedback for query-refinement while figure 4.2 showed the retrieved set of documents as a simple set , it is interesting to impose the relevance-feedback labeling on the retrieved documents viewed in vector-space . figure 4.4 shows a query-vector and a number of retrieved documents , together with a plausible distribution of relevance-feedback over them . that is , we can expect that there is some localized region in vector-space where © relevant documents are most likely to occur . if we believe that these positively labeled retrieved documents are in fact clustered , it becomes appropriate to consider a hypothetical centroid 112 finding out about figure 4.4 relevance-feedback labels in vector-space figure 4.5 various ways of being irrelevant (average) document d + gt ; which is at the center of all those documents that users have identified as relevant . it is less reasonable * however , to imagine that the negatively labeled 9 documents are similarly clustered . documents that were inappropriately retrieved failed to be relevant for one reason or another ; there may be several such reasons . these are shown as discriminating planes in figure 4.5 . assessing the retrieval 113 - bct figure 4.6 using relevance-feedback to refine the query the vector-space view also lets us easily portray two very different uses to which relevance-feedback information might be applied . most typically , relevance-feedback is used to refine the user 's query . figure 4.6 represents this refinement in terms of two changes we can make to the initial query vector . the first is to `` take a step toward '' the centroid of the positive relevance-feedback cluster . the size of this stept reflects how confident we are that the positive cluster-centroid is a better characterization of the user 's interests than the original query . there is one important difference between the query and even a slight perturbation of it toward a cluster 's centroid : while the original query-vector is often very sparse and results from just those few words used in the user 's original query , any movement toward the centroid will include (linear-combinations of) all those keywords used in any of the positively labeled documents . the additional difficulty in implementing this more densely filled feature-vector becomes a serious obstacle in many system implementations . the fact that relevance feedback-refined queries involve many more nonzero keyword entries also means that query weighting and matching techniques may be sensitive to this difference . seminal work on the use of relevance-feedback was done by saltongt ; especially with students rocchio , brauen , and ide in the late 1960s and early 1970s [rocchio , 1966 ; brauen , 1969 ; salton , 1972] . more recent students have extended the theory of query-refinement and related it to topics in machine-learning [buckley et al , 1994 ; buckley and salton , 1995 ; allan , 1996] . neural-net style learning 114 finding out about some of these experiments explored a second modification to the query-vector . in addition to moving toward the d '' ^ center of © , it is also plausible to move away from the irrelevant retrieved documents 0 . as noted earlier , however , it is much less likely that these irrelevant documents are as conveniently clustered . as salton [salton and mcgill , 1983] reported : ... retrieval operation is most effective when the relevant documents as well as the non-relevant documents are tightly clustered and the difference between the two groups is as large as possible ___ the relevance-feedback operation is less favorable in the more realistic case where the set of non-relevant documents covers a wider area of the space , [p. 145] one possible strategy is to take a single element d ~ ~ of the irrelevant retrieved documents (for example , the most highly ranked irrelevant retrieval) and define the direction of movement with respect to it alone . as we have discussed in connection with figure 4.2 , relevance-feedback helps to link individual queries into a browsing sequence . and so , although we have focused here on the simplest form of query-refinement , with respect to the users ' initial queries , relevance feedbackcn be given again and again . an initial query vector is moved toward the centroid of documents identified as relevant (and perhaps away from an especially bad one) ; this modified query instigates a new retrieval , which is again refined . in practice , it appears that such adjustments result in diminishing returns after only a few iterations of query-refinement [salton and mcgill , 1983 ; stanfill and kahle , 1986b] . however , section 7.3 will discuss a type of foa in which a document-corpus is constantly changing and the user 's interest in a topic is longlived . in this case , we can imagine the query as a filter against which a constant stream (e.g. , of newly published web-documents) is applied relevance-feedback has also been used in this setting , to make ongoing changes to the query/filter that continue to improve its effectiveness [allan , 1996] . using relevance-feedback for query-refinement produces results that are immediately satisfying to the users . first , it automatically generates a new query with which they can continue their browsing process . second , the statistical-analysis of positively labeled retrieved documents can provide other forms of useful information to the users as well . for example , rather than assessing the retrieval 115 figure 4.7 document modifications due to relevance-feedback simply retrieving a new set of documents , new keywords that are not in the users ' original queries but are present in positively labeled documents at statistically significantly levels can be suggested to the users as new vocabulary . conversely , words that were in the original query but are negatively correlated with d + (and/or positively correlated with d ~ ~) can also be identified .
