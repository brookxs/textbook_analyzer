6.4.2 html html stands for hypertext markup-language and is an instance of sgml . html was created in 1992 and has evolved during the past years , 4.0 being the latest version , released as a recommendation at the end of 1997 . currently it is being extended in many ways to solve its many limitations , for example , to be able to write mathematical-formulas . most documents on the web are stored and transmitted in html . html is a simple language well suited for hypertext , multimedia , and the display of small and simple documents . html is based on sgml , and although there is an html dtd (document-type-definition) , most html instances do not explicitly make reference to the dtd . the html tags follow all the sgml conventions and also include formatting directives . html-documents can have other media embedded within them , such as images or audio in different formats . html also has fields for metadata , which can be used for different applications and purposes . if we also add programs (for example , using javascript) inside a page , some people call it dynamic-html (or dhtml) . this should not be confused with a microsoft proposal (also called dynamic-html) of an application-programming-interface (api) for accessing and manipulating html-documents . figure 6.4 gives an example of an html-document together with its output in a web-browser . because html does not fix the presentation style of a document , in 1997 , cascade-style-sheets (css) were introduced . css offer a powerful and manageable way for authors , artists , and typographers to create visual-effects that improve the aesthetics of html pages in the web . style-sheets can be used one after another (called cascading) to define the presentation style for different elements of an html page . style-sheets separate information about presentation from document-content , which in turn simplifies web-site maintenance , promotes web-page accessibility , and makes the-web faster . however , css support in current browsers is still modest . another disadvantage is that two style-sheets do not have to be consistent nor complete , so the stylistic result might not be good , in particular regarding color . css are supposed to balance the expectations of the author and of the reader regarding presentation issues . nevertheless , it is not clear who or in which cases the author or the reader should define the presentation . the evolution of html implies support for backward-compatibility and also for forward compatibility , because people should also be able to see new documents with old browsers . html 4.0 has been specified in three flavors : strict , transitional , and frameset . strict html only worries about non-presentational markup-languages 153 lt ; htmlgt ; lt ; headgt ; lt ; titlegt ; html examplelt ; / titlegt ; lt ; meta naine = rby content = `` just an example `` gt ; lt ; / headgt ; lt ; bodygt ; lt ; hlgt ; html examplelt ; / hlgt ; lt ; pgt ; lt ; hrgt ; lt ; pgt ; html has many lt ; igt ; tagslt ; / igt ; , among them : lt ; ligt ; links to other lt ; a href = http://www.w3c.org/gt;pageslt;/agt; (a from anchor) , lt ; ligt ; paragraphs (p) , headings (hi , h2 , etc) , font types (b , i) , lt ; ligt ; horizontal rules (hr) , indented lists and items (ul , li) , lt ; ligt ; images (img) , tables , forms , etc. lt ; hrgt ; lt ; pgt ; lt ; img align = left src = `` at_work . gif `` gt ; this page is lt ; bgt ; alwayslt ; / bgt ; under construction . lt ; / bodygt ; lt ; / htmlgt ; html example html has many tags , among them : ¶ links to other gag ^ .
