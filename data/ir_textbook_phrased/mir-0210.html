10.7.5 pseudo-relevance-feedback at the far end of the system versus user-feedback spectrum is what is informally known as pseudo-relevance-feedback . in this method , rather than relying on the user to choose the top k relevant documents , the system simply assumes that its top-ranked documents are relevant , and uses these documents to augment the query with a relevance-feedback ranking-algorithm . this procedure has been found to be highly effective in some settings [760 , 465 , 12] , most likely those in which the original query statement is long and precise . an intriguing extension to this idea is to use the output of clustering of retrieval results as the input to a relevance-feedback-mechanism , either by having the user or the system select the cluster to be used [359] , but this idea has not yet been evaluated . interface-support for the search-process 309
