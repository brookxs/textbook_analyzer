10.7 using relevance-judgements an import ant part of the information-access process is query-reformulation , and a proven effective technique for query-reformulation is relevance-feedback . in its original form , relevance-feedback refers to an interaction-cycle in which the user selects a small set of documents that appear to be relevant to the query , and the system then uses features derived from these selected relevant documents to revise the original query . this revised query is then executed and a new set of documents is returned . documents from the original set can appear in the new results 304 user-interfaces and visualization list , although they are likely to appear in a different rank-order . relevance-feedback in its original form has been shown to be an effective mechanism for improving retrieval results in a variety of studies and settings [702 , 343 , 127] . in recent years the scope of ideas that can be classified under this term has widened greatly . relevance-feedback introduces important design choices , including which operations should be performed automatically by the system and which should be user initiated and controlled . bates discusses this issue in detail [66] , asserting that despite the emphasis in modern systems to try to automate the entire process , an intermediate approach in which the system helps automate search at a strategic level is preferable . bates suggests an analogy of an automatic-camera versus one with adjustable lenses and shutter speeds . on many occasions , a quick , easy method that requires little training or thought is appropriate . at other times the user-needs more control over the operation of the machinery , while still not wanting to know about the low level details of its operation . a related idea is that , for any interface , control should be described in terms of the task being done , not in terms of how the machine can be made to accomplish the task [607] . continuing the camera analogy , the user should be able to control the mood created by the photograph , rather than the adjustment of the lens . in information-access systems , control should be over the kind of information returned , not over which terms are used to modify the query . unfortunately it is often quite difficult to build interfaces to complex-systems that behave in this manner .
