relation to multinomial unigram-language-model 12.2.1 12.2.1 113 104 12.2.1 (120) 113 120 120 we also used mle estimates in section 12.2.2 (page) and encountered the problem of zero estimates owing to sparse-data (page 12.2.2) ; but instead of add-one-smoothing , we used a mixture of two distributions to address the problem there . add-one-smoothing is closely related to add - smoothing in section 11.3.4 (page) . exercises . why is in table 13.2 expected to hold for most text-collections ?
