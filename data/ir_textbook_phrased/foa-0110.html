6 __________ inference beyond the index the index , that critical mapping between documents and descriptive keywords , has dominated our approach to foa in all the preceding chapters . but there is of course a larger context of available information : foa can be accomplished by showing a user relations among keywords , by acquainting him or her with important authors , by pointing to important journals where relevant documents are often published , and so on . retrieval of all these information-resources , especially when structured in meaningful interfaces , can tell a user much more than a simple list of relevant documents . this chapter is concerned with exploiting a variety of other clues we might have about documents (and keywords , authors , etc.) , above and beyond the statistical , word-frequency information that has been at the heart of the index relation . in all cases , these techniques identify some new source of data , represent it efficiently , and then perform some kind of inference over the representation . ai is a subdiscipline of computer-science that is centrally concerned with questions of knowledge-representation-and-inference over those representations , especially when these algorithms arguably lead to `` intelligent '' behaviors . (in many ways the best characterization of the ai domain is the extensional one provided by the ait corpus of ph.d. dissertations .) we could expect , therefore , that there would be a great deal of cross-fertilization between ai methods and ir methods , both having 182 inference beyond the index 183 grown up within computer-science during the same period . but for complicated reasons , until recently there has been very little interaction . ^ history : ai xor by and large , ai has defined its notions of inference in logical terms , ir ? originally based on automatic theorem-proving results . chapter 5 discussed ir 's probabilistic foundations , and one immediate axis of difference between ai and ir is the distinction between primarily logical and primarily probabilistic modes of inference . nevertheless , some in ir perceived early on the advantages offered by afs knowledge representations [smith , 1981] and expert-systems techniques [fox and france , 1987 ; mccune et al , 1985 ; fidel , 1986] . today , the fields of ai and ir align much more closely . for example , both machine-learning and natural-language-processing have always been considered central issues within ai . the next chapter will discuss at length machine-learning-techniques as they have been applied to document corpora . section 8.2 can only sketch another large intersection , corpus-based linguistics , where natural-language issues and ir techniques also merge . the advantages of applying ai knowledge-representation techniques become especially obvious when additional structured attributes are associated with documents , keywords , and authors . early on , kochen [kochen , 1975] considered a broad range of these forms of information as shown in figure 6.1 . even more inclusive lists have since been proposed [katzer et al. , 1982 ; hanson , 1988] . this shows the primary index relation in the larger context of other information we might have available . what all of these additional forms of information have in common is their ability to shed new light on the semantic questions of what the documents are about . information on the publication details of documents , for example , the journal date or page numbers of documents , can help provide a context within which individual documents can be better understood . much of this data-about-data document is now referred to as meta-data . this additional modeling of document-structure , in languages like xml and codified in standards like the dublin coreyl is one of the most important ways in which database and ir technologies now interact . this constructively blurs many of the database/search engine differences mentioned earlier (cf. section 1.6) . techniques for performing fact-extraction - building database-relations 184 finding out about broader/narrower term publication figure 6,1 other information available for foa (after [kochen , 1975]) from analysis of textual www pages [craven et al , 1998] - suggest a broad range of new ways that structured attributes may enter into the retrieval-task . section 6.1 discusses one of the most important ways in which documents can be understood independent of their keywords . in science , in the common law tradition , more recently in email newsgroups , and now with html hyperlinks , the ability to link one document to another can provide vital information about how the arguments of one document relate to those contained in another . section 6.3 will discuss some of the special representation-techniques that have been used to organize keywords in the vocabulary . it is also inference beyond the index 185 possible to reason about authors of documents . section 6.4.1 discusses ph.d. `` genealogies '' in which dissertation authors are related to one another by shared advisors . coauthorship and membership in the same research institution have also been proposed as ways to provide context on a particular author 's words . in some cases , characterizations of expertise of the authors , independent of the documents themselves , are available . the chapter concludes with several suggestions of how these varied information-sources can become integrated as part of next-generation foa tools . section 6.5 considers several `` modes of inference '' by which new conclusions about keywords and documents can be reached from elementary facts . section 6.6 suggests a few of the new interface-techniques that become available as richer data-streams are provided by and presented back to a user . sections 6.7 and 6.8 look at two domains of discourse in particular - the law and science surrounding molecular-genetics - as examples of how such techniques can be marshaled toward particular foa purposes . after considering all these ways that the methods of ai can be used to help with foa , section 6.9 concludes by speculating about how the problem of intelligence itself might be changed as we take seriously the prospect of basing it on textual representations .
