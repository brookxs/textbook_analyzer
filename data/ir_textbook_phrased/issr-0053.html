4.2.3 dictionary-look-up stemmers an alternative to solely relying on algorithms to determine a stem is to use a dictionary-look-up mechanism . in this approach , simple stemming rules still may be applied . the rules are taken from those that have the fewest exceptions (e.g. , removing pluralization from nouns) . but even the most consistent rules have exceptions that need to be addressed . the original term or stemmed version of the term is looked up in a dictionary and replaced by the stem that best represents it . this technique has been implemented in the inquery and retrievalware systems . the inquery-system uses a stemming technique called kstem . kstem is a morphological-analyzer that conflates word variants to a root form (kstem-95) . it tries to avoid collapsing words with different meanings into the same root . for example , `` memorial '' and `` memorize '' reduce to `` memory . '' but `` memorial '' and `` memorize '' are not synonyms and have very different meanings . kstem , like other stemmers associated with natural-language processors and dictionaries , returns words instead of truncated word forms . generally , kstem requires a word to be in the dictionary before it reduces one word-form to another . some endings are always removed , even if the root form is not found in the dictionary (e.g. , 4ness ' , ` ly ') . if the word being processed is in the dictionary , it is assumed to be unrelated to the root after stemming and conflation is not performed (e.g. , ` factorial ' needs to be in the dictionary or it is stemmed to ` factory ') . for irregular morphologies , it is necessary to explicitly map the word variant to the root desired (for example , `` matrices '' to `` matrix '') . the kstem system uses the following six major data files to control and limit the stemming process : dictionary of words (lexicon) supplemental list of words for the dictionary exceptions list for those words that should retain an `` e '' at the end (e.g. , `` suites '' to `` suite '' but `` suited '' to `` suit '') directconflation - allows definition of direct conflation via word-pairs that override the stemming algorithm country_nationality - conflations between nationalities and countries (`` british '' maps to `` britain '') 78 chapter 4 proper nouns - a list of proper nouns that should not be stemmed . the strength of the retrieval ware system lies in its thesaurus/semantic network support data-structure that contains over 400,000 words . the dictionaries that are used contain the morphological variants of words . new words that are not special forms (e.g. , dates , phone numbers) are located in the dictionary to determine simpler forms by stripping off suffixes and respelling plurals as defined in the dictionary .
