7.7 other learning applications and issues this chapter has focused primarily on applications of classification-techniques that are among the most successful with machine-learning . there are , however , a wide range of other ways that adaptive mechanisms have been incorporated within the foa context [bono , 1972] . for example , gordon has applied genetic-algorithm optimization to the construction of effective queries [gordon , 1988] . the success of social-collaborative-filtering , where adaptation in response to the activities of one user is extrapolated to other users [shardaanand and miaes , 1995] , promises to become an important part of the www industry (as recently demonstrated by microsoft 's purchase of firefly , for example) . learning to extract structured , database-like relations from the vast www of unstructured documents is another important new direction [howe and dreilinger , 1997 ; craven et al , 1998] . here we mention several other ways that adaptation-mechanisms can be exploited and some new problems arising from this dynamism .
