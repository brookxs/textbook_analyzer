processing figure 1.5 structure of the book . in the traditional keyword-based approach , the user specifies his information-need by providing sets of keywords and the information-system retrieves the documents which best approximate the user-query . also , the information-system organization of the book 13 might attempt to rank the retrieved documents using some measure of relevance . this ranking task is critical in the process of attempting to satisfy the user-information need and is the main goal of modeling in ir . thus , information-retrieval-models are discussed early in chapter 2 . the discussion introduces many of the fundamental concepts in information-retrieval and lays down much of the foundation for the subsequent chapters . our coverage is detailed and broad . classic models (boolean , vector , and probabilistic) , modern probabilistic variants (belief network-models) , alternative paradigms (extended boolean , generalized vector , latent-semantic-indexing , neural-networks , and fuzzy retrieval) , structured-text retrieval , and models for browsing (hypertext) are all carefully introduced and explained . once a new retrieval algorithm (maybe based on a new retrieval-model) is conceived , it is necessary to evaluate its performance . traditional evaluation-strategies usually attempt to estimate the costs of the new algorithm in terms of time and space . with an information-retrieval-system , however , there is the additional issue of evaluating the relevance of the documents retrieved . for this purpose , text reference collections and evaluation procedures based on variables other than time and space are used . chapter 3 is dedicated to the discussion of retrieval-evaluation . in traditional ir , queries are normally expressed as a set of keywords which is quite convenient because the approach is simple and easy to implement . however , the simplicity of the approach prevents the formulation of more elaborate querying tasks . for instance , queries which refer to both the structure and the content of the text can not be formulated . to overcome this deficiency , more sophisticated query-languages are required . chapter 4 discusses various types of query-languages . since now the user might refer to the structure of a document in his query , this structure has to be defined . this is done by embedding the description of a document-content and of its structure in a text language such as the standard-generalized-markup-language (sgml) . as illustrated in figure 1.5 , chapter 6 is dedicated to the discussion of text languages . retrieval based on keywords might be of fairly low quality . two possible reasons are as follows . first , the user-query might be composed of too few terms which usually implies that the query-context is poorly characterized . this is frequently the case , for instance , in the web . this problem is dealt with through transformations in the query such as query-expansion and user-relevance-feedback . such query-operations are covered in chapter 5 . second , the set of keywords generated for a given document might fail to summarize its semantic-content properly . this problem is dealt with through transformations in the text such as identification of noun-groups to be used as keywords , stemming , and the use of a thesaurus . additionally , for reasons of efficiency , text-compression can be employed . chapter 7 is dedicated to text operations . given the user-query , the information-system has to retrieve the documents which are related to that query . the potentially large size of the document-collection (e.g. , the-web is composed of millions of documents) implies that specialized indexing-techniques must be used if efficient retrieval is to be achieved . thus , to speed up the task of matching documents to queries , proper indexing and search14 introduction ing techniques are used as discussed in chapter 8 . additionally , query-processing can be further accelerated through the adoption of parallel and distributed ir techniques as discussed in chapter 9 . as illustrated in figure 1.5 , all the key issues regarding text ir , from modeling to fast-query processing , are covered in this book . modern user-interfaces implement strategies which assist the user to form a query . the main objective is to allow him to define more precisely the context associated to his information-need . the importance of query contextualization is a consequence of the difficulty normally faced by users during the querying process . consider , for instance , the problem of quickly finding useful information in the-web . navigation in hyperspace is not a good solution due to the absence of a logical and semantically well defined structure (the-web has no underlying logical model) . a popular approach for specifying a user-query in the web consists of providing a set of keywords which are searched for . unfortunately , the number of terms provided by a common user is small (typically , fewer than four) which usually implies that the query is vague . this means that new-user interface paradigms which assist the user with the query-formation process are required . further , since a vague user-query usually retrieves hundreds of documents , the conventional approach of displaying these documents as items of a scrolling list is clearly inadequate . to deal with this problem , new data-visualization paradigms have been proposed in recent years . the main trend is towards visualization of a large subset of the retrieved documents at once and direct-manipulation of the whole subset . user-interfaces for assisting the user to form his query and current approaches for visualization of large-data-sets are covered in chapter 10 . following this , we discuss the application of ir techniques to multimedia-data . the key issue is how to model , index , and search structured-documents which contain multimedia objects such as digitized voice , images , and other binary-data . models and query-languages for office and medical-information-retrieval systems are covered in chapter 11 . efficient indexing and searching of multimedia objects is covered in chapter 12 . some readers may argue that the models and techniques for multimedia-retrieval are rather different from those for classic text-retrieval . however , we take into account that images and text are usually together and that with the-web , other media types (such as video and audio) can also be mixed in . therefore , we believe that in the future , all the above will be treated in a unified and consistent manner . our book is a first step in that direction . the final three chapters of the book are dedicated to applications of modern information retrieval : the-web , bibliographic systems , and digital-libraries . as illustrated in figure 1.5 , chapter 13 presents the-web and discusses the main problems related to the issue of searching the-web for useful information . also , our discussion covers briefly the most popular search-engines in the web presenting particularities of their organization . chapter 14 covers commercial document-databases and online-public-access-catalogs . commercial document-databases are still the largest information-retrieval-systems nowadays . lexis-nexis , for instance , has a database with 1.3 billion documents and attends to over 120 million query requests annually . finally , chapter 15 discusses modern digital how to use this book 15 libraries . architectural issues , models , prototypes , and standards are all covered . the discussion also introduces the ' 5s ' model (streams , structures , spaces , scenarios and societies) as a framework for providing theoretical and practical unification of digital-libraries .
