3.2.4 herbert simon 's explanation simon considered a very different model , focused on the author 's activity of constructing a text . simon 's model is based on two assumptions . first , that new words - neologisms - introduced by the author and not previously used are introduced at some constant probability . second , that the probability of a word having occurred exactly i times is proportional to the total number of occurrences of all words that have appeared exactly i times . these assumptions allow simon to use the basic mathematics of `` pure birth processes '' to account for word-frequency rankings . * simon was interested in models for the `` associative '' processes underlying authors ' cognition , '' ... sampling earlier segments of the word-sequence '' [simon , 1955 , p. 434] as they compose . he acknowledged * in the same paper , `` on a class of skew distributions '' [simon , 1955] , simon gives similar accounts for the numbers of papers published by scientists , city populations , and distributions of biological taxa . 68 finding out about that authors also use processes of `` imitation : sampling segments of word-sequences from other works of other authors , and , of course , from sequences he has heard . '' simon imagined this model as potentially applying to three different distributions : ï the distribution of word-frequencies in the whole historical sequence of words that constitute a language ; ï the distribution of word-frequencies in a continuous piece of prose ; and ï the distribution of word-frequencies in a sample of prose assembled from compositive sources . he seems most engaged by the second of these alternatives , considering the activity of a particular author . (he uses james joyce 's ulysses as an example .) obviously this word-based-model provides a very different explanation of zipf s law from mandelbrot 's and miller 's character-based ones . simon was familiar with such models but argued [simon , 1955 , p. 435] that his own `` averaging rather than [miller 's] maximizing assumptions '' are more desirable . but as miller notes , `` the assumption of maximization can be replaced by the assumption of random spacing '' [miller , 1957 , p. 313] . worse , in terms of the empirical bottom line , simon 's equation does not fit available data as well .
