7.2 document-preprocessing document-preprocessing is a procedure which can be divided mainly into five text operations (or transformations) : (1) lexical-analysis of the text with the objective of treating digits , hyphens , punctuation-marks , and the case of letters . (2) elimination of stopwords with the objective of filtering out words with very low discrimination values for retrieval purposes . (3) stemming of the remaining words with the objective of removing affixes (i.e. , prefixes-and-suffixes) and allowing the retrieval of documents containing syntactic-variations of query terms (e.g. , connect , connecting , connected , etc) . (4) selection of index-terms to determine which words/stems (or groups of words) will be used as an indexing elements . usually , the decision on whether a particular word will be used as an index term is related to the syntactic nature of the word . in fact , noun words frequently carry more semantics than adjectives , adverbs , and verbs . (5) construction of term-categorization structures such as a thesaurus , or extraction of structure directly represented in the text , for allowing the expansion of the original query with related terms (a usually useful procedure) . in the following , each of these phases is discussed in detail . but , before proceeding , let us take a look at the logical view of the documents which results after each of the above phases is completed . figure 1.2 is repeated here for convenience as figure 7.1 . as already discussed , by aggregating the preprocessing phases , we are able to move the logical view of the documents (adopted by the system) from that of a full text to that of a set of high level indexing terms .
