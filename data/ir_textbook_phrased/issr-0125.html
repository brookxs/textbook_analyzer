10.6 summary this chapter addresses content-based-access to multimedia . multimedia-retrieval encompasses a range of media types including text , speech and non-speech-audio , and video . this chapter illustrates multiple systems that provide contentbased retrieval of media , some of which have become commercial software . this chapter summarizes , where results have been reported , empirical-evaluation of these advances . impressive as these initial systems may be , they serve as pathfinders in new subfields of multimedia-retrieval research . many unanswered research-questions remain which offer fertile ground for research . for example , imagery retrieval is presently based on shallow image-feature analyses (e.g. , color , shape , texture) and so integration of these results with those from deeper semantic-analysis of text-documents remains a challenge . higher level intentional models of media (e.g. , what is the purpose of a clip of non-speech-audio or a graphic ?) require even more sophisticated analytic methods but promise even deeper representations of media and correspondingly more powerful retrieval . in addition , enhanced interfaces promise to enhance retrieval-performance and user-satisfaction . finally , techniques for rapidly creating multimedia-corpora so scientists can create machine learned systems as well as develop metrics , measures , and methods for effective 256 chapter 10 community evaluations will remain important for fostering continued progress in the field .
