7.2.5 thesauri the word thesaurus has greek and latin origins and is used as a reference to a treasury of words [261] . in its simplest form , this treasury consists of (1) a precompiled list of important-words in a given domain of knowledge and (2) for each word in this list , a set of related words . related words are , in its most common variation , derived from a synonymity relationship . in general , however , a thesaurus also involves some normalization of the vocabulary and includes a structure much more complex than a simple list of words and their synonyms . for instance , the popular thesaurus published by peter roget [679] also includes phrases which means that concepts more complex than single words are taken into account . roget 's thesaurus is of a general nature (i.e. , not specific to a certain domain of knowledge) and organizes words and phrases in categories and subcategories . an example of an entry in roget 's thesaurus is as follows : cowardly adjective ignobly lacking in courage : cowardly turncoats . syns : chicken (slang) , chicken-hearted , craven , dastardly , fainthearted , gutless , lily-livered , pusillanimous , unmanly , yellow (slang) , yellow-bellied (slang) . to the adjective cowardly , roget 's thesaurus associates several synonyms which compose a thesaurus class . while roget5s thesaurus is of a generic nature , a thesaurus can be specific to a certain domain of knowledge . for instance , the thesaurus of engineering and scientific terms covers concepts related to engineering and technical-terminology . according to foskett [261] , the main purposes of a thesaurus are basically : (a) to provide a standard vocabulary (or system of references) for indexing and searching ; (b) to assist users with locating terms for proper query-formulation ; and (c) to provide classified hierarchies that allow the broadening and narrowing of the current query request according to the needs of the user . in this section , however , we do not discuss how to use a thesaurus for modifying the user-query . this issue is covered on chapter 5 which also discusses algorithms for automatic-construction of thesauri . notice that the motivation for building a thesaurus is based on the fundamental idea of using a con trolled vocabulary for the indexing and searching . a controlled-vocabulary presents important advantages such as normalization document-preprocessing 171 of indexing concepts , reduction of noise , identification of indexing terms with a clear semantic-meaning , and retrieval based on concepts rather than on words . such advantages are particularly important in specific domains , such as the medical-domain for which there is already a large amount of knowledge compiled . for general domains , however , a well known body-of-knowledge which can be associated with the documents in the collection might not exist . the reasons might be that the document base is new , that it is too large , or that it changes very dynamically . this is exactly the case with the-web . thus , it is not clear how useful a thesaurus is in the context of the-web . despite that , the success of the search-engine named ` yahoo! ' (see chapter 13) , which presents the user with a term-classification hierarchy that can be used to reduce the space to be searched , suggests that thesaurus-based techniques might be quite useful even in the dynamic world of the-web . it is still too early to reach a consensus on the advantages of a thesaurus for the-web . as a result , many search-engines simply use all the words in all the documents as index-terms (i.e. , there is no notion of using the concepts of a controlled-vocabulary for indexing and searching purposes) . whether thesaurus-based techniques will flourish in the context of the-web remains to be seen . the main components of a thesaurus are its index-terms , the relationships among the terms , and a layout-design for these term-relationships . index-terms and term-relationships are covered below . the layout-design for term-relationships can be in the form of a list or in the form of a bi-dimensional display . here , we consider only the more conventional layout structure based on a list and thus , do not further discuss the issue of layout of the terms in a thesaurus . a brief coverage of topics related to this problem can be found in chapter 10 . a more detailed discussion can be found in [261] . theasurus index-terms the terms are the indexing components of the thesaurus . usually , a term in a thesaurus is used to denote a concept which is the basic-semantic-unit for conveying ideas . terms can be individual words , groups of words , or phrases , but most of them are single words . further , terms are basically nouns because nouns are the most concrete part-of-speech . terms can also be verbs in gerund form whenever they are used as nouns (for instance , acting , teaching , etc.) . whenever a concept can not be expressed by a single word , a group of words is used instead . for instance , many concepts are better expressed by a combination of an adjective with a noun . a typical example is ballistic missiles . in this case , indexing the compound term directly will yield an entry under balistic and no entry under missiles which is clearly inadequate . to avoid this problem , the compound term is usually modified to have the noun as the first word . for instance , we can change the compound term to missiles , ballistic . we notice the use of the plural form missiles instead of the singular form missile . the reasoning is that a thesaurus represents classes of things and thus it is natural to prefer the plural form . however , the singular form is used for 172 text operations compound terms which appear normally in the singular such as body temperature . deciding between singular and plural is not always a simple matter . besides the term itself , frequently it is necessary to complement a thesaurus entry with a definition or an explanation . the reason is the need to specify the precise meanings of a term in the context of a particular thesaurus . for instance , the term seal has a meaning in the context of marine animals and a rather distinct meaning in the context of documents . in these cases , the definition might be preceded by a context explanation such as seal (marine animals) and seal (documents) [735] . thesaurus term-relationships the set of terms related to a given thesaurus term is mostly composed of synonyms and near-synonyms . in addition to these , relationships can be induced by patterns of co-occurrence within documents . such relationships are usually of a hierarchical nature and most often indicate broader (represented by bt) or narrower (represented by nt) related terms . however , the relationship might also be of a lateral or non-hierarchical nature . in this case , we simply say that the terms are related (represented by rt) . as discussed in chapter 5 , bt and nt relationships define a classification-hierarchy where the broader term is associated with a class and its related narrower terms are associated with the instances of this class . further , it might be that a narrower term is associated with two or more broader terms (which is not the most common case though) . while bt and nt relationships can be identified in a fully automatic manner (i.e. , without assistance from a human subject) , dealing with rt relationships is much harder . one reason seems to be that rt relationships are dependent on the specific context and particular needs of the group of users and thus are difficult to identify without knowledge provided by specialists . on the use of thesauri in ir as described by peter roget [679 , 261] , a thesaurus is a classification-scheme composed of words and phrases whose organization aims at facilitating the expression of ideas in written text . thus , whenever a writer has a difficulty in finding the proper term to express an idea (a common occurrence in serious writing) , he can use the thesaurus to obtain a better grasp on the fundamental semantics of terms related to his idea . in the area of information-retrieval , researchers have for many years conjectured and studied the usefulness of a thesaurus for helping with the query-formation process . whenever a user wants to retrieve a set of documents , he first builds up a conceptualization of what he is looking for . such conceptualization is what we call his information-need . given the information-need , the user still lias to translate it into a query in the language of the ir-system . this usually document-clustering 173 means that a set of index-terms has to be selected . however , since the collection might be vast and the user inexperienced , the selection of such initial terms might be erroneous and improper (a very common situation with the largely unknown and highly dynamic collection of documents and pages which compose the-web) . in this case , reformulating the original query seems to be a promising course-of-action . such a reformulation process usually implies expanding the original query with related terms . thus , it seems natural to use a thesaurus for assisting the user with the search for related terms . unfortunately , this approach does not work well in general because the relationships captured in a thesaurus frequently are not valid in the local-context of a given user-query . one alternative is to determine thesaurus-like relationships at query time . unfortunately , such an alternative is not attractive for web-search-engines which can not afford to spend a lot of time with the processing of individual queries . this and many other interesting issues related to the use of thesaurus-based techniques in ir are covered in chapter 5 .
