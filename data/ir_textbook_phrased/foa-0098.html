mathematical foundations 165 53.3 connections between mds and lsi bartell et al. [bartell et al. , 1994a] have shown that any time the basis of mds is s , a positive semidefinite matrix of d observations of t variables (cf. equation 5.15) , the lsi decomposition together with inner-product similarities provides an optimal mds scaling . that is , under reasonable conditions mds and lsi arrive at identical results . this correspondence is more than a mathematical curiosity . mds allows generalization of the scaling to any other source of documentdocument similarity information ! there are many possible sources-of-information regarding ways to analyze the similarity of a number of documents ; bibliometric information is one practical alternative already mentioned . mds is potentially important because it allows us to go beyond the set of static features of the corpus , to consider the unending stream of relevance-feedback generated by browsing users . chapter 4 discussed users ' relevance-feedback assessments in detail . recall that one of the critical features of relevance-feedback information is that it is nonmetric . mds allows us to define optimal scalings directly from nonmetric relevance-feedback data .
