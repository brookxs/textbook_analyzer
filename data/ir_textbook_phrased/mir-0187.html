10.4 starting-points search-interfaces must provide users with good ways to get started . an empty screen or a blank entry form does not provide clues to help a user decide how to start the search-process . users usually do not begin by creating a long , detailed expression of their information-need . studies show that users tend to start out with very short queries , inspect the results , and then modify those queries in an incremental feedback cycle [22] . the initial query can be seen as a kind of ` testing the water ' to see what kinds of results are returned and get an idea of how to reformulate the query [804 , 65] . thus , one task of an information-access interface is to help users select the sources and collections to search on . for example , there are many different information-sources associated with cancer , and there are many different kinds of information a user might like to know about cancer . guiding the user to the right set of starting-points can help with the initial problem-formulation . traditional bibliographic-search assumes that the user begins by looking through a list of names of sources and choosing which collections to search on , while web-search-engines obliterate the distinctions between sources and plunge the user into the middle of a web-site with little information about the relationship of the search hit to the rest of the collection . in neither case is the interface to the available sources particularly helpful . in this section we will discuss four main types of starting-points : lists , overviews , examples , and automated source-selection .
