4.2 keyword-based querying a query is the formulation of a user-information need . in its simplest form , a query is composed of keywords and the documents containing such keywords are searched for . keyword-based-queries are popular because they are intuitive , easy to express , and allow for fast ranking . thus , a query can be (and in many cases is) simply a word , although it can in general be a more complex combination of operations involving several words . in the rest of this chapter we will refer to single-word and multiple-word queries as basic queries . patterns , which are covered in section 4.3 , are also considered as basic queries .
