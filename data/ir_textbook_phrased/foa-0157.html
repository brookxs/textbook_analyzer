7.53 when irrelevant attributes abound in documents where `` irrelevant attributes abound '' [littlestone , 1988] (e.g. , when any one document contains a small fraction of the full vocabulary but still more than are important in a classifier) , the rapid `` winnowing '' of features is critical . one approach is to use boosting methods , which begin with many very weak hypotheses but focus in on the most successful [schapire et al , 1998] . kivinen and warmuth 's exponentiated gradient eg algorithm extends from winnow 's binary-features and output to real-valued quantities [warmuth , 1997] . the result shares much with the widrow-hoff model (cf. section 7.3.1) , but rather than having weight changes making an additive change in the direction of the gradient , eg recommends making a multiplicative change to each element of the document vector . using r4 as in equation 7.6 : d' =d (7.18) adaptive-information-retrieval 275 figure 7.8 combining experts where a ! is the updated document-vector and | d/7 | is the length of the document vector after all weights have been updated . that is , weights are always renormalized so that their sum remains one (and nonnegative) . renormalization is an important feature of eg , which , in conjunction with the multiplicative increases in those `` relevant '' features that are shared with a query , results in quick (i.e. , exponentially fast) reduction to zero for irrelevant weights [lewis et al. , 1996] . callan has also found that rather than training the eg classifier with zero for incorrect classifications and unity for correct ones , using more moderate target values pegged to the minimum and maximum feature values is more successful [callan , 1998] . another very recent approach is to apply vapnik 's support-vector-machines (svm) [vapnik , 1995] . rather than searching for dichotomizing planes within a representational space that has been predefined (e.g. , the hyperplanes that gradient-descent methods adjust) , svms search in the `` dual '' space defined by the set of training instances for kernels (representations) wherein the classes can be conveniently separated ! as joachims [joachims , 1998] recently emphasized , the way in which these techniques avoid searching the vast space of potential keyword features seems to make svm a very appropriate technology for this application .
