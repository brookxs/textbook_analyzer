inverse-document-frequency collection frequency , instead , it is more commonplace to use for this purpose the document frequency , defined to be the number of documents in the collection that contain a term . this is because in trying to discriminate between documents for the purpose of scoring it is better to use a document-level statistic (such as the number of documents containing a term) than to use a collection-wide statistic for the term . figure 6.7 : collection frequency (cf) and document-frequency (df) behave differently , as in this example from the reuters collection . 6.7 how is the document frequency df of a term used to scale its weight ? denoting as usual the total number of documents in a collection by , we define the inverse-document-frequency of a term as follows : (21) thus the idf of a rare term is high , whereas the idf of a frequent term is likely to be low . figure 6.8 gives an example of idf 's in the reuters collection of 806,791 documents ; in this example logarithms are to the base 10 . in fact , as we will see in exercise 6.2.2 , the precise base of the logarithm is not material to ranking . we will give on page 11.3.3 a justification of the particular form in equation 21 .
