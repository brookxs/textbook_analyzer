12.4.2 feature-extraction and lower-bounding having decided on the euclidean-distance as the dissimilarity-measure , the next step is to find some features that can lower-bound it . we would like a set-of-features that first , preserve/lower-bound the distance , and second , carry much information about the corresponding time-series (so that the false-alarms are few) . the second requirement suggests that we use ` good ' features , that have much discriminatory power . in the stock price example , a ` bad ' feature would be , e.g. , the first day 's value : the reason being that two stocks might have similar first-day values , yet they may differ significantly from then on . conversely , two otherwise similar sequences may agree everywhere , except for the first day 's values . at the other extreme , we could use the values of all 365 days as features . however , although this would perfectly match the actual distance , it would lead to the ` dimensionality-curse ' problem . clearly , we need some better features . applying the second step of the gemini algorithm , we ask the feature-extracting question : ` if we are allowed to use only one feature from each sequence , what would this feature be ? ' a natural answer is the average . by the same token , additional features could be the average of the first half , of the second half , of the first quarter , etc. . or , in a more systematic way , we could use the coefficients of the fourier-transform , and , for our case , the discrete-fourier-transform (dft) . for a signal x = [xl] , i = 0 , ... , n - ~ 1 , let xp denote the n-point dft coefficient at the f-th frequency) the third step of the gemini methodology is to show that the distance in feature-space lower-bounds the actual distance . the solution is provided by parsevafs theorem , which states that the dft preserves the energy of a signal , as well as the distances between two signals :) (12.4) 354 multimedia-ir : indexing and searching where x and y are fourier transforms of x and y respectively . thus , if we keep the first / (/ lt ; n) coefficients of the dft as the features , we lower-bound the actual distance : # \ xf - yf \ 2 f = 0 f = 0 n-1 i = 0 and finally vfeature ^) , ? ($)) lt ; vv) (12-5) because we ignore positive terms from equation 12.2 . thus , there will be no false dismissals , according to lemma 12.1 . notice that the gemini approach can be applied with any orthonormal transform , such as , the discrete-cosine-transform (dct) , the wavelet-transform etc. , because they all preserve the distance between the original and the transformed space . in fact , our response-time will improve with the ability of the transform to concentrate the energy : the fewer the coefficients that contain most of the energy , the more accurate our estimate for the actual distance , the fewer the false-alarms , and the faster our response-time . thus , the performance-results presented next are just pessimistic bounds ; better transforms will achieve even better response-times . in addition to being readily available , (e.g. , in ` mathematical bs , ' ` maple ,1 inatlab ' etc.) , the dft concentrates the energy in the first few coefficients , for a large class of signals , the colored noises . these signals have a skewed energy spectrum (o (f ~ ~ b) , as follows : ï for 6 = 2 , we have the so-called random-walks or brown noise , which model successfully stock movements and exchange rates (e.g. , [541]) . ï with even more skewed spectrum (b gt ; 2) , we have the black noises [712] . such signals model successfully , for example , the water level of rivers and the rainfall patterns as they vary over time [541] . ï with 6 = 1 , we have the pink noise . birkhoffs theory [712] claims that interesting ' signals , such as musical scores and other works of art , consist of pink noise , whose energy spectrum follows oif `` 1) . the argument of the theory is that white-noise with o (f ∞) energy spectrum is completely unpredictable , while brown noise with o (f ~ 2) energy spectrum is too predictable and therefore `` boring . '' the energy spectrum of pink noise lies in between . one-dimensional time-series 355 (a) time plot (lin-lin) (b) amplitude spectrum (log-log) figure 12.4 (a) the swiss-franc exchange-rate (7 august 1990 to 18 april 1991 - first 3000 values out of 30,000) and (b) log-log amplitude of its fourier-transform , along with the 1/f line . as an illustration of the above observations , figure 12.4 (a) plots the movement of the exchange-rate between the swiss franc and the us dollar starting 7 august 1990 (3000 measurements) ; figure 12.4 (b) shows the amplitude of the fourier-coefficients as a function of the frequency f , as well as the 1/f line , in a logarithmic-logarithmic plot . notice that , since it is successfully modeled as a random-walk , the amplitude of the fourier-coefficients follow the 1/f line . the above data-set is available through anonymous-ftp from sfi.santafe.edu . in addition to id signals (stock price movements and exchange rates) , it is believed that several families of real n-d signals belong to the-family of ` colored noises ' , with skewed spectrum . for example , 2d signals , like photographs , are far from white-noise , exhibiting a few strong coefficients in the lower spatial frequencies . the jpeg-image-compression standard exploits this phenomenon , effectively ignoring the high-frequency components of the discrete-cosine-transform , which is closely related to the fourier-transform . if the image consisted of white-noise , no compression would be possible at all .
