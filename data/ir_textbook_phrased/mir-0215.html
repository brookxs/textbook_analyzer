10.8.4 examples of poor use of overlapping-windows sometimes conversion from a command-line-based interface to a graphical display can cause problems . hancock-beaulieu et al [337] describe poor design-decisions made in an overlapping-windows display for a bibliographic system . (an improvement was found with a later redesign of the system that used a monolithic interface [336] .) problems can also occur when designers make a literal ' transformation from a tty interface to a graphical-interface . the consequences can be seen in the current lexis-nexis interface , which does not make use of the fact that window-systems allow the user to view different kinds of information simultaneously . instead , despite the fact that it occupies the entire screen , the interface does not retain window context when the user switches from one function to another . for example , viewing a small amount of metadata about a list of retrieved titles causes the list of results to disappear , rather than overlaying the information with a pop-up window or rearranging the available space with resizable tiles . furthermore , this metadata is rendered in poorly-format ted ascii instead of using the bit-map capabilities of a graphical-interface . when a user opts to see the full text view of a document , it is shown in a small-space , a few paragraphs at a time , instead of expanding to fill the entire available space .
