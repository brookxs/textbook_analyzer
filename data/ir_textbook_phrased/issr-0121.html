244 chapter 10 10.2 non-speech-audio retrieval in addition to content-based-access to speech audio , noise/sound retrieval is also important in such fields as music and movie/video production . thorn blum et al (1997) describe a user-extensible sound-classification and retrieval-system , called soundfisher (www.musclefish.com) , that draws from several disciplines , including signal-processing , psychoacoustics , speech-recognition , computer-music , and multimedia-databases . just as image-indexing algorithms use visual-feature vectors to index and match images , blum et al. use a vector of directly measurable acoustic features (e.g. , duration , loudness , pitch , brightness) to index sounds . this enables users to search for sounds within specified feature ranges . for example , figure 10.2 a illustrates the analysis of male laughter on several dimensions including amplitude , brightness , bandwidth , and pitch . figure 10.2 b shows an enduser content-based-retrieval application that enables a user to browse and/or query a sound database by acoustic (e.g. , pitch , duration) and/or perceptual-properties (e.g. , `` scratchy '') and/or query-by-example . for example , soundfisher supports such complex content queries as `` find all aiff encoded files with animal or human vocal sounds that are similar to barking sounds without regard to duration or amplitude . '' the user can also perform a weighted query-by-value (e.g. , foreground and transition with gt ; .8 metallic and gt ; .7 plucked aural properties and 2000 hz lt ; average pitch lt ; 300 hz and duration ...) . the system can also be trained by example , so that perceptual-properties (e.g. , `` scratchiness '' or `` buzziness '') that are more indirectly related to acoustic features can be specified and retrieved . ï l. \ \ ¶ \ . - ' .
