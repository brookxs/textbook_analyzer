3.2.6 summary i have provided this historical background because these eminent scientists ' stories remain compelling . the plausibility of the proposed theories , coupled with our retrospective knowledge of their incorrectness , also provides a sobering background as we attempt to infer semantic-properties from the statistics arising in foa . as we shall discuss in chapter 5 (cf. section 5.1) , the real basis of zipps law can be traced to much simpler mechanisms , relating only to patterns of characters rather than any underlying semantics or purposes . benoit mandelbrot , george miller , and noam chomsky have shown that the underlying phenomena relating a word 's frequency to its rank-order is obeyed as much by random text generated by monkeys at typewriters , for example - as by samples of text (the bible , james joyce 's ulysses , etc.) we seem to find more literate . the fact that the simple , four-character sequence zipf should bring together such a rich combination of mathematical and semantic issues is ironic , to say the least . there is obviously a great deal we can predict about our language by assuming nothing more than we would about monkeys at keyboards . at the same time , the fact that we can change the meaning of a simple sequence of characters , for example , the title of this section remember zipf , dramatically by adding a single additional character to form either remember zipf ! or remember zipf ? should make it clear how much more there still is to say .
