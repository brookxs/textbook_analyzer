15.4.4 distributed-collections though our view of digital librarys encompasses even those that are small , self-contained , and constrained to a personal collection with a suitable system and services , most digital librarys are spread across computers , that is spanning physical and/or logical spaces . dealing with collections of information that are distributed in nature is one of the common requirements for digital-library technology . yet , proper handling of such collections is a challenging problem , possibly since many computer scientists are poorly equipped to think about situations involving spaces as well as the other aspects of 5s . of particular concern is working with a number of digital librarys , each separately constructed , so the information-systems are truly heterogeneous . integration requires support for at least some popular scenarios (often a simple search that document-models , representations , and access 423 external servers figure 15.2 architecture of the biokleisli system (adapted from [829 , 128]) . is a type of least common denominator) by systems that expect differing types of communication streams (e.g. , respond to different protocols and query-languages) , have varying types of streams and structures , and combine these two differently in terms of representations of data-and-metadata . to tackle this problem , one approach has been to develop a description-language for each digital-library and to build federated-search systems that can interpret that description-language [161] . however , when digital-library content is highly complex (e.g. , when there are ` unstructured ' collections , meaning that the structure is complex and not well described) , there is need for richer description languages and more powerful systems to interpret and support highly expressive queries/operations [828 , 209 , 128] . an architecture of this type is illustrated in figure 15.2 for the biokleisli system [829] . in addition to these two approaches - namely reducing functionality for end-users in order to give digital-library developers more freedom and increasing functionality by making the federated system smarter and able to use more computational-resources on both servers and clients - there is the third approach of making each digital-library support a powerful protocol aimed at effective retrieval . this third course is supported by the computer interchange of museum information (cimi) effort [570] , wherein a z39 .50 interface exists on a number of museum information servers and clients [570] . while z39 .50 was aimed at the needs of libraries desiring interoperability among library catalogs , it does support many of the needs for digital librarys . thus , the cimi interoperability demonstration , with its support for multimedia-content , is of great import , but does leave open further improvement 424 digital-libraries in supporting richer digital-library interaction-scenarios , involving more powerful federated searchers .
