5.2 dimensionality-reduction as section 3.5 has already suggested , our interest in matching queries and documents within a vector-space can benefit greatly from other kinds of matching that have arisen in other kinds of vector-spaces [schutze , 1993] . we review several other basic features of the mathematical topic of linear-algebra before applying them to the problem of foa . it is worth remembering that similarity information can come from many sources . for example , we will later (cf. section 6.1) have much to say about how citation structure can be represented as a graph , with each document represented by a node in the graph and a directed edge going from d \ to dj , when dj appears in the bibliography of d \ . note that the documents ' citation-information is entirely independent of the words they contain and can be the basis for another characterization of the topical-similarity between documents : two documents are about the same topic to the extent that they share the same documents in their bibliographies . for now , such bibliometric data need only seem like a plausible , new way to analyze document-content . chapter 6 will discuss other features that we might also exploit . our goal in casting similarity-matching of queries with documents in general mathematical terms is to make the resulting solutions sufficiently broad to handle any kind of features , keywords , or bibliographic-citations .
