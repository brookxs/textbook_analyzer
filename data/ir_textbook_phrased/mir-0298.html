15.4.5 federated-search federated-search work has often been prompted by challenging application-requirements . for example , to allow computer-science technical reports from around the world to become accessible with minimal investment and maximal local control , the nsf-funded wide-area technical report service (waters) initiative was launched [279] . this was then integrated with an effort begun earlier with darpa funding , the computer-science technical report (cstr) project [260] , leading to a hybrid effort , the networked cs technical reference (previously , report) library (ncstrl) [471] . at the heart of nc-strl is a simple search-system , a well-thought-out open federated digital library protocol and the dienst reference implementation , developed at cornell university [210] . while this system was custom-built with little dependence on other software , its type of operation could be constructed more rapidly atop various supports like corba [788] . federated-search has had an interesting history , with workers adopting a variety of approaches . first , there are those interested in collecting the required information , often through web-crawling of various sorts [715] . second , there are those focusing on intelligent-search [27] . one example is work emphasizing picking the best sites to search [126] . these efforts often assume some integrated information organization across the distributed internet information-space [393] . third , there is work on fusion of results . this can be viewed in the abstract , regardless of whether the various collections are nearby or distributed , with the target of improving retrieval by culling from a number of good sources [76] . one approach adopts a probabilistic-inference network-model [139] . another views the problem as database merging [791] . alternatively , one can assume that there are a number of search-engines distributed to cover the collection , that must be used intelligently [292] . fourth , there are commercial solutions , including through special web-services [223] . probably the most visible is the patented , powerful yet elegant , approach by infoseek corporation [394] . finally , there is a new line of work to develop comprehensive and realistic architectures for federated-search [219 , 218] . the long-term challenge is to segment the collection and/or its indexes so that most searches only look at a small number of the most useful sources-of-information , yet recall is kept high . ultimately , however , there are rich types of use of digital-library content , once one of these approaches to search is carried out .
