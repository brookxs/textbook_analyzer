14.5 trends arid research-issues with a few exceptions , librarians are consumers of information-systems , whether information-retrieval-systems provided by database vendors , or turnkey opacs . even in the digital-library environment , their emphasis is on providing integrated access to a diversity of modules for information-retrieval . their interest therefore is in obtaining and using systems which offer ease of integration in their automated environment , and ease-of-use for themselves and their patrons . the former goal is approached through standards such as sgml and z39 .50 , and the development and application of these standards is an important trend in the design of ir systems for libraries . for the latter goal , ease-of-use . the trend toward user-centered research and design is significant because it offers the potential to answer bergman 's query , ` why are online catalogs still hard to use ? ' [105] . much of the recent research interest is in cognitive and behavioral bibliographic discussion 413 issues (as reviewed in [482]) . developing an understanding of information-need , either in general or for a specific client group , has been an important component of this work . researchers are also interested in the searching-behavior of users . obviously , there is no single ` user ' group , and studies have focused on groups such as trained intermediaries , children , and subject specialists , in both the search-service and opac environment . one such project conducted over two years is the getty online-search project which studied the end-user search-behavior of humanities scholars [67] . the interest in end-user behavior also extends to an examination of relevance , since an understanding of the criteria by which users determine if retrieved information meets their information-need is critical to achieving user-centered-design .
