5.6 bibliographic discussion query-expansion methods have been studied for a long time . while the success of expansion methods throughout the years has been debatable , more recently researchers have reached the consensus that query-expansion is a useful and little explored (commercially) technique . useful because its modern variants can be used to consistently improve the retrieval-performance with general collections . little explored because few commercial systems (and web-search-engines) take advantage of it . early work suggesting the expansion of a user-query with closely related terms was done by maron and kuhns in 1960 [547] . the classic technique for combining query-expansion with term reweighting in the vector-model was studied by rocchio in 1965 (using the smart system [695] as a testbed) and published later on [678] , ide continued the studies of rocchio and proposed variations to the term reweighting formula [391] . the probabilistic-model was introduced by robertson and sparck jones [677] in 1976 . a thorough and entertaining discussion of this model can be found in the book by van rijsbergen [785] . croft and harper [199] suggested that the initial search should use a distinct-computation . in 1983 , croft [198] proposed to extend the probabilistic formula to include within-document frequencies and introduced the c and k parameters . since the probabilistic-model does not provide means of expanding the query , query-expansion has to be done separately . in 1978 , harper and van rijsbergen [345] used a term-term clustering-technique based on a maximum-spanning-tree to select terms for probabilistic query-expansion . two years later , they also introduced a new relevance-weighting scheme , called emim [344] , to be used with their query-expansion technique . in 1981 , wu and salton [835] used relevance-feedback to reweight terms (using a probabilistic formula) extracted from relevant documents and used these terms to expand the query . empirical-results showed improvements in retrieval-performance . our discussion on user-relevance-feedback for the vector and probabilistic-models in section 5.2 is based on four sources : a nice paper by salton and buckley [696] , the book by van rijsbergen [785] , the book by salton and mcgill [698] , and two book chapters by harman [340 , 339] . regarding automatic-query-expansion , lesk [500] tried variations of term-term clustering in the smart system without positive results . following that , sparck jones and barber [413] and minker , wilson and zimmerman [562] also observed no improvements with query-expansion based on term-term global clustering . these early research results left the impression that query-expansion based on global-analysis is not an effective technique . however , more recent results show that this is not the case . in fact , the research results obtained by vorhees [793] , by crouch and yang [200] , and by qiu and prei [655] indicate that query-expansion based on global-analysis can consistently yield improved retrieval-performance . our discussion on query-expansion through local-clustering is based on early work by attar and fraenkel [35] from 1977 . the idea of local-context bibliographic discussion 139 analysis is much more recent and was introduced by xu and croft [838] in 1996 . the discussion on query-expansion using a global similarity-thesaurus is based on the work by qiu and prei [655] . finally , the discussion on query-expansion using a global statistical thesaurus is based on the work of crouch and yang [200] which is influenced by the term discrimination value theory introduced by salton , yang , and yu [699] early in 1975 . since query-expansion frequently is based on some form of clustering , our discussion covered a few clustering-algorithms . however , our aim was not to provide a thorough review of clustering-algorithms for information-retrieval . such a review can be found in the work of rasmussen [668] .
