7.3.2 user drift and event-tracking one interesting feature of the training-set generated by the routing task is the odd distribution of positive-and-negative-examples it generates . initially , we can imagine that this filter is very inaccurate ; i.e. , we are likely to see many negative-examples . later , when we hope it is better trained , the filter has nearly perfect performance and the system gets very few negative-examples . further , no user 's interests remain static . as discussed in the next chapter , one common purpose for the foa activity is to become educated (cf. section 8.3.4) , and this is an elusive , ever-changing goal . the world changes , and what users read changes their opinions of what needs to be done and what the new questions are . in brief , documents they used to find relevant become irrelevant . this has been called concept-drift [klinkenberg and renz , 1998] . when the world changes , this corresponds to documents , and the news they contain changes too . this side of the dynamic is called topic-tracking [allan et al , 1998 ; baker et al , 1999] . jaime carbonell 's (of cmu) approach is to first identify that a concept-change has occurred and then to adjust a time-window on the stream of incoming training-data over which a new invariant is then identified (personal-communication) . the distribution of relevance-feedback generated by the filtering task , where a standing-query is allowed to adapt to a stream of relevance-feedback generated by users who receive and evaluate routed documents (cf. section 4.3.9) , provides an especially interesting form of learning-task , because of its temporal-dimension . initially , the set of documents routed to users must depend on the same fundamental matching-function shared by other search-engine tasks . but as relevance-feedback , in response to the first retrievals , comes to affect the users ' characterizations of interest , only a skewed sample (relative to the initial distribution) of potential documents is shown to the users , and only these can be the basis of subsequent relevance-feedback adaptive-information-retrieval 267 this tension between exploration of the universe of potentially relevant documents and exploitation of those documents that prior relevance-feedback makes it seem are most likely to be perceived as relevant by the users is familiar to other reinforcement-learning situations [sutton and barto , 1998] .
