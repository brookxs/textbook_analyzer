4.4.2 hypertext hypertexts probably represent the maximum freedom with respect to structuring power . a hypertext is a directed-graph where the nodes hold some text and the links represent connections between nodes or between positions inside the nodes (see chapter 2) . hypertexts have received a lot of attention since the explosion of the-web , which is indeed a gigantic hypertext-like database spread across the world . however , retrieval from a hypertext began as a merely navigational activity . that is . the user had to manually traverse the hypertext nodes following links to search what he wanted . it was not possible to query the hypertext based on its structure . even in the web one can search by the text contents of the nodes , but not by their structural connectivity . structural queries 109 an interesting proposal to combine browsing and searching on the web is webglimpse . it allows classical navigation plus the ability to search by content in the neighborhood of the current node . currently , some query-tools have appeared that achieve the goal of querying hypertexts based on their content and their structure . this problem is covered in detail in chapter 13 .
