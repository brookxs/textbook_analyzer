11.4 trends and research-issues in this chapter we have discussed the main issues in developing a multimedia-ir system . we have observed that only the integration of dbms and ir technologies provides the ability to represent , store , and manipulate multimedia-data and , at the same time , to retrieve those data by applying content-based searches . 342 multimedia-ir : models and languages we then discussed the main issues arising in defining a data-model for multimedia-data . since multimedia-data has , in general , a complex structure , the data-model must be able to reflect and manage this complexity . object-oriented or object-relational data models represent the right technology for multimedia-data representation . additional relevant requirements include the support of semi-structured-data and metadata . another important requirement is the ability to internally represent the content of multimedia-data in a way that ensures fast retrieval of the stored data and efficient processing of content-based-queries . to achieve this goal , semantic-features can be extracted from the data , stored inside the system , and used during query-processing . the second topic discussed in this chapter is related to multimedia-query languages . we observed that a multimedia-query-language is characterized by the type of interface presented to the user and the types of predicates it allows in a query . such predicates are used to perform content-based searches and to let the user drive the selection of relevant objects . examples of commercial and prototype systems have been discussed , with respect to the data-modeling and query-language capabilities . several aspects require further investigation . for example , even though sql3 supports multimedia-data representation , it can not be taken as the basis for the definition of a multimedia-ir system . additional research is needed to integrate sql3 with specific language constructs and underlying techniques to perform information-retrieval and query-optimization . another topic is related to xml (see chapter 6) , the new standard format for data on the web [304] . xml is a text-based format , providing a standard data-model to encode the content , the semantics , and the schema of ordinary documents , structured records , and metacontent information about a web-site . the extension of such a standard to support multimedia-data and content-based-queries is an important research direction . a further direction concerns the techniques for ranking the objects returned by a partial-match query . such ranking usually only takes into account the degree of similarity of the objects retrieved with the query request . however , other factors can be considered , such as the profile of the user submitting the query , or the history of the previous queries specified by the user . taking into account these aspects is very important , since it gives rise to a customized ranking which is closer to the user-needs .
