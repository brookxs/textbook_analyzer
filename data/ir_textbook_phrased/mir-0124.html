7.3 document-clustering document-clustering is the operation of grouping together similar (or related) documents in classes . in this regard , document-clustering is not really an operation on the text but an operation on the collection of documents . the operation of clustering documents is usually of two types : global and local . in a global clustering strategy , the documents are grouped accordingly to their occurrence in the wrhole collection . in a local-clustering strategy , the grouping of documents is affected by the context defined by the current query and its local set of retrieved documents . clustering-methods are usually used in ir to transform the original query in an attempt to better represent the user-information need . from this perspective , clustering is an operation which is more related to the transformation of the user-query than to the transformation of the text of the documents . in this book , document-clustering techniques are treated as query-operations and thus , are covered in chapter 5 (instead of here) .
