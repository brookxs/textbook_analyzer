58 chapter 3 3.2.2 precoordination and linkages another decision on the indexing process is whether linkages are available between index-terms for an item . linkages are used to correlate related attributes associated with concepts discussed in an item . this process of creating term linkages at index creation time is called precoordination . when index-terms are not coordinated at index time , the coordination occurs at search-time . this is called postcoordination , that is coordinating terms after (post) the indexing process . postcoordination is implemented by `` and `` ing index-terms together , which only finds indexes that have ail of the search-terms . factors that must be determined in the linkage process are the number of terms that can be related , any ordering constraints on the linked terms , and any additional descriptors are associated with the index-terms (vickery-70) . the range of the number of index-terms that can be linked is not a significant implementation issue and primarily affects the design of the indexer 's user-interface . when multiple terms are being used , the possibility exists to have relationships between the terms . for example , the capability to link the source of a problem , the problem and who is affected by the problem may be desired . each term must be caveated with one of these three categories along with linking the terms together into an instance of the relationships describing one semantic-concept . the order of the terms is one technique for providing additional role descriptor information on the index-terms . use of the order of the index-terms to implicitly define additional term descriptor information limits the number of index-terms that can have a role descriptor . if order is not used , modifiers may be associated with each term linked to define its role . this technique allows any number of terms to have the associated role descriptor . figure 3.2 shows the different types of linkages . it assumes that an item discusses the drilling of oil wells in mexico by citgo and the introduction of oil refineries in peru by the u.s. . when the linked capability is added , the system does not erroneously relate peru and mexico since they are not in the same set of linked items . it still does not have the ability to discriminate between which country is introducing oil refineries into the other country . introducing roles in the last two examples of figure 3.2 removes this ambiguity . positional roles treat the data as a vector allowing only one value per position . thus if the example is expanded so that the u.s. was introducing oil refineries in peru , bolivia and argentina , then the positional role technique would require three entries , where the only difference would be in the value in the `` affected country '' position . when modifiers are used , only one entry would be required and all three countries would be listed with three `` modifiers .
