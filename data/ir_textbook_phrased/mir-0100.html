6.3 text with the advent of the computer , it was necessary to code text in binary digits . the first coding-schemes were ebcdic and ascii , which used seven bits to code each possible symbol . later , ascii was standardized to eight bits (iso-latin) , to accommodate several languages , including accents and other diacritical marks . nevertheless , ascii is not suitable for oriental languages such as chinese or japanese kanji , where each symbol might represent a concept and therefore thousands of them exist . for this case , a 16-bit code exists called unicode (iso 10616) [783] . in this section we cover different characteristics of text . first , the possible formats of text , ascii being the simplest format . second , how the information-content of text can be measured , followed by different models for it . finally , we mention briefly how we can measure similarity between strings or pieces of text .
