2.11 trends and research-issues there are three main types of products and systems which can benefit directly from research in models for information-retrieval : library systems , specialized retrieval-systems , and the-web . regarding library systems , there is currently much interest in cognitive and behavioral issues oriented particularly at a better understanding of which criteria the users adopt to judge relevance . prom the point-of-view of the computer scientist , a main question is how this knowledge about the user affects the ranking strategies and the user-interface implemented by the system . a related issue is the investigation of how models other than the boolean-model (which is still largely adopted by most large commercial library systems) affect the user of a library . a specialized retrieval-system is one which is developed with a particular application in mind . for instance , the lexis-nexis retrieval-system (see chapter 14) , which provides access to a very-large collection of legal and business-documents , is a good example of a specialized retrieval-system . in such a system , a key problem is how to retrieve (almost) all documents which might be relevant to the user-information need without also retrieving a large number of unrelated documents . in this context , sophisticated ranking-algorithms are highly desirable . since ranking based on single evidential sources is unlikely to provide the appropriate answers , research on approaches for combining several evidential sources seems highly relevant (as demonstrated at the various trec conferences , see chapter 3 for details) . in the web , the scenario is quite distinct and unique . in fact , the user of the-web frequently does not know what he wants or has great difficulty in properly formulating his request . thus , research in advanced-user-interfaces is highly desirable . from the point-of-view of the ranking engine , an interesting problem is to study how the paradigm adopted for the user-interface affects the ranking . furthermore , it is now well established that the indexes maintained by the various web-search-engines are almost disjoint (e.g. , the ten most popular search-engines have indexes whose intersection corresponds to less than 2 % of the total number of pages indexed) . in this scenario , research on meta-search-engines (i.e. , engines which work by fusing the rankings generated by other search-engines) seems highly promising .
