7.1.1 training against manual indices we will be especially concerned with corpora that have benefited from extensive manual-indexing . for example , the articles in the encyclopcedia britannica have benefited from man-centuries of effort that have been applied to organize these textual passages into coherent indices , thesauri , and taxonomies . this manual attention provides two advantages in the context of machine-learning . first , the manual-classification of documents to categories can be used as training-data in the context of supervised-learning (see 1 www . lit . nrc . ca/bibliogpaphies / ml-applied-toir . html 2 www.iit.nrc.ca/llpiiblic/classiflcatioii/resouroes.html adaptive-information-retrieval 255 section 7.4) . second , manually constructed representations provide a kind of upper-bound on what we can hope our automatic-learning techniques can build . ultimately , however , we can expect that the most successful applications will not oppose manual , editorial enhancement with automatic-induction but rather will integrate learning into the editorial process . machine-learning can already do much of the job that has traditionally been done by human editors ; and yet , many aspects of the editorial function will remain beyond our learning-techniques for the foreseeable future . harnessing machine-learning as part of an editor 's workbench promises to leverage this scarce resource most effectively . of course , corpora that have benefited from such careful manual attention are few and far between . much more typical is the textual corpus without any manual-indexing whatsoever . the third advantage , then , of those special corpora that do have attending editorial enhancements is that if our learning-techniques can generate analogous structures on these special-collections , we can realistically expect the same techniques to generate useful structure on other collections as well .
