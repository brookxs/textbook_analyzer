63 keyword structures most of what we have said about the index relation (e.g. , as part of the vector-space-model) assumes that keywords are simply a set-of-features . but beyond simply providing access to the retrieval of documents , the fact that keywords are meaning-fill objects in their own right means that we can analyze relationships among keywords directly . thesauri are structured-representations of relations among keywords . common relations represented in thesauri include : ï broader term/narrower term (bt/nt) ; these capture hierarchic relations , generally between a kind of semantics * sometimes a partwhole relation . ï related term (rt) , capturing synonym or quasi-synonym relationships . ï use for (uf) , capturing a preferred , conventional , or authoritative term over possible alternatives . inference beyond the index 211 one of the most extensive examples of such a representation is the mesh (medical subject-headings) thesaurus , part of the national-library-of-medicine 's extensive pubmed system . figure 6.14 shows the term lymphoma within the mesh thesaurus . * example hierarchic bt/nt relations are shown as indentation . because this thesaurus allows a single keyword to fit in multiple places in the hierarchy (e.g. , treating lymphoma as a kind of neoplasm as well as a kind of immhn `` ologic disease) , this browser shows the term as part of three separate paths ; note that the children (narrower terms) of lymphoma are repeated in each location .
