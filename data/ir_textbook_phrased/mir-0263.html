13.5.3 helpful tools there are many software-tools to help browsing and searching . some of them are add-ons to browsers , such as alexa [10] . alexa is a free web-navigation service that can be attached as a toolbar at the bottom of any browser and accompanies the user in his surfing . it provides useful information about the sites that are visited , including their popularity , speed of access , freshness , and overall quality (obtained from votes of alexa users) . alexa also suggests related sites helping one 's navigation . another navigation service and searching guide is webtaxi [805] . there are other tools that use visual-metaphors , which can be broadly classified into two types : tools designed to visualize a subset of the-web and tools designed to visualize large answers . both cases need to represent a large-graph in a meaningful way . specific commercial examples of tools to visualize web subsets are microsoft 's siteanalyst (formerly from netcarta) , 3mapa from dynamic diagrams , ibm 's mapuccino (formerly webcutter [527] , shown in figure 10.22) , surfserf , merzscope from merzcom , clearweb , astra sitemanager , weban-alyzer from incontext , historytree from smartbrowser , etc. . non-commercial works include webmap [220] , sitemap , ptolomeaus , and many earlier research [234 , 578 , 564 , 20] . we have not included more generic visualization software , where web-visualization is just a particular case , or other related visualization-tools such as web-usage-analysis [642 , 294 , 737] . metaphors to visualize large answers are covered in chapter 10 . visual-tools are not yet deployed in the whole web because there is no standard way of communicating visualizers and search-engines . one possible approach is to use a markup-language based on xml (see chapter 6) , as proposed in [15] .
