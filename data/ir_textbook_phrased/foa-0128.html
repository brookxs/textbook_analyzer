inference beyond the index 221 6.4.1 ai genealogy the ai genealogy project (aig) is an attempt to collect information relating authors in artificial-intelligence to one another through shared advisors . in analogy to genealogical family trees , we can treat the advisor as a parent to the advisee . students of students become grandchildren , and so on . a subset of this data is shown in figure 6.17 . as an example of how this additional-information about authors can be exploited to understand more about the words used in documents , steier has analyzed word-pair cooccurrence data as a means of finding potential index phrases [steier and belew , 1994b] . take , for example , the phrase case-based-reasoning . this phrase has a high degree of phrasal information-content (using mutual-information statistics to identify statistically dependent word-pairs) when these statistics are collected across the entire ait document-corpus . but a statistically significant different distribution is observed within dissertations coming from a particular set of universities : yale , georgia tech , and the university of massachusetts . within these particular university contexts , the constituent concepts of case-based and reasoning are examined in detail and independently . not only do these words occur together as case-based-reasoning , but they often occur separately (e.g. , case-based planning , case-based argument , case-based problem , schema-based reasoning , analogical-reasoning , commonsense-reasoning) . within the limited context of these subcorpora , the keywords occur more independently and hence are considered less phraselike . as this phrase is `` exported '' into the general ai vocabulary , the semantic nuances are left behind , and the dominant use of the constituent words is as part of the phrase . what is it that makes language-use so different at yale , georgia tech , and the university of massachusetts ? perhaps it is merely coincidence , but our hypothesis is that it is the common lineage traced to roger schank ! work across these geographically distant research institutions is pulled together by an intellectual tradition captured by the aig data . part of what is interesting about the ait corpus is its demonstration within a single corpus of many of the representations discussed in this chapter . the ai genealogy captures some of the intellectual linkage due 222 finding out about mcculloch , w. s. ó minsky , marvin ó winston , patrick h. 1973 waltz , david l. 1980 finin , timothy w. 1988 kass , robert john 1989 klein , david a. 1987 pollack , jordan b. 1993 angeline , peter 1994 eolen , john mey , jacob 1969 schank , roger c. ó - kolodner , janet l. 1989 shinn , hong shik 1989 turner , roy marvin 1991 hinrichs , thomas ryland 1992 redmond , michael albert ó dejong , gerald francis 1987 segre , alberto maria 1988 shavlik , jude william 1991 towell , geoffrey gilmer 1988 mooney , raymond joseph 1992 ng , hwee tou 1989 rajamoney , shankar anand ó lehnert , wendy g. 1983 dyer , michael g. 1987 mueller , eric 1987 zernik , uri 1988 pazzani , michael john 1988 gasser , michael 1989 dolan , charles patrick 1989 alvarado , sergio jose 1989 dolan , charles 1991 lee , geunbae 1991 reeves , john fairbanks 1991 nenov , valeriy iliev 1991 quilici , alexander eric 1993 turner , scott r. 1990 williams , robert stuart 1976 meehan , james r. 1978 wilensky , robert 1985 jacobs , paul 1986 norvlg , peter 1986 arens , yigal 1987 cain , david ngi 1992 wu , dekai 1978 carbonee , jaime g. 1988 minton , steven 1989 lehman , jiu fain 1991 perlin , mark w. 1991 hauptmann , alexander georg 1992 veloso , manuela m. 1980 lebowitz , michael 1987 hovy , eduard hendrik 1988 hunter , lawrence e. 1989 ram , ashwin 1989 dehn , natalie jane 1990 leake , david browder 1992 domeshek , eric andrew 1993 edelson , daniel choy the semantic interpretation ... acquiring a model of the ... see co-adv shortliffe , ted on connectionst models of ... evolutionary-algorithms and . . computation in recurrent ... a conceptual-dependency ... a unified approach to ... a schema-based model of ... problem-solving in open ... learning by observing and ... explanation-based-learning ... generalizing the structure ... symbolic knowledge and ... a general explanation-based ... a general abductive system ... explanation-based theory ... in-depth-understanding : a. . . daydreaming and computation : . strategies in language ... learning causal ... see co-adv hatch , evelyn tensor manipulation ... understanding editorial ... the use and acquisition of ... distributed semantic ... computational morality : a. . . perceptually grounded ... the correction machine : a. . . minstrel : a computer model ... learning plan schemas from ... the metanovel : writing ... understanding goal-based ... a knowledge-based-approach ... a unified theory of ... cluster : an apporach to ... intelligent-agents as a. . . automatic-inference : a. . . subjective understanding : ... learning effective search ... adaptive parsing : ... automating the construction ... meaning from structure in ... learning by analogical ... generalization and memory in ... generating natural-lanugage ... gaining expertise through ... question-driven ... computer story-writing : the ... evaluating explanations do the right thing : a. . . learning from stories : ... figure 6.17 a sample of the ai genealogical record
