logical or physical organisation and data-independence there is one important distinction that must be made at the outset when discussing file-structures . and that is the difference between the logical and physical organisation of the data . on the whole a file-structure will specify the logical-structure of the data , that is the relationships that will exist between data items independently of the way in which these relationships may actually be realised within any computer . it is this logical aspect that we will concentrate on . the physical organisation is much more concerned with optimising the use of the storage medium when a particular logical-structure is stored on , or in it . typically for every unit of physical store there will be a number of units of the logical-structure (probably records) to be stored in it . for example , if we were to store a tree-structure on a magnetic disk , the physical organisation would be concerned with the best way of packing the nodes of the tree on the disk given the access characteristics of the disk . the work on data-bases has been very much concerned with a concept called data-independence . the aim of this work is to enable programs to be written independently of the logical-structure of the data they would interact with . the independence takes the following form , should the file-structure overnight be changed from an inverted to a serial file the program should remain unaffected . this independence is achieved by interposing a data-model between the user and the data-base . the user sees the data-model rather than the data-base , and all his programs communicate with the model . the user therefore has no interest in the structure of the file . there is a school of thought that says that says that applications in library-automation and information retrieval should follow this path as well [6,7] . and so it should . unfortunately , there is still much debate about what a good data-model should look like . furthermore , operational implementations of some of the more advanced theoretical systems do not exist yet . so any suggestion that an ir-system might be implemented through a data-base package should still seem premature . also , the scale of the problems in ir is such that efficient-implementation of the application still demands close scrutiny of the file-structure to be used . nevertheless , it is worth taking seriously the trend away from user-knowledge of file-structures , a trend that has been stimulated considerably by attempts to construct a theory of data [8,9] . there are a number of proposals for dealing with data at an abstract level . the best known of these by now is the one put forward by codd [8] , which has become known as the relational-model . in it data are described by n-tuples of attribute values . more formally if the data is described by relations , a relation on a set of domains d1 , ... , dn can be represented by a set of ordered n-tuples each of the form (d1 , ... , dn) where di [[propersubset]] di . as it is rather difficult to cope with general relations , various levels (three in fact) of normalisation have been introduced restricting the kind of relations allowed . a second approach is the hierarchical-approach . it is used in many existing data-base-systems . this approach works as one might expect : data is represented in the form of hierarchies . although it is more restrictive than the relational-approach it often seems to be the natural way to proceed . it can be argued that in many applications a hierarchic structure is a good approximation to the natural structure in the data , and that the resulting loss in precision of representation is worth the gain in efficiency and simplicity of representation . the third approach is the network approach associated with the proposals by the data-base-task-group of codasyl . here data items are linked into a network in which any given link between two items exists because it satisfies some condition on the attributes of those items , for example , they share an attribute . it is more general than the hierarchic approach in the sense that a node can have any number of immediate superiors . it is also equivalent to the relational-approach in descriptive power . the whole field of data-base structures is still very much in a state of flux . the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed very thoroughly in date [10] , who also gives excellent annotated citations to the current literature . there is also a recent computing survey [ll] which reviews the current-state of the art . there have been some very early proponents of the relational-approach in ir , as early as 1967 maron [12] and levien [13] discussed the design and implementation of an ir-system via relations , be it binary ones . also prywes and smith in their review chapter in the annual review of information-science and technology more recently recommended the dbtg proposals as ways of implementing ir systems [7] . lurking in the background of any discussion of file-structures nowadays is always the question whether data-base technology will overtake all . thus it may be that any application in the field of library-automation and information retrieval will be implemented through the use of some appropriate data-base package . this is certainly a possibility but not likely to happen in the near future . there are several reasons . one is that data-base-systems are general purpose systems whereas automated library and retrieval-systems are special purpose . normally one pays a price for generality and in this case it is still too great . secondly , there now is a considerable investment in providing special purpose systems (for example , marc) [14] and this is not written off very easily . nevertheless a trend towards increasing use of data-base technology exists and is well illustrated by the increased prominence given to it in the annual review of information-science and technology .
