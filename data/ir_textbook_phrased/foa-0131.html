6.5.1 theorem-proving models for relevance imagine the current-state of knowledge possessed by a browsing user as a set of axioms e . then we can model their information-need as a question : can we infer that a theorem r is true or false from our current knowledge ? ? e \ = x (6.12) inference beyond the index 225 the fact that the user has an information-need can be taken as an assumption that there must be additional knowledge , contained in some documents , that together with his of her current knowledge-base does allow r (or ~ i r) to be proven . relevant documents are exactly those that support such an inference : rel = {d \ hu d | = t} (6.13) practically speaking , of course , this model is impossible . it would demand a complete and consistent logical description of the user 's cognitive-state . it also requires that the full set ofall possible logical facts contained in each and every document be similarly encoded . (and then , of course , there is the minor problem of searching for the minimal set of documents that satisfy this inference !) ^ late winograd still , this basic conception of existing knowledge being extended by new facts and new inferences becoming possible as new facts become known is a provocative metaphor at the least . sperber and wilson 's notion of `` connected '' information corresponds exactly to such new inferences (cf. section 8.2.2) . van rijsbergen has talked about this strong notion of relevance as objective relevance [van rijsbergen , p. 147] . in more recent work , he has extended this basic model to a full relevance logic , based on a four-valued semantics over 2 ^ t} f ^ [van rijsbergen , 1986] .
