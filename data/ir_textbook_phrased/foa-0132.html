6.5.2 spreading-activation search the facts that keywords can be associated with documents or with one another , that documents become associated by citations , and so on led early ir pioneers such as doyle and stiles to adopt simple association as a unifying relation connecting many objects of the foa inquiry [doyle , 1960 ; doyle , 1961 ; doyle , 1962 ; stiles , 1961 ; maron , 1982b ; giuliano , 1963 ; findler , 1979] . integrating information across semantic-networks of such associative relations has been an important example of knowledge-representation within ai since the memory-models of collins and qullian [collins and quillian , 1972] . in its simplest form , a simple quantity known as activity is allowed to propagate through a network like that shown in figure 6.18 from several sources . spreading 226 finding out about goal figure 6.18 spreading-activation search activation search is the name for a broad range of techniques that find solutions (for example , a path from start to goal in figure 6.18) by controlling the propagation of activity through associative-networks like this [preece , 1981 ; salton and buckley , 1988a ; cohen and kjeldsen , 1987] . the adaptive-information-retrieval (air) system was a prototype search-engine built as part of my dissertation at the university of michigan in the mid-1980s [belew , 1986 ; belew , 1989] . this research was one of several systems applying connectionist (neural-network) learning-methods to the ir search-engine problem [mozer , 1988 ; bein and smolensky , 1988 ; doszkocs et al. ? 1990 ; belew , 1987b] . basic representation in air , each new document first causes a corresponding document node to be generated . an author node is then generated (if it does n't already exist) for each author of the document . two links are then created between the document and each of its keywords (one in each direction) , and two more between the document and each of its authors . weights are assigned to these links according to an inverse frequency-weighting scheme : the sum of the weights on all links going out of a node is forced to be a constant ; in our system that constant is one . figure 6.19 shows the subnet corresponding to the book parallel-models ofassociative inference beyond the index 227 [hinton and anderson 1984] figure 6.19 subnet corresponding to each document memory , by g. e. hinton and j. a. anderson [hinton and anderson , 1984] . the initial network is constructed from the superposition of many such documents ' representations . most of the experiments described in this report used a network constructed from 1600 documents , forming a network of approximately 5000 nodes . this is a trivial corpus that uses relatively crude lexical-analysis and keyword-weighting ideas . however , air requires only that the initial automatic-indexing assign some weighted set of tentative keywords to each document . there is one property of the inverse weighting-scheme on which air does depend , however . a network built using this keyword-weighting scheme , together with similar constraints on the weights assigned to author links , has the satisfying property of ` conserving activity . that is , if a unit of activity is put into a node and the total outgoing associativity from that node is one , the amount of activity in the system will neither increase nor diminish . this is helpful in controlling the spreading-activation dynamics of the network during querying . 228 finding out about querying and retrieval users begin a session with air by describing their information-need , using a very simple query-language . an initial query is composed of one or more clauses . each clause can refer to one of the three types of `` features '' represented in air 's network : keywords , documents , or authors , and all but the first clause can be negated . this query causes activity to be placed on nodes in air 's network corresponding to the features named in the query this activity is allowed to propagate throughout the network , and the system 's response is the set of nodes that become most active during this propagation . the traditional result of a query is only documents . air also provides keywords and authors . keywords retrieved in this manner are considered related terms that users may use to pursue their searches . retrieved authors are considered to be closely linked to the subject of interest . there are many ways in which a user might find related terms and centrally involved authors , a valuable information-product in their own right . figure 6.20 shows air 's response to a typical query : (oterm `` associative '') (: auth `` anderson , j. a. '')) this is the network of keywords , documents , and authors considered relevant to this query . the nodes are drawn as a tripartite graph with keywords on the top level , documents in the middle , and authors on the bottom . associative links that helped to cause a node to become retrieved (and only those links) are also displayed . heavier lines imply stronger associative weights . air uses directed links , and this directionality is represented by the concavity of the arcs ; a clockwise convention is used . for example , a link from a document node (in the middle level) to a keyword node (in the top level) goes clockwise , around to the left . actually , this is only a picture of the final-state of the system 's retrieval . the network is actually drawn incrementallyy with the first nodes to become significantly active being drawn first and in the middle of the pane . as additional nodes become active at significant levels , they are drawn farther out along the three horizontal axes and the links through which they became active are drawn as well . this dynamic-display has at inference beyond the index 229 qu ´ ogt ;) ...) ; {{item lt ; ´ saoet ´ ttv ´ gt ;) (; ´ wcn ' ª * wtrsofl , j ** gt ; figure 6.20 air-interface least two real advantages . first , the fact that air provides the first part of its retrieval almost immediately means that the user is not impatiently waiting for the retrieval to complete (typically 5 to 10 seconds in this implementation) . second , displaying the query 's dynamics helps to give the user a tangible feeling of `` direct-manipulation '' [rose and belew , 1990] ; the user `` prods '' the network in a certain place and then watches as waves of activity flow outward from that place . relevance-feedback in air queries subsequent to the first are performed differently . after air has retrieved the network of features , the user responds with relevance-feedback , indicating which features are considered (by that user) relevant to the query and which are not . using a mouse , the user marks features with the symbols : © © , ægt ; 9 , and 90 , indicating that the feature was very relevant , relevant , irrelevant , or very irrelevant , respectively . not all features need be commented on (cf. section 4.1.1) . 230 finding out about the system constructs a new query directly from this feedback . first , terms from the previous query are retained . positively marked features are added to this query , as are the negated versions of features marked negatively . equal weight is placed on each of these features , except that features marked very relevant or very irrelevant are counted double . from the perspective of retrieval , this relevance-feedback becomes a form of browsing : positively marked features are directions the user wants to pursue , and negatively marked features are directions that should be pruned from the search . from the perspective of learning , this relevance-feedback is exactly the training signal air needs to modify its representations through learning . this unification of learning (i.e. , changing representations) and doing (i.e. , browsing) was a central component of air 's design . it means that the collection of feedback is not an additional onerous task for the user , but rather is a natural part of the retrieval-process . learning in air nodes marked by the user with positive or negative-feedback act as sources of a signal that then propagates backwards along the weighted links . a local-learning rule then modifies the weight on links directly or indirectly involved in the query process . several learning-rules were investigated ; the experiments reported here used a learning-rule that correlated the activity of the presynaptic nodei with the feedback signal experienced by the postsynaptic nodef . wjj oc corr (ni active , rij relevant) air makes a most direct correspondence between the connectionist notion of activity and the ir notion of pr (rei) 5.5) : the activity level of nodes at the end of the propagation phase is considered to be a prediction of the probability that this node will be judged relevant to the query presented by the user . inference beyond the index 231 this interpretation constrained the air system-design in several ways (e.g. , activity is a real number bounded between zero and one , query nodes are activated fully) . air also allows negative activity , which is interpreted as the probability that a node is not relevant . the next step of the argument is to consider a link weight wab to be the conditional-probability that nodeg is relevant given that node a is relevant . next , this definition must be extended inductively to include indirect transitive paths that air uses extensively for its retrievals . the system 's interactions with users are then considered experiments . given a query , air predicts which nodes will be considered relevant and the user confirms or disconfirms this prediction . these results update the system 's weights (conditional-probabilities) to reflect the system 's updated estimates . thus , air 's representation results from the combination of two completely different sources of evidence : the word-frequency statistics underlying its initial indexing and the opinions of its users . a straightforward mechanism exists to incrementally introduce new documents into air 's database . links are established from the new document to all of its initial keywords and to its authors ; new keyword and author nodes are created as necessary . the weights on these links are distributed evenly so that they sum to a constant . because the sum of the (outgoing) weights for all nodes is to remain constant , any associative weight to the new document must come from existing link weights . a new parameter ^ conservative *) is introduced to control the weight given these new links at the expense of existing ones . if the network is untrained by users , this parameter can be set to zero to make the effect of an incremental addition exactly the same as if the new document had been part of the initial collection . in a trained network , setting conservative * near unity ensures that the system 's experience incorporated in existing link weights is not sacrificed to make the new connections . also , note that the computation required to place the new document is strictly local : only the links directly adjacent to the new document 's immediate neighbors must be changed . the major observation about the inclusion of new documents , however , is that there is an immediate `` place '' for new documents in air 's existing representation . a second source of new information to the air system comes from users ' queries . if a query contains a term unknown to air , this term is 232 finding out about held in abeyance and air executes the query based on the remaining terms . then , after the user has designated which of air 's responses are relevant to this query , a new node corresponding to the new query-term is created and becomes subjected to the same learning-rule used for all other nodes . although easily incorporating new documents and new query terms is a valuable property for any ir-system , from the perspective of machine-learning these are examples of simple rote learning , and they are necessarily dependent on the specifics of the ir task domain . the main focus of the air system is the use of general-purpose connectionist-learning techniques that , once the initial document network is constructed , are quite independent of the ir task . generalized representation the standard , interkeyword and interdocument associations typically evaluated as part of keyword and document-clustering are part of the broader context of the associative representation used by air . the system extends these pairwise-clustering relations and the fundamental keyword-document index relation to include higher-order transitive relations as well . that is , if node a is associated with node b and node b is associated with node c , then node a is also considered to be associated with node c , but to a lesser extent . obviously , this transitive assumption is not always valid , and this may be why most ir research does not consider this extension . but air is an adaptive-system , and one of the critical problems facing any learning-system is the generation of plausible hypotheses , i.e. , theories that stand a better than average chance of being correct . transitivity is considered a default assumption , the consequences of which will be subjected to adaptations that favor appropriate transitivities and cull out inappropriate ones . it is interesting to contrast the adaptive-changes made by air in response to relfhk with the document modification strategies of g. salton and his students [friedman et al , 1967 ; brauen , 1969] mentioned in section 4.2.7 (and returned to in section 7.3) . the query-document matches used as the basis of their changes consider only direct , keywordto-document associations while air makes use of a much wider web-inference beyond the index 233 of indirect associations . to a first approximation the changes made by air to direct keyword-to-document associations are not unlike those proposed by salton and brauen (if i 'd only known !) , but air also makes other changes , to more indirect associations . salton and buckley have analyzed the spreading-activation search used in some of these systems and concluded that it is inferior to more traditional retrieval-methods [salton and buckley , 1988a ; salton and buckley , 1988b] . they point out : ... the relationships between terms or documents are specified by labeled links between the nodes ___ the effectiveness of the procedure is crucially dependent on the availability of a representative node association map . (pp. 4 , 5 , emphasis added) in a weighted , associative representation of the semantics of indexing , interdocument and interkeyword clustering links are dropped in favor of a single , homogeneous associative relation . air treats all three types of weighted links equally . for example , if interdocument citation data had been available , this information could naturally be included as well ; again the semantics of these relations would have been dropped in favor of a simple associative weight . the contrast between the use of spreading-activation search in connectionist networks with its use in semantic-networks is admittedly a subtle one , but it is also critically important [rose and belew , 1989] . one clear difference is that semantic-networks typically make logical , deterministic use of labeled links , while connectionist networks like air rely on weighted links for probabilistic computations . figure 6.21 shows how many of the features discussed here can interact as part of a single retrieval-system . this figure comes from dan rose 's scalir (symbolic and connectionist approach to legal-information retrieval) system , which was built to investigate the use of both logical , `` symbolic '' modes of inference and probabalistic , `` subsymbolic '' ones . this figure shows containment relations between document elements (like those shown in more detail in figure 6.10) , topical connections between keywords , and interdocument citations , all mixed and used as part of spreading activation-based inference . 234 finding out about figure 6.21 semantic-net of legal document relations from [rose , 1994] . reproduced with permission of lawrence erlbaum
