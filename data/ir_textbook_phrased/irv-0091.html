explicit measures-of-effectiveness i shall now argue for a specific form of [[phi]] i and f , based on a model for the user . in other words , the form [[phi]] i and f are partly determined by the user . we start by showing how the ordering on r x p in fact induces an ordering of intervals on each factor . from figure 7.13 we have that (r3 , p1) gt ; = (r1 , p2) , (r3 , p1) gt ; = (r1 , p1) and (r1 , p2) gt ; = (r1 , p1) . therefore the increment (interval) r1r3 is preferred to the increment p1p2 . but (r2 , p2) gt ; = (r4 , p1) , which gives p1 p2 is preferred to r2 r4 . hence r1 r3 gt ; = 1 r2 , r4 where gt ; = 1 is the induced order relation on r . we now have a method of comparing each interval on r with a fixed interval on p . since we have assumed that effectiveness is determined by precision-and-recall we have committed ourselves to the importance of proportions of documents rather than absolute numbers . consistent with this is the assumption of decreasing marginal effectiveness . let me illustrate this with an example . suppose the user is willing to sacrifice one unit of precision for an increase of one unit of recall , but will not sacrifice another unit of precision for a further unit increase in recall , i.e. (r + 1 , p - 1) gt ; (r , p) but (r + 1 , p) gt ; (r + 2 , p - 1) we conclude that the interval between r + 1 and r exceeds the interval between p and p - 1 whereas the interval between r + 1 and r + 2 is smaller . hence the marginal effectiveness of recall is decreasing . (a similar argument can be given for precision .) the implication of this for the shape of the curves of equal effectiveness is that they are convex towards the origin . finally , we incorporate into our measurement procedure the fact that users may attach different relative-importance to precision-and-recall . what we want is therefore a parameter (ß) to characterise the measurement function in such a way that we can say : it measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches ß times as much importance to recall as precision . the simplest way i know of quantifying this is to specify the p/r ratio at which the user is willing to trade an increment in precision for an equal loss in recall . definition 6 . the relative-importance a user attaches to precision-and-recall is the p/r ratio at which [[partialdiff]] e / [[partialdiff]] r = [[partialdiff]] e / [[partialdiff]] p , where e = e (p , r) is the measure of effectiveness based on precision-and-recall . can we find a function satisfying all these conditions ? if so , can we also interpret it in an intuitively simple way ? the answer to both these questions is yes . it involves : the scale functions are therefore , [[phi]] 1 (p) = [[alpha]] (1/p) , and [[phi]] 2 (r) = (1 - [[alpha]]) (1/r) . the ` combination ' function f is now chosen to satisfy definition 6 without violating the additive independence . we get : we now have the effectiveness measure . in terms of p and r it will be : to facilitate interpretation of the function , we transform according to [[alpha]] = 1 / (ß [2] + 1) , and find that [[partialdiff]] e / [[partialdiff]] r = [[partialdiff]] e / [[partialdiff]] p when p/r = ß . if a is the set of relevant documents and b the set of retrieval documents , then : e now gives rise to the following special cases : (1) when [[alpha]] = 1/2 (ß = 1) e = | a [[delta]] b | / (| a | + | b |) , a normalised symmetric difference between sets a and b (a [[delta]] b = a [[union]] b - a [[intersection]] b) . it corresponds to a user who attaches equal importance to precision-and-recall . (2) e - gt ; 1 - r when [[alpha]] - gt ; 0 (ß - gt ; *) , which corresponds to a user who attaches no important to precision . (3) e - gt ; 1 - p when [[alpha]] - gt ; 1 (ß - gt ; 0) , which corresponds to a user who attaches no importance to recall . it is now a simple matter to show that certain other measures given in the literature are special cases of the general form e. by the representation theorem , the [[phi]] i 's are uniquely determined up to a linear transformation , that is , [[phi]] i ['] = [[theta]] [[phi]] i + [[gamma]] i would serve equally well as scale functions . if we now set [[phi]] 1 ['] = 2 [[phi]] 1 - 1/2 , [[phi]] 2 ['] = 2 [[phi]] 2 - 1/2 , and ß = 1 then we have : which is the measure recommended by heine [3] . one final example is the measure suggested by vickery in 1965 which was documented by cleverdon et al. [27] . here we set : which is vickery 's measure (apart from a scale factor of 100) . to summarise , we have shown that it is reasonable to assume that effectiveness in terms of precision-and-recall determines an additive conjoint structure . this guarantees the existence of an additively independent representation . we then found the representation satisfying some user-requirements and also having special cases which are simple to interpret . the analysis is not limited to the two factors precision-and-recall , it could equally well be carried out for say the pair fallout and recall . furthermore , it is not necessary to restrict the model to two factors . if appropriate variables need to be incorporated the model readily extends to n factors . in fact , for more than two dimensions the thomsen condition is not required for the representation theorem .
