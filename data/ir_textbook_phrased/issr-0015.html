2.1.1 boolean-logic boolean-logic allows a user to logically relate multiple concepts together to define what information is needed . typically the boolean-functions apply to processing tokens identified anywhere within an item . the typical boolean-operators are and , or , and not . these operations are implemented using set-intersection , set union and set-difference procedures . a few systems introduced the concept of `` exclusive or '' but it is equivalent to a slightly more complex-query using the other operators and is not generally useful to users since most users do not understand it . placing portions of the search statement in parentheses are used to overtly specify the order of boolean-operations (i.e. , nesting function) . if parentheses are not used , the system follows a default precedence ordering of operations (e.g. , typically not then and then or) . in the examples of effects of boolean-operators given in figure 2.1 , no precedence order is given to the operators and queries are processed left to right unless parentheses are included . most commercial systems do not allow weighting of boolean-queries . a technique to allow weighting boolean-queries is described in chapter 7 . some of the deficiencies of use of boolean-operators in information-systems are summarized by belkin and croft (belkin-89) . a special type of boolean search is called `` m of n '' logic . the user lists a set of possible search-terms and identifies , as acceptable , any item that contains a subset of the terms . for example , `` find any item containing any two of the following terms : `` aa , '' `` bb , '' `` cc . '' this can be expanded into a boolean search that performs an and between all combinations of two terms and `` or `` s the results together ((aa and bb) or (aa and cc) or (bb and cc)) . some search examples and their meanings are given in figure 2.1 . most information-retrieval-systems allow boolean-operations as well as allowing for the natural-language-interfaces discussed in section 2.1.8 . as noted in chapter 1 , very little attention has been focused on integrating the boolean search functions and weighted information-retrieval-techniques into a single search result .
