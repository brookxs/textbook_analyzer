7.2.2 hidden-markov-models techniques use of hidden-markov-models for searching textual-corpora has introduced a new paradigm for search . in most of the previous search-techniques , the query is thought of as another `` document '' and the system tries to find other documents similar to it . in hmms the documents are considered unknown statistical processes that can generate output that is equivalent to the set of queries that would consider the document relevant . another way to look at it is by taking the general definition that a hmm is defined by output that is produced by passing some unknown key via state-transitions through a noisy-channel . the observed output is the query , and the unknown keys are the relevant documents . the noisy-channel is the mismatch between the author 's way of expressing ideas and the user 's ability to specify his query . leek , miller and schwartz (leek-99) computed for each document the probability that d was the relevant-document in the users mind given that q was the query produced , i.e. , p (d is r/q) . the development for a hmm approach begins with applying bayes rule to the conditional-probability : p (d is r/q) = p (q/d is r) * p (d is r) / p (q) since we are performing the analysis from the document 's perspective , the p (q) will be the same for every document and thus can be ignored . p (d is r) is also almost an impossible task in a large diverse corpora . relevant documents sets 174 chapter 7 seem to be so sensitive to the specific queries , that trying to estimate p (d is r) does not return any noticeable improvements in query resolution . thus the probability that a document is relevant given a specific query can be estimated by calculating the probability of the query given the document is relevant , i.e. , p (q/d is r) . as described in chapter 4 , a hidden-markov-model is defined by a set of states , a transition-matrix defining the probability of moving between states , a set of output symbols and the probability of the output symbols given a particular state . the set of all possible queries is the output symbol set and the document file defines the states . states could for example be any of the words or stems of the words in the documents . thus the hmm process traces itself through the states of a document (e.g. , the words in the document) and at each state-transition has an output of query terms associated with the new state . state-transitions are associated with ways that words are combined to make documents . given the query , it is possible to calculate the probability that any particular document generated the query . the biggest problem in using this approach is to estimate the transition-probability matrix and the output (queries that could cause hits) for every document in the corpus . if there was a large-training database of queries and the relevant documents they were associated with that included adequate coverage , then the problem could be solved using estimation-maximization algorithms (dempster-77 , bryne-93 .) but given the lack of data , leek et . al. recommend making the transition-matrix independent of specific document-sets and applying simple unigram estimation for output distributions (leek-99) .
