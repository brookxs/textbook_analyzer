1.6.1 teaching suggestions this textbook can be used in many different areas including computer-science (cs) , information-systems , and library-science . the following list gives suggested contents for different courses at the undergraduate and graduate level , based on syllabuses of many universities around the world : ï information-retrieval (computer-science , undergraduate) : this is the standard course for many cs programs . the minimum content should include chapters 1 to 8 and chapter 10 , that is , most of the part on text ir complemented with the chapter on user-interfaces . some specific topics of those chapters , such as more advanced models for ir and sophisticated algorithms for indexing and searching , can be omitted to fit a one term course . the chapters on applications of ir can be mentioned briefly at the end . ï advanced information retrieval (computer-science , graduate) : similar to the previous course but with more detailed coverage of the various chapters particularly modeling and searching (assuming the previous course as a requirement) . in addition , chapter 9 and chapters 13 to 15 should be covered completely . emphasis on research problems and new results is a must . ï information-retrieval (information-systems , undergraduate) : this course is similar to the cs-course , but with a different emphasis . it should include chapters 1 to 7 and chapter 10 . some notions from chapter 8 are 16 introduction useful but not crucial . at the end , the system-oriented parts of the chapters on applications of ir , in particular those on bibliographic systems and digital-libraries , must be covered (this material can be complemented with topics from [501]) . ï information-retrieval (library-science , undergraduate) : similar to the previous course , but removing the more technical and advanced material of chapters 2 , 5 , and 7 . also , greater emphasis should be put on the chapters on bibliographic systems and digital-libraries . the course should be complemented with a thorough discussion of the user-centered view of the ir problem (for example , using the book by allen [13]) . ï multimedia-retrieval (computer-science , undergraduate or graduate) : this course should include chapters 1 to 3 , 6 , and 11 to 15 . the emphasis could be on multimedia itself or on the integration of classical ir with multimedia . the course can be complemented with one of the many books on this topic , which are usually more broad and technical . ï topics in ir (computer-science , graduate) : many chapters of the book can be used for this course . it can emphasize modeling and evaluation or user-interfaces and visualization . it can also be focused on algorithms-and-data-structures (in that case , [275] and [825] are good complements) . a multimedia focus is also possible , starting with chapters 11 and 12 and using more specific books later on . ï topics in ir (information-systems or library-science , graduate) similar to the above but with emphasis on non-technical parts . for example , the course could cover modeling and evaluation , query-languages , user-interfaces , and visualization . the chapters on applications can also be considered . ï web-retrieval and information access (generic , undergraduate or graduate) : this course should emphasize hypertext , concepts coming from networks and distributed-systems and multimedia . the kernel should be the basic models of chapter 2 followed by chapters 3 , 4 , and 6 . also , chapters 11 and 13 to 15 should be discussed . ï digital-libraries (generic , undergraduate or graduate) : this course could start with part of chapters 2 to 4 and 6 , followed by chapters 10 , 14 , and 15 . the kernel of the course could be based on the book by lesk [501] . iviore bibliography useful for many of the courses above is discussed in the last section of this chapter .
