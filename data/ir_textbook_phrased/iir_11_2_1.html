the 1/0 loss case we assume a ranked-retrieval setup as in section 6.3 , where there is a collection of documents , the user-issues a query , and an ordered-list of documents is returned . we also assume a binary notion of relevance as in chapter 8 . for a query and a document in the collection , let be an indicator random-variable that says whether is relevant with respect to a given query . that is , it takes on a value of 1 when the document is relevant and 0 otherwise . in context we will often write just for . using a probabilistic-model , the obvious order in which to present documents to the user is to rank documents by their estimated probability-of-relevance with respect to the information-need : . this is the basis of the-probability-ranking-principle (prp) (van rijsbergen , 1979 , 113-114) : `` if a reference retrieval-system 's response to each request is a ranking of the documents in the collection in order of decreasing probability-of-relevance to the user who submitted the request , where the probabilities are estimated as accurately as possible on the basis of whatever data have been made available to the system for this purpose , the overall effectiveness of the system to its user will be the best that is obtainable on the basis of those data . '' accuracy 1/0 loss bayes optimal-decision-rule (61) theorem . the prp is optimal , in the sense that it minimizes the expected loss (also known as the bayes risk) under 1/0 loss . end theorem . the proof can be found in ripley (1996) . however , it requires that all probabilities are known correctly . this is never the case in practice . nevertheless , the prp still provides a very useful foundation for developing models of ir .
