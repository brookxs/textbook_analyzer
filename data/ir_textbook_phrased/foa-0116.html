6.1.5 analyzing www adj acency to a computer scientist , the www looks much like the directed-graphs (digraph) we have studied in data-structure classes for decades . it 's big , it 's dynamic , we have special questions about it , etc. , but many of the same analyses we would apply to any digraph are good starting-points for the www . a useful first step is to define the adjacency-matrix a connecting all the documents dj of the www : ajj = 1 if 4 cites dj (6.1) ai} = 0 otherwise (6.2) 196 finding out about for example , the google search engine5 imagines the www graph as the basis of a markov-process , where the probability of jumping from one page is uniform across all of its anchor/citations . if e is defined to be this (small) probability , the stationary-distribution of this markov-process provides some insight into how likely a browsing user would be to find him or herself on a particular page . nec 's citeseer6 is another example of how useful citation-information can be as part of a tool for searching computer-science literature . a more extensive analysis [chakrabarti et al. , 1998b ; kleinberg , 1998] has analyzed the www , looking especially for methods that extract authoritative pages from the vast numbers of other pages the www also contains . the first component of this method corresponds approximately to the notion of impact discussed in section 6.1.1 . ... the fundamental difficulty lies in what could be called the abundance problem : the number of pages that could reasonably be returned as `` relevant '' is far too large for a human user to digest . thus , to provide effective methods for automated-search under these constraints , one does not necessarily need stronger versions of classical information retrieval notions such as relevance ; rather one needs a method of providing a user , from a large set of relevant pages , a small collection of the most `` authoritative '' or `` definitive '' ones ___ unfortunately , `` authority '' is perhaps an even more nebulous concept than `` relevance , '' again highly subject to human-judgment ___ we claim that an environment such as the www is explicitly annotated with precisely the type of human-judgment that we need in order to formulate a notion of authority . specifically , the creation of a link in the www represents a concrete indication of the following type of judgment : the creator of page p , by including a link to page q , has in some measure conferred authority on q. [chakrabarti et al. , 1998b , p. 2] second , they define hub documents to be ones that are particularly exhaustive in their reference to other pages . this is roughly analogous to review papers also mentioned in section 6.1.1 . to a first approximation , * www.google.com / h clteseer.na.nec.com/cs inference beyond the index 197 authoritative pages are those with high in-degree while hubs are those with high out-degree . but kleinberg imposes an important additional constraint : a-community of hubs and authority pages must be mutually self-referential . the thinking underlying kleinberg 's method is provocative : authoritative pages relevant to the initial query should not only have large in-degree ; since they are all authorities on a common topic , there should also be considerable overlap in the sets of pages that point to them . thus , in addition to highly authoritative pages , we expect to find what could be called hub pages : these are pages that have links to multiple relevant authoritative pages . it is these hub pages that `` pull together '' authorities on a common topic , and allow us to throw out unrelated pages of large in-degree . hubs-and-authorities exhibit what could be called a mutually reinforcing relationship : a good hub is a page that points to many good authorities ; a good authority is a page that is pointed to by many good hubs . [kleinberg , 1998 , p. 4] two quantities , x and y , are associated with each document , corresponding to how good an authority or hub , respectively , the document is , based on the adjacency-matrix a : xi = authority (ij) (6.3) y {= hubness (df) (6.4) x = {xi) (6.5) y = (yi) (6.6) x and y values are iteratively updated by premultiplication with the adjacency-matrix or its transpose : xt + i = a y (67) jt + l = axf (6.8) it is also important to renormalize these vectors to unit length after each update . under reasonable assumptions * this update procedure is guaranteed to converge on values with x * being the principal-eigenvector of ata 198 finding out about figure 6.5 citation-expanded hitlist and y * the principal-eigenvector of a at : x * = codata) (6.9) y * = coi (aat) (6.10) using this notation , the similarity of documents dx and dj can be conveniently measured in terms of cocitation as the (z , j) entry of a a t * while we can conceive of applying these techniques to the graph corresponding to the entire www , the computational time and space required still makes such an analysis intractable . kleinberg et al. typically recommend applying this adjacency analysis to a subset of pages pulled together by a query against some search-engine . in their experiments , they augment this initial hitlist with documents that either point to or are pointed to from documents in the hitlist itself , as shown in figure 6.5 . note that the values for authority and hub on which this analysis converges correspond to the first , primary eigenvector . using these values to identify high hub and anchor nodes gives rise to the first , primary community of documents in the graph . another interesting application of adjacency analysis is to consider communities other than the one corresponding to the first , largest eigenvalue . a particularly striking application of this analysis-concerns bimodal queries : consider results arising from a query abortion , shown in table 6.3 . after first identifying * kleinberg also notes that the complementary measure ata corresponds to the earlier , bibllornetric construct of bibliographic-coupling [kessler , 1963] . inference beyond the index 199 table 6.3 authority nodes elicited by abortion query , associated with second eigenvector x2 url title .321 wwiw.caral.org/abortion.html abortion and reproductive rights internet resources .219 www.plannedparenthood.org / welcome to planned parenthood .195 www.gynpages.com / abortion clinics online .172 www.oneworld.org/ippf/ ippf home-page .162 www.prochoice.org/naf/ the national abortion federation .161 www . lm . com/imann/femirnst / abortion . html -.197 www.awinc.com/partners/bc/commpass/lifenet/ life web lifenet.htm - .169 www.worldvillage.com/wv/square/chapel/xwalk/html/ healing after abortion peter.htm - ,164 www.nebula.net/maeve/hfelink.html - .150 members.aol.com/pladvocate/ - . 144 www.clark.net/pub/jeffd/factbot.html the right side of the-web - .144 www.catholic.net/h3rperuews/get/abortion.html a-community of pages extensively citing both pro-choice and pro-life documents , the second eigenvector 002 clearly separates pages associated with pro-choice organizations (with relatively high positive values) and pro-life (with negative values) . * another important feature of this analysis is that it depends on only first-order adjacency information . that is , while it is always easy to find all of the documents pointed to by a target document simply by inspecting the document for its anchors , the in-neighborhood of a document can be identified through direct inspection of other documents . this means , for example , that search-engine crawlers that look at every single-document can , as part of their normal search , simultaneously collect this adjacency data .
