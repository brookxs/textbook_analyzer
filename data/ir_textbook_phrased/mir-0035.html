2.6.2 extended boolean-model boolean-retrieval is simple and elegant . however , since there is no provision for term-weighting , no ranking of the answer set is generated . as a result , the size of the output might be too large or too small (see chapter 10 for details on this issue) . because of these problems , modern information retrieval-systems are no longer based on the boolean-model . in fact , most of the new systems adopt at their core some form of vector-retrieval . the reasons are that the vector-space-model is simple , fast , and yields better retrieval-performance . one alternative approach though is to extend the boolean-model with the functionality of partial-matching and term-weighting . this strategy allows one to combine boolean-query formulations with characteristics of the vector-model . in what follows , we discuss one of the various models which are based on the idea of extending the boolean-model with features of the vector-model . the extended boolean-model , introduced in 1983 by salton , fox , and wu [703] , is based on a critique of a basic assumption in boolean-logic as follows . consider a conjunctive boolean-query given by q ó kx a ky. . according to the boolean-model , a document which contains either the term kx or the term ky is as irrelevant as another document which contains neither of them . however , this binary-decision criteria frequently is not in accordance with common-sense . an analogous reasoning applies when one considers purely disjunctive queries . when only two terms are considered , we can plot queries and documents in a two-dimensional map as shown in figure 2.6 . a document dj is positioned in this space through the adoption of weights wxj and wyj associated with the pairs [kx , dj] and [ky , dj] , respectively . we assume that these weights are normalized and thus lie between 0 and 1 . for instance , these weights can be computed as normalized tf-idf factors as follows . = / idf * max , idf * (0,1) (0,0) alternative set theoretic models 39 (1,1) ky (1.0) (0,0) ! (1,0) * x * x figure 2.6 extended boolean-logic considering the space composed of two terms kx and ky only . where , as defined by equation 2.3 , fxj is the normalized frequency of term kx in document dj and idj % is the inverse-document-frequency for a generic term k {. for simplicity , in the remainder of this section , we refer to the weight wx ^ as x , to the weight wyj as y , and to the document vector d3 = (wx ,3 , wy ,3) as the point dj = (x , y) . observing figure 2.6 we notice two particularities . first , for a disjunctive query qor ó kxv fcy , the point (0 , 0) is the spot to be avoided . this suggests taking the distance from (0,0) as a measure of similarity with regard to the query qor . second , for a conjunctive-query qand = kx a ky , the point (1,1) is the most desirable spot . this suggests taking the complement of the distance from the point (1,1) as a measure of similarity with regard to the query qand-furthermore , such distances can be normalized which yields , sim (qorid) = sim (qandid) = 1if the weights are all boolean (i.e. , wxj # {0,1}) , a document is always positioned in one of the four corners (i.e. , (0,0) , (0,1) , (1,0) , or (1,1)) and the values for sim (qor , d) are restricted to 0 , l / \ / 2 , and 1 . analogously , the values for sim (qand , d) are restricted to 0 , 1 ó l / \ / 2 , and 1 . given that the number of index-terms in a document-collection is t , the boolean-model discussed above can be naturally extended to consider euclidean distances in a t-dimensional space . however , a more comprehensive generalization is to adopt the theory of vector norms as follows . the p-norrn model generalizes the notion of distance to include not only euclidean distances but also p-distances , where 1 lt ; p lt ; oc is a newly introduced parameter whose value must be specified at query time . a generalized disjunctive 40 modeling query is now represented by qor ó a-i v a/2 v ... v / im analogously , a generalized conjunctive-query is now represented by qand = h ap k2 ap ... ap km the respective query-document similarities are now given by t {+ x \ + ... + x m sim {qand) dj) = 1 - i 771 where each x {stands for the weight w ^ d associated to the pair [ki , d3] . the p norm as defined above enjoys a couple of interesting properties as follows . first , when p = 1 it can be verified that . / , n . / - , \ xi {- \ x sim (qor , dj) = sim {qand , dj) = second , when p = oo it can be verified that sim (qor , dj) = sim (qand , d3) = min [xi) thus , for p = 1 , conjunctive and disjunctive queries are evaluated by a sum of term-document weights as done by vector-based similarity formulas (which compute the inner-product) . further , for p = oo , queries are evaluated according to the formalism of fuzzy-logic (which we view as a generalization of boolean-logic) . by varying the parameter p between 1 and infinity , we can vary the p-norm ranking behavior from that of a vector-like ranking to that of a boolean-like ranking . this is quite powerful and is a good argument in favor of the extended boolean-model . the processing of more general queries is done by grouping the operators in a predefined order . for instance , consider the query q = (fci ap 2) vp k % . the similarity sim (q , d3) between a document dj and this query is then computed as / / \ {! - [-------- 2 --------)) + x3 [gt ; ¶ - {------- 2 ------- ; ; t4 sim {q , d) = v / this procedure can be applied recursively no matter the number of and/or operators . alternative algebraic-models 41 one additional interesting aspect of this extended boolean-model is the possibility of using combinations of different values of the parameter p in a same query request . for instance , the query (fci v2 k2) a ∞ ∞ fc3 could be used to indicate that k \ and k2 should be used as in a vector system but that the presence of ks is required (i.e. , the conjunction is interpreted as a boolean-operation) . despite the fact that it is not clear whether this additional functionality has any practical impact , the model does allow for it and does so in a natural way (without the need for clumsy extensions to handle special cases) . we should also observe that the extended boolean-model relaxes boolean-algebra interpreting boolean-operations in terms of algebraic distances . in this sense , it is really a hybrid-model which includes properties of both the set theoretic models and the algebraic-models . for simplicity , we opted for classifying the model as a set theoretic one . the extended boolean-model was introduced in 1983 but has not been used extensively . however , the model does provide a neat framework and might reveal itself useful in the future .
