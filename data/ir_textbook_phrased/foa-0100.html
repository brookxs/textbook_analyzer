5.4.1 the cluster-hypothesis we have been talking about a measure of association between query and document , but as discussed in section 5.2.5 , we can use x = jjt (cf. equation 5.15) to capture similarities or differences among the documents themselves . van rijsbergen 's cluster-hypothesis suggests how useful this data might be : closely associated documents tend to be relevant to the same request , [van rijsbergen , p. 45] the cluster-hypothesis suggests that if we first compute a measure of distance x among all the documents , we could cluster those documents that seem to be close to one another or seem to be about the same topic and retrieve them all in response to a query that matched any of them . if a query happens to match one document based on an overlap of features , then we will claim that other documents that are similar to it should also be retrieved . 166 finding out about as van rijsbergen , p. 38 notes , the fact that most measures of association are monotonic with respect to one another makes it sufficient that clustering-methods only respect the same rank ordering of their results ; once again the nonmetric quality of critical foa quantities is striking . divisive / partitional-clustering
