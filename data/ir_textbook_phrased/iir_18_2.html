term-document matrices and singular value decompositions singular-value-decomposition 18.3 18.2 18.1.1 theorem . let be the rank of the-matrix . then , there is a singular-value-decomposition (svd for short) of of the form (232) the eigenvalues of are the same as the eigenvalues of ; for , let , with . then the-matrix is composed by setting for , and zero otherwise . end theorem . the values are referred to as the singular-values of . it is instructive to examine the relationship of theorem 18.2 to theorem 18.1.1 ; we do this rather than derive the general proof of theorem 18.2 , which is beyond the scope of this book . by multiplying equation 232 by its transposed version , we have (233) note now that in equation 233 , the left-hand side is a square symmetric-matrix real-valued matrix , and the right-hand-side represents its symmetric diagonal decomposition as in theorem 18.1.1 . what does the left-hand side represent ? it is a square matrix with a row and a column corresponding to each of the terms . the entry in the matrix is a measure of the overlap between the th and th terms , based on their co-occurrence in documents . the precise mathematical meaning depends on the manner in which is constructed based on term-weighting . consider the case where is the term-document incidence matrix of page 1.1 , illustrated in figure 1.1 . then the entry in is the number of documents in which both term and term occur . when writing down the numerical values of the svd , it is conventional to represent as an matrix with the singular-values on the diagonals , since all its entries outside this sub-matrix are zeros . accordingly , it is conventional to omit the rightmost columns of corresponding to these omitted rows of ; likewise the rightmost columns of are omitted since they correspond in to the rows that will be multiplied by the columns of zeros in . this written form of the svd is sometimes known as the reduced svd or truncated svd and we will encounter it again in exercise 18.3 . henceforth , our numerical examples and exercises will use this reduced form . worked example . we now illustrate the singular-value-decomposition of a matrix of rank 2 ; the singular-values are and . (234) end worked example . as with the-matrix decompositions defined in section 18.1.1 , the singular-value-decomposition of a matrix can be computed by a variety of algorithms , many of which have been publicly available software-implementations ; pointers to these are given in section 18.5 . exercises . let (235) be the term-document incidence matrix for a collection . compute the co-occurrence-matrix . what is the interpretation of the diagonal entries of when is a term-document incidence matrix ? verify that the svd of the-matrix in equation 235 is (236) by verifying all of the properties in the statement of theorem 18.2 . suppose that is a binary term-document incidence matrix . what do the entries of represent ? let (237) be a term-document-matrix whose entries are term frequencies ; thus term 1 occurs 2 times in document 2 and once in document 3 . compute ; observe that its entries are largest where two terms have their most frequent occurrences together in the same document .
