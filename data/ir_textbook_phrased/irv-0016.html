discrimination and/or representation there are two conflicting ways of looking at the problem of characterising documents for retrieval . one is to characterise a document through a representation of its contents , regardless of the way in which other documents may be described , this might be called representation without discrimination . the other way is to insist that in characterising a document one is discriminating it from all , or potentially all , other documents in the collection , this we might call discrimination without representation . naturally , neither of these extreme positions is assumed in practice , although identifying the two is useful when thinking about the problem of characterisation . in practice , one seeks some sort of optimal trade-off between representation and discrimination . traditionally this has been attempted through balancing indexing exhaustively against specificity . most automatic methods of indexing can be seen to be a mix of representation versus discrimination . in the simple case of removing high-frequency words by means of a ` stop ' word list we are attempting to increase the level of discrimination between document . salton 's methods based on the discrimination value attempts the same thing . however , it should be clear that when removing possible index-terms there must come a stage when the remaining ones can not adequately represent the contents of documents any more . bookstein-swanson-harter 's formal-model can be looked upon as one in which the importance of a term in representing the contents of a document is balanced against its importance as a discriminator . they , in fact , attempt to attach a cost-function to the trade-ff between the two . the emphasis on representation leads to what one might call a document-orientation : that is , a total preoccupation with modelling what the document is about . this approach will tend to shade into work on artificial-intelligence , particularly of the kind concerned with constructing computer-models of the contents of any given piece of natural-language-text . the relevance of this work in ai , as well as other work , has been conveniently summarised by smith [36] . this point-of-view is also adopted by those concerned with defining a concept of ` information ' , they assume that once this notion is properly explicated a document can be represented by the ` information ' it contains [37] . the emphasis on discrimination leads to a query-orientation . this way of looking at things presupposes that one can predict the population of queries likely to be submitted to the ir-system . in the light of data about this population of queries , one can then try and characterise documents in the optimal fashion . recent work attempting to formalise this approach in terms of utility-theory has been done by maron and cooper [38 , 39] , although it is difficult to see at this stage how it might be automated .
