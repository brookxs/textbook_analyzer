10.4.2 overviews faced with a large set of text-collections , how can a user choose which to begin with ? one approach is to study an overview of the contents of the collections . an overview can show the topic domains represented within the collections , to help users select or eliminate sources from consideration . an overview can help users get started , directing them into general neighborhoods , after which they can navigate using more detailed descriptions . shneiderman [724] advocates an interaction-model in which the user begins with an overview of the information to be worked with , then pans and zooms to find areas of potential interest , and then view details . the process is repeated as often as necessary . three types of overviews are discussed in this subsection . the first is display and navigation of large topical category hierarchies associated with the documents of a collection . the second is automatically derived overviews , usually created by unsupervised-clustering techniques on the text of documents , that attempt to extract overall characterizing themes from collections . the third type starting-points 269 of overview is that created by applying a variant of co-citation-analysis on connections or links between different entities within a collection . other kinds of overviews are possible , for example , showing graphical depictions of bookshelves or piles of books [681 , 46] . category or directory overviews there exist today many large online text collections to which category labels have been assigned . traditional online bibliographic systems have for decades assigned subject-headings to books and other documents [752] . medigital libraryine , a large-collection of biomedical articles , has associated with it medical subject-headings (mesh) consisting of approximately 18,000 categories [523] . the association for computing-machinery (acm) has developed a hierarchy of approximately 1200 category (keyword) labels.f yahoo! [839] , one of the most popular search sites on the world-wide-web , organizes web-pages into a hierarchy consisting of thousands of category labels . the popularity of yahoo! and other web-directories suggests that hierarchically structured categories are useful starting-points for users seeking information on the web . this popularity may reflect a preference to begin at a logical starting point , such as the home-page for a set of information , or it may reflect a desire to avoid having to guess which words will retrieve the desired information . (it may also reflect the fact that directory-services attempt to cull out low quality web-sites .) the meanings of category labels differ somewhat among collections . most are designed to help organize the documents and to aid in query-specification . unfortunately , users of online bibliographic catalogs rarely use the available subject-headings [335 , 222] , hancock-beaulieu and drabenstott and weller , among others , put much of the blame on poor (command line-based) user-interfaces which provide little aid for selecting subject labels and require users to scroll through long alphabetic lists . even with graphical web-interfaces , finding the appropriate place within a category-hierarchy can be a time-consuming task , and once a collection has been found using such a representation , an alternative means is required for searching within the site itself . most interfaces that depict category hierarchies graphically do so by associating a document directly with the node of the category-hierarchy to which it has been assigned . for example , clicking on a category link in yahoo! brings up a list of documents that have been assigned that category-label conceptually , the document is stored within the category-label . when navigating the results of a search in yahoo! , the user must look through a list of category labels and guess which one is most likely to contain references to the topic of interest . a wrong path requires backing up and trying again , and remembering which pages contain which information . if the desired information is deep in the hierarchy , or t http://www.acm.org/class 270 user-interfaces and visualization figure 10.4 [453] . the meshbrowse interface for viewing category labels hierarchically not available at all , this can be a time-consuming and frustrating process . because documents are conceptually stored ` inside ' categories , users can not create queries based on combinations of categories using this interface . it is difficult to design a good interface to integrate category-selection into query-specification , in part because display of category hierarchies takes up large amounts of screen-space . for example , internet grateful medt is a web-based-service that allows an integration of search with display and selection of mesh category labels . after the user-types in the name of a potential category-label , a long list of choices is shown in a page . to see more information about a given label the user selects a link (e.g. , radiation injuries) . the causes the context of the query to disappear because a new web page appears showing the ancestors of the term and its immediate descendants . if the user attempts to see the siblings of the parent term (wounds and injuries) then a new page appears that changes the context again . radiation injuries appears as one of many siblings and its children can no long be seen . to go back to the query , the illustration of the category-hierarchy disappears . the meshbrowse system [453] allows users to interactively browse a subset of semantically associated links in the mesh-hierarchy . from a given starting point , clicking on a category causes the associated categories to be displayed in a two-dimensional tree-representation . thus only the relevant subset of the http : / / iga . sin , sib . go * ? : 80 / starting-points 271 + hibrowse foi embase add a view anatomy organisms disease-diagnosis therapy chernov sarkldfugs pharmacology ' ? # * ´ (arid * ortfaic em m broaden} close ma 1266i | physical disease # : © ? 1 jmpy and child [ï # 12661 | diild and therapy \ ~ . c3 313 abdominal diseas 1 2468 therapy (in geij * ; 8411 child (in genera .

the centroids of the clusters determine the themes in the collections . the scatter/gather browsing paradigm [203 , 202] clusters documents into topically-coherent groups , and presents descriptive textual summaries to the user . the summaries consist of topical terms that characterize each cluster generally , and a set of typical titles that hint at the contents of the cluster . informed by the summaries , the user may select a subset of clusters that seem to be of most interest , and recluster their contents . thus the user can examine the contents of each subcollection at progressively finer granularity of detail . the reclustering is computed on-the-fly ; different themes are produced depending on the documents contained in the subcollection to which clustering is applied . the choice of clustering-algorithm influences what clusters are produced , but no one algorithm has been shown to be particularly better than the rest when producing the same number-of-clusters [816] . a user-study [640] showed that the use of scatter/gather on a large text collection successfully conveys some of the content-and-structure of the corpus . however , that study also showed that scatter/gather without a search-facility was less effective than a standard similarity-search for finding relevant documents for a query . that is , subjects allowed only to navigate , not to search over , a hierarchical-structure of clusters covering the entire collection were less able to find documents relevant to the supplied query than subjects allowed to write queries arid scan through retrieval results . it is possible to integrate scatter/gather with conventional search-technology by applying clustering on the results of a query to organize the retrieved documents (see figure 10.6) . an offline experiment [359] suggests that clustering may be more effective if used in this manner . the study found that documents relevant to the query tend to fall mainly into one or two out of five clusters , if the clusters are generated from the top-ranked documents retrieved in response to the query . the study also showed that precision-and-recall were higher within the best cluster than within the retrieval results as a whole . the implication is that a user might save time by looking at the contents of the cluster with the highest proportion of relevant documents and at the same time avoiding those clusters with mainly non-relevant documents . thus , clustering of retrieval results may be useful for helping direct users to a subset of the retrieval results that contain a large proportion of the relevant documents . general themes do seem to arise from document-clustering , but the themes are highly dependent on the makeup of the documents within the clusters [$ 59 , 357] . the unsupervised nature of clustering can result in a display of topics at varying levels of description . for example , clustering a collection of documents about computer-science might result in clusters containing documents about starting-points 273 0 star-spstttgtei banner , the o klt ;

[163] . for one (if the tasks , subjects were asked to find an interesting '' web-page within the entertainment category of yahoo! and of an organization of the same web-pages into a ko-lionen map layout . the experiment varied whether subjects started in yahoo! or in the t * raphical map . after completion of the browing task , subjects were asked to attempt to repeat the browse using the other tool . for the subjects that starting-points 275 trfibkt ´ * j ; ¶ rtii c84 . . ¶ am 1 : t + `` sgf ´ in # + dª him 1 fttffcf ªª lt ; - ttcsct w h - lt ; ? ¶ wchiw ? ª ** : v. * | ------- 3 ` i. + t j. let 1h ici ** '' . , ^ , m figure 10.8 a two-dimensional overview created using a kohonen feature map learning-algorithm on web-pages having to do with the topic entertainment [163] . began with the kohonen-map visualization , 11 out of 15 found an interesting page within ten minutes . eight of these were able to find the same page using yahoo! . of the subjects who started with yahoo! , 14 out of 16 were able to find interesting home-pages . however , only two of the 14 were able to find the page in the graphical map display ! this is strong evidence against the navigability of the display and certainly suggests that the simple label view provided by yahoo! is more useful . however , the map display may be more useful if the system is modified to tightly integrate querying with browsing . the subjects did prefer some aspects of the map representation . in particular , some liked the ease of being able to jump from one area to another without having to back up as is required in yahoo! , and some liked the fact that the maps have varying levels of granularity . the subjects disliked several aspects of the display . the experimenters found that some subjects expressed a desire for a visible hierarchical organization , others wanted an ability to zoom in on a sub-area to get more detail , and some users disliked having to look through the entire map to find a theme , desiring an alphabetical ordering instead . many found the single-term labels to be misleading , in part because they were ambiguous (one region called ` bill * was thought to correspond to a person 's name rather than count ing money) . the authors concluded that tills interface is more appropriate for casual browsing than for search . in general , unsupervised thematic overviews are perhaps must useful for giving users a `` gist ' of the kinds of information that can be 276 user-interfaces and visualization found within the document collection , but generally have not been shown to be helpful for use in the information-access process . co-citation clustering for overviews citation-analysis has long been recognized as a way to show an overview of the contents of a collection [812] . the main idea is to determine ` centrally-located ' documents based on co-citation patterns . there are different ways to determine citation-patterns : one method is to measure how often two articles are cited together by a third . another alternative is to pair articles that cite the same third article . in both cases the assumption is that the paired articles share some commonalities . after a matrix of co-citations is built , documents are clustered based on the similarity of their co-citation patterns . the resulting clusters are interpreted to indicate dominant themes within the collection . clustering can focus on the authors of the documents rather than the contents , to attempt to identify central authors within a field . this idea has recently been implemented using web-based documents in the referral web-project [432] . the idea has also been applied to web-pages , using web link structure to identify major topical themes among web-pages [485 , 639] . a similar idea , but computed a different way , is used to explicitly identify pages that act as good starting-points for particular topics (called `` authority pages ' by kleinberg [444]) .
