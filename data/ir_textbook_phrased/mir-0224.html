11.2.2 the multos data-model multos (kiultimedia office server) is a multimedia-document ^ server with advanced document-retrieval capabilities , developed in the context of an esprit project in the area of office-systems [759] . multos is based on a client/server-architecture . three different types of document servers are supported : current servers ^ dynamic servers , and archive servers , which differ in storage-capacity and document-retrieval speed . such servers support filing and retrieval of multimedia objects based on document-collections , document types , document attributes , document-text , and images . | as multos deals with office services , in the following we use the words object and document agt ; , svnonvnious . 332 multimedia-ir : models and languages the multos data-model allows the representation of high level concepts present in the documents contained in the database , the grouping of documents into classes of documents having similar-content and structure , and the expression of conditions on free-text . each document is described by a logical-structure , a layout structure , and a conceptual-structure . the logical-structure determines arrangements of logical document components (e.g. , title , introduction , chapter , section , etc.) . the layout structure deals with the layout of the document content and it contains components such as pages , frames , etc. . the conceptual-structure allows a semantic-oriented description of the document content as opposed to the syntax-oriented description provided by the logical and layout structure . the conceptual-structure has been added to provide support for document-retrieval by content . multos provides a formal-model , based on a data structuring tool available in semantic-data-models , to define the document conceptual-structure . the logical and layout structures are defined according to the oda document-representation [398] . documents having similar conceptual-structures are grouped into conceptual types . in order to handle types in an effective manner , conceptual types are maintained in a hierarchy of generalization , where a subtype inherits from its supertypes the conceptual-structure and can then refine it . types can be strong or weak . a strong type completely specifies the structure of its instances . a weak type , on the other hand , partially specifies the structure of its instances . moreover , components of unspecified type (called spring component-types) can appear in a document definition . example 1 the conceptual-structure of the type generic . letter is shown in figure 11.1 . the node letter_body is a spring conceptual component . the complete conceptual-structure in figure 11.2 corresponds to the type businessjproductjletter . this type has been obtained from generic . letter by specialization of letter jbody into a complex conceptual component , defined as an aggregation of five conceptual components . according to the conceptual-model the document ^ pebusiness_prodnct_letter is linked to the document type genericxetter by an kis-a ' relationship . in this example , the ijt ' symbol attached to the receiver component means that it is multivalued . notice also that the name and the address appear in two subtrees having as roots the conceptual components receiver and sender , respectively . for document-retrieval , conceptual types play the role of the database-schema which enables the use of efficient access structures . moreover , conceptual types are the basis for formulating queries at an abstract level . multos also provides a sophisticated approach to deal with image-data . first , an image-analysis process is performed , consisting of two phases : low level image-analysis and high level image-analysis . during the low level image-analysis phase , the basic objects composing a given image and their relative positions are identified . the high level image-analysis phase deals with image-interpretation according to the dempster-shaffer theory-of-evidence [60 , 312 ; . data-modeling 333 document place date receiver + sender-name address name street city country street city country figure 11.1 conceptual-structure of the type generic_letter . document ^ - ó -- ^ place date receiver + lender name address name address street city country street city country letterjbody companyjlogo image productjpresentation \ i / texl product_description text signature product_cost text figure 11.2 complete conceptual-structure of the type business-product - letter . at the end of the image-analysis process , images are described in terms of the objects recognized , with associated belief and plausibility values , and the classes to which they belong . the information is then exploited in image-access . image-access information is stored in an image header , associated with the image file . access structures are then built for a fast access to image headers . two types of index are constructed : ï object-index . for each object a list is maintained . each element of the lists is a pair (bi , imh) , where imh is a pointer to the header of the image containing the object , and bi is the associated belief interval , representing the probability that the image considered really contains the object . ï cluster index . for each image class , a list of pairs (mfjmh) is maintained . imh is a pointer to an image header corresponding to an image with a non-null degree of membership to the class , and mf is the value of the membership-degree . the membership-degree of an image to a given class is computed by comparing the image-interpretation resulting from the analysis phase , with the class description , using techniques analogous to the ones used in text ir systems [698] (see chapter 6) . 334 multimedia-ir : models and languages
