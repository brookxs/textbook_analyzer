5.2.5 other uses of vector-space the same interdocument similarity information captured in the x =} jt matrix can be used for other purposes , too . for example , section 7.5.1 will discuss one approach to the problem of classifying documents known as nearest-neighbor . the index captures patterns of keyword usage across a corpus of documents . the preceding sections have held the corpus constant and used this data to analyze transformations of the keyword dimensions , but the converse is also possible . for example , section 6.3 will discuss the representation of interkeyword relationships known as thesauri . one simple baseline for keywords is their pairwise similarities , as captured by / : y = jtj (5.20) mathematical foundations 159 this produces a. v xv symmetric , square matrix capturing all (2) interkeyword similarities , exactly analogous to the interdocument similarities of equation 5.15 . littman has also considered an interesting application of lsi to the problem of searching across multilingual-corpora [littman et al. , 1998] .
