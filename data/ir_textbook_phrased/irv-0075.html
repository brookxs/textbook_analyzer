bibliographic remarks the basis background reading for this chapter is contained in but a few papers . one approach to probabilistic weighting based on relevance data derives from the work of yu and his collaborators [28,29] . the other is contained in the already frequently cited paper of robertson and sparck jones [1] . unfortunately , both these approaches rely heavily on the assumption of stochastic independence . my own paper [2] and the one of bookstein and kraft [3] are the only ones i know of , which try and construct a model without this assumption . perhaps an earlier paper by negoita should be mentioned here which discusses an attempt to use non-linear decision functions in ir [30] . robertson 's recent progress in documentation on models gives a useful summary of some of the more recent work [31] . according to doyle [32] (p. 267) , maron and kuhns [19] were the first to describe in the open literature the use of association (statistical co-occurrence) of index-terms as a means of enlarging and sharpening the search . however , doyle himself was already working on similar ideas in the late fifties [33] and produced a number of papers on ` associations ' in the early sixties [34,35] . stiles in 1961 [36] , already apparently aware of maron and kuhns work , gave an explicit procedure for using terms co-occurring significantly with search-terms , and not unlike the method based on the dependence tree described in this chapter . he also used the [[chi]] [2] to measure association between index-terms which is mathematically very similar to using the expected mutual-information measure , although the latter is to be preferred when measuring dependence (see goodman and kruskal for a discussion on this point [37]) . stiles was very clear about the usefulness of using associations between index-terms , he saw that through them one was ` able to locate documents relevant to a request even though the document had not been indexed by the term used in the request ' [36] . the model in this chapter also connects with two other ideas in earlier research . one is the idea of inverse-document-frequency weighting already discussed in chapter 2 . the other is the idea of term-clustering . taking the weighting idea first , this in fact goes back to the early paper by edmundson and wyllys [38] , we can write or in words , for any document the probability of relevance is inversely proportional the probability with which it will occur on a random basis . if the p (document) is assumed to be the product of the probabilities of the individual index-terms being either present or absent in the document then after taking logs we have the inverse-document-frequency weighting principle . it assumes that the likelihood p (document/relevance) is constant for all documents . why it is exactly that this principle works so well is not yet clear (but see yu and salton 's recent theoretical paper [39]) . the connection with term-clustering was already made earlier on in the chapter . the spanning-tree can be looked upon as a classification of the index-terms . one of the important consequences of the model described in this chapter is that it lays down precisely how the tree should be used in retrieval . earlier work in this area was rather ad-hoc and did not lead to conclusive results [40] . it should be clear now that the quantitative-model embodies within one theory such diverse topics as term-clustering , early association-analysis , document-frequency weighting , and relevance-weighting .
