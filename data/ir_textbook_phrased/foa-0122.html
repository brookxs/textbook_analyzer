6.2.5 beyond unary about (k) predicates our discussion of foa has generally assumed that we are attempting to find the topic or topics that a document is about . in the language of logic , we can talk about this as applying a unary predicate about (k) . that is , the determination that a document is about keyword k depends 210 finding out about on only one argument , a single keyword . but no piece of writing deals with only a single topic , at least for more than a moment . good writing connects topics . it discusses a relation among those topics . within the paragraph-size textual passages that have been our focus , this relational aspect of language has not been too troubling . but it should make us especially interested in the transitions in topical focus as we move from one paragraph to the next within the same document . passage-level analysis like this was mentioned earlier (cf. section 6.2.2) . as we move to larger documents , an additional source of information is citations from one to another . assuming that we have characterized the topical area of each document independently , an analysis of the citations , placed by one author relating another document to the author 's topic , is an explicit indication of the relationships between these topics . all three levels-of-analysis รณ within-paragraph relations among topics , paragraph-to-paragraph topical progression , and interdocument relations reflected by citations - are some of the clues we can exploit when suggesting potential browsing directions for users trying to foa .
