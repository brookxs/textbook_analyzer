4.4.1 history the first use of n-grams dates to world war ii when it was used by cryptographers . fletcher pratt states that `` with the backing of bigram and trigram tables any cryptographer can dismember an simple substitution cipher '' (pratt-42) . use of bigrams was described by adamson as a method for conflating terms (adamson-74) . it does not follow the normal definition of stemming because what is produced by creating n-grams are word-fragments versus semantically meaningful word stems . it is this characteristic of mapping longer words into shorter n-gram fragments that seems more appropriately classified as a data-structure process than a stemming process . another major use of n-grams (in particular trigrams) is in spelling-error-detection and correction (angeil-83 , mcillroy-82 , morris-75 , peterson-80 , thorelli-62 , wang-77 , and zamora-81) . most approaches look at the statistics on probability of occurrence of n-grams (trigrams in most approaches) in the english-vocabulary and indicate any word that contains non-existent to seldom used 11gram s as a potential erroneous word . damerau specified four categories of spelling errors (damerau-64) as shown in figure 4.8 . using the classification-scheme , zamora showed trigram-analysis provided a viable data-structure for identifying misspellings and transposed characters . this impacts information-systems as a possible basis for identifying potential input-errors for correction as a procedure within the normalization-process (see chapter 1) . frequency of occurrence of ngram patterns also can be used for identifying the language of an item (damashek95 , cohen-95) . data-structure 37 error category single-character insertion single-character deletion single-character substitution transposition of two adjacent characters figure 4.8 categories of spelling errors in information-retrieval , trigrams have been used for text-compression (wisn-87) and to manipulate the length of index-terms (will-79 , schek-78 , schuegraf-76) . d'amore and mah (d'amore-85) used a variety of different 11gram s as index elements for inverted-file systems they implemented - they have also been the core data structure to encode profiles for the logicon lmds system (yochum-95) used for selective-dissemination-of-information . for retrospective search , the acquaintance system uses n-grams to store the searchable document file (damashek-95 , huffman-95) for retrospective search of large textual-databases .
