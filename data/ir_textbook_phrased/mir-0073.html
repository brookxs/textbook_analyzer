4.2.4 natural-language pushing the fuzzy boolean-model even further , the distinction between and and or can be completely blurred , so that a query becomes simply an enumeration of words and context queries . all the documents matching a portion of the user-query are retrieved . higher ranking is assigned to those documents matching more parts of the query . the negation can be handled by letting the user express t notice that the same problem arises in the relational-calculus , which is shown similar to the relational-algebra only when `` unsafe ' expressions are avoided . unsafe expressions are those that make direct or indirect reference to a universe of elements , as not does . 104 query-languages that some words are not desired , so that the documents containing them are penalized in the ranking computation . a threshold may be selected so that the documents with very low weights are not retrieved . under this scheme we have completely eliminated any reference to boolean-operations and entered into the field of natural-language queries . in fact , one can consider that boolean-queries are a simplified abstraction of natural-language queries . a number of new issues arise once this model is used , especially those related to the proper way to rank an element with respect to a query . the search criterion can be re-expressed using a different model , where documents and queries are considered just as a vector of ` term-weights ' (with one coordinate per interesting keyword or even per existing text word) and queries are considered in exactly the same way (context queries are not considered in this case) . therefore , the query is now internally converted into a vector of term-weights and the aim is to retrieve all the vectors (documents) which are close to the query (where closeness has to be defined in the model) . this allows many interesting possibilities , for instance a complete document can be used as a query (since it is also a vector) , which naturally leads to the use of relevance-feedback techniques (i.e. , the user can select a document from the result and submit it as a new query to retrieve documents similar to the selected one) . the algorithms for this model are totally different from those based on searching patterns (it is even possible that not every text word needs to be searched but only a small set of hopefully representative keywords extracted from each document) . natural-language-querying is also covered in chapter 14 .
