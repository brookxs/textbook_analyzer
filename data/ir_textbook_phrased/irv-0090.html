theorem suppose lt ; r x p , gt ; = gt ; is an additive conjoint structure , then there exist functions , [[phi]] 1 from r , and [[phi]] 2 from p into the real numbers such that , for all r , r ' [[propersubset]] r and p , p ' [[propersubset]] p : (r , p) gt ; = (r ' , p ') lt ; = gt ; [[phi]] 1 (r) + [[phi]] 2 (p) gt ; = [[phi]] 1 (r ') + [[phi]] 2 (p ') if [[phi]] i ['] are two other functions with the same property , then there exist constants [[theta]] gt ; 0 , [[gamma]] 1 , and [[gamma]] 2 such that [[phi]] 1 ['] = [[theta]] [[phi]] 1 + [[gamma]] 1 [[phi]] 2 ['] = [[theta]] [[phi]] 2 + [[gamma]] 2 the proof of this theorem may be found in krantz et al. [15] . let us stop and take stock of this situation . so far we have discussed the properties of an additive conjoint structure and justified its use for the measurement of effectiveness based on precision-and-recall . we have also shown that an additively independent representation (unique up to a linear transformation) exists for this kind of relational-structure . the explicit form of [[phi]] i has been left unspecified . to determine the form of [[phi]] i we need to introduce some extrinsic considerations . although the representation f = [[phi]] 1 + [[phi]] 2 , this is not the most convenient form for expressing the further conditions we require of f , nor for its interpretation . so , in spite of the fact that we are seeking an additively independent representation we consider conditions on a general f . it will turn out that the f which is appropriate can be simply transformed into an additive representation . the transformation is f (f) = - (f - 1) [-1] which is strictly monotonically increasing in the range 0 lt ; = f lt ; = 1 , which is the range of interest . in any case , when measuring retrieval-effectiveness any strictly monotone transformation of the measure will do just as well .
