efficient scoring-and-ranking we begin by recapping the algorithm of figure 6.14 . for a query such as jealous gossip , two observations are immediate : the unit vector has only two non-zero components . in the absence of any weighting for query terms , these non-zero components are equal - in this case , both equal 0.707 . for the purpose of ranking the documents matching this query , we are really interested in the relative (rather than absolute) scores of the documents in the collection . to this end , it suffices to compute the cosine-similarity from each document unit vector to (in which all non-zero components of the query-vector are set to 1) , rather than to the unit vector . for any two documents (34) 6.14 7.1 6.3.3 figure 7.1 : a faster algorithm for vector-space scores . given these scores , the final step before presenting results to a user is to pick out the highest-scoring documents . while one could sort the complete set of scores , a better approach is to use a heap to retrieve only the top documents in order . where is the number of documents with non-zero cosine scores , constructing such a heap can be performed in comparison steps , following which each of the highest scoring documents can be `` read off '' the heap with comparison steps . subsections inexact top k document-retrieval index elimination champion lists static quality scores and ordering impact ordering cluster pruning
