2.2.3 highlighting another display aid is an indication of why an item was selected . this indication , frequently highlighting , lets the user quickly focus on the potentially relevant parts of the text to scan for item relevance . different strengths of highlighting indicates how strongly the highlighted word participated in the selection of the item . most systems allow the display of an item to begin with the first highlight within the item and allow subsequent jumping to the next highlight . another capability , which is gaining strong acceptance , is for the system to determine the passage in the document most relevant to the query and position the browse to start at that passage . the dcars system that acts as a user frontend to the retrievalware search-system allows the user to browse an item in the order of the paragraphs or individual words that contributed most to the rank value associated with the item . highlighting has always been useful in boolean systems to indicate the cause of the retrieval this is because of the direct-mapping between the terms in the search and the terms in the item . using natural-language-processing , automatic expansion of terms via thesauri , and the similarity ranking-algorithms information-retrieval-system capabilities 41 discussed in detail later in this book , highlighting loses some of its value the terms being highlighted that caused a particular item to be returned may not have direct or obvious mapping to any of the search-terms entered . this causes frustration by the user trying to guess why a particular item was retrieved and how to use that information in reformulating the search statement to make it more exact . in a ranking-system different terms can contribute to different degrees to the decision to retrieve an item . the highlighting may vary by introducing colors and intensities to indicate the relative-importance of a particular word in the item in the decision to retrieve the item . information-visualization appears to be a better display process to assist in helping the user formulate his query than highlights in items .
