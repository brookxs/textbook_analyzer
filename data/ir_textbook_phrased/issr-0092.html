6.2.2.3 one pass assignments this technique has the minimum overhead in that only one pass of all of the terms is used to assign terms to classes . the first term is assigned to the first class . each additional term is compared to the centroids of the existing classes . a threshold is chosen . if the item is greater than the threshold , it is assigned to the class with the highest similarity . a new centroid has to be calculated for the modified class . if the similarity to all of the existing centroids is less than the threshold , the term is the first item in a new class . this process continues until all items are assigned to classes . using the system defined in figure 6.3 , with a threshold of 10 the following classes would be generated : class 1 = term 1 , term 3 , term 4 class 2 = term 2 , term 6 , term 8 154 chapter 6 class 3 = term 5 class 4 = term 7 note : the centroid values used during the one-pass process : class 1 (termi , term3) = 0 , 7/2 , 3/2 , 0 , 4/2 classl (terml , term3 , term4) = 0 , 10/3 , 3/3 , 3/3 , 7/3 class2 (term2 , term6) = 6/2 , 3/2 , 0/2 , 1/2 , 6/2 although this process has minimal computation on the order of o (n) , it does not produce optimum clustered classes . the different classes can be produced if the order in which the items are analyzed changes . items that would have been in the same cluster could appear in different clusters due to the averaging nature of centroids .
