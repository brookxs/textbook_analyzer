12.6 automatic-feature-extraction gemini is useful for any setting that we can extract features from . in fact , algorithms for automatic-feature-extraction methods exist , like the ` multidimentrends and research-issues 361 2000 total ti cputi cpu-time for na ne - gemini ------ me-gemini ó - - we sequential ive sequential 0000 8000 6000 4000 ___ ------ óó -------------------------- ' _ ------ 0 figure 12.9 response-time vs. selectivity , for the sequential (` naive ') retrieval and for gemini . sional scaling ' (mds) and ` fastmap . ' extracting features not only facilitates the use of off-the-shelf spatial-access-methods , but it also allows for visual-data-mining : we can plot a 2d or 3d projection of the data-set , and inspect it for clusters , correlations , and other patterns . figure 12.10 shows the results of fastmap on 35 documents of seven classes , after deriving k = 3 features/dimensions . the classes include basketball reports (` bbr ') , abstracts of computer-science technical reports (cabs5) , cooking-recipes (` rec ') , and so on . the distance-function was a decreasing function of the cosine-similarity . the figure shows the 3d scatter-plot , (a) in its entirety and (b) after zooming into the center , to highlight the clustering abilities of fastmap . notice that the seven classes are separated well , in only k = 3 dimensions .
