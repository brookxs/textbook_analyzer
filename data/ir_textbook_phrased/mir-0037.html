2.7.1 generalized vector-space-model as already discussed , the three classic models assume independence of index-terms . for the vector-model , this assumption is normally interpreted as follows . definition let ki be a vector associated with the index term kz . independence of index-terms in the vector-model implies thai the set of vectors {k \ , k2 , kt) is linearly independent and forms a basis for the subspace of interest . the dimension of this space is the number t of index-terms in the collection . frequently , independence among index-terms is interpreted in a more restrictive sense to mean pairwise orthogonality among the index term vectors i.e. , to mean that for each pair of index term vectors k % and k3 we have ki ïkj = 0 . in 1985 , however , wong , ziarko , and wong [832] proposed an interpretation in which the index term vectors are assumed linearly independent but are not pairwise orthogonal . such interpretation leads to the generalized vector-space-model which we now discuss . 42 modeling in the generalized vector-space-model , two index term vectors might be non-orthogonal . this means that index term vectors are not seen as the orthogonal vectors which compose the basis of the space . instead , they are themselves composed of smaller components which are derived from the particular collection at hand as follows . definition given the set {k \ , k2 , ... , kt} of index-terms in a collection , as before , let wij be the weight associated with the term-document pair [fc $ , dj] . if the wii3 weights are all binary then all possible patterns of term-co-occurrence (inside documents) can be represented by a set of2t minterms given by mi = (0,0 , ... , 0) , rn2 = (1,0 , . . . ,0) 7 ... , m2t = (1,1 , . . . ,1) . let gi (rrij) return the weight {0,1} of the index term kz in the minterm nrij . thus , the minterm mi (for which gi (mi) = 0 , for all i) points to the documents containing none of the index-terms . the minterm m2 (for which gi (m2) = 1 , for i = l , and # 2 (7712) = 0 , for i gt ; 1) points to the documents containing solely the index term k ± . further , the minterm m2t points to the documents containing all the index-terms . the central idea in the generalized vector-space-model is to introduce a set of pairwise orthogonal vectors rhi associated with the set of minterms and to adopt this set of vectors as the basis for the subspace of interest . definition let us define the following set of rhi vectors fax = (1,0 , ... ,0,0) m2 = (0,1 , ... ,0,0) rh2t = (0,0 , ... ,0,1) where each vector rhi is associated with the respective minterm m * . notice that rhi ï fh3 = 0 for all i ¶ = # j and thus the set of rhi vectors is , by definition , pairwise orthogonal . this set of rhi vectors is then taken as the orthonormal basis for the generalized vector-space-model . pairwise orthogonality among the rhi vectors does not imply independence among the index-terms . on the contrary , index-terms are now correlated by the rhi vectors . for instance , the vector rh ^ is associated with the minterm m4 = (l , l , ... ,0) which points to the documents in the collection containing the index-terms fcx , k2 , and no others . if such documents do exist in the collection under consideration then we say that the minterm m4 is active and that a dependence between the index-terms a `` i and ^ 2 is induced . if we consider this point more carefully , we notice that the generalized vector-model adopts as a basic foundation the idea that co-occurrence of index-terms inside documents in the collection induces dependencies among these index-terms . since this is an idea which was introduced many years before the generalized vector-space alternative algebraic-models 43 model itself , novelty is not granted . instead , the main contribution of the model is the establishment of a formal-framework in which dependencies among index-terms (induced by co-occurrence patterns inside documents) can be nicely represented . the usage of index term dependencies to improve retrieval-performance continues to be a controversial issue . in fact , despite the introduction in the 1980s of more effective algorithms for incorporating term dependencies (see chapter 5) , there is no consensus that incorporation of term dependencies in the model yields effective improvement with general collections . thus , it is not clear that the framework of the generalized vector-model provides a clear advantage in practical situations . further , the generalized vector-model is more complex and computationally more expensive than the classic vector-model . to determine the index term vector ki associated with the index term ki , we simply sum up the vectors for all minterms mr in which the term kz is in state 1 and normalize . thus , ft , = y z - ^ vr , d3 | 9i (dj) = 9i (mr) for all i these equations provide a general definition for the index term vector ki in terms of the mr vectors . the term vector ki collects all the mr vectors in which the index term ki is in state 1 . for each rht vector , a correlation factor a , r is defined . such a correlation factor sums up the weights wij associated with the index term ki and each document dj whose term occurrence pattern coincides exactly with that of the minterm mr. thus , a minterm is of interest (in which case it is said to be active) only if there is at least one document in the collection which matches its term occurrence pattern . this implies that no more than n minterms can be active , where n is the number of documents in the collection . therefore , the ranking computation does not depend on an exponential number of minterms as equation 2.5 seems to suggest . notice that the internal product ki ï kj can now be used to quantify a degree of correlation between the index-terms ki and kj . for instance , ki ï kj ó - y # i , r ^ ^ j , r vr i 0t (mr) = l a g3 {mr) - l which , as later discussed in chapter 5 , is a good technique for quantifying index term correlations . in the classic vector-model , a document dj and a user-query q are expressed by d3 = j2viwij ^ anc * % = ylviwi , g ^ i , respectively . in the generalized vector-space-model , these representations can be directly translated to the space of minterm vectors mr by applying equation 2.5 . the resultant dj and q vectors 44 modeling are then used for computing the ranking through a standard cosine-similarity function . the ranking that results from the generalized vector-space-model combines the standard wij term-document weights with the correlation factors air-however , since the usage of term-term correlations does not necessarily yield improved retrieval-performance , it is not clear in which situations the generalized model outperforms the classic vector-model . furthermore , the cost of computing the ranking in the generalized model can be fairly high with large-collections because , in this case , the number of active minterms (i.e. , those which have to be considered for computing the ki vectors) might be proportional to the number of documents in the collection . despite these drawbacks , the generalized vector-model does introduce new ideas which are of importance from a theoretical point-of-view .
