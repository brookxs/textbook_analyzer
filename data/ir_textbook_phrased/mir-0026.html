2.4 a formal characterization of ir-models we have argued that the fundamental premises which form the basis for a ranking-algorithm determine the ir model . throughout this chapter , we will discuss different sets of such premises . however , before doing so , we should state clearly what exactly an ir model is . our characterization is as follows . definition an information-retrieval-model is a quadruple [d , q , t , r {qi , dj) j where (1) d is a set composed of logical-views (or representations) for the documents in the collection . (2) q is a set composed of logical-views (or representations) for the user-information-needs . such representations are called queries . (3) tis a framework for modeling document representations , queries , and their relationships . (4) r {qi , dj) is a ranking-function which associates a real number with a query qt Ã¤ q and a document-representation dj g d . such ranking defines an ordering among the documents with regard to the query qi . to build a model , we think first of representations for the documents and for the user-information need . given these representations , we then conceive the framework in which they can be modeled . this framework should also provide the intuition for constructing a ranking-function . for instance , for the classic boolean-model , the framework is composed of sets of documents and the standard operations on sets . for the classic vector-model , the framework is composed of a 24 modeling t-dimensional vectorial space and standard linear-algebra operations on vectors . for the classic probabilistic-model , the framework is composed of sets , standard probability operations , and the bayes ' theorem . in the remainder of this chapter , we discuss the various ir-models shown in figure 2.1 . throughout the discussion , we do not explicitly instantiate the components d , q , t , and r (qu dj) of each model . such components should be quite clear from the discussion and can be easily inferred .
