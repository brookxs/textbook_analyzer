7.2.2 elimination of stopwords as discussed in chapter 2 , words which are too frequent among the documents in the collection are not good discriminators . in fact , a word which occurs in 80 % of the documents in the collection is useless for purposes of retrieval . such words are frequently referred to as stopwords and are normally filtered out as potential index-terms . articles , prepositions , and conjunctions are natural candidates for a list of stopwords . elimination of stopwords has an additional important benefit . it reduces the size of the indexing-structure considerably . in fact , it is typical to obtain a compression in the size of the indexing-structure (for instance , in the size of an inverted list , see chapter 8) of 40 % or more solely with the elimination of stopwords . since stopword elimination also provides for compression of the indexing-structure , the list of stopwords might be extended to include words other than articles , prepositions , and conjunctions . for instance , some verbs , adverbs , and adjectives could be treated as stopwords . in [275] . a list of 425 stopwords is illustrated . programs in c for lexical-analysis are also provided . 168 text operations despite these benefits , elimination of stopwords might reduce recall . for instance , consider a user who is looking for documents containing the phrase ho be or not to be. : elimination of stopwords might leave only the term be making it almost impossible to properly recognize the documents which contain the phrase specified . this is one additional reason for the adoption of a full text index (i.e. , insert all words in the collection into the inverted-file) by some web-search-engines .
