9.3 hardware text-search systems-software text-search is applicable to many circumstances but has encountered restrictions on the ability to handle many search-terms simultaneously against the same text and limits due to i/o speeds . one approach that off loaded the resource intensive searching from the main processors was to have a specialized-hardware machine to perform the searches and pass the results to the main computer which supported the user-interface and retrieval of hits . since the searcher is hardware based , scalability is achieved by increasing the number of hardware search devices . the only limit on speed is the time it takes to flow the text off of secondary-storage (i.e. , disk-drives) to the searchers . by having one search machine per disk , the maximum time it takes to search a database of any size will be the time to search one disk . in some systems , the disks were formated to optimize the data-flow off of the drives . another major advantage of using a hardware text-search unit is in the elimination of the index that represents the document database . typically the indexes are 70 % the size of the actual items . 234 chapter 9 other advantages are that new items can be searched as soon as received by the system rather than waiting for the index to be created and the search speed is deterministic . even though it may be slower than using an index , the predictability of how long it will take to stream the data provides the user with an exact search-time . as hits as discovered they can immediately be made available to the user versus waiting for the total search to complete as in index searches . figure 9.1 represents hardware as well as software text-search solutions . the algrithmetic part of the system is focused on the term detector . there has been three approaches to implementing term detectors : parallel comparators orassociative memory , a cellular-structure , and a universal finite-state-automata (hollar-79) . when the term cmparator is implemented with parallel comparators , each term in the query is assgned to an individual comparison element and input data are serially streamed into the detector . when a match occurs , the term comparator informs the external query resolver (usually in the main computer) by setting status flags . in some systems , some of the boolean-logic between terms is resolved in the term detector hardware (e.g. , in the gescan machine) . instead of using specially designed comparators specialized-hardware that interfaces with computers and is used to search secondary-storage devices was developed from the early 1970s with the most recent product being the parasel searcher (previously the fast data finder) . the need for this hardware was driven by the limits in computer-resources . the typical hardware configuration is shown in figure 9.9 in the dashed box . the speed of search is then based on the speed of the i/o . 1 j gt ;

matching query terms to input-text and boolean-logic resolution . term matching is performed by a series of character cells each containing one character of the query . a string of character cells is implemented on the same lsi chip and the chips can be connected in series for longer strings . when a word or phrase of the query is matched , a signal is sent query resolvers term matchers query processors 1 q q-q-q p p-p-p ----- - p -- - g n p-q-q -- - q figure 9.10 gescan text array-processor to the resolution sub-process on the lsi chip . the resolution chip is responsible for resolving the boolean-logic between terms and proximity requirements . if the item satisfies the query , the information is transmitted to the users computer . the 236 chapter 9 text array-processor uses these chips in a matrix arrangement as shown in figure 9.10 . each row of the-matrix is a query-processor in which the first chip performs the query resolution while the remaining chips match query terms . the maximum number of characters in a query is restricted by the length of a row while the number of rows limit the number of simultaneous queries that can be processed . another approach for hardware searchers is to augment disc storage . the augmentation is a generalized associative-search element placed between the read and write heads on the disk . the content addressable segment sequential memory (cassm) system (roberts-78) uses these search elements in parallel to obtain structured-data from a database . the cassm system was developed at the university-of-florida as a general purpose search device (copeiand-73) . it can be used to perform string-searching across the database . another special search machine is the relational associative-processor (rap) developed at the university of toronto (schuster-79) . like cassm performs search across a secondary-storage device using a series of cells comparing data in parallel . the fast data finder (fdf) is the most recent specialized-hardware text-search unit still in use in many organizations . it was developed to search text and has been used to search english and foreign languages . the early fast data finders consisted of an array of programmable text-processing cells connected in series forming a pipeline hardware search processor (mettler-93) . the cells are implemented using a vsli chip . in the trec tests each chip contained 24 processor cells with a typical system containing 3600 cells (the fdf-3 has a rack mount configuration with 10,800 cells) . each cell will be a comparator for a single-character limiting the total number of characters in a query to the nuber of cells . the cells are interconnected with an 8-bit data-path and approximately 20-bit control path . the text to be searched passes through each cell in a pipeline fashion until the complete database has been searched . as data is analyzed at each cell , the 20 control lines states are modified dependning upon their current-state and the results from the comparator . an example of a fast data finder system is shown in figure 9.11 . a cell is composed of both a register cell (rs) and a comparator (cs) . the input from the document database is controlled and buffered by the microprocess/memory and feed through the comapators . the search characters are stored in the registers . the connection between the registers reflect the control lines that are also passing state-information . groups of cells are used to detect query terms , along with logic between the terms , by appropriate programming of the control lines . when a pattern-match is detected , a hit is passed to the internal microprocessor that passes it back to the host processor , allowing immediate access by the user to the hit item . the functions supported by the fast data finder are : boolean-logic including negation proximity on an arbitrary pattern variable-length `` do n't cares '' term counting and thresholds fuzzy-matching text-search algorithms 237 term-weights numeric ranges the expense and requirement that the complete database be streamed to complete a search has discuraged general use of hardware text-search units . paracel , who now markets the fast data finder , is modifying its application to the area of genetic-analysis . comparing sequence homology (linear sequence of genes as another chromosone) to known familys of proteins can provide insights about functions of newly sequenced genes . parcel has combined the search capability of the fdf with their biology tool kit (btk) . the major function that is applied is the fuzzy match capability that can be applied to chromosones . searches can be applied to dna against dna , protein against protein , or dna against protein c1 - * c2 - * c3 j r1 ó + * r2 ó + gt ;
