review of basic probability-theory we hope that the reader has seen a little basic probability-theory previously . we will give a very quick review ; some references for further reading appear at the end of the chapter . a variable represents an event (a subset of the space of possible outcomes) . equivalently , we can represent the subset via a random-variable , which is a function from outcomes to real numbers ; the subset is the domain over which the random-variable has a particular value . often we will not know with certainty whether an event is true in the world . we can ask the probability of the event . for two events and , the joint event of both events occurring is described by the joint-probability . the conditional-probability expresses the probability of event given that event occurred . the fundamental relationship between joint and conditional-probabilities is given by the chain-rule : (56) writing for the complement of an event , we similarly have : (57) partition rule (58) from these we can derive bayes ' rule for inverting conditional-probabilities : (59) prior-probability posterior-probability likelihood finally , it is often useful to talk about the odds of an event , which provide a kind of multiplier for how probabilities change : (60)
