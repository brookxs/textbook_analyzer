15.3 architectural issues since digital librarys are part of the global information infrastructure , many discussions of them focus on high level architectural issues [611] . on the one hand , digital librarys can be just part of the ` middleware ' of the-internet , providing various services that can be embedded in other task-support systems . in this regard they can be treated separately from their content , allowing development to proceed without entanglement in problems of economics , censorship , or other social concerns . on the other hand , digital librarys can be independent systems and so must have an architecture of their own in order to be built . thus , many current digital librarys are cobbled together from pre-existing pieces , such as search-engines , web-browsers , database-management-systems , and tools for handling multimedia-documents . from either perspective , it is helpful to extend definitions into more operational forms that can lead to specification of protocols when various components are involved . such has been one of the goals of efforts at the corporation for national research initiatives (cnri) , as illustrated in figure 15.1 . thus , kahn and wilensky proposed one important framework [426] . anns et at have extended this work into digital-library-architectures [28 , 31] . one element is a-digital object , which has content (bits) and a handle (a type of name or identifier) [189] , and also may have properties , a signature , and a log of transactions that involve it . digital-objects have associated metadata , that can be managed in sets [472] . repositories of digital-objects can provide security and can respond to a repository access protocol [30] . significant progress has been niade toward adopting a scheme of digital-object identifiers , first illustrated by the online handles are used to access digital-objects architectural issues 419 handle-system repository handle __ (metadata) signature - (optional) signature ó (optional) 1 transaction log digital-object digital-object handle (metadata) x properties j ----- content ógt ; (bits) 222 wm ¶ i signature ----- * (optional) ó _ ó 1 transaction log handle digital-object content - (bits) signature ó (optional) j transacti ion log i handle digital-object signature ó (optional) 1 transaction log digital-object security provided by repository figure 15.1 digital-objects , handles , and repositories (adapted from [428 , 28 , 31 , 30]) . 420 digital-libraries computer library center , inc. (oclcs) persistent urls (purls) [654] , and agreement seems likely on a standard for digital-object identifiers (dois) [396] . other implementation efforts have focused more on services [473] and security [475] . a useful testbed for this work has been computer-science reports [210] , most recently through the networked computer science technical reference library , ncstrl [471] . two large digital-libraries initiative (digital libraryi) projects have devoted a good deal of attention to architecture , taking radically different approaches . at stanford , the key concern has been interoperability [624] . their ` infobus ' [625] allows a variety of information-resources to be connected through suitable mediators and then used via the shared-bus through diverse interfaces . at the university of michigan , the emphasis has been on agent-technologies [97] . this approach can have a number of classes of entities involved in far-flung distributed-processing . it is still unknown how efficiently an agent-based digital-library can operate or even be built . ultimately , software to use in digital librarys will be selected as a result of comparisons . one basis for such comparisons is the underlying conceptual-model [820] . another basis is the use of metrics , which is the subject of recent efforts towards definition and consensus-building [499] . in addition to metrics traditionally used in ir , dealing with efficiency , effectiveness , and usability , a variety of others must be selected , according to agreed-upon scenarios . also important to understand is the ability of digital librarys to handle a variety of document types (combinations of streams and structures) , to accurately and economically represent their content and relationships (structures) , and to support a range of access approaches and-constraints (scenarios) .
