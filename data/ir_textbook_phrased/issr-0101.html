7.2.3 ranking-algorithms a by-product of use of similarity-measures for selecting hit items is a value that can be used in ranking the output . ranking the output implies ordering the output from most likely items that satisfy the query to least likely items . this reduces the user overhead by allowing the user to display the most likely relevant items first . the original boolean systems returned items ordered by date of entry into the system versus by likelihood of relevance to the user 's search statement . with the inclusion of statistical-similarity techniques into commercial systems and the large number of hits that originate from searching diverse corpora , such as the-internet , ranking has become a common feature of modern systems . a summary of ranking-algorithms from the research-community is found in an article written by belkin and croft (belkin-87) . in most of the commercial systems , heuristic-rules are used to assist in the ranking of items . generally/systems do not want to use factors that require knowledge across the corpus (e.g. , inverse-document-frequency) as a basis for their similarity or ranking-functions because it is too difficult to maintain current values as the database changes and the added complexity has not been shown to significantly improve the overall weighting process . a good example of how a commercial product integrates efficiency with theoretical concepts is the user-search techniques 175 retrievalware system 's approach to queries and ranking (retr1evalware95) . retrievalware first uses indexes (inversion lists) to identify potential relevant items . it then applies coarse-grain and fine-grain ranking . the coarse-grain ranking is based on the presence of query terms within items . in the fine-grain ranking , the exact rank of the item is calculated . the coarse-grain ranking is a weighted formula that can be adjusted based on completeness , contextual evidence or variety , and semantic-distance . completeness is the proportion of the number of query terms (or related terms if a query-term is expanded using the retrievalware semantic network/thesaurus) found in the item versus the number in the query . it sets an upper limit on the rank value for the item . if weights are assigned to query terms , the weights are factored into the value . contextual evidence occurs when related words from the semantic network are also in the item . thus if the user has indicated that the query-term `` charge '' has the context of `` paying for an object '' then finding words such as `` buy , '' `` purchase , '' `` debt '' suggests that the term `` charge '' in the item has the meaning the user desires and that more weight should be placed in ranking the item . semantic-distance evaluates how close the additional words are to the query-term . synonyms add additional weight ; antonyms decrease weight . the coarse-grain process provides an initial rank to the item based upon existence of words within the item . since physical-proximity is not considered in coarse-grain ranking , the ranking value can be easily calculated . fine-grain ranking considers the physical location of query terms and related words using factors of proximity in addition to the other three factors in coarse-grain evaluation . if the related terms and query terms occur in close proximity (same sentence or paragraph) the item is judged more relevant . a factor is calculated that maximizes at adjacency and decreases as the physical separation increases . if the query terms are widely distributed throughout a long item , it is possible for the item to have a fine-grain rank of zero even though it contains the query terms . although ranking creates a ranking score , most systems try to use other ways of indicating the rank value to the user as hit lists are displayed . the scores have a tendency to be misleading and confusing to the user . the differences between the values may be very close or very-large . it has been found to be better to indicate the general relevance of items than to be over specific (see chapter s) .
