2.2 a taxonomy of information-retrieval-models the three classic models in information-retrieval are called boolean , vector , and probabilistic . in the boolean-model , documents and queries are represented as sets of index-terms . thus , as suggested in [327] , we say that the model is set theoretic . in the vector-model , documents and queries are represented as vectors in a t-dimensional space . thus , we say that the model is algebraic . in the probabilistic-model , the framework for modeling document and query representations is based on probability-theory . thus , as the name indicates , we say that the model is probabilistic . over the years , alternative modeling-paradigms for each type of classic model (i.e. , set theoretic , algebraic , and probabilistic) have been proposed . regarding alternative set theoretic models , we distinguish the fuzzy and the extended boolean models . regarding alternative algebraic-models , we distinguish the generalized vector , the latent-semantic-indexing , and the neural-network models . regarding alternative probabilistic-models , we distinguish the inference-network and the belief network-models . figure 2.1 illustrates a taxonomy of these information-retrieval-models . besides references to the text-content , the model might also allow references to the structure normally present in written text . in this case , we say that we have a structured model . we distinguish two models for structured-text retrieval namely , the non-overlapping lists model and the proximal nodes model . as discussed in chapter 1 , the user task might be one of browsing (instead of retrieval) . in figure 2.1 , we distinguish three models for browsing namely , flat , structure guided , and hypertext . the organization of this chapter follows the taxonomy of information-retrieval-models depicted in the figure.we first discuss the three classic models . second , we discuss the alternative models for each type of classic model . third , we cover structured-text retrieval-models . at the end , we discuss models for browsing . we emphasize that the ir model (boolean , vector , probabilistic , etc.) , the logical view of the documents (full text , set of index-terms , etc.) , and the user task (retrieval , browsing) are orthogonal aspects of a retrieval-system as detailed in chapter 1 . thus , despite the fact that some models are more appropriate for a certain user task than for another , the same ir model can be used with distinct document logical views to perform different user-tasks . figure 2.2 illustrates the retrieval-models most frequently associated with each one of six distinct combinations of a document logical view and a user task . retrieval : ad-hoc and filtering 21 retrieval : lt ; adhoc filtering browsing classic models / ------ boolean ^ vector * ~ probabilistic Ã¯ structured models non-6v ^ riappmg tists proximal nodes browsing flat structure guided hypertext set theoretic fuzzy extended boolean algebraic generalized vector lat . semantic-index neural-networks probabilistic-inference network belief network figure 2.1 a taxonomy of information-retrieval-models . logical view of documents u s e r t a s k index-terms full text full text + structure retrieval classic set theoretic algebraic probabilistic classic set theoretic algebraic probabilistic structured browsing flat flat hypertext-structure guided hypertext figure 2.2 retrieval-models most frequently associated with distinct combinations of a document logical view and a user task .
