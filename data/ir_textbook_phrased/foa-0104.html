5.5.2 bayesian inversion if we had worked hard on a particular test-corpus of documents to identify (always with respect to some particular query) which documents were rel and which were not , it would be possible to carefully study which features xt were reliably found in relevant documents and which were not . collecting such statistics for each feature would then allow us to estimate : pr (x \ rel) 170 finding out about the probability of any particular set-of-features x , given that we know it is rel (just which statistics we collect , and how , will be discussed in more detail in section 7.4 as part of a more general classification-task .) the retrieval question requires that we ask the converse : the probability that a document with features x should be considered relevant . this inversion is accomplished via the familiar bayes rule : (5.37 ,
