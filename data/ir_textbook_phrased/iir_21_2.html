pagerank pagerank 6.3 7.2.2 15.4.1 consider a random surfer who begins at a web-page (a node of the-web graph) and executes a random-walk on the-web as follows . at each time step , the surfer proceeds from his current page a to a randomly chosen web-page that a hyperlinks to . figure 21.1 shows the surfer at a node a , out of which there are three hyperlinks to nodes b , c and d ; the surfer proceeds at the next time step to one of these three nodes , with equal probabilities 1/3 . figure 21.1 : the random surfer at node a proceeds with probability 1/3 to each of b , c and d . as the surfer proceeds in this random-walk from node to node , he visits some nodes more often than others ; intuitively , these are nodes with many links coming in from other frequently visited nodes . the idea behind pagerank is that pages visited more often in this walk are more important . what if the current location of the surfer , the node a , has no out-links ? to address this we introduce an additional operation for our random surfer : the teleport operation . in the teleport operation the surfer jumps from a node to any other node in the web-graph . this could happen because he types an address into the url bar of his browser . the destination of a teleport operation is modeled as being chosen uniformly at random from all web-pages . in other words , if is the total number of nodes in the web-graph , the teleport operation takes the surfer to each node with probability . the surfer would also teleport to his present position with probability . in assigning a pagerank score to each node of the-web graph , we use the teleport operation in two ways : (1) when at a node with no out-links , the surfer invokes the teleport operation . (2) at any node that has outgoing links , the surfer invokes the teleport operation with probability and the standard random-walk (follow an out-link chosen uniformly at random as in figure 21.1) with probability , where is a fixed parameter chosen in advance . typically , might be 0.1 . in section 21.2.1 , we will use the theory of markov-chains to argue that when the surfer follows this combined process (random-walk plus teleport) he visits each node of the-web graph a fixed fraction of the time that depends on (1) the structure of the web-graph and (2) the value of . we call this value the pagerank of and will show how to compute this value in section 21.2.2 . subsections markov-chains definition : the pagerank computation topic-specific pagerank
