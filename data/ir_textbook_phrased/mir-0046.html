2.8.6 the impact of bayesian-network models the classic boolean-model is based on a neat formalism but is not very effective for information-retrieval . the classic vector-model provides improved answer sets but lacks a more formal-framework . many attempts have been made in the past to combine the best features of each model . the extended boolean-model and the generalized vector-space-model are two well known examples . these past attempts are grounded in the belief that the combination of selected properties from distinct models is a promising approach towards improved retrieval . bayesian-network models constitute modern variants of probabilistic-reasoning whose major strength (for information-retrieval) is a framework which allows the neat combination of distinct evidential sources to support a relevance-judgement (i.e. , a numerical rank) on a given document . in this regard , belief-networks seem more appropriate than previous approaches and more promising . further , besides allowing the combination of boolean and vector features , a belief network can be naturally extended to incorporate evidential information derived from past user sessions [674] and feedback cycles [332] . the inference-network model has been successfully implemented in the inquery-retrieval-system [122] and compares favorably with other retrieval-systems . however , despite these promises , whether bayesian-networks will become popular and widely used for information-retrieval remains to be seen .
