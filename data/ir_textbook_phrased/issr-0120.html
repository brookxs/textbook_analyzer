10.1 spoken-language audio-retrieval just as a user may wish to search the archives of a large text collection , the ability to search the content of audio sources such as speeches , radio broadcasts , and conversations would be valuable for a range of applications . an assortment of techniques have been developed to support the automated recognition of speech (waibel and lee 1990) . these have applicability for a range of application areas such as speaker-verification , transcription , and command-and-control . for example , jones et al. (1997) report a comparative-evaluation of speech and text-retrieval in the context of the video-mail retrieval (vmr) project . while speech-transcription word-error-rates may be high (as much as 50 % or more depending upon the source , speaker , dictation vs. conversation , environmental factors and so on) , redundancy in the source material helps offset these error-rates and still support effective retrieval . in jones et al. 's speech/text comparative experiments , using standard information-retrieval-evaluation techniques , speaker-dependent techniques retain approximately 95 % of the performance of retrieval of text-transcripts , speaker independent techniques about 75 % . however , system-scalability remains a significant challenge . for example , whereas even the best speech-recognition-systems have on the order of 100,000 words in an electronic lexicon , text lexicons include upwards of 500,0000 vocabulary words . another challenge is the need expend significant time and effort to develop an annotated video-mail corpus to support machine-learning and evaluation . some recent efforts have focused on the automated transcription of broadcast-news . for example , figure 10.1 illustrates bbn 's rough 'n ` ready prototype that aims to provide information-access to spoken-language from audio and video sources (kubala et al. 2000) . rough 'n' ready `` creates a rough summarization of speech that is ready ? for browsing . '' figure 10.1 illustrates a multimedia-information-retrieval 243 january 31 , 1998 sample from abc 's world news tonight in which the left hand column indicates the speaker , the center column shows the translation with highlighted named-entities (i.e. , people , organizations , locations) and the rightmost column lists the topic of discussion . rough 'n' ready 's transcription is created by the byblos√¥ large-vocabulary-speech-recognition system , a continuous-density hidden-markov-model (hmm) system that has been competitively tested in annual formal evaluations for the past 12 years (kubala , f. et al , 1997) . byblos runs at 3 times real-time , uses a 60,000 word-dictionary , and most recently reported word-error-rates of 18.8 % for the broadcast-news-transcription task . ij # fc | lt ; ft vfcw , nlp7 * aol/rumarcte * digital libraryhbn world sews tonight 01/31/98 it 's a strategy to pressure on council making deals and it 's known each day in southern california latest danger from hell . from abc-news world headquarters in mow york january thirty first nineteen ninety ... this is world news tonight saturday here 's elizabeth vargas . good evening and defense secretary william cohens said today that a military strike against a rock would be quota substantial in size and impact but cohen stressed that the strike would not be able to remove saddam hussein from power or eliminate his deadly arsenal the defense secretary also had strong words today for the united-nations security-council abc 's john mcwethy reports . with more american firepower being considered for the persian ; guif defense secretary cohen today issued by are the administration 's toughest criticism of the un security-council without mentioning russia or china buying named cohen took dead aim at their reluctance to get tough with sraq . frankly 1 find it ... incredibly hard to accept the proposition but in the face oi saddam 's actions and that of members of the security-council can not bring themselves to to clear that this is a fundamental or material breach ... of old conduct on his part i think it challenges the credibility of security-council . figure 10.1 . bbn 's rough and ready additional research in broadcast-news processing is addressing multilingual-information-access . for example , gauvain (2000) at limsi reports a north american broadcast-news-transcription-system that performs with a 13.6 % word-error-rate and reports spoken-document-retrieval performance using the sdr '98 trec-7 data . current work is investigating broadcast-transcription of german and french broadcasts . joint research between the tokyo institute of technology and nhk broadcasting (furui et al. 2000) is addressing transcription and topic-extraction from japanese broadcast-news . the focus of furui et al. is on improving processing by modeling filled pauses , performing on-line incremental speaker-adaptation and by using a context-dependent language-model that models readings of words . the language-model includes chinese-characters (kanji) and two kinds of japanese characters (hira-gana and kata-kana) . foreign relations with the united-states inspections united-nations iraq politics and government
