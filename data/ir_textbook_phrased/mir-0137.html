8.2.1 searching the search-algorithm on an inverted-index follows three general steps (some may be absent for specific queries) : ï vocabulary search the words and patterns present in the query are isolated and searched in the vocabulary . notice that phrases and proximity-queries are split into single words . ï retrieval of occurrences the lists of the occurrences of all the words found are retrieved . ï manipulation of occurrences the occurrences are processed to solve phrases , proximity , or boolean-operations . if block addressing is used it may be necessary to directly search the text to find the information missing from the occurrences (e.g. , exact word positions to form phrases) . hence , searching on an inverted-index always starts in the vocabulary . because of this it is a good idea to have it in a separate file . it is possible that this file fits in main-memory even for large text collections . single-word queries can be searched using any suitable data-structure to speed up the search , such as hashing , tries , or b-trees . the first two give o (m) search-cost (independent of the text size) . however , simply storing the words in lexicographical order is cheaper in space and very competitive in performance , since the word can be binary searched at o (logn) cost . prefix and range-queries can also be solved with binary-search , tries , or b-trees , but not with hashing . if the query is formed by single words , then the process ends by delivering the list of occurrences (we may need to make a union of many lists if the pattern mat dies many words) . 196 indexing and searching context queries are more difficult to solve with inverted-indices . each element must be searched separately and a list (in increasing positional order) generated for each one . then , the lists of all elements are traversed in synchronization to find places where all the words appear in sequence (for a phrase) or appear close enough (for proximity) . if one list is much shorter than the others , it may be better to binary-search its elements into the longer lists instead of performing a linear merge . it is possible to prove using zipf s law that this is normally the case . this is important because the most time-demanding operation on inverted-indices is the merging or intersection of the lists of occurrences . if the index stores character positions the phrase-query can not allow the separators to be disregarded , and the proximity has to be defined in terms of character distance . finally , note that if block addressing is used it is necessary to traverse the blocks for these queries , since the position information is needed . it is then better to intersect the lists to obtain the blocks which contain all the searched words and then sequentially search the context query in those blocks as explained in section 8.5 . some care has to be exercised at block boundaries , since they can split a match . this part of the search , if present , is also quite time consuming . using heaps1 and the generalized zipf s laws , it has been demonstrated that the cost of solving queries is sublinear in the text size , even for complex-queries involving list merging . the time-complexity is 0 (na) , where a depends on the query and is close to 0.4 . .0.8 for queries with reasonable selectivity . even if block addressing is used and the blocks have to be traversed , it is possible to select the block-size as an increasing function of n , so that not only does the space requirement keep sublinear but also the amount of text traversed in all useful queries is also sublinear . practical figures show , for instance , that both the space requirement and the amount of text traversed can be close to o (n0 `` 85) . hence , inverted-indices allow us to have sublinear search-time at sublinear space requirements . this is not possible on the other indices . search times on our reference machine for a full inverted-index built on 250 mb of text give the following results : searching a simple word took 0.08 seconds , while searching a phrase took 0.25 to 0.35 seconds (from two to five words) .
