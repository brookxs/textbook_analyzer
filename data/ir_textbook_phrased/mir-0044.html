2.8.4 comparison of bayesian-network models there is a close resemblance between the belief network-model and the inference-network model . however , this resemblance hides important differences between the two models . first , the belief network-model is based on a set-theoretic view 60 modeling of the ir ranking problem and adopts a clearly defined sample space . the inference-network model takes a purely epistemological view of the ir problem which is more difficult to grasp (because , for instance , the sample space is not clearly defined) . second , the belief network-model provides a separation between the document and the query portions of the network which facilitates the modeling of additional evidential sources such as past-queries and past relevance information . third , as a result of this document-query space separation , the belief network-model is able to reproduce any ranking strategy generated by the inference-network model while the converse is not true . to see that the belief network ranking subsumes any ranking generated by an inference-network , compare equations 2.6 and 2.13 . the key distinction is between the terms p (d3 \ k) and p (k \ d3) . for the latter , instantiation of the document node dj separates the index term nodes making them mutually independent . thus , the joint-probability p (k \ d3) can always be computed as the product of the individual probabilities p (kl \ dj) . however , the computation of p (dj \ k) might be non-decomposable in a product of term-based probabilities . as a result , p (d3 \ k) can express any probability-function denned with p {k \ d3) while the converse is not true . one should not infer from the above comparison that the inference-network model is not a good model . on the contrary , it has been shown in the literature that the inference-network model allows top retrieval-performance to be accomplished with general collections . further , it is the retrieval-model used by the inquery-system . the point of the comparison is that , from a theoretical point-of-view , the belief network-model is more general . also , it provides a separation between the document space and the query space which simplifies the modeling task .
