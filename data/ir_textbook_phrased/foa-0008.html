1.3 query-syntax keywords therefore have a special status in ir and as part of the foa process . not only must they be exhaustive enough to capture the entire topical scope reflected by the corpora 's domain of discourse , but they must also be expressive enough to characterize any information-needs the users might have . of course we need not restrict our users to only one of these keywords . it seems quite natural for queries to be composed of two or three , perhaps even dozens , of keywords . recent empirical evidence suggests that many typical queries have only two or three keywords 14 finding out about (cf. section 8.1) , but even this number provides a great combinatorial extension to the basic vocabulary of single keywords . other applications , for example , using a document itself as a query (i.e. , using it as an example : `` give me more like this '') , can generate queries with hundreds of keywords . regardless of size , queries defined only as sets of keywords will be called simple queries . many web-search-engines support only simple queries . often , however , the search-engines also provide more advanced-interfaces , including operators in the query-language . perhaps , because you have previously been warped by an exposure to computer-science :-rrb- , you think that sets of keywords might be especially useful if joined by boolean-operators . for example , if we have one set of documents about neural-networks and another set of documents about speech-recognition , we can expect the query : neural-networks and speech-recognition to correspond to the intersection of these two sets , while neural-networks or speech-recognition would correspond to their union . the boolean not operator is a bit more of a problem . if users say they want things that are not about neural-networks , they are in fact referring to the vast majority of the corpus . that is , not is more appropriately considered a binary , subtraction operator . to make this distinction explicit we will call it but_not . there are other syntactic operators that are often included in a search-engine 's query-language , but discussion of these will be put off until later . even with these simple boolean connectives and a keyword vocabulary of reasonable size , users can construct a vast number of potential queries when attempting to express their information-need .
