2.5.2 fine points changing indices for dynamic corpora one reason to keep raw frequency-counts in the inverted keyword file used by our experimental implementation is that this provides maximum flexibility as we consider various keyword-weighting schemes . but there is another reason these raw statistics are useful in real applications . extracting lexical-features 55 it is often important to be able to update a corpus 's index as documents are added to or deleted from it . retention of raw keyword frequency information allows these statistics to be updated as our corpus changes . adding a new document simply requires that it be analyzed (as outlined earlier) , simply incrementing existing counters for each keyword . ^ similarly , deletion of documents from an index exploits the full text of the document itself to identify all keywords it contains . for each keyword then , posting counts are simply decremented . * implementation details posting resolution typically we need only keep track of which document contains the posting . but an important element of many query-languages is proximity operators , which allow users to specify how close two keywords must be (adjacent words , within the same sentence , within the same paragraph , within a fc-word window of one another , etc.) . to support such queries , we may also be concerned with recording higher resolution posting information than which document it is in . for example , many systems retain the exact character position of the (beginning of the) keyword . figure 2.6 shows the elaborate data-structure used by the stairs ir-system . ^ in addition to very high-resolution postings , this representation supports other query-attributes (e.g. , security) . '' ^ emphasizing proxy text the fact that keyword tokens occur in both the proxy text and the main text of the document gives us the opportunity to treat them differently . for example , we can emphasize the importance of words used in the proxy over those occurring in the raw text . this would be sensible if we believed that those occurrences in , for example , the subject of a message or the title of a dissertation , are better characterizations of a document than words picked from the text of the abstract or the text of the email-message . in our code , this emphasis will be controlled by an integer variable emphproxy , which notes occurrences of keywords in the proxy by doubling (emphproxy = 2) or tripling (emphproxy = 3) the keyword counters for proxy text . more about stairs proximity searching with low-resolution posting information * the optimized fpost data-structure makes this update awkward as well . 56 finding out about dictionary number of documents to which term is assigned figure 2.6 stairs posting information reproduced with permission from salton and mcgill [salton and mcgill , 1983 , figure 8.5 , p. 244] document number because we have made the first stage of our processing flexible with respect to how a corpus extends across multiple files in general , two numbers will uniquely identify each of your documents : its file number and the document number within that file . for that reason , and because each posting must retain a unique-identifier for each document , it becomes important to construct a single number that folds them together . maintaining a single integer , instead of two integers , therefore becomes a worthwhile space-saver . one simple way to accomplish this is to multiply the document 's file number by some number larger than the maximum number of documents within any file , and then add its document number . just extracting lexical-features 57 subject : re : ide or scsi ? from : helpful@urban.or.jp (me @ my humble abode) date : 1997/08/29 message-id : lt;3406f93a.50446926@nnrp.gol.oomgt; newsgroups : comp.os.ms-windows . nt.setup.hardware , comp . windows , nt.misc [more headers] on thu , 28 aug 1997 23:10:03 gmt , michael query lt;query@dpi.qld.gov.augt; wrote : gt ; my question is , should i get another 2 gb scsi disk for putting the gt ; 0s (nt 4.0 ws) , software , etc on , or should i get an ide disk for this ? having played around with different conngs for a while , i 'd say go scsi . i 'd do that even if i had to get a second scsi controller .
