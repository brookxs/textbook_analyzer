wildcard queries wildcard queries are used in any of the following situations : (1) the user is uncertain of the spelling of a query-term (e.g. , sydney vs. sidney , which leads to the wildcard query s * dney) ; (2) the user is aware of multiple variants of spelling a term and (consciously) seeks documents containing any of the variants (e.g. , color vs. colour) ; (3) the user seeks documents containing variants of a term that would be caught by stemming , but is unsure whether the search-engine performs stemming (e.g. , judicial vs. judiciary , leading to the wildcard query judicia *) ; (4) the user is uncertain of the correct rendition of a foreign-word or phrase (e.g. , the query universit * stuttgart) . a query such as mon * is known as a trailing wildcard query , because the * symbol occurs only once , at the end of the search string . a search-tree on the dictionary is a convenient way of handling trailing wildcard queries : we walk down the tree following the symbols m , o and n in turn , at which point we can enumerate the set of terms in the dictionary with the prefix mon. . finally , we use lookups on the standard inverted-index to retrieve all documents containing any term in . but what about wildcard queries in which the * symbol is not constrained to be at the end of the search string ? before handling this general case , we mention a slight generalization of trailing wildcard queries . first , consider leading wildcard queries , or queries of the form * mon. . consider a reverse b-tree on the dictionary - one in which each root-to-leaf path of the b-tree corresponds to a term in the dictionary written backwards : thus , the term lemon would , in the b-tree , be represented by the path root-n-o-m-e-l . a walk down the reverse b-tree then enumerates all terms in the vocabulary with a given prefix . in fact , using a regular b-tree together with a reverse b-tree , we can handle an even more general case : wildcard queries in which there is a single * symbol , such as se * mon. . to do this , we use the regular b-tree to enumerate the set of dictionary terms beginning with the prefix se , then the reverse b-tree to enumerate the set of terms ending with the suffix mon. . next , we take the intersection of these two sets , to arrive at the set of terms that begin with the prefix se and end with the suffix mon. . finally , we use the standard inverted-index to retrieve all documents containing any terms in this intersection . we can thus handle wildcard queries that contain a single * symbol using two b-trees , the normal b-tree and a reverse b-tree . subsections general wildcard queries permuterm indexes k-gram indexes for wildcard queries
