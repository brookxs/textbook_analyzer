10.6.7 tables tabular display is another approach for showing relationships among retrieval documents . the envision system [273] allows the user to organize results according to metadata such as author or date along the x and y-axes , and uses graphics to show values for attributes associated with retrieved documents within each cell (see figure 10.23) . color , shape , and size of an iconic representation of a document are used to show the computed relevance , the type of document , or 302 user-interfaces and visualization key-constraints governing human 1983 tho psychology of human-computer-interaction 1904 human liadts and tha vdt coadjutor intotiaco figure 10.23 the envision tabular display for graphically organizing retrieved documents [270] . other attributes . clicking on an icon brings up more information about the document in another window . like the webcutter system , this view provides few cues about how the documents are related to one another in terms of their content or meaning . the sensemaker system also allows users to group documents into different views via a table-like display [51] , including a scatter/gather [203] style view . although tables are appealing , they can not show the intersections of many different attributes ; rather they are better for pairwise-comparisons . another problem with tables for display of textual-information is that very little information can be fitted on a screen at a time , making comparisons difficult . the table lens [666] is an innovative interface for viewing and interactively reorganizing very-large tables of information (see figure 10.24) . it uses focus-plus-context to fit hundreds of rows of information in a space occupied by at most two dozen rows in standard spreadsheets . and because it allows for rapid reorganization via sorting of columns , users can quickly switch from a view focused around one kind of metadata to another . for example , first sorting documents by rank and then by author name can show the relative ranks of different articles by the same author . a re-sort by date can show patterns in relevance-scores with respect to date of publication . this rapid re-sorting capability helps circumvent the problems associated with the fact that tables can not show many simultaneous intersections . another variation on the table theme is that seen in the perspective wall [530] in which a focuh-plas-coritext display is used to center information currently using relevance-judgements 303 68490cl _____ l 287658 427500 . ______ m79550 l1617b4 figure 10.24 the tablelens visualization [666] . of interest in the middle of the display , compressing less important information into the periphery on the sides of the wall . the idea is to show in detail the currently most important information while at the same time retaining the context of the rest of the information . for example , if viewing documents in chronological order , the user can easily tell if they are currently looking at documents in the beginning , middle , or end of the time range . these interfaces have not been applied to information-access tasks . the problem with such displays when applied to text is that they require an attribute that can be shown according to an underlying order , such as date . unfortunately , information useful for organizing text-content , such as topic labels , does not have an inherent meaningful order . alphabetical order is useful for looking up individual items , but not for seeing patterns across items according to adjacency , as in the case for ordered data-types like dates and size .
