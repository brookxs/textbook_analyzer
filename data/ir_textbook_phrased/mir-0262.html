13.5.2 combining searching with browsing usually , users either browse following hypertext-links or they search a web-site (or the whole web) . currently , in web-directories , a search can be reduced to a subtree of the taxonomy . however , the search may miss related-pages that are not in that part of the taxonomy . some search-engines find similar pages using common words , but often this is not effective . webglimpse is a tool that tries to solve these problems by combining browsing with searching [539] . webglimpse attaches a small search box to the bottom of every html page , and allows the search to cover the neighborhood of that page or the whole site , without having to stop browsing . this is equivalent to following hypertext-links that are constructed on-the-fly through a neighborhood-search . webglimpse can be useful in building indices for personal-web pages or collections of favorite urls . first , webglimpse indexes a web-site (or a collection of specific documents) and computes neighborhoods according to user specifications . as a result . webglimpse adds the search boxes to selected pages , collects remote pages that are relevant , and caches those pages locally . later , the users can search in the neighborhood of a page using the search boxes . as the name suggests , webglimpse uses glimpse as its search-engine [540] , the neighborhood of a web-page is defined as the set of web-pages that are reachable by a path of hypertext-links within a maximum predefined distance . this distance can be set differently for local and remote pages . for example , it metasearchers 387 can be unlimited locally , but be only three at any remote-site . the neighborhood can also include all the subdirectories of the directory where the-web page is . the result is a graph of all the neighborhoods of the-web site or collection , and for each web-page , a file with all the-web pages in its neighborhood . when searching , any query in the whole index can be intersected with a neighborhood list , obtaining the relevant-web pages . a nice addition to webglimpse would be to visualize the neighborhoods . this problem is the topic of the next section .
