11.3.3 uncertainty , proximity , and weights in query expressions as we have already remarked , the execution of a content-dependent query returns a set of relevant objects . an interesting aspect in designing a multimedia-query-language is how it is possible to specify the degree of relevance of the retrieved objects . in general , this can be done in three different ways : ï by using some imprecise terms and predicates , such as normal , unacceptable , typical . each of those terms does not represent a precise value but a set of possible acceptable values with respect to which the attribute or the feature has to be matched . ï by specifying particular proximity predicates . in this case , the predicate does not represent a precise relationship between objects or between attributes/features and values . rather , the relationship represented is based on the computation of a semantic-distance between the query object and the stored ones , on the basis of the extracted features . the nearest object-search is an example of proximity predicate , by which the user requests all the objects which are closest or within a certain distance of a given object . indexing support for this kind of query is discussed in chapter 12 . ï by assigning each condition or term a given weighty specifying the degree of precision by which a condition must be verified by an object . for example , the query ` find all the objects containing an image representing a screen (high) and a keyboard (low) ' [657] , can be used to retrieve all the objects containing an image representing a screen and a keyboard . however , the objects containing only a screen are also retrieved and returned to the user , after the ones containing both the screen and the keyboard , since the condition imposing the containment of a keyboard is weaker than the condition imposing the containment of a screen . the use of imprecise terms and relationships , as well as the use of weights , allows the user to drive the similarity-based-selection of relevant objects . the corresponding query is executed by assigning some importance and preference values to each predicate and term . then * objects are retrieved and presented to the user as an ordered-list . this ordering is given by a score associated with each object , giving a measure of the matching degree between the object and 338 multimedia-ir : models and languages the query . the computation of the score is based on probabilistic-models , using the preference values assigned to each predicate .
