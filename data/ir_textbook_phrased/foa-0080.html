4.4.2 raveplan a second challenge is to find the desired density or redundancy of sample points . that is , for each document that we believe may be relevant to a query , how many subjects should evaluate it ? the answer will vary depending on such factors as the number of participants , their expertise , their motivation to produce quality judgments , how long each will spend rating documents , etc. . a higher density means that fewer documents will be evaluated , but also that the intersubject cumulative assessment is likely to be more statistically stable . this can be especially important when relevance-feedback is to be used to train the system . the trade-off between the most important of these factors is captured in the following formula : x = nr stq (4.21) assessing the retrieval 143 where x = number of documents to be evaluated for each query n = number of subjects r = expected subject efficiency (votes/user/time) 5 = desired density (votes/document) t = time spent by subjects q = number of queries to be evaluated note that this formula ignores the overlap between queries that occurs when users see a document that may be relevant to two or more of the queries in their list . care must be taken , therefore , to minimize expected overlap between the topical areas of the queries . we have also found that the assessment densities constructed using this formula are unfortunately uneven . the main source of these is variability in jr , the rate at which subjects are able to produce relevance-assessments . eaveplan takes as input a list of q query specifications , a list of n subject logins , the desired density s , and the number of documents r * t that should be allocated to each subject . the query specifications indicate which queries can go in which fields and which queries should not be shown together . this allows us to limit possible interactions between queries about similar topics . ^ a better raveplan outputs two files . the plan file , which is an input to the raveplan rave interactive-application , lists each subject id along with the queries and document numbers that have been selected for that subject . the assignments file is a list of document-query pairs , which tells us which query we expect the document to be relevant to . ravecompile uses this file after data-collection is complete to generate true and false-positive measures .
