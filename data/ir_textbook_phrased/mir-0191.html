10.4.4 automated source-selection human-computer-interfaces for helping guide users to appropriate sources is a wide open area for research . it requires both eliciting the information-need from users and understanding which needs can be satisfied by which sources . an ambitious approach is to build a model of the source and of the information-need of the user and try to determine which fit together best . user-modeling systems and intelligent-tutoring-systems attempt to do this both for general domains [204 , 814] and for online-help-systems [378] . a simpler alternative is to create a representation of the contents of information-sources and match this representation against the query-specification . this approach is taken by g1oss , a system which tries to determine in advance the best bibliographic database to send a search request to , based on the terms in the query [765] . the system uses a simple analysis of the combined frequencies of the query words within the individual collections . the savvysearch system [383] takes this idea a step further , using actions taken by users after a query to decide how to decrease or increase the ranking of a search-engine for a particular query (see also chapter 13) . the flip side to automatically selecting the best source for a query is to automatically send a query to multiple sources and then combine the results from the various systems in some way . many metasearch engines exist on the web . how to combine the results effectively is an active area of research , sometimes known as collection-fusion [63 , 767 , 388] .
