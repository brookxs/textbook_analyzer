8.3.2 scientists scientifically constructed knowledge can take many forms , especially in the modern age of genomic-data , hypertexts , and multimedia . knowledge-networks is a term used (e.g. , by the national-science-foundation) to refer to an even wider range of interconnections , among both the scientists who have created them and the representations themselves . in the new science occurring on the www , the speed with which a manuscript can go from author to reader has been accelerated dramatically . perhaps because the physical installations required to do modern physics (high-energy accelerators , telescopes , etc.) required them to come to the same geographical-location (cern , livermore , los alamos) , physicists have long been aware of how useful informal `` preprint '' communication-channels can be [latour , 1987] . this may be one reason why the server begun by p. ginsparg at los alamos national labs has been a leader in exploring how scientific publication can occur . this system , originally developed for only physicists , has been so wildly successful that it now houses many documents from many disciplines . the national institute of health has recently proposed extending this example with pubmed central ,10 which would disseminate research-reports , both with and without peer-review . as might be expected , computer scientists have a particularly wide range of resources for searching their own literature , including : ï the computing research repository11 (corr) ; ï coray12 a search-engine developed especially for computer-science-research ; ï ncstrl13 (pronounced `` ancestral '') , a system for sharing archives of technical reports in computer-science . 10 http://www.nih.gov/aj3out/director/pubm^cªntral-htin 11 xxxjanl.gov / arcmve/cs/intro . html 12 www.oorajiistresearcli.cx5m / '' www.ncstrl.org / 310 finding out about one ugly truth of science is that the primary task of scientists is to disagree with one another . the scientific-process works because it effectively weeds out flawed arguments . one scientist can gain fame by claiming something new is true ; a second scientist can gain fame by showing that it is not . if the question is sufficiently important , a third , scholarly scientist can do useful work by enumerating the many people who said all the things that were neither new nor true , as well as the very few publications that are both . the printed record of science must contain all aspects of this ongoing debate , but the channel is not wide enough to contain all debates among all scientists , and so only some aspects of the debate can be published . reviewers play a critical role in deciding what is worthy of publication . searching for journal-articles is only a part of what scientists must do . they are planning experiments and executing them , they may be teaching , they may be relating their basic findings to the development of a product , etc. . the browsing-behaviors of scientists contribute to a philosophy of how science is actually prosecuted , but only if it deals with the larger realm of scientists ' activities . a great deal has been said about the small fraction of a typical scientist 's day that is in fact reflected in their publication record [latour , 1987] . but the www and email suggest a new characterization of scientists ' activities that includes traditional publication channels and informal artifacts similar to the letters and correspondence that have traditionally been the mainstay of historians of science [rudwick , 1985] . logical positivists aside , most current philosophy-of-science acknowledges the tremendous burden carried by the language used as scientists muddle toward a common-understanding . this point has been made especially clear in biology by keller and lloyd 's keywords in evolutionary-biology [keller and lloyd , 1992] . for these philosophers , the word `` keyword '' is not being used as it has in this text , as an element of an automatically assigned indexing vocabulary . rather , they are interested in those key-words that scientists use to talk to one another . as parts of scientific theories expressed in natural-language , keywords ... serve as conduits for unacknowledged , unbidden , and often unwelcome traffic between worlds . words also have memories ; they cae insinuate theoretical or cultural past into the present . finally , they have force . upon examination , their multiple shadows conclusions and future-directions 311 and memories can be seen to perform real conceptual work , in science as in ordinary language . [keller and lloyd , 1992 , p. 2] indeed , it is precisely because of the large overlap between forms of scientific thought and forms of societal thought that `` keywords '' - terms whose meanings chronically and insistently traverse the boundaries between ordinary and technical discourse can serve not simply as indicators of either social meanings and social-change or scientific meaning and scientific change , but as indicators of the ongoing traffic between social and scientific meaning and , accordingly , between social and scientific change . [keller and lloyd , 1992 , pp. 4-5 , emphasis in original] as suggested by section 6.8 , the emergence of vast data-sets like those surrounding the human-genome-project point to qualitatively different relationships between the keywords used as part of natural-language by scientists and the data and theories to which they are meant to refer .
