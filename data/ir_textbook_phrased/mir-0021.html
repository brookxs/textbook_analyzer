1.7 bibliographic discussion many other books have been written on information-retrieval , and due to the current widespread interest in the subject , new books have appeared recently . in the following , we briefly compare our book with these previously published works . classic references in the field of information-retrieval are the books by van rijsbergen [785] and salton and mcgill [698] . our distinction between data and information retrieval is borrowed from the former . our definition of the information-retrieval process is influenced by the latter . however , almost 20 years later , both books are now outdated and do not cover many of the new developments in information-retrieval . three more recent and also well known references in information-retrieval are the book edited by frakes and baeza-yates [275] , the book by witten , moffat , and bell [825] , and the book by lesk [501] . all these three books are complementary to this book . the first is focused on data-structures-and-algorithms for information-retrieval and is useful whenever quick prototyping of a known algorithm is desired . the second is focused on indexing and compression , and covers images besides text . for instance , our definition of a textual-image is borrowed from it . the third is focused on digital-libraries and practical issues such as history , distribution , usability , economics , and property-rights . on the issue of computer-centered and user-centered retrieval , a generic book on information-systems that takes the latter view is due to allen [13] . there are other complementary books for specific chapters . for example , there are many books on ir and hypertext . the same is true for generic or specific multimedia-retrieval , as images , audio or video . although not an information-retrieval title , the book by rosenfeld and morville [682] on information-architecture of the-web , is a good complement to our chapter on searching the 18 introduction web . the book by menasce and almeida [554] demonstrates how to use queue-ing theory for predicting web-server-performance . in addition , there are many books that explain how to find information on the web and how to use search-engines . the reference edited by sparck jones and willet [414] , which was long awaited , is really a collection of papers rather than an edited book . the coherence and breadth of coverage in our book makes it more appropriate as a textbook in a formal discipline . nevertheless , this collection is a valuable research-tool . a collection of papers on cross-language-information-retrieval was recently edited by grefenstette [323] . this book is a good complement to ours for people interested in this particular topic . additionally , a collection focused on intelligent ir was edited recently by maybury [550] , and another collection on natural-language ir edited by strzalkowski will appear soon [748] . the book by korfhage [451] covers a lot less material and its coverage is not as detailed as ours . for instance , it includes no detailed discussion of digital-libraries , the-web , multimedia , or parallel-processing . similarly , the books by kowalski [459] and shapiro et al. [719] do not cover these topics in detail , and have a different orientation . finally , the recent book by grossman and frieder [326] does not discuss the-web , digital-libraries , or visual-interfaces . for people interested in research results , the main journals on ir are : journal of the american society of information-sciences (jasis) published by wiley and sons , acm transactions on information-systems , information-processing management (ipm , elsevier) , information-systems (elsevier) , information-retrieval (kluwer) , and knowledge and information-systems (springer) . the main conferences are : acm sigir international conference on information-retrieval , acm international conference on digital-libraries (acm digital-library) , acm conference on information knowledge and management (cikm) , and text re-trieval conference (trec) . regarding events of regional influence , we would like to acknowledge the spire (south american symposium on string-processing and information retrieval) symposium .
