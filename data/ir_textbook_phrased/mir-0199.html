10.6.1 document surrogates the most common way to show results for a query is to list information about documents in order of their computed relevance to the query . alternatively , for pure boolean ranking , documents are listed according to a metadata attribute , such as date . typically the document list consists of the document 's title and a subset of important metadata , such as date , source , and length of the article . in systems with statistical-ranking , a numerical score or percentage is also often shown alongside the title , where the score indicates a computed degree of match or probability-of-relevance . this kind of information is sometimes referred to as a document surrogate . see figure 10.14 from [824] . some systems provide users with a choice between a short and a detailed view . the detailed view typically contains a summary or abstract . in bibliographic systems , the author-written or service-written abstract is shown . web-search-engines automatically generate excerpts , usually extracting the first few lines of non-markup text in the web-page . in most interfaces , clicking on the document 's title or an iconic representation of the document shown beside the title will bring up a view of the document itself , either in another window on the screen , or replacing the listing of search-results . (in traditional bibliographic systems , the full text was unavailable online , and only bibliographic-records could be readily viewed .)
