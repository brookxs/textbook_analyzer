53 natural-language the goal of natural-language-processing is to use the semantic information in addition to the statistical-information to enhance the indexing of the item . this improves the precision of searches , reducing the number of false hits a user reviews . the semantic information is extracted as a result of processing the 124 chapter 5 language rather than treating each word as an independent entity . the simplest output of this process results in generation of phrases that become indexes to an item . more complex-analysis generates thematic representation-of-events rather figure 5.7 extended bayesian-network than phrases . statistical-approaches use proximity as the basis behind determining the strength of word relationships in generating phrases . for example , with a proximity constraint of adjacency , the phrases ` venetian blind '' and `` blind venetian '' may appear related and map to the same phrase . but syntactically and semantically those phrases are very different concepts . word phrases generated by natural-language-processing algorithms enhance indexing specification and provide another level of disambiguation . natural-language-processing can also combine the concepts into higher level concepts sometimes referred to as thematic representations . one example represents them as concept-relationship-concept triples (liddy-93) .
