2.10.3 the hypertext-model one fundamental concept related to the task of writing down text is the notion of sequencing . written text is usually conceived to be read sequentially . the reader should not expect to fully understand the message conveyed by the writer by randomly reading pieces of text here and there . one might rely on the text-structure to skip portions of the text but this might result in miscommunication between reader and writer . thus , a sequenced organizational-structure lies underneath most written text . when the reader fails to perceive such a structure and abide by it , he frequently is unable to capture the essence of the writer 's message . sometimes , however , we are looking for information which is subsumed by the whole text but which can not be easily captured through sequential reading . for instance , while glancing at a book about the history of the wars fought by man , we might be momentarily interested solely in the regional wars in europe . we know that this information is in the book , but we might have a hard time finding it because the writer did not organize his writings with this purpose (he might have organized the wars chronologically) . in such a situation , a different organization of the text is desired . however , there is no point in rewriting the whole text . thus , the solution is to define a new organizational-structure besides the one already in existence . one way to accomplish such a goal is through the design of a hypertext . models for browsing 67 hypertext definition and the navigational-task a hypertext is a high level interactive navigational-structure which allows us to browse text non-sequentially on a computer screen . it consists basically of nodes which are correlated by directed links in a graph-structure . to each node is associated a text region which might be a chapter in a book , a section in an article , or a web-page . two nodes a and b might be connected by a directed link iab which correlates the texts associated with these two nodes . in this case , the reader might move to the node b while reading the text associated with the node a . in its most conventional form , a hypertext link iab is attached to a specific string inside the text for node a . such a string is marked specially (for instance , its characters might appear in a different color or underlined) to indicate the presence of the underlying link . while reading the text , the user might come across a marked string . if the user-clicks on that string , the underlying directed link is followed , and a new text region (associated with the node at the destination) is displayed on the screen . the process of navigating the hypertext can be understood as a traversal of a directed-graph . the linked nodes of the graph represent text nodes which are semantically related . while traversing this graph the reader visualizes a flow of information which was conceived by the designer of the hypertext . consider our previous example regarding a book on the wars fought by man . one might design a hypertext composed of two distinct webs (here , a web is simply a connected-component formed by a subset of all links in the hypertext) . while the first web might be designed to provide access to the local wars fought in europe in chronological order , the second web might be designed to provide access to the local wars fought by each european country . in this way , the user of this hypertext can access the information according to his particular need . when the hypertext is large , the user might lose track of the organizational-structure of the hypertext . the effect is that the user might start to take bad navigational decisions which might sidetrack him from his main goal (which usually consists of finding a piece of information in the hypertext) . when this happens , the user is said to be lost-in-hyperspace [604] . to avoid this problem , it is desirable that the hypertext include a hypertext map which shows where the user is at all times . in its simplest form , this map is a directed-graph which displays the current node being visited . additionally , such a map could include information on the paths the user has traveled so far . this can be used to remind the user of the uselessness of following paths which have been explored already . while navigating a hypertext , the user is restricted to the intended flow of information previously conceived by the hypertext designer . thus , the task of designing a hypertext should take into account the needs of its potential users . this implies the execution of a requirement-analysis phase before starting the actual implementation of the hypertext . such a requirement-analysis is critically important but is frequently overlooked . furthermore , during the hypertext-navigation , the user might find it difficult to orient himself . this difficulty arises even in the presence of a guiding 68 modeling-tool such as the hypertext map discussed above . one possible reason is an excessively complex hypertext organization with too many links which allow the user to travel back and forth . to avoid this problem , the hypertext can have a simpler structure which can be quickly remembered by the user at all times . for instance , the hypertext can be organized hierarchically to facilitate the navigational-task . definition of the structure of the hypertext should be accomplished in a domain-modeling phase (done after a requirement-analysis phase) . further , after the modeling of the domain , a user-interface-design should be concluded prior to implementation . only then , can we say that we have a proper hypertext-structure for the application at hand . in the web , however , pages are usually implemented with no attention paid to requirement-analysis , domain-modeling , and user-interface-design . as a result , web-pages are frequently poorly conceived and often fail to provide the user with a proper hypertext-structure for assistance with the information-seeking-task . with large hypertexts , it might be difficult for the user to position himself in the part of the whole graph which is of most interest to him . to facilitate this initial positioning step , a search-based on index-terms might be used . in [540] , manber discusses the advantages of this approach . hypertexts provided the basis for the conception and design of the hypertext markup-language (html) and the hypertext-transfer-protocol (http) which originated the world-wide-web (which we simply refer to as the-web) . in chapter 13 , we discuss the-web in detail . we briefly discuss some of its features below . about the-web when one talks about the-web , the first concept which comes to mind is that of a hypertext . in fact , we frequently think of the wteb as a huge distributed-hypertext domain . however , the-web is not exactly a proper hypertext because it lacks an underlying data-model , it lacks a navigational plan , and it lacks a consistently designed user-interface . each one of the millions of web-page designers devises his own interface with its own peculiar characteristics . many times we visit a web-site simply looking for a phone-number and can not find it because it is buried in the least expected place of the local hypertext-structure . thus , the-web user has no underlying metaphor to assist him in the search for information of interest . instead of saying that the-web is a hypertext , we prefer to say that it is a pool of (partially) interconnected webs . some of these webs might be characterized as a local hypertext (in the sense that they have an underlying structure which enjoys some consistency) but others might be simply a collection of pages designed separately (for instance , the-web of a university department whose professors design their own pages) . despite not being exactly a hypertext , the-web has provided us with a new dimension in communication functionality because it is easily accessible world wide at very low cost . and maybe most important , the-web has no control body setting-up regulations and censorship rules . as a bibliographic discussion 69 result , for the first time in the history of mankind , any one person can publish his writings through a large medium without being subjected to the filtering of an editorial board . for a more thorough discussion of these and many other issues related to the-web , the user is referred to chapter 13 .
