bibliographic remarks in recent years a vast literature on automatic-classification has been generated . one reason for this is that applications for these techniques have been found in such diverse fields as biology , pattern-recognition , and information retrieval . the best introduction to the field is still provided by sneath and sokal [15] (a much revised and supplemented version of their earlier book) which looks at automatic-classification in the context of numerical taxonomy . second to this , i would recommend a collection of papers edited by cole [58] . a book and a report on cluster-analysis with a computational emphasis are anderberg [59] and wishart [60] respectively . both given listings of fortran programs for various cluster methods . other books with a numerical taxonomy emphasis are everitt [61] , hartigan [62] and clifford and stephenson [63] . a recent book with a strong statistical flavour is van ryzin [64] . two papers worth singling-out are sibson [65] and fisher and van ness [66] . the first gives a very lucid account of the foundations of cluster methods based on dissimilarity-measures . the second does a detailed comparison of some of the more well-known cluster methods (including single-link) in terms of such conditions on the clusters as connectivity and convexity . much of the early work in document-clustering was done on the smart project . an excellent idea of its achievement in this area may be got by reading isr-10 (rocchio [36]) , isr-19 (kerchner [67]) , isr-20 (murray [43]) , and dattola [68] . each has been predominantly concerned with document-clustering . there are a number of areas in ir where automatic-classification is used which have not been touched on in this chapter . probably the most important of these is the use of ` fuzzy-sets ' which is an approach to clustering pioneered by zadeh [69] . its relationship with the measurement of similarity is explicated in zadeh [70] . more recently it has been applied in document-clustering by negoita [71] , chan [72] and radecki [73] . one further interesting area of application of clustering-techniques is in the clustering of citation-graphs . a measure of closeness is defined between journals as a function of the frequency with which they cite one another . groups of closely related journals can thus be isolated (disiss [74]) . related to this is the work of preparata and chien [75] who study citation-patterns between documents so that mutually cited documents can be stored as closely together as possible . the early work of ivie [76] was similarly motivated in that he proposed to collect feedback information from users showing which pairs of documents were frequently was then taken as proportional to the strength of association , and documents more closely associated were made more readily accessible than those less closely associated . finally , the reader may be interested in pursuing the use of cluster methods in pattern-recognition since some of the ideas developed there are applicable to ir . both duda and hart [77] and watanabe [78] devote a chapter to clustering in the context of pattern-recognition .
