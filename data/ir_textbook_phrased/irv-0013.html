indexing an index language is the language used to describe documents and requests . the elements of the index language are index-terms , which may be derived from the text of the document to be described , or may be arrived at independently . index languages may be described as pre-coordinate or post-coordinate , the first indicates that terms are coordinated at the time of indexing and the latter at the time of searching . more specifically , in pre-coordinate indexing a logical combination of any index-terms may be used as a label to identify a class of documents , whereas in post-coordinate indexing the same class would be identified at search-time by combining the classes of documents labelled with the individual index-terms . one last distinction , the vocabulary of an index language may be controlled or uncontrolled . the former refers to a list of approved index-terms that an indexer may use , such as for example used by medigital libraryars . the controls on the language may also include hierarchic relationships between the index-terms . or , one may insist that certain terms can only be used as adjectives (or qualifiers) . there is really no limit to the kind of syntactic controls one may put on a language . the index language which comes out of the conflation algorithm in the previous section may be described as uncontrolled , post-coordinate and derived . the vocabulary of index-terms at any stage in the evolution of the document-collection is just the set of all conflation class-names . there is much controversy about the kind of index language which is best for document-retrieval . the recommendations range from the complicated relational-languages of farradane et al. [12] and the syntol group (see coates [13] for a description) to the simple index-terms extracted by text-processing systems just described . the main debate is really about whether automatic-indexing is as good as or better than manual-indexing . each can be done to various levels of complexity . however , there seems to be mounting evidence that in both cases , manual and automatic-indexing , adding complexity in the form of controls more elaborate than index-term-weighting do not pay dividends . this has been demonstrated by the results obtained by cleverdon et al. [14] , aitchison et al. [15] , comparative systems laboratory [16] and more recently keen and digger [17] . the message is that uncontrolled vocabularies based on natural-language achieve retrieval-effectiveness comparable to vocabularies with elaborate controls . this is extremely encouraging , since the simple index language is the easiest to automate . probably the most substantial evidence for automatic-indexing has come out of the smart project (1966) . salton [18] recently summarised its conclusions : ' ... on the average the simplest indexing procedures which identify a given document or query by a set of terms , weighted or unweighted , obtained from document or query text are also the most effective ' . its recommendations are clear , automatic-text-analysis should use weighted terms derived from document excerpts whose length is at least that of a document abstract . the document representatives used by the smart project are more sophisticated than just the lists of stems extracted by conflation . there is no doubt that stems rather than ordinary word forms are more effective (carroll and debruyn [19]) . on top of this the smart project adds index-term-weighting , where an index term may be a stem or some concept class arrived at through the use of various dictionaries . for details of the way in which smart elaborates its document representatives see salton [20] . in the next sections i shall give a simple discussion of the kind of frequency information that may be used to weight document descriptors and explain the use of automatically constructed term classes to aid retrieval .
