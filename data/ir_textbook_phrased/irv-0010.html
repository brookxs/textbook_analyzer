introduction before a computerised information-retrieval-system can actually operate to retrieve some information , that information must have already been stored inside the computer . originally it will usually have been in the form od documents . the computer , however , is not likely to have stored the complete text of each document in the natural-language in which it was writtten . it will have , instead , a document representative which may have been produced from the documents either manually or automatically . the starting point of the text-analysis process may be the complete document-text , an abstract , the title only , or perhaps a list of words only . from it the process must produce a document representative in a form which the computer can handle . the developments and advances in the process of representation have been reviewed every year by the appropriate chapters of cuadra 's annual review of information-science and technology * . the reader is referred to them for extensive references . the emphasis in this chapter is on the statistical (a word used loosely here : it usually simply implies counting) rather than linguistic approaches to automatic-text-analysis . the reasons for this emphasis are varied . firstly , there is the limit on space . were i to attempt a discussion of semantic and syntactic methods applicable to automatic-text-analysis , it would probably fill another book . luckily such a book has recently been written by sparck jones and kay [2] . also montgomery [3] has written a paper surveying linguistics in information-science . secondly , linguistic-analysis has proved to be expensive to implement and it is not clear how to use it to enhance information-retrieval . part of the problem has been that very little progress has been made in formal semantic theory . however , there is some reason for optimism on this front , see , for example , keenan [4 , 5] . undoubtedly a theory of language will be of extreme importance to the development of intelligent ir systems . but , to date , no such theory has been sufficiently developed for it to be applied successfully to ir . in any case satisfactory , possibly even very good , document-retrieval systems can be built without such a theory . thirdly , the statistical-approach has been examined and tried ever since the days of luhn and has been found to be moderately successful . the chapter therefore starts with the original ideas of luhn on which much of automatic-text-analysis has been built , and then goes on to describe a concrete way of generating document representatives . furthermore , ways of exploiting and improving document representatives through weighting or classifying keywords are discussed . in passing , some of the evidence for automatic-indexing is presented .
