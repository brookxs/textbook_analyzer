9.1 introduction to text-search techniques the basic concept of a text-scanning system is the ability for one or more users to enter queries , and the text to be searched is accessed and compared to the query terms . when all of the text has been accessed , the query is complete . one advantage of this type-architecture is that as soon as an item is identified as satisfying a query , the results can be presented to the user for retrieval . figure 9.1 provides a diagram of a text streaming search-system . the database contains the full text of the items . the term detector is the special hardware/software that 222 chapter 9 contains all of the terms being searched for and in some systems the logic between the items . it will input the text and detect the existence of the search-terms . it will output to the query resolver the detected terms to allow for final logical processing of a query against an item . the query resolver performs two functions . it will accept search statements from the users , extract the logic and search-terms and pass the search-terms to the detector . it also accepts results from the detector and determines which queries are satisfied by the gt ;

so if i * c s , - gt ; s2 if i = p s,-gt ; soifi * {p , c} 51 - gt ; si if i = c s2-gt ; s3ifi = u s2-gt ; s ! if i = c s2-ªsoin * {c , u}} so = {so} sf = {s3} figure 9.2 b automata definition / c , u = c figure 9.2 a finite-state-automata the automata remains in the initial-state until it has an input symbol of `` c '' which moves it to state sj . it will remain in that state as long as it receives `` c `` s as input . if it receives a `` p '' it will move to s2 . if it receives anything else it falls back to the initial-state . once in state s2 it will either go to the final-state if `` u '' is the next symbol , go to si if a `` c '' is received or go back to the initial-state so if anything else is received . it is possible to represent the productions by a table with the states as the rows and the input symbols that cause state-transitions as each column . the states are representing the current-state and the values in the table are the next state given the particular input symbol .
