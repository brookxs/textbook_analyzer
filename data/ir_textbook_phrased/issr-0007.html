1.3.3 document-database search the document database-search process (see figure 1.4) provides the capability for a query to search against all items received by the system . the document database-search process is composed of the search-process , user entered queries (typically ad-hoc queries) and the document database which contains all items that have been received , processed and stored by the system . it is the retrospective search source for the system . if the user is on-line , the selective-dissemination-of-information system delivers to the user items of interest as soon as they are processed into the system . any search for information that has already been processed into the system can be considered a `` retrospective '' search for information . this does not preclude the search to have search statements constraining it to items received in the last few hours . but typically the searches span far greater time periods . each query is processed against the total document-database . queries differ from profiles in that they are typically short and focused on a specific area-of-interest . the document database can be very-large , hundreds of millions of items or more . typically items in the document-database do not change (i.e. , are not edited) once received . the value of much information quickly decreases over time . these facts are often used to partition the database by time and allow for archiving by the time partitions . some user-interfaces force the user to indicate searches against items received older than a specified time , making use of the partitions of the document database . the documents in the mail files are also in the document-database , since they logically are input to both processes .
