12.8 bibliographic discussion spatial-access-methods structures and algorithms for a recent , very thorough survey of spatial-access-methods , see [290] . for the introduction of r-trees , see the seminal paper by guttman [330] . among the numerous follow-up variations , the jr * - tree [69] seems to be one of the best performing methods , using the idea of deferred splitting with ` forced-reinsert , ' thus achieving higher space-utilization , and therefore more compact , shorter , and faster trees . another strong contender is the hilbert r-tree [427] , which achieves even higher space-utilization and often outperforms the jt-tree . a generalized framework and implementation for all these methods is the gist tree [362] which is available , at the time of writing , at http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu:8000 / gist . with respect to algorithms , the range-search is trivial in r-trees . nearest-neighbors queries require more careful record-keeping , with a branch-and-bound-algorithm (e.g. , [686]) . spatial-joins (e.g. , ` find all pairs of points within distance # ') have also attracted a lot of interest : see the filtering-algorithms in [119] and the methods in [521] and [458] . indexing high-dimensional address spaces has attracted a lot of recent interest : the tv-trees [519] adaptively use only a few of the available dimensions . the sr-trees [431] use spheres in conjunction to rectangles , as bounding regions . the more recent x-trees [83] gracefully switch to sequential-scanning for extremely high dimensionalities . for the analysis of spatial-access-methods and selectivity-estimation , the concept of `` fractal-dimension ' has given very accurate results in every case it was tried : range-queries [247] , nearest-neighbor-queries [628] , spatial-joins [79] . quadtrees [245] . the idea behind the fractal-dimension is to consider the intrinsic dimensionality of the given set of points . for example , consider the points on the diagonal of a 3d cube : their `` embedding ' dimensionality is e = 3 : however , their intrinsic dimensionality is d = 1 . using the appropriate definition for the dimensionality , like the hausdorff fractal-dimension , or the correlation fractal 364 multimedia-ir : indexing and searching dimension [712] , it turns out that real-data sets have a fractional dimensionality : the value is 1.1-1 .2 for coastlines , ~ 2.7 for the brain surface of mammals , ´ 1.3 for the periphery of rain patches , ´ 1.7 for the end-points of road segments , to name but a few [247] . metric trees finally , a class of access-methods that operate on the distance-function directly seems promising . these methods require only a distance-function , and they typically build a cluster hierarchy , that is , a tree-structure of ` spheres ' , which include the children spheres , and so on , recursively . this class includes the burkhard-keller methods [131] , the fixed-query trees [47] , the gnat trees [116] , the mvp trees [112] , and the m-trees [172] . the-technology is still young : most of the above methods are designed for static data sets . on the positive side , they do n't need feature-extraction ; on the negative side , they do n't provide for visualization and data-mining , like gemini and fastmap do (see figure 12.10) . multimedia-indexing , dsp and feature-extraction gemini ó feature-extraction probably the earliest paper that suggested feature-extraction for fast-indexing is [400] , for approximate-matching in shapes . the proof of the lower-bounding lemma is in [249] . algorithms for automatic-feature-extraction include the traditional , multidimensional-scaling (mds) , see , e.g. , [462] . mds has attracted tremendous interest , but it is o (iv2) , quadratic on the number of database objects n. thus , it is impractical for large-data-sets . an o (n) alternative is the so-called fastmap [248] , which was used to produce figure 12.10 . time-sequences for additional , more elaborate distance-functions , that include time-warping , see chapter 8 or [706] . an indexing-method with the time-warping distance-function has recently been developed [840] , using fastmap . for linear-time sequence forecasting , see the classic book on the box-jenkins methodology [109] . for more recent , non-linear forecasting methods , see the intriguing volumes from the santa-fe institute [149 , 808] . digital-signal-processing (dsp) powerful tools for the analysis of time-sequences and n-d signals in general include the traditional fourier-transform (see , e.g. , [622]) , the popular discrete-cosine-transform , which is the basis for the jpeg-image-compression standard [802] , and the more recent , and even more effective , wavelet-transform (dwt) [689] . an excellent introduction to all these methods , as well as source-code , is available in [051] . bibliographic discussion 365 image-features and similarity-functions there is a lot of work in machine-vision on feature-extraction and similarity-measures . classic references are e.g. , [53 , 224 , 285] . a recent survey on image-registration and image-comparison methods is in [125] . the proof for quadratic distance-bounding theorem of section 12.5 is in [244] . other applications of multimedia-indexing there are numerous papers on indexing in multimedia-databases . a small-sample of them include the following : for time-sequences allowing scaling or subpattern matching , see [305] , [7] , [246] . for voice-and-video see , e.g. , [800] . for shapes see , e.g. , [244] . for medical-image-databases see , e.g. , [381] , [454] , [635] . for multimedia-searching on the web , see , e.g. , [4 , 733 , 80 , 714] . data-mining finally , there is a lot of work on traditional machine-learning [565] and statistics (e.g. , [408]) .
