rocchio classification 14.1 decision boundaries figure 14.3 : rocchio classification . perhaps the best-known way of computing good class boundaries is rocchio classification , which uses centroids to define the boundaries . the centroid of a class is computed as the vector average or center-of-mass of its members : (139) 25 6.3.1 14.3 the boundary between two classes in rocchio classification is the set of points with equal distance from the two centroids . for example , , , and in the figure . this set of points is always a line . the generalization of a line in - dimensional space is a hyperplane , which we define as the set of points that satisfy : (140) normal-vector thus , the boundaries of class regions in rocchio classification are hyperplanes . the classification-rule in rocchio is to classify a point in accordance with the region it falls into . equivalently , we determine the centroid that the point is closest to and then assign it to . as an example , consider the star in figure 14.3 . it is located in the china region of the space and rocchio therefore assigns it to china . we show the rocchio-algorithm in pseudocode in figure 14.4 . table 14.1 : vectors and class centroids for the data in table 13.1 . term-weights vector chinese japan tokyo macao beijing shanghai 0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 0.71 0.71 0 0 0 0 0.71 0.71 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.33 0.33 0.33 0 0.71 0.71 0 0 0 worked example . table 14.1 shows the tf-idf vector-representations of the five documents in table 13.1 (page 13.1) , using the formula if (equation 29 , page 6.4.1) . the two class centroids are and . the distances of the test document from the centroids are and . thus , rocchio assigns to . the separating hyperplane in this case has the following parameters : 14.8 end worked example . the assignment criterion in figure 14.4 is euclidean-distance (applyrocchio , line 1) . an alternative is cosine-similarity : (141) 14.1 16.4 16.4 figure 14.4 : rocchio classification : training and testing . rocchio classification is a form of rocchio relevance-feedback (section 9.1.1 , page 9.1.1) . the average of the relevant documents , corresponding to the most important component of the rocchio vector in relevance-feedback (equation 49 , page 49) , is the centroid of the `` class '' of relevant documents . we omit the query component of the rocchio formula in rocchio classification since there is no query in text-classification . rocchio classification can be applied to classes whereas rocchio relevance-feedback is designed to distinguish only two classes , relevant and nonrelevant . in addition to respecting contiguity , the classes in rocchio classification must be approximate spheres with similar radii . in figure 14.3 , the solid square just below the boundary between uk and kenya is a better fit for the class uk since uk is more scattered than kenya . but rocchio assigns it to kenya because it ignores details of the distribution of points in a class and only uses distance from the centroid for classification . the assumption of sphericity also does not hold in figure 14.5 . we can not represent the `` a '' class well with a single prototype because it has two clusters . rocchio often misclassifies this type of multimodal class . a text-classification example for multimodality is a country like burma , which changed its name to myanmar in 1989 . the two clusters before and after the name change need not be close to each other in space . we also encountered the problem of multimodality in relevance-feedback (section 9.1.2 , page 9.1.3) . two-class-classification is another case where classes are rarely distributed like spheres with similar radii . most two-class classifiers distinguish between a class like china that occupies a small region of the space and its widely scattered complement . assuming equal radii will result in a large number of false-positives . most two-class-classification problems therefore require a modified decision-rule of the form : (142) mode time-complexity training testing training and test times for rocchio classification . is the average number of tokens per document . and are the numbers of tokens and types , respectively , in the test document . computing euclidean-distance between the class centroids and a document is . table 14.2 gives the time-complexity of rocchio classification . adding all documents to their respective (unnormalized) centroid is (as opposed to) since we need only consider non-zero entries . dividing each vector sum by the size of its class to compute the centroid is . overall , training-time is linear in the size of the collection (cf. exercise 13.2.1) . thus , rocchio classification and naive-bayes have the same linear-training-time complexity . in the next section , we will introduce another vector-space classification-method , knn , that deals better with classes that have non-spherical , disconnected or other irregular-shapes . exercises . show that rocchio classification can assign a label to a document that is different from its training-set label .
