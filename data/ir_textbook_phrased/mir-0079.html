4.5 query protocols in this section we briefly cover some query-languages that are used automatically by software applications to query text-databases . some of them are proposed as standards for querying cd-roms or as intermediate-languages to query library systems . because they are not intended for human use , we refer to them as protocols rather than languages . more information on protocols can be found in chapters 14 and 15 . the most important query protocols are : ï z39 .50 is a protocol approved as a standard in 1995 by ansi and niso . this protocol is intended to query bibliographical-information using a standard interface between the client and the host database manager which is independent of the client user-interface and of the query database-language at the host . the database is assumed to be a text-collection with some fixed fields (although it is more flexible than usual) . the z39 .50 protocol is used broadly and is part , for instance , of wais (see below) . the protocol does not only specify the query-language and its semantics , but also the way in which client and server establish a session , communicate and exchange information , etc. . although originally conceived only to operate on bibliographical-information (using the machine readable cataloging record (marc) format) , it has been extended to query other types of information as well . ï wais (wide-area information-service) is a suite of protocols that was popular at the beginning of the 1990s before the boom of the-web . the goal of wais was to be a network publishing protocol and to be able to query databases through the-internet . in the cd-rom publishing arena , there are several proposals for query protocols . the main goal of these protocols is to provide ` disk interchangeability . '' this means more flexibility in data-communication between primary information providers and end-users . it also enables significant cost-savings since it allows access to diverse information without the need to buy , install , and train users for different data-retrieval applications . we briefly cover three of these proposals : 114 query-languages æ ccl (common command-language) is a niso proposal (z39 .58 or iso 8777) based on z39 .50 . it defines 19 commands that can be used interactively . it is more popular in europe , although very few products use it . it is based on the classical boolean-model . ï cd-rdx (compact disk read only data-exchange) uses a client-server-architecture and has been implemented in most platforms . the client is generic while the server is designed and provided by the cd-rom publisher who includes it with the database in the cd-rom . it allows fixed-length fields , images , and audio , and is supported by such us national agencies as the cia , nasa , and gsa . ï sfql (structured full-text query-language) is based on sql and also has a client-server-architecture . sfql has been adopted as a standard by the aerospace community (the air transport association/aircraft industry association) . documents are rows in a relational-table and can be tagged using sgml . the language defines the format of the answer , which has a header and a variable-length message area . the language does not define any specific formatting or markup . for example , a query in sfql is : select abstract from journal.papers where title contains `` text-search '' the language supports boolean and logical-operators , thesaurus , proximity operations , and some special characters such as wild cards and repetition . for example : where paper contains `` retrieval '' or like `` info ï / , '' and date gt ; 1/1/98 compared with ccl or cd-rdx , sfql is more general and flexible , although it is based on a relational-model , which is not always the best choice for a document-database .
