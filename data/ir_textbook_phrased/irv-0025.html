the use of clustering in information-retrieval there are a number of discussions in print now which cover the use of clustering in ir . the most important of these are by litofsky [28] , crouch [29] , prywes and smith [30] and fritzche [31] . rather than repeat their chronological treatment here , i shall instead try to isolate the essential features of the various cluster methods . in choosing a cluster method for use in experimental ir , two , often conflicting , criteria have frequently been used . the first of these , and in my view the most important at this stage of the development of the subject , is the theoretical soundness of the method . by this i mean that the method should satisfy certain criteria of adequacy . to list some of the more important of these : (1) the method produces a clustering which is unlikely to be altered drastically when further objects are incorporated , i.e. it is stable under growth . (2) the method is stable in the sense that small errors in the description of the objects lead to small changes in the clustering ; (3) the method is independent of the initial ordering of the objects . these conditions have been adapted from jardine and sibson [2] . the point is that any cluster method which does not satisfy these conditions is unlikely to produce any meaningful experimental-results . unfortunately not many cluster methods do satisfy these criteria , probably because algorithms implementing them tend to be less efficient than ad-hoc clustering-algorithms . the second criterion for choice is the efficiency of the clustering process in terms of speed and storage requirements . in some experimental work this has been the overriding consideration . but it seems to me a little early in the day to insist on efficiency even before we know much about the behaviour of clustered files in terms of the effectiveness of retrieval (i.e. the ability to retrieve wanted and hold back unwanted documents .) in any case , many of the ` good ' theoretical methods (ones which are likely to produce meaningful experimental-results) can be modified to increase the efficiency of their clustering process . efficiency is really a property of the algorithm implementing the cluster method . it is sometimes useful to distinguish the cluster method from its algorithm , but in the context of ir this distinction becomes slightly less than useful since many cluster methods are defined by their algorithm , so no explicit mathematical-formulation exists . in the main , two distinct approaches to clustering can be identified : (1) the clustering is based on a measure of similarity between the objects to be clustered ; (2) the cluster method proceeds directly from the object-descriptions . the most obvious examples of the first approach are the graph theoretic methods which define clusters in terms of a graph derived from the measure of similarity . this approach is best explained with an example (see figure 3.3) . consider a set of objects to be clustered . we compute a numerical value for each pair of objects indicating their similarity . a graph corresponding to this set of similarity values is obtained as follows : a threshold-value is decided upon , and two objects are considered linked if their similarity value is above the threshold . the cluster definition is simply made in terms of the graphical-representation . a string is a connected sequence of objects from some starting point . a connected-component is a set of objects such that each object is connected to at least one other member of the set and the set is maximal with respect to this property . a maximal complete subgraph is a subgraph such that each node is connected to every other node in the subgraph and the set is maximal with respect to this property , i.e. if one further node were included anywhere the completeness condition would be violated . an example of each is given in figure 3.4 . these methods have been used extensively in keyword-clustering by sparck jones and jackson [32] , augustson and minker [33] and vaswani and cameron [34] . a large class of hierarchic cluster methods is based on the initial measurement of similarity . the most important of these is single-link which is the only one to have extensively used in document-retrieval . it satisfies all the criteria of adequacy mentioned above . in fact , jardine and sibson [2] have shown that under a certain number of reasonable conditions single-link is the only hierarchic method satisfying these important criteria . it will be discussed in some detail in the next section . a further class of cluster methods based on measurement of similarity is the class of so-called ` clump ' methods . they proceed by seeking sets which satisfy certain cohesion and isolation conditions defined in terms of the similarity-measure . the computational difficulties of this approach have largely caused it to be abandoned . an attempt to generate a hierarchy of clumps was made by van rijsbergen [35] but , as expected , the cluster definition was so strict that very few sets could be found to satisfy it . efficiency has been the overriding consideration in the definition of the algorithmically defined cluster methods used in ir . for this reason most of these methods have tended to proceed directly from object description to final classification without an intermediate calculation of a similarity-measure . another distinguishing characteristic of these methods is that they do not seek an underlying structure in the data but attempt to impose a suitable structure on it . this is achieved by restricting the number of clusters and by bounding the size of each cluster . rather than give a detailed account of all the heuristic-algorithms , i shall instead discuss some of the main types and refer the reader to further developments by citing the appropriate authors . before proceeding , we need to define some of the concepts used in designing these algorithms . the most important concept is that of cluster representative variously called cluster profile , classification vector , or centroid . it is simply an object which summaries and represents the objects in the cluster . ideally it should be near to every object in the cluster in some average sense ; hence the use of the term centroid . the similarity of the objects to the representative is measured by a matching-function (sometimes called similarity or correlation function) . the algorithms also use a number of empirically determined parameters such as : (1) the number of clusters desired ; (2) a minimum and maximum size for each cluster ; (3) a threshold-value on the matching-function , below which an object will not be included in a cluster ; (4) the control of overlap between clusters ; (5) an arbitrarily chosen objective-function which is optimised . almost all of the algorithms are iterative , i.e. the final classification is achieved by iteratively improving an intermediate classification . although most algorithms have been defined only for one-level classification , they can obviously be extended to multi-level classification by the simple device of considering the clusters at one level as the objects to be classified at the next level . probably the most important of this kind of algorithm is rocchio 's clustering-algorithm [36] which was developed on the smart project . it operates in three stages . in the first stage it selects (by some criterion) a number of objects as cluster centres . the remaining objects are then assigned to the centres or to a ` rag-bag ' cluster (for the misfits) . on the basis of the initial assignment the cluster representatives are computed and all objects are once more assigned to the clusters . the assignment rules are explicitly defined in terms of thresholds on a matching-function . the final clusters may overlap (i.e. an object may be assigned to more than one cluster) . the second stage is essentially an iterative step to allow the various input parameters to be adjusted so that the resulting classification meets the prior specification of such things as cluster size , etc. more nearly . the third stage is for ` tidying up ' . unassigned objects are forcibly assigned , and overlap between clusters is reduced . most of these algorithms aim at reducing the number of passes that have to be made of the file of object-descriptions . there are a small number of clustering-algorithms which only require one pass of the file of object-descriptions . hence the name ` single-pass algorithm ' for some of them . basically they operate as follows : (1) the object-descriptions are processed serially ; (2) the first object becomes the cluster representative of the first cluster ; (3) each subsequent object is matched against all cluster representatives existing at its processing-time ; (4) a given object is assigned to one cluster (or more if overlap is allowed) according to some condition on the matching-function ; (5) when an object is assigned to a cluster the representative for that cluster is recomputed ; (6) if an object fails a certain test it becomes the cluster representative of a new cluster . once again the final classification is dependent on input parameters which can only be determined empirically (and which are likely to be different for different sets of objects) and must be specified in advance . the simplest version of this kind of algorithm is probably one due to hill [37] . subsequently , many variations have been produced mainly the result of changes in the assignment rules and definition of cluster representatives . (see for example rieber and marathe [38] , johnson and lafuente [39] and etzweiler and martin [40] .) related to the single-pass approach is the algorithm of macqueen [41] which starts with an arbitrary initial partition of the objects . cluster representatives are computed for the members (sets) of the partition , and objects are reallocated to the nearest cluster representative . a third type of algorithm is represented by the work of dattola [42] . his algorithm is based on an earlier algorithm by doyle . as in the case of macqueen , it starts with an initial arbitrary partition and set of cluster representatives . the subsequent processing reallocates the objects , some ending up in a ` rag-bag ' cluster (cf. rocchio) . after each reallocation the cluster representative is recomputed , but the new cluster representative will only replace the old one if the new representative turns out to be nearer in some sense to the objects in the new cluster than the old representative . dattola 's algorithm has been used extensively by murray [43] for generating hierarchic classifications . related to dattola 's approach is that due to crouch [29] . crouch spends more time obtaining the initial partition (he calls them categories) and the corresponding cluster representatives . the initial phase is termed the ` categorisation stage ' , which is followed by the ` classification stage ' . the second stage proceeds to reallocate objects in the normal way . his work is of some interest because of the extensive comparisons he made between the algorithms of rocchio , rieber and marathe , bonner (see below) and his own . one further algorithm that should be mentioned here is that due to litofsky [28] . his algorithm is designed only to work for objects described by binary state attributes . it uses cluster representatives and matching-functions in an entirely different way . the algorithm shuffles objects around in an attempt to minimise the average number of different attributes present in the members of each cluster . the clusters are characterised by sets of attribute values where each set is the set of attributes common to all members of the cluster . the final classification is a hierarchic one . (for further details about this approach see also lefkovitz [44] .) finally , the bonner [45] algorithm should be mentioned . it is a hybrid of the graph-theoretic and heuristic approaches . the initial clusters are specified by graph-theoretic methods (based on an association-measure) , and then the objects are reallocated according to conditions on the matching-function . the major advantage of the algorithmically defined cluster methods is their speed : order n log n (where n is the number of objects to be clustered) compared with order n [2] for the methods based on association measures . however , they have disadvantages . the final classification depends on the order in which the objects are input to the cluster algorithm , i.e. it suffers from the defect of order dependence . in additional the effects of errors in the object-descriptions are unpredictable . one obvious omission from the list of cluster methods is the group of mathematically or statistically based methods such as factor-analysis and latest class-analysis . although both methods were originally used in ir (see borko and bernick [46] , baker [47]) they have now largely been superseded by the cluster methods described above . the method of single-link avoids the disadvantages just mentioned . its appropriateness for document-clustering is discussed here .
