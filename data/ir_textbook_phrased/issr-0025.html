2.2.1 ranking under boolean systems , the status display is a count of the number of items found by the query . every one of the items meet all aspects of the boolean-query . the reasons why an item was selected can easily be traced to and displayed (e.g. , via highlighting) in the retrieved items . hits are retrieved in either a sorted order (e.g. , sort by title) or in time order from the newest to the oldest item . with the introduction of ranking based upon predicted relevance values , the status summary displays the relevance score associated with the item along with a brief descriptor of the item (usually both fit on one display screen line) . the relevance information-retrieval-system capabilities 39 score is an estimate of the search-system on how closely the item satisfies the search statement . typically relevance-scores are normalized to a value between 0.0 and 1.0 . the highest value of 1.0 is interpreted that the system is sure that the item is relevant to the search statement . this allows the user to determine at what point to stop reviewing items because of reduced likelihood of relevance . theoretically every item in the system could be returned but many of the items will have a relevance value of 0.0 (not relevant) . practically , systems have a default minimum value which the user can modify that stops returning items that have a relevance value below the specified value . in addition to ranking based upon the characteristics of the item and the database , in many circumstances collaborative-filtering is providing an option for selecting and ordering output . in this case , users when reviewing items provide feedback to the system on the relative value of the item being accessed . the system accumulates the various user rankings and uses this information to order the output for other user queries that are similar . collaborative-filtering has been very successful in sites such as amazon.com moviefinder.com , and cdnow.com in deciding what products to display to users based upon their queries (herlocker-99) since one line is usually dedicated per item in a summary display , part of a zone truncated by allocated space on the display is typically displayed with the relevance weight of the item . this zone is frequently the title and provides the user with additional-information with the relevance weight to avoid selecting nonrelevant items for review . presenting the actual relevance number seems to be more confusing to the user than presenting a category that the number falls in . for example , some systems create relevance categories and indicate , by displaying items in different colors , which category an item belongs to . other systems uses a nomenclature such as high , medium high , medium , low , and non-relevant . the color technique removes the need for written indication of an item 's relevance , thereby providing additional positions in a line to display more of the title but causes problems with users that suffer from partial or total color-blindness . rather than limiting the number of items that can be assessed by the number of lines on a screen , other graphical-visualization techniques showing the relevance relationships of the hit items can be used . for example , a two or three-dimensional graph can be displayed where points on the graph represent items and the location of the points represent their relative relationship between each other and the user 's query . in some cases color is also used in this representation . this technique allows a user to see the clustering of items by topics and browse through a cluster or move to another topical cluster . this has an analogy of moving through the stacks at a library . in a single-image the user can see the effects of his search statement rather than displaying a few items at a time . information-visualization is also being used in displaying individual items and the terms that contributed to the item 's selection . this graphical display assists the user in determining how to reformulate his query to improve finding the information the user requires . chapter 8 describes information-visualization .
