cellular multi-lists a further modification of the multi-list is inspired by the fact that many storage media are divided into pages , which can be retrieved one at a time . a k-list may cross several page boundaries which means that several pages may have to be accessed to retrieve one record . a modified multi-list structure which avoids this is called a cellular multi-list . the k-lists are limited so that they will not cross the page (cell) boundaries . at this point the full power of the notation introduced before comes into play . the directory for a cellular multi-list will be the set of sequences (ki , ni , hi , ai1 , ... aihi) i = 1 , 2 , ... , m where the hi have been picked to ensure that a ki-list does not cross a page-boundary . in an implementation , just as in the implementation of an index-sequential file , further information will be stored with each address to enable the right page to be located for each key value .
