bibliographic remarks the best introduction to information-retrieval is probably got by reading some of the early papers in the field . luckily many of these have now been collected in book form . i recommend for browsing the books edited by garvin [27] , kochen [28] , borko [29] , schecter [30] and saracevic [31] . it is also worth noting that some of the papers cited in this book may be found in one of these collections and therefore be readily accessible . a book which is well written and can be read without any mathematical background is one by lancaster [2] . more recently , a number of books have come out entirely devoted to information-retrieval and allied topics , they are doyle [32] , salton [33] , paice [34] , and kochen [35] . in particular , the latter half of doyle 's book makes interesting reading since it describes what work in ir was like in the early days (the late 1950s to early 1960s) . a critical view of information-storage-and-retrieval is presented in the paper by senko [20] . this paper is more suitable for people with a computer science background , and is particularly worth reading because of its healthy scepticism of the whole subject . readers more interested in information-retrieval in a library context should read vickery [36] . one early publication worth reading which is rather hard to come by is the report on the cranfield ii project by cleverdon et al. [21] . this report is not really introductory material but constitutes , in my view , one of the milestones in information-retrieval . it is an excellent example of the experimental approach to ir and contains many good ideas which have subsequently been elaborated in the open literature . time spent on this report is well spent . papers on information-retrieval have a tendency to get published in journals on computer-science and library-science . there are , however , a few major journals which are largely devoted to information-retrieval . these are , journal of documentation , information-storage-and-retrieval * , and journal of the american society for information-science . finally , every year a volume in the series annual review of information-science and technology is edited by c. a. cuadra . each volume attempts to cover the new work published in information-storage-and-retrieval for that year . as a source of references to the current literature it is unsurpassed . but they are mainly aimed at the practitioner and as such are a little difficult to read for the uninitiated .
