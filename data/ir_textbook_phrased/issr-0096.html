7 user-search techniques 7.1 search statements and binding 7.2 similarity-measures and ranking 7.3 relevance-feedback 7.4 selective-dissemination-of-information search 7.5 weighted searches of boolean systems 7.6 searching the-internet and hypertext 7.7 summary previous chapters defined the concept of indexing and the data-structures most commonly associated with information-retrieval-systems . chapter 5 described different weighting algorithms associated with processing tokens . applying these algorithms creates a data-structure that can be used in search . chapter 6 describes how clustering can be used to enhance retrieval and reduce the overhead of search . chapter 7 focuses on how search is performed . to understand the search-process , it is first necessary to look at the different binding levels of the search statement entered by the user to the database being searched . the selection and ranking of items is accomplished via similarity-measures that calculate the similarity between the user 's search statement and the weighted stored representation of the semantics in an item . relevance-feedback can help a user enhance search by making use of results from previous searches . this technique uses information from items judged as relevant and non-relevant to determine an expanded search statement . chapter 6 introduces the concept of representing multiple-items via an single averaged representation called a `` centroid . '' searching centroids can reduce search computation , but there is an associated risk of missing relevant items because of the averaging nature of a centroid . hyperlinked items introduce new concepts in search originating from the dynamic nature of the linkages between items .
