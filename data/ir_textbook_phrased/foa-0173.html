8.2.2 sperber and wilson 's `` relevance '' the notion of relevance has been at the heart of much of the foa enterprise , particularly its evaluation (cf. chapter 4) . by making connections to foundational theories of language-games and speech-acts , sperber and wilson offer one of the soundest definitions of what `` relevance '' might mean [sperber and wilson , 1986] . their principle of relevance puts the onus on the communicator : ostensive behaviors (i.e. , those in which there is a manifest intention to inform another) should be taken as guarantees that the sender believes them to be relevant to the receiver . they then provide a pragmatics for the communication , i.e. , why a reader or listener should pay attention : viz. , to improve their knowledge . then the most relevant-information we might convey has two properties : it must be new , or we have not improved the state of knowledge . but it also must be connected to other information , or this new factoid really adds almost nothing . the value of connected information can be made most clear in terms of a logical theorem-proving model (cf. section 6.5) . assuming again that the user already `` knows '' the contents of an intitial knowledge-base e and has a question whether the proposition r is true or false , relevant documents are those that most extend what they know . sperber and wilson 's notion of connected information corresponds exactly to the set of new inferences that are now allowed . sperber and wilson also draw our attention to the importance of the context within which any communicative-act occurs . one aspect of this context is the mutual-knowledge that sender and receiver must have in order for communication to proceed efficiently : mutualknowil u) = {k \ know (h k) lt ; - + know (u , k)} (8.1) mutual-knowledge is that knowledge k that if i know it , you know it too . this deep knowing what you mean , and your knowing that i know , conclusions and future-directions 305 and my knowing that you know that i know , etc. , is what we seek in eye-contact , in email responses , and in `` active '' listening . relevance-feedback is the fundamental communicative-act that this text proposes for the process of assuring mutual-knowledge . the context within which any particular communicative-act occurs has many other dimensions , too . as the earlier mpi example suggested , one of the fundamental issues in www-searching is the confounding of contexts . the author of a journal article from the multimedia community can use mpi with his colleagues and students without any problem or confusion , because they share the same context . but when these journal-articles are mingled with those from the parallel-computing community , using mpi as a sign causes it to straddle two different contexts . in summary , then , the foa language game seems to propose a ternary predicate about connecting keywords and a document with a person who believes that the relation holds .
