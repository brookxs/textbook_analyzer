conclusions and future-directions 299 8.2.1 the foa language game lurking at the core of the entire foa enterprise is the fundamental question of semabtics : what do the words in our language mean ? computer scientists are most familiar with artificial-languages (formal-grammars , programming-languages , etc.) for which precise-semantics in terms of a particular machine are absolutely necessary . many philosophers of language , notably frege and ludwig wittgenstein , have advocated that a similarly precise-semantics of natural-language is also possible . words are predicates about states of the world : either they apply or they do n't an alternative point-of-view says that such a precise and abstract semantics can never be achieved . what language means is what it means to us , the language users . that is , words ' meaning can not be separated from the forms of life of which they are a part . as it happens the same ludwig wittgenstein has argued forcefully on this side of the debate too ! ^ one of wittgenstein 's most useful devices for getting across his theory of language was his notion of the language game (sprachspiele in german) [wittgenstein , 1953] . wittgenstein gives many varieties of language-games , from chidren 's games as simple as `` ring-around-the-rosy '' [wittgenstein , 1953 , section 7] to such `` adult '' games as : ï forming and testing hypotheses ; ï making up a story and reading it ; and ï asking questions . it is interesting to compare the multiplicity of the tools in language and of the ways they are used [wittgenstein , 1953 , section 23] . certainly foa counts as another example of a language game , but one with special rules . another interesting aspect of wittgenstein 's theory is how well it anticipates the models of language meaning arising from modern machine-learning-techniques . the common cause is that wittgenstein was centrally concerned with learning by children . this is evident in his aringaround-the-rosy '' example , and in his explicit attention to consequences of learning that apply equally well to our algorithms : [consider] two pictures , one of which consists of colour patches with vague contours , and the other of patches ... with clear contours . the degree to which the sharp picture can resemble early versus late wittgenstein 300 finding out about the blurred one depends on the latter 's degree of vagueness ___ wo n't you then have to say : `` anything and nothing is right . '' and this is the position you are in if you look for the definition corresponding to our concepts in aesthetics or ethics . in such a difficulty always ask yourself : how did we learn the meaning of this word [vague] ? from what sort of examples ? in what language-games ? then it will be easier for you to see that the word must have a family of meanings . [wittgenstein 1953 , sections 76 , 77] our current versions of the foa language-games are tied to the technologies by which we are currently allowed to communicate with one another . for now , centralized search-engines are in the center of this dialog . authors write and sometimes try to influence the audiences their documents reach . later , readers use a few of the first words that come to mind to tease out some possible answers . search-engines do their best to connect these two vocabularies . reading and writing are the primitive language-games on which foa is based . the tools available to help writers and readers are currently strong constraints in the foa rules . people can only express what they are allowed to express . if only simple query-languages are available , only simple questions will be asked . if all documents are treated interchangeably , as context-free samples of text , then the tacit context assumed by the author is not available . and so , our abilities to automatically learn what the words really do mean to authors and to readers will change as the evidence in the www dialogs changes . especially unclear are guarantees about communication privacy-and-security : if we believe all our words are for everyone 's ears , then many things will never be said via the net . if search-engines watch over our shoulders as we browse , should we be grateful because it will understand what we mean , or should we send them a bill for the valuable training-data we have provided ? as companies like amazon.com8 use new-technologies that allow them to `` eavesdrop '' on commercial transactions ^ consumers must ultimately decide what their privacy and more effective indexing are worth to them personally . 1 ajnazon.com * newb.cnet.oom / news/0 -1007 -200 -1 s17791 . html conclusions and future-directions 301 passion figure 8.2 the semiotic view semiotics the next step toward a theory of what the foa language game might mean involves semiotics , the subfield of linguistics centrally concerned with the ability of signs to convey meaning . dating back at least to the american pragmatist philosopher c. s. peirce and the french linguist saussure , semiotics is now often associated with umberto eco (most famous for his popular novel name of the rose [eco , 1983]) . david blair has written an excellent overview of the field [blair , 1990 , chapter 4] . in order to get away from using words as communicative signs , semioticists often use other symbols , such as the rose shown in figure 8.2 in brief , semiotic theory imagines meaning being trapped by the triad of signifier , signified , and sign . hawkes (quoted from blair) uses a gift of roses as an example of how meaning can be conveyed : ... a bunch of roses can be used to signify passion . when it does so , the bunch of roses is the signifier , the passion the signified . the relation between the two (the associative total) produces the third term , the bunch of roses as a sign . and , as a sign it is important to understand that the bunch of roses is quite a different thing from the bunch of roses as a signifier , that is , as a horticultural entity . as a signifies the bunch of roses is empty , as a sign it is full . what has filled it (with signification) is a combination of my intent and the nature of society 's conventional modes and channels which offer me a range of vehicles for the purpose . the range is extensive , 302 finding out about i 'm looking for documents about `` message-passing-interface '' `` mpi '' `` mpi '' `` multi-perspective interactive (video) '' figure 8.3 a semiotic analysis of keyword mismatch but conventionalized and so finite , and it offers a complex-system of ways , of signing . [hawkes , 1977 , p. 131 , quoted from blair , 1990 , monospace font not in original] that is , in a successful communicative-act , the sign of roses successfully unites what the signifier was trying to express with what the receiving listener thinks they are pointing at , i.e. , the content of the sign . figure 8.3 applies this analysis to the case when a mediating search-engine stands between linguistic sign users . when a keyword like mpi is used as part of a query by a user-intent on the features of the message-passing-interface (a communication-standard used by parallel-computers and language compilers) , it is confounded with documents authored by people who use mpi to mean multi-perspective interactive (video) . the same signifier mpi points to two different significations . if a specialist in parallel-computing has multimedia video documents returned by the search-engine , the communication of a unifying sign has not been accomplished . speech-acts certainly the communication going on between sender and receiver of flowers is different from that between www author and browser . one important difference is that flowers , like spoken oral language , happen in the moment between two people who know one another . the www , conclusions and future-directions 303 1 . quantity 1.1 . make your contribution as informative as required . 1.2 . do not make your contribution more informative than is required . 2 . quality 2.1 . do not say what you believe to be false . 2.2 . do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence . 3 . relation 3.1 . be relevant . 4 . manner 4.1 . avoid obscurity of expression . 4.2 . avoid ambiguity . 4.3 . be brief . 4.4 . be orderly . figure 8.4 grice 's maxims from [grice , 1975] . reproduced with permission of academic press like libraries , contains written language , which communicates between readers and writers separated by arbitrary amounts of time and space . differences between orality and literacy are some of the most important to understand if foa is to become a part of traditional linguistics [ong , 1982] . an important dimension of the difference between oral and literate communication concerns the attentional focus of sender and receiver and how and when it is given . before any symbols can be exchanged , the sender must apply attention to the construction of a message , and before a receiver can understand it he or she must be `` listening . '' communication is a demand for attention by the author and of a reader . grice has defined what he calls the cooperative principle to make explicit the co-dependence of sender and receiver 's communicative tasks [grice , 1957 ; grice , 1975] . grice 's maxims (see figure 8.4) help to codify ways in which this tacit contract can lead to meaningful communication or be broken . '' ^ '' although these were drafted with oral communica - star trek script tion in mind , they remain (with strunk and white 's elements of style generator [strunk and white , 1979]) excellent advice to authors on how to write clearly . a second important difference between oral-and-written-communication is its intimacy . spoken-language is imagined to be a quiet act , between a particular speaker and a listener . the foa communicative-acts with which we are most concerned involve much more public-displays of language . in 1975 , saracevic [saracevic , 1975] talked about this as 304 finding out about communicating public knowledge , a concept `` as pertinent now as when it was written '' [sparck jones and willett , 1997 , p. 86] . the author had an intended audience in mind when he or she wrote , but once the document is written and published , it is (like graffiti !) there for all to read . search-engines connect huge sets of authors with vast audiences of readers . the language used in queries and indexing vocabularies is bound to be loud and broad .
