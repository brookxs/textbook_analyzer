6.5.3 discovering latent knowledge within a corpus nothing is more frustrating than spending many hours on a technical problem , unless it is finding out later that someone else had previously solved the same problem ! one of the motivations shared by many people working on search-engine technology is the hope that we can reduce the number of times the same wheel is reinvented . d. r. swanson has concentrated on the scientific and medical literature and viewed it as `` a potential source of new knowledge '' [swanson , 1990 ; swanson and smalheiser , 1997] . each new medical report contains new knowledge about some particular disease or treatment . but swanson has taken the next step : to imagine what modes of inference might be most appropriate across a network of such papers , each of which describes potential causal-relations : each scientific article contributes to a web of logical connections that interlace the literature of science . some of these connections are made explicit through references from one article to another , citations that reflect , among other things , authors ' perceptions of how their own work is related to that of others and how it fits into the scheme of existing knowledge . however , there may exist many implicit logical interarticle inference beyond the index 235 connections that are unintended and not marked by citations ; such implicit-links are the focus of this paper . (the word `` logical '' here is used informally ; a `` logical connection '' is formed by statements that are related by any process of scientific-reasoning or argument .) scientific articles can be seen as clustering into more or less independent-sets or `` literatures . '' within each set , common problems are addressed , common arguments are advanced , and articles `` interact '' by citing one another . distinct literatures that are essentially unrelated are in general `` noninteractive '' in that they do not cite or refer directly to each other , have no articles in common , and are not cited together by other articles . on the other hand , if two literatures are linked by arguments that they respectively put forward - that is , are `` logically '' related or connected - one would expect them to cite each other . if they do not , then the logical connections between them would be of great interest , for such connections may be unintended , unnoticed , and unknown - therefore potential sources of new knowledge ... the number of possible pairs of literatures (that might be connected) increases very nearly as the square of the number of literatures ; the number of possible connections increases at even a greater rate if triple or higher combinations are taken into account rather than just pairs . from this perspective , the significance of the `` information explosion '' may lie not in an explosion of quantity per se , but in an incalculably greater combinatorial explosion of unnoticed logical connections , (pp. 29 , 35) swanson 's first and most well-known example of new knowledge discovered in this fashion identified fish oil as a treatment for raynaud 's syndrome , a circulatory problem resulting in poor blood supply to the extremities . figure 6.22 shows a second example of swanson 's method . beginning with a syndrome like migraine headaches , swanson searches the literature for features mentioned in the context of migraines that have also been mentioned in a second , disjoint , `` mutually oblivious '' literature . working backwards from the syndrome to be explained , a query is formed against a medical-corpus like medline . the resulting set of 236 finding out about step 3 : seek common cause magnesiums 6 = 65 / reduced_by tress , type a behavior a reduces t vascular tone type_of / calcium blocker inhibits pneading cortial depres pnea suscept_to + epilepsy inhibit platetlet aggregabilit} . inhibit erbtonin-induced inhibit substance p aggrevated_by rotoglandin release inhbiits inflamation prevents hypoxia step 2 : analyze results d = 63 assoc stress , type a behaviw suscept_to + \ vascular tone \ prevented.by v \ calcium blocker \ \ caused_by \ r cortial depre caused_by epilepsy symptom gp.atetlet aggregability '' symptom s sensitive to se caused_by substance p / aggrevated_by protoglandin released assoc / sterile inflamation of cerebral-blood-vessel caused ^ by cerebral hypoxia step 1 : form query migraines figure 6.22 swanson 's search for latent knowledge (in this case 63) documents is then analyzed and clustered into related sets ; it is in this clustering that swanson 's manual , intellectual effort is most obvious . the clusters are used to suggest new additional queries . finally , the single common `` cause '' of magnesium is identified . figure 6.22 also shows an attempt to classify the relationship between common phrases in the retrieved literature and the relation to the syndrome . further , the relationship between these same phrases (or lexical variations on them !) and the common cause magnesium is also forced into structured relationships . it is hard to imagine a more exciting prospect for the analysis of all literature . the identification of such `` undiscovered public knowledge '' is almost certainly possible in many other situations . the question inference beyond the index 237 becomes how we might algorithmically search for all of them . note especially the liberties taken in interpreting the literature and phrases used consistently within it as they have been transformed into the structured relations of figure 6.22 . these relations are meant to suggest more formal and powerful modes of inference between causes and effects mentioned within each paper . some of the arrowheads show suggested causal-relationships ; some relationships (e.g. , associated_with) are neutral with respect to correlation versus causation ; others (type.of) suggest hierarchic relations between classes . swanson is aware of these difficulties : ... [the] form and structure of logically connected arguments are in general recognizable by scientists irrespective of their specialty , a point that may have implications for research on futuristic , more fully automated systems . however , the simple structure of the syllogistic model does not in many respects reflect the depth or range of actual problems that would be encountered if one tried to build a database of logical connections ___ the objective , moreover , is not simply to draw mechanistic logical inferences , but rather to determine whether certain plausible connections or hypotheses appear to be worth testing . most articles harbor , either explicitly or implicitly , an enormous number of logical connections . which connections are relevant and important can be determined only in the light of a specific context , hypothesis , problem , or question ; but such contexts and questions are always changing . the degree to which one can hope to encode logical connections in any form suitable for all future uses may therefore be quite limited . [swanson , 1990 , p. 35] recognizing that even if fully automatic discovery of new facts is currently too hard , gordon and lindsey have investigated forms of `` discovery support '' [gordon and lindsay , 1996] . gordon and duraais have also explored the use of lsi techniques (cf. section 5.2.3) as part of the literature-based discovery process [gordon and dumais , 1998] . the formation of an svd , eigenstructure analysis of the relationship between a query and documents (step 2) , and then the analysis of these intermediate literatures and ultimate causes (step 3) is an 238 finding out about important extension beyond the manual investigations originally proposed by swanson .
