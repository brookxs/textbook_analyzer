6.3.1 formats there is no single format for a text-document , and an ir-system should be able to retrieve information from many of them . in the past , ir systems would convert a document to an internal format . however , that has many disadvantages , because the original application related to the document is not useful any more . on top of that , we can not change the contents of a document . current ir systems have filters that can handle most popular documents , in particular those of word processors with some binary syntax such as word , wordperfect or framemaker . even then , good filters might not be possible if the format is proprietary and its details are not public . this is not the case for full ascii syntax , as in tex documents . although documents can be in a binary-format (for example , parts of a word document) , documents that are represented in human-readable ascii form imply more portability and are easier to modify (for example , they can be edited with different applications) . other text formats were developed for document interchange . among these we should mention the rich text format (rtf) , which is used by word processors and has ascii syntax . other important formats were developed for displaying or printing documents . the most popular ones are the portable document-format (pdf) and postscript (which is a powerful programming-language for drawing) . other interchange-formats are used to encode electronic-mail , for example mime (multipurpose internet mail exchange) . mime supports multiple character-sets , multiple languages , and multiple-media . on top of these formats , nowadays many files are compressed . text-compression is treated in detail in chapter 7 , but here we comment on the most text 145 popular compression software and associated formats . these include compress (unix) , arj (pcs) , and zip (for example gzip in unix and winzip in windows) . other tools allow us to convert binary files , in particular compressed text , to ascii text such that it can be transmitted through a communication line using only seven bits . examples of these tools are uuencode/uudecode and binhex .
