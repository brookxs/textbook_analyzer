6.2 hypertext , imtradociraient links since the very first papyrus scrolls were used to capture written language , it has become natural to conceive of text as a single , linear , and continuous of course , the fact that one happens to be positive values and the other negative is completely circumstantial ! 200 finding out about thread , authored and then read as a single stream . but as books became longer , tables of contents were prepended , indices were appended , and the opportunities for traversing the text in fundamentally nonlinear ways became more common . we are becoming interested in other kinds of documents , many of which bring their own special structures and writing conventions , for example , the abstract paragraph , introductions , and conclusions of longer papers and the `` methods '' sections in scientific papers . in news-reporting , spiral exposition is often used ; a news item is summarized in the first paragraph , then treated in more detail in the paragraphs that fit on page 1 or `` above the fold '' of the newspaper , and in still more detail in the body of the article . the attempt to analyze , support , and create such nonlinear hypertext relations among documents began long before the www made hypertext-links commonplace ; vannevar-bush 's `` as we may think `` 7 article (published in 1945 !) [bush , 1945] and ted-nelson 's revolutionary xanadus project [nelson , 1987] are often mentioned as seminal works . mice and graphical-interfaces made clicking on one textual passage , to jump to another , second nature . hypertext conferences focusing on these new issues began in the mid-1980s and have taken on new energy as the http protocols and html authoring languages made it easy to support many kinds of intra - and interdocument relations [conklin , 1987 ; conklin and begman , 1988 ; agosti et al. , 1992 ; agosti and marchetti , 1992 ; bruza and weide , 1992 ; egan et al. , 1991] . in the process , many types of linkages between documents have been proposed . the following sections mention some of the most common and useful , sometimes using this foa text (self-referentially !) as examples .
