multi-lists a multi-list is really only a slightly modified-inverted-file . there is one list per keyword , i.e. hi = 1 . the records containing a particular keyword ki are chained together to form the ki-list and the start of the ki-list is given in the directory , as illustrated in figure 4.6 . since there is no k3-list , the field reserved for its pointer could well have been omitted . so could any blank pointer field , so long as no ambiguity arises as to which pointer belongs to which keyword . one way of ensuring this , particularly if the data-values (attribute-values) are fixed format , is to have the pointer not pointing to the beginning of the record but pointing to the location of the next pointer in the chain . the multi-list is designed to overcome the difficulties of updating an inverted-file . the addresses in the directory of an inverted-file are normally kept in record-number order . but , when the time comes to add a new record to the file , this sequence must be maintained , and inserting the new address can be expensive . no such problem arises with the multi-list , we update the appropriate k-lists by simply chaining in the new record . the penalty we pay for this is of course the increase in search-time . this is in fact typical of many of the file-structures . inherent in their design is a trade-off between search-time and update time .
