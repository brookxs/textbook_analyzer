10.2.1 design-principles offer informative feedback this principle is especially important for information-access interfaces . in this chapter we will see current ideas about how to provide human-computer-interaction 259 users with feedback about the relationship between their query-specification and documents retrieved , about relationships among retrieved documents , and about relationships between retrieved documents and metadata describing collections . if the user has control of how and when feedback is provided , then the system provides an internal locus-of-control reduce working-memory-load . information-access is an iterative-process , the goals of which shift and change as information is encountered . one key way information-access interfaces can help with memory-load is to provide mechanisms for keeping track of choices made during the search-process , allowing users to return to temporarily abandoned strategies , jump from one strategy to the next , and retain information and context across search-sessions . another memory-aiding device is to provide browsable information that is relevant to the current stage of the information-access process . this includes suggestions of related terms or metadata , and search starting-points including lists of sources and topic lists . provide alternative-interfaces for novice and expert-users . an important tradeoff in all user-interface-design is that of simplicity versus power . simple interfaces are easier to learn , at the expense of less flexibility and sometimes less efficient use . powerful interfaces allow a knowledgeable user to do more and have more control over the operation of the interface , but can be time-consuming to learn and impose a memory burden on people who use the system only intermittently . a common solution is to use a ` scaffolding ' technique [684] . the novice-user is presented with a simple interface that can be learned quickly and that provides the basic functionality of the application , but is restricted in power and flexibility . alternative-interfaces are offered for more experienced users , giving them more control , more options , and more features , or potentially even entirely different interaction-models . good user-interface-design provides intuitive bridges between the simple and the advanced-interfaces . information-access interfaces must contend with special kinds of simplicity/power tradeoffs . one such tradeoff is the amount of information shown about the workings of the search-system itself . users who are new to a system or to a particular collection may not know enough about the system or the domain associated with the collection to make choices among complex features . they may not know how best to weight terms , or in the case of relevance-feedback , not know what the effects of reweighting terms would be . on the other hand , users that have worked with a system and gotten a feeling for a topic are likely to be able to choose among suggested terms to add to their query in an informed manner . determining how much information to show the user of the system is a major design choice in information-access interfaces .
