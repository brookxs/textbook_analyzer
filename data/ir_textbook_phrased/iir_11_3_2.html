probability-estimates in theory for each term , what would these numbers look like for the whole collection ? odds-ratio-ct-contingency gives a contingency-table of counts of documents in the collection , where is the number of documents that contain term : using this , and and (74) add (75) adding in this way is a simple form of smoothing . for trials with categorical outcomes (such as noting the presence or absence of a term) , one way to estimate the probability of an event from data is simply to count the number of times an event occurred divided by the total number of trials . this is referred to as the relative-frequency of the event . estimating the probability as the relative-frequency is the maximum-likelihood-estimate (or mle) , because this value makes the observed data maximally likely . however , if we simply use the mle , then the probability given to events we happened to see is usually too high , whereas other events may be completely unseen and giving them as a probability-estimate their relative-frequency of 0 is both an underestimate , and normally breaks our models , since anything multiplied by 0 is 0 . simultaneously decreasing the estimated probability of seen events and increasing the probability of unseen events is referred to as smoothing . one simple way of smoothing is to add a number to each of the observed counts . these pseudocounts correspond to the use of a uniform-distribution over the vocabulary as a bayesian prior , following equation 59 . we initially assume a uniform-distribution over events , where the size of denotes the strength of our belief in uniformity , and we then update the probability based on observed events . since our belief in uniformity is weak , we use . this is a form of maximum a posteriori (map) estimation , where we choose the most likely point value for probabilities based on the prior and the observed evidence , following equation 59 . we will further discuss methods of smoothing estimated counts to give probability-models in section 12.2.2 (page) ; the simple method of adding to each observed count will do for now .
