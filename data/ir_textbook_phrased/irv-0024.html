the cluster-hypothesis before describing the battery of classification-methods that are now used in information-retrieval , i should like to discuss the underlying hypothesis for their use in document-clustering . this hypothesis may be simply stated as follows : closely associated documents tend to be relevant to the same requests . i shall refer to this hypothesis as the cluster-hypothesis . a basic assumption in retrieval-systems is that documents relevant to a request are separated from those which are not relevant , i.e. that the relevant documents are more like one another than they are like non-relevant documents . whether this is true for a collection can be tested as follows . compute the association between all pairs of documents : (a) both of which are relevant to a request , and (b) one of which is relevant and the other non-relevant . summing over a set of requests gives the relative distribution of relevant-relevant (r-r) and relevant-non-relevant (r-n-r) associations of a collection . plotting the relative-frequency against strength of association for two hypothetical collections x and y we might get distributions as shown in figure 3.2 . from these it is apparent : (a) that the separation for collection x is good while for y it is poor ; and (b) that the strength of the association between relevant documents is greater for x than for y. figure 3.2 . r-r is the distribution of relevant-relevant associations , and r-n-r is the distribution of relevant-non-relevant associations . it is this separation between the distributions that one attempts to exploit in document-clustering . it is on the basis of this separation that i would claim that document-clustering can lead to more effective retrieval than say a linear search . a linear search ignores the relationship that exists between documents . if the hypothesis is satisfied for a particular collection (some promising results have been published in jardine and van rijsbergen [10] , and van rijsbergen and sparck jones [27] for three test-collections) , then it is clear that structuring the collection in such a way that the closely associated documents appear in one class , will not only speed up the retrieval but may also make it more effective , since a class once found will tend to contain only relevant and no non-relevant documents . i should add that these conclusions can only be verified , finally , by experimental work on a large number of collections . one reason for this is that although it may be possible to structure a document-collection so that relevant documents are brought together there is no guarantee that a search-strategy will infallibly find the class of documents containing the relevant documents . it is a matter for experimentation whether one can design search-strategies which will do the job . so far most experiments in document-clustering have been moderately successful but by no means conclusive . note that the cluster-hypothesis refers to given document descriptions . the object of making permanent or temporary changes to a description by such techniques as keyword classifications can therefore be expressed as an attempt to increase the distance between the two distributions r-r and r-n-r . that is , we want to make it more likely that we will retrieve relevant documents and less likely that we will retrieve non-relevant ones . as can be seen from the above , the cluster-hypothesis is a convenient way of expressing the aim of such operations as document-clustering . of course , it does not say anything about how the separation is to be exploited .
