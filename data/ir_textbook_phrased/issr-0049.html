72 chapter 4 4.1 introduction to data-structures there are usually two major data-structures in any information-system . one structure stores and manages the received items in their normalized-form . the process supporting this structure is called the `` document-manager . '' the other major data-structure contains the processing tokens and associated data to support search . figure 4.1 expands the document file-creation function in figure 1.4 from chapter 1 , showing the document manager function . details on the creation of processing tokens can be found in section 1.3.1 . the results of a search are references to the items that satisfy the search statement , which are passed to the document manager for retrieval . this chapter focuses on data-structures used to support the search function . it does not address the document management function nor the data-structures and other related theory associated with the parsing of queries . for that background the reader should pursue a text on finite-automata and language (regular-expressions) . item normalization [document file-creation ' ^ * 贸 document document-manager search manager i r ------- ^ ^ co t3 m zj o u 5gt ; 贸j o - n ^ 33 o o ot (t1 mnai hfil ^ 贸 贸 ^ m lt ; o figure 4.1 major data-structures data-structure 73 one of the first transformations often applied to data before placing it in the searchable data-structure is stemming . stemming reduces the diversity of representations of a concept (word) to a canonical morphological representation . the risk with stemming is that concept discrimination-information may be lost in the process , causing a decrease in precision and the ability for ranking to be performed . on the positive side , stemming has the potential to improve recall . the most common data structure encountered in both data-base and information systems is the inverted-file system (discussed in section 4.3) . it minimizes secondary-storage access when multiple search-terms are applied across the total database . all commercial and most academic systems use inversion as the searchable data-structure . a variant of the searchable data-structure is the n-gram structure that breaks processing tokens into smaller string units (which is why it is sometimes discussed under stemming) and uses the token fragments for search . ngrams have demonstrated improved efficiencies and conceptual manipulations over full word inversion . pat trees and arrays view the text of an item as a single long stream versus a juxtaposition of words . around this paradigm search-algorithms are defined based upon text strings . signature-files are based upon the idea of fast elimination of non-relevant items reducing the searchable items to a manageable subset . the subset can be returned to the user for review or other search-algorithms may be applied to it to eliminate any false hits that passed the signature filter . a special data-structure that is becoming common place because of its use on the internet is hypertext . this structure allows the creator of an item to manually or automatically create imbedded links within one item to a related item .
