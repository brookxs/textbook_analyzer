introduction in this chapter i shall attempt to present a coherent account of classification in such a way that the principles involved will be sufficiently understood for anyone wishing to use classification-techniques in ir to do so without too much difficulty . the emphasis will be on their application in document-clustering , although many of the ideas are applicable to pattern-recognition , automatic medical-diagnosis , and keyword-clustering . a formal-definition of classification will not be attempted ; for our purposes it is sufficient to think of classification as describing the process by which a classificatory system is constructed . the word ` classification ' is also used to describe the result of such a process . although indexing is often thought of (wrongly i think) as ` classification ' we specifically exclude this meaning . a further distinction to be made is between ` classification ' and ` diagnosis ' . everyday language is very ambiguous on this point : ` how would you classify (identify) this ? ' ` how are these best classified (grouped) ? ' the first example refers to diagnosis whereas the second talks about classification proper . these distinctions have been made before in the literature by kendall [1] and jardine and sibson [2] . in the context of information-retrieval , a classification is required for a purpose . here i follow macnaughton-smith [3] who states : ` all classifications , even the most general are carried out for some more or less explicit `` special purpose '' or set of purposes which should influence the choice of [classification] method and the results obtained . ' the purpose may be to group the documents in such a way that retrieval will be faster or alternatively it may be to construct a thesaurus automatically . whatever the purpose the ` goodness ' of the classification can finally only be measured by its performance during retrieval . in this way we can side-step the debate about ` natural ' and ` best ' classifications and leave it to the philosophers (see for example hempel [4]) . there are two main areas of application of classification-methods in ir : (1) keyword-clustering ; (2) document-clustering . the first area is very well dealt with in a recent book by sparck jones [5] . document-clustering , although recommended forcibly by salton and his co-workers , has had very little impact . one possible reason is that the details of salton 's work on document-clustering became submerged under the welter of experiments performed on the smart system . another is possibly that as the early enthusiasm for clustering wanted , the realisation dawned that significant experiments in this area required quantities of expensive data and large amounts of computer time . good [6] and fairthorne [7] were amongst the first to recommend that automatic-classification might prove useful in document-retrieval . a clear statement of what is implied by document-clustering was made early on by r. m. hayes [8] : ` we define the organisation as the grouping together of items (e.g. documents , representations of documents) which are then handled as a unit and lose , to that extent , their individual identities . in other words , classification of a document into a classification slot , to all intents and purposes identifies the document with that slot . thereafter , it and other documents in the slot are treated as identical until they are examined individually . it would appear , therefore , that documents are grouped because they are in some sense related to each other ; but more basically , they are grouped because they are likely to be wanted together , and logical-relationship is the means of measuring this likelihood . ' in the main , people have achieved the ` logical organisation ' in two different ways . firstly , through direct classification of the documents , and secondly via the intermediate calculation of a measure of closeness between documents . the first approach has proved theoretically to be intractable so that any experimental test results can not be considered to be reliable . the second approach to classification is fairly well documented now , and above all , there are some forceful arguments recommending it in a particular form . it is this approach which is to be emphasised here . the efficiency of document-clustering has been emphasised by salton [9] , he says : ` clearly in practice it is not possible to match each analysed document with each analysed search request because the time consumed by such operation would be excessive . various solutions have been proposed to reduce the number of needed comparisons between information items and requests . a particular promising one generates groups of related documents , using an automatic document matching procedure . a representative document group vector is then chosen for each document group , and a search request is initially checked against all the group vectors only . thereafter , the request is checked against only those individual documents where group vectors show a high score with the request . ' salton believes that although document-clustering saves time , it necessarily reduces the effectiveness of a retrieval-system . i believe a case has been made showing that on the contrary document-clustering has potential for improving the effectiveness (jardine and van rijsbergen [10]) .
