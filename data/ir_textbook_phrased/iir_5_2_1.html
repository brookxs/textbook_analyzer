dictionary as a string 5.3 for reuters-rcv1 , we need for storing the dictionary in this scheme . dictionary-as-a-string storage.pointers mark the end of the preceding term and the beginning of the next . for example , the first three terms in this example are systile , syzygetic , and syzygial . using fixed-width entries for terms is clearly wasteful . the average length of a term in english is about eight characters icompresstb1 , so on average we are wasting twelve characters (or 24 bytes) in the fixed-width scheme . also , we have no way of storing terms with more than twenty characters like hydrochlorofluorocarbons and supercalifragilisticexpialidocious . we can overcome these shortcomings by storing the dictionary terms as one long string of characters , as shown in figure 5.4 . the pointer to the next term is also used to demarcate the end of the current term . as before , we locate terms in the data-structure by way of binary-search in the (now smaller) table . this scheme saves us 60 % compared to fixed-width storage - 24 bytes on average of the 40 bytes 12 bytes on average of the 20 bytes we allocated for terms before . however , we now also need to store term pointers . the term pointers resolve positions , so they need to be bits or 3 bytes long . in this new scheme , we need for the reuters-rcv1 dictionary : 4 bytes each for frequency and postings pointer , 3 bytes for the term pointer , and bytes on average for the term . so we have reduced the space requirements by one third from 19.211.2 to 10.87.6 mb . blocked storage with four terms per block.the first block consists of systile , syzygetic , syzygial , and syzygy with lengths of seven , nine , eight , and six characters , respectively . each term is preceded by a byte encoding its length that indicates how many bytes to skip to reach subsequent terms .
