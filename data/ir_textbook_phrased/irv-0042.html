ring structures a ring is simply a linear list that closes upon itself . in terms of the definition of a k-list , the beginning and end of the list are the same record . this data-structure is particularly useful to show classification of data . let us suppose that a set of documents {dl , d2 , d3 , d4 , d5 , d6 , d7 , d8} has been classified into four groups , that is {(dl , d2) , (d3 , d4) , (d5 , d6) , (d7 , d8)} furthermore these have themselves been classified into two groups , {((dl , d2) , (d3 , d4)) , ((d5 , d6) , (d7 , d8))} the dendrogram for this structure would be that given in figure 4.7 . to represent this in storage by means of ring structures is now a simple matter (see figure 4.8) . the di indicates a description (representation) of a document . notice how the rings at a lower level are contained in those at a higher level . the field marked ci normally contains some identifying information with respect to the ring it subsumes . for example , c1 in some way identifies the class of documents {d1 , d2} . were we to group documents according to the keywords they shared , then for each keyword we would have a group of documents , namely , those which had that keyword in common . ci would then be the field containing the keyword uniting that particular group . the rings would of course overlap (figure 4.9) , as in this example : d1 = {k1 , k2} d2 = {k2 , k3} d3 = {k1 , k4} the usefulness of this kind of structure will become more apparent when we discuss searching of classifications . if each ring has associated with it a record which contains identifying information for its members , then , a search-strategy searching a structure such as this will first look at ci (or ki in the second example) to determine whether to proceed or abandon the search .
