3.3.3 the cystic-fibrosis collection the cystic-fibrosis (cf) collection [721] is composed of 1239 documents indexed with the term * cystic-fibrosis ' in the national-library-of-medicine 's medigital libraryine database . each document contains the following fields : reference collections 95 collection subject num . docs num . queries adi information-science 82 35 cacm computer-science 3200 64 isi library-science 1460 76 cran aeronautics 1400 225 lisa library-science 6004 35 med medicine 1033 30 nlm medicine 3078 155 npl elec. engineering 11,429 100 time general articles 423 83 table 3.4 test-collections related to the cacm and isi collections . ï medigital libraryine accession number ï author ï title ï source ï major subjects ï minor subjects ï abstract (or extract) ï references ï citations . the collection also includes 100 information requests (generated by an expert with two decades of clinical and research experience with cystic-fibrosis) and the documents relevant to each query . further , 4 separate relevance-scores are provided for each relevant-document . these relevance-scores can be 0 (which indicates non-relevance) , 1 (which indicates marginal relevance) , and 2 (which indicates high relevance) . thus , the overall relevance score for a document (relative to a given query) varies from 0 to 8 . three of the relevance-scores were provided by subject experts while the fourth relevance score was provided by a medical bibliographer . table 3.5 provides some statistics regarding the information requests in the cf collection . we notice that the number of queries with at least one relevant-document is close to the total number of queries in the collection . further , for various relevance thresholds (the minimum value of relevance score used to characterize relevance) , the average number of relevant documents per query is between 10 and 30 . the cf collection , despite its small size , has two important characteristics . first , its set of relevance-scores was generated directly by human experts through a careful evaluation-strategy . second , it includes a good number of information requests (relative to the collection-size) and , as a result , the respective query-vectors present overlap among themselves . this allows experimentation 96 retrieval-evaluation relevance queries min . num . max . num . avg . num . threshold at least 1 rel docs rel docs rel docs rel doc 1 100 2 189 31.9 2 100 1 130 18.1 3 99 1 119 14.9 4 99 1 114 14.1 5 99 1 93 10.7 6 _________ 94 __________ 1 ___________ 53 __________ 6.4 table 3.5 summary statistics for the information requests in the cf collection . with retrieval-strategies which take advantage of past query sessions to improve retrieval-performance .
