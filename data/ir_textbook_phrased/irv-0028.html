single-link and the minimum spanning-tree the single-link tree (such as the one shown in figure 3.5) is closely related to another kind of tree : the minimum spanning-tree , or mst , also derived from a dissimilarity coefficient (gower and ross [50]) . this second tree is quite different from the first , the nodes instead of representing clusters represent the individual objects to be clustered . the mst is the tree of minimum length connecting the objects , where by ` length ' i mean the sum of the weights of the connecting links in the tree . similarly we can define a maximum-spanning-tree as one of maximum length . whether we are interested in a minimum or maximum-spanning-tree depends entirely on the application we have in mind . for convenience we will concentrate on the minimum-spanning-tree since it derives naturally from a dissimilarity coefficient and is more common anyway . (in chapter 6 we shall have cause to use a maximum-spanning-tree based on the expected mutual-information measure .) given the minimum spanning-tree then the single-link clusters are obtained by deleting links from the mst in order of decreasing length ; the connected sets after each deletion are the single-link clusters . the order of deletion and the structure of the mst ensure that the clusters will be nested into a hierarchy . the mst contains more information than the single-link hierarchy and only indirectly information about the single-link clusters . thus , although we can derive the single-link hierarchy from it by a simple thresholding process , we can not reverse this and uniquely derive the mst from the single-link hierarchy . it is interesting to consider in the light of this whether the mst would not be more suitable for document-clustering than the single-link hierarchy . unfortunately , it does not seem possible to update a spanning-tree dynamically . to add a new object to a single-link hierarchy is relatively straightforward but to add one to an mst is much more complicated . the representation of the single-link hierarchy through an mst has proved very useful in connecting single-link with other clustering-techniques [51] . for example , boulton and wallace [52] have shown , using the mst representation , that under suitable assumptions the single-link hierarchy will minimise their information-measure of classification . they see classification as a way of economically describing the original object-descriptions , and the best classification is one which does it most economically in an information-theoretic sense . it is interesting that the mst has , independently of their work , been used to reduce storage when storing object-descriptions , which amounts to a practical application of their result [53] .
