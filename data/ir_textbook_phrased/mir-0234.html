12.2 background รณ spatial-access-methods as mentioned earlier , the idea is to map objects into points in / - d space , and to use multiattribute access-methods (also referred to as spatial-access-methods or sams) to cluster them and to search for them . thus , a brief introduction to multidimensional-indexing methods (or spatial-access-methods) is in order . the prevailing methods form three classes : (1) r * - trees and the rest of the r-tree-family , (2) linear-quadtrees , and (3) grid-files . several of these methods explode exponentially with the dimensionality , eventually reducing to sequential-scanning . for linear-quadtrees , the effort is proportional to the hypersurface of the query region [244] ; the hypersurface grows exponentially with the dimensionality . grid files face similar problems , since they require a directory that grows exponentially with the dimensionality . the r-tree-based methods seem to be most robust for higher dimensions , provided that the fanout of the r-tree nodes remains gt ; 2 . below , we give a brief description of the r-tree method and its variants , since it is one of the typical representatives of spatial-access-methods . the r-tree represents a spatial object by its minimum bounding rectangle (mbr) . data rectangles are grouped to form parent nodes , which are recursively grouped , to form grandparent nodes and , eventually , a tree-hierarchy . the mbr of a parent node completely contains the mbrs of its children ; mbrs are allowed to overlap . nodes of the tree correspond to disk pages . disk pages , or ` disk blocks ' , are consecutive byte positions on the surface of the disk that are typically fetched with one disk access . the goal of the insertion , split , and deletion routines is to give trees that will have good clustering , with few , tight parent mbrs . figure 12.1 illustrates data rectangles (in black) , organized in an r-tree with fanout 3 . figure 12.2 shows the file-structure for the same r-tree , where nodes correspond to disk pages . a range-query specifies a region-of-interest , requiring all the data regions that intersect it . to answer this query , we first retrieve a superset of the qualifying data regions : we compute the mbr of the query region , and then we recursively descend the r-tree , excluding the branches whose mbrs do not intersect the query mbr . thus , the r-tree will give us quickly the data regions whose mbr intersects the mbr of the query region . the retrieved data regions will be further examined for intersection with the query region . algorithms for additional operations (nearest-neighbor-queries , spatial-joins , insertions , and deletions) are more complicated and are still under research (see the bibliographic discussion) . the original r-tree paper inspired much follow-up work , as described in 348 multimedia-ir : indexing and searching ------- 1 t ii figure 12.1 data (dark rectangles) organized in an r-tree with fanout = 3 . solid , light-dashed , and heavy-dashed lines indicate parents , grandparents and great-grandparent (the root , in this example) . figure 12.2 the file-structure for the r-tree of the previous figure (fanout = 3) . section 12.8 . it is important to highlight , however , that any spatial-access-method can be used (like i ? * - trees , x-trees , sr-trees , and so on) .
