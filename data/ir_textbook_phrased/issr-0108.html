8.1 introduction to information-visualization the beginnings of the theory of visualization began over 2400 years ago . the philosopher plato discerned that we perceive objects through the senses , using the-mind . our perception of the real-world is a translation from physical-energy from our environment into encoded neural-signals . the-mind is continually interpreting and categorizing our perception of our surroundings . use of a computer is another source of input to the-mind 's processing functions . text-only interfaces reduce the complexity of the interface but also restrict use of the more powerful information-processing functions the-mind has developed since birth . information-visualization 201 information-visualization is a relatively new discipline growing out of the debates in the 1970s on the way the brain processes and uses mental-images . it required significant advancements in technology and information-retrieval-techniques to become a possibility . one of the earliest researchers in information-visualization was doyle , who in 1962 discussed the concept of `` semantic road maps '' that could provide a user a view of the whole database (doyie-62) . the road maps show the items that are related to a specific semantic-theme . the user could use this view to focus his query on a specific semantic portion of the database . the concept was extended in the late 1960s , emphasizing a spatial-organization that maps to the information in the database (miller-68) . sammon implemented a non-linear-mapping algorithm that could reveal document associations providing the information required to create a road-map or spatial-organization (sammons-69) . in the 1990s technical advancements along with exponential growth of available information moved the discipline into practical research and commercialization . information-visualization-techniques have the potential to significantly enhance the user 's ability to minimize resources expended to locate needed information . the way users interact with computers changed with the introduction of user-interfaces based upon windows , icons , menus , and pointing-devices (wimps) . although movement in the right direction to provide a more natural human interface , the technologies still required humans to perform activities optimized for the computer to understand . a better approach was stated by donald a. norman (rose-96) : ... people are required to conform to technology . it is time to reverse this trend , time to make technology conform to people norman stresses that to optimize the user 's ability to find information , the focus should be on understanding the aspects of the user 's interface and processing of information which then can be migrated to a computer interface (norman-90) . although using text to present an overview of a significant amount of information makes it difficult for the user to understand the information , it is essential in presenting the details . in information-retrieval , the process of getting to the relevant details starts with filtering many items via a search-process . the results of this process is still a large number of potentially relevant items . in most systems the results of the search are presented as a textual list of each item perhaps ordered by rank . the user has to read all of the pages of lists of the items to see what is in the hit list . understanding the human cognitive process associated with visual-data suggests alternative ways of presenting and manipulating information to focus on the likely relevant items . there are many areas that information-visualization-and-presentation can help the user : a. reduce the amount of time to understand the results of a search and likely clusters of relevant-information 202 chapter 8 b. yield information that comes from the relationships between items versus treating each item as independent c. perform simple actions that produce sophisticated information-search functions a study was performed by fox et al. using interviews and user-task-analysis on professionals in human-factors engineering , library-science , and computer-science to determine the requirements to optimize their work with documents (fox-93a) . once past the initial requirement for easy access from their office , the researchers ' primary objective was the capability to locate and explore patterns in document-databases . they wanted visual-representations of the patterns and items of interest . there was a consistent theme that the tools should allow the users to view and search documents with the system sensitive to their view of the information-space . the users wanted to be able to focus on particular areas of their interest (not generic system interest definitions) and then easily see new topical areas of potential interest to investigate . they sought an-interface that permits easy identification of trends , interest in various topics and newly emerging topics . representing information in a visual mode allows for cognitive parallel-processing of multiple facts and data-relationships satisfying many of these requirements . the exponential growth in available information produces large hit files from most searches . to understand issues with the search statement and retrieved items , the user has to review a significant number of status screens . even with the review , it is hard to generalize if the search can be improved . information-visualization provides an intuitive-interface to the user to aggregate the results of the search into a display that provides a high-level summary and facilitates focusing on likely centers of relevant items . the query logically extracts a virtual-workspace (information-space) of potential relevant items which can be viewed and manipulated by the user . by representing the aggregate semantics of the workspace , relationships between items become visible . it is impossible for the user to perceive these relationships by viewing the items individually . the aggregate presentation allows the user to manipulate the aggregates to refine the items in the workspace . for example , if the workspace is represented by a set of named clusters (name based upon major semantic-content) , the user may select a set of clusters that defines the next iteration of the search . an alternative use of aggregates is to correlate the search-terms with items retrieved . inspecting relevant and non-relevant items in a form that highlights the effect of the expanded search-terms provides insights on what terms were the major causes for the results . a user may have thought a particular term was very important . a visual-display could show that the term in fact had a minimal effect on the item selection-process , suggesting a need to substitute other search-terms . using a textual display on the results of a search provides no mechanism to display inter-relationships between items . for example , if the user is interested in the development of a polio vaccine , there is no way for a textual listing of found items to show `` date '' and `` researcher '' relationships based upon published items . information-visualization 203 the textual summary list of the hit file can only be sorted via one attribute , typically relevance rank . aspects of human-cognition are the technical basis for understanding the details of information-visualization systems . many techniques are being developed heuristically with the correlation to human-cognition and perception analyzed after the techniques are in test . the commercial pressures to provide visualization in delivered systems places the creativity under the intuitive concepts of the developer .
