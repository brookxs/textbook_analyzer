66 finding out about 3.2.3 benoit mandelbrot 's explanation the early days of cybernetics were heady , and zipf was not alone in seeking a grand , unifying theory to explain the phenomena of communication on computational grounds like those proving so successful in physics . benoit mandelbrot was equally ambitious . mandelbrot 's background as a physicist is clear when he considers the message decoder as a physical piece of apparatus , '' ... cutting a continuous incoming string of signs into groups , and recoding each group separately '' [mandelbrot , 1953] . this `` differentiator '' complements an `` integrator , '' which reconstitutes new messages from individual words . within this model communication can be considered `` fully analogous to the perfect gas of thermodynamics . '' minimizing the cost of transmission corresponds to minimization of free-energy in thermodynamics . mandelbrot was also interested in how the critical parameter a varied from one vocabulary to another . extending the physical analogy of thermodynamic energy , the informational temperature or temperature of discourse is proportional to i/or , which mandelbrot argues provides a much better measure of the richness of a vocabulary than simply counting the number of words it contains . the value i/a can also be used to relate our analysis of zipf s law to mandelbrot 's fractals . if the letters of our alphabet are imagined to be digits of numbers base n + 1 and a leading decimal point is placed before each word , then each word corresponds to a number between 0 and 1 . the construction amounts in effect to cutting out of [0,1] all the numbers that include the digit 0 otherwise than at the end . one finds that the remainder is a cantor dust , the fractal-dimension of which is precisely i/or . [mandelbrot , 1982 , p. 346] mandelbrot proposed a more general form of zipf s law : (3 ' 2) which has proved important in analysis of the relationship between word-frequencies and their rank (cf. section 5.1) . mandelbrot also suggested this as a potential model of cognition : whatever the detailed structure of the brain it recodes information many times . the public representation through phonemes weighting and matching against indices 67 is immediately replaced by a private one through a string of nerve impulses ... this recorded message presumably uses fewer signs than the incoming one ; therefore when a given message reaches a higher level it will have been reduced to a choice between a few possibilities only without the extreme redundancy of the sounds . the last stages are `` idea '' stages , where not only the public representation has been lost , but also the public elements of information . [mandelbrot , 1953 , pp. 488-9] mandelbrot makes other provocative suggestions , for example , that schizophrenics provide the best test of his theory because these individuals impose the fewest `` semantic-constraints '' on the random-process (generating language) of interest ?! although he was unsuccessful at his more ambitious goal of wedding a physical-model of communcation to models of semantics such as saussure 's , mandelbrot was probably the first to characterize the real truth underlying zipfian distributions . this derivation is put off until chapter 5 . we conclude here with one more historical-perspective , due to herbert simon , and a couple of more modern rediscoveries of zipfian phenomena .
