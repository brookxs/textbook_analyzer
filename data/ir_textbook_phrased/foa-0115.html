6.1.4 citations and arguments expository documents are arguments : attempts to convince an audience that some set of propositions are true . depending on the type of 194 finding out about rule/issue followed ^ . / harmonized f ^ / explained ^ facts questioned criticized ^ overruled figure 6.4 rose 's two-dimensional analysis of shepard treatment codes document and the type of audience , the argument may be more or less formally structured . perhaps the most structured kinds of documents are mathematical papers . mathematical arguments typically depend on , indeed are defined by , theorem-proving , which connects new propositions to previously established results . even in the case of mathematical papers , however , it is interesting to observe the crucial role natural-language-text continues to play in providing a context for formal theoretical results . readers can be persuaded that assumptions are reasonable , that mathematical definitions capture intuitive relationships , etc. . citations in a mathematical paper typically point to papers containing theorems that were used as part of the current proof . in a scientific paper , the form of the argument often has to do with the discipline . there is often data to present , methodology to describe , and so on . many of the citations are typically gathered in a section relating the current piece of work to prior literature . this prior literature may be referenced for at least two , very different , purposes . most typically the prior work is used much as theorems in mathematical papers : to establish a result from which the current work proceeds . the current author points to the work of a prior author as providing validation for a proposition they both believe to be true . another potential reason for citation is the opposite . in this case , the current author is interested in debating a position put forward by the cited work . this polarity , reflecting whether the cited work and its conclusions are positively or negatively correlated with those in the citing work , will be termed the polarity of the citation . here legal documents provide a good example for what might be possible in scientific-writing . every inference beyond the index 195 law student learns proper legal syntax for codifying references as they learn to write legal briefs , the structured memos provided to judges that are often incorporated into the ultimate opinion [harvard law review association , 1995] . one feature of legal briefs is the special syntax used to refer to statutory law (e.g. , 17 u.s.c 101 refers to a section of the u.s. code) or case-law (e.g. , west pub . co. v. mead data cent. , inc. , 616 rsupp 1571) in a conventional fashion . a more interesting aspect of legal brief style is the explicit syntactic marking of the relation of the cited case to the argument being made in the brief : reference to a supporting legal precedent is marked by cf. , while potentially antagonistic arguments are marked with but cf. ! note the importance of the syntactic localization of both the source and destination of a citation pointer to the two documents ' semantic purposes . localization helps to anchor the author 's purpose in using the citation to the document 's larger argument . most papers make many points and attempt to establish a number of propositions . the ability to point to particular conclusions within the cited paper is therefore important . the citing paper 's argument-structure is simultaneously being extended , and so reference to a prior argument at a particular location in the current argument can be more persuasive than if all cites are n't localized . ? 35 4 , one reason citation has been less exploited in foa applications than it might otherwise be is due to the expense of obtaining this data . in the context of the www , however , it turns out that the indices built by web-crawlers can be quite easily extended to capture information on cited pages , which can be easily inverted to maintain information on citing pages as well (cf. section 8.1) .
