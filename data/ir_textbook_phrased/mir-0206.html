10.7.1 interfaces for standard relevance-feedback a standard interface for relevance-feedback consists of a list of titles with checkboxes beside the titles that allow the user to mark relevant documents . this can imply either that unmarked documents are not relevant or that no opinion has been made about unmarked documents , depending on the system . another option is to provide a choice among several checkboxes indicating relevant or not relevant (with no selection implying no opinion) . in some cases users are allowed to indicate a value on a relevance scale [73] . standard relevance-feedback algorithms usually do not perform better given negative relevance judgement evidence [225] , but machine-learning-algorithms can take advantage of negative-feedback [629 , 460] . after the user has made a set of relevance-judgements and issued a search command , the system can either automatically reweight the query and re-execute the search , or generate a list of terms for the user to select from in order to augment the original query . (see figure 10.25 , taken from [448] .) systems usually do not suggest terms to remove from the query . after the query is re-executed , a new list of titles is shown . it can be helpful to retain an indicator such as a marked checkbox beside the documents that the usc ^ r has already judged . a difficult design-decision concerns whether or not to show documents that the user lias already viewed towards the top of the ranked list 111 repeatedly showing the same set of documents at the top may inconvenience a user who is trying to create a large set of relevant documents . using relevance-judgements 305 | resetall | | undq last run querv | | show search topic textj enter (next) quei ªace b2 detroit ógeneral motors corp said it is recalling 62,000 1988-89 model cars equipped with its high-tech quad 4 iglne to fu defective fuel lines (inked to 24 engine fires cm said the 1988-89 pontiac grand am , oldsmoblle cutlass mais and buick skylark cars equipped with the 16-valve , ur-cylmder quad 4 engine have fuel lines that could crack separate from the engines although gm has received jports of 24 fires caused by leaks attributable to the faulty fuel i ines a spokesman says the company knows of no injuries resulting from the incidents gm sold about 312,000 cars equipped with quad 4 engines in the 1988-89 model years another action gm said it is recalling about 3 200 of 990 oldsmoblle cutlass calais and buick skylark models ix fuel-line defects on three engines the quad 4 , 3 3-liter v-6 and ? 5-liter four cylinder gm is n't aware of any fires or injuries related to the fuel jm ´ problems in this group of cars , the spokesman said an repairs will be done free of charge to owners , the company said separately , the u s sales arm of volkswagen ac 's audi subsidiary said it is recalling 1 600 1990-model audi 80 90 ind coupe qurtro luxury csrs to replace d defective bolt in fie assembly that locks the steering when the car is parked ` he defective bolt could break causing the steering wheel to figure 10.25 an example of an interface for relevance-feedback [448] . but at the same time , this can serve as feedback indicating that the revised query does not downgrade the ranking of those documents that have been found especially important . one solution is to retain a separate window that shows the rankings of only the documents that have not been retrieved or ranked highly previously . another solution is to use smaller fonts or gray-out color for the titles of documents already seen . creating multiple relevance-judgements is an effortful task , and the notion of relevance-feedback is unfamiliar to most users . to circumvent these problems , web-based search-engines have adopted the terminology of ` more like this1 as a simpler way to indicate that the user is requesting documents similar to the selected one . this 4one-click ' interaction method is simpler than standard relevance-feedback dialog which requires users to rate a small number of documents and then request a reranking . unfortunately , in most cases relevance-feedback requires many relevance-judgements in order to work well . to partly alleviate this problem , aalbersberg [1] proposes incremental relevance-feedback which works well given only one relevant-document at a time and thus can be used to hide the two-step procedure from the user .
