6.6 trends and research-issues many changes and proposals are happening , and very rapidly , in particular due to the advent of the-web . at this point , the reader must be lost in a salad of acronyms (we were ton !) , in spite of the fact that we have only mentioned the most important languages and formats . the most important of these are included in the glossary at the end of this book . soine people believe that new languages tei lite trends and research-issues 161 sgml : dsssl 1 xsl a css style-sheets next rdf mathml smil generation html figure 6.6 taxonomy of web languages . format specifications such as css or xml take away the simplicity of html , which is the basis of its success . only the-future will tell . figure 6.6 illustrates a taxonomy of the main languages considered . solid lines indicate instances of a metalanguage (for example , html is an instance of sgml) , while dashed lines indicate derived languages . the main trend is the convergence and integration of the different efforts , the-web being the main application . a european alternative to sgml is the open document architecture (oda) which is also a standard (iso 8613 [398]) . oda was designed to share documents electronically without losing control over the content , structure , and layout of those documents . oda defines a logical-structure (like sgml) , a layout and the content (including vector and raster-graphics) . an oda file can also be formatted , processable , or formatted processable . formatted files can not be edited and have information about content and layout . the other two types can be edited . processable files also have logical-information in addition to content , while formatted processable files have everything . oda is not used very much nowadays (see also chapter 11) . recent developments include : ï an object-model is being defined : the document object-model (dom) . dom will provide an interoperable set of classes and methods to manipulate html and xml objects from programming-languages such as java . ï integration between vrml and dynamic-html , providing a set of evolving features aod architecture extensions to html and web-browsers that includes cascading-style-sheets and document object models . ï integration between the standard exchange for product data format (step , iso-10303) and sgml . step covers product data from a broad range of industries , and provides extensive support for modeling . 162 text and multimedia languages and properties automated storage schema generation , life-cycle maintenance , and other management facilities . ï efforts to convert marc to sgml by denning a dtd , as well as converting marc to xml . this has potential possibilities for enhanced access and navigation and presentation of marc record data and the associated information . ï cgm has become of interest to web researchers and commercial vendors for its use on the internet , by developing a new encoding which can be parsed by xml . ï several new proposals have appeared . among them we can mention sdml (signed document markup-language) , vml (vector markup-language) , and pgml (precision graphics markup-language) . the latter is based on the 2d imaging model of postscript and pdf .
