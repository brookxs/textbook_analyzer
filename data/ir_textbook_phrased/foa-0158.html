7.5.4 combining-classifiers the preceding chapters have described a wide range of potentially useful retrieval techniques . a very reasonable response is to ask if perhaps the best possible retrieval-system is n't some sort of mixture of these various techniques . for example , bartell [bartell et al , 1994a] has considered simple linear-combinations of experts like those shown in figure 7.8 . his experiments considered two experts , one that used a set of simple words as features and a second that did more elaborate phrase-extraction . 276 finding out about 1 o optimal term-weight (weights normalized to unit circle) figure 7.9 optimal weightings distribution from [bartell et al. , 1994b] holding the sum of the two experts ' contributions constant , their relative contribution describes a circle of fixed radius . figure 7.9 shows a set of 228 test queries and the optimal weighting of phrase and term experts for each . that is , for a particular query , the optimal contribution of ranking information from the phrase and term expert is determined . also shown is a line corresponding to the optimal balance between phrase and term expert across all queries . in general , the phrase expert was not very useful . on some queries , however , it was able to improve performance significantly . the way in which individual queries make special demands of the retrieval-system is perhaps the most striking feature of these results . as search-engine technologies have developed , the composition of hybrid-systems involving multiple systems has required a more `` black-box '' composition . that is , rather than manipulating a single feature of the retrieval-system (e.g. , term versus phrase features) , the combination has been of a system 's net ranking [thompson , 1990a ; thompson , 1990b] . collection-fusion refers to the problem of combining results coming from disjoint corpora [towell et al. , 1995 ; yager and rybalov , 1998] . (in the emerging environment of combined corpora and primarily adaptive-information-retrieval 277 publisher-driven search-engines , corpora have become confounded with the search-engines allowed to search them .) diamond (personal-communication) has hypothesized several effects we might imagine from fusing multiple search-engines : skimming effect ... [when] retrieval approaches that represent [documents] differently may retrieve different relevant items , so that a combination method that takes the top-ranked items from each of the retrieval approaches will `` push '' non-relevant items down in the ranking . chorus effect ... when several retrieval approaches (each representing the query differently) suggest that an item is relevant to a query , this tends to be stronger evidence for relevance than a single approach doing so . thus , allowing several independent retrieval approaches to `` vote '' on the relevance of an item should enable a sharper distinction between relevant and non-relevant items . [diamond , personal-communication] note how the first of these focuses on differences in the systemsbased treatment of documents and the second on queries (cf. section 3.3.3) . * dark horse in some ways , this combination-of-classifiers is reminiscent of earlier effect too work using multiple query representations [beucin et al. , 1993] . vogt has recently performed an exhaustive analysis of linear-combinations for all 61 search-engines submitted to the trec5 competition [vogt and cottrell , 1998] . his primary conclusion , following lee [lee , 1997] , is that two systems are best combined linearly when there is a great deal of overlap in the set of relevant documents they identify , while their retrieval of nonrelevant documents is nearly disjoint . in terms of diamond 's qualitative expectations , linear-combinations are best able to support the `` chorus '' effect . schutze et al. and larkey have considered combining various types of special-function classifiers [schutze et al. , 1995b ; larkey and croft , 1996] .
