13.6 metasearchers metasearchers are web-servers that send a given query to several search-engines , web-directories and other databases , collect the answers and unify them . examples are metacrawler [715] and sawysearch [383 , 223] . the main advantages of metasearchers are the ability to combine the results of many sources and the fact that the user can pose the same query to various sources through a single common interface . metasearchers differ from each other in how ranking 388 searching the-web metasearcher url sources used cyber 411 www.cyber411.com 14 dogpile www.dogpile.com 25 highway 61 www . higliway61 . com 5 inference find www.infind.com 6 mamma www.mamma.coin 7 metacrawler www.metacrawler.com 7 metafind www.met af ind. c om 7 metaminer www.miner.uol.com.br 13 metasearch www.metasearch.com _ savvysearch savvy.cs.colostate.edu :2000 gt ; 13 table 13.5 urls of metasearchers and number of sources that they use (october 1998) . is performed in the unified result (in some cases no ranking is done) , and how well they translate the user-query to the specific query-language of each search-engine or web-directory (the query-language common to all of them could be small) . table 13.5 shows the urls of the main metasearch engines as well as the number of search-engines , web-directories and other databases that they search . metasearchers can also run on the client , for example , copernic , echosearch , webferret , webcompass , and webseeker . there are others that search several sources and show the different answers in separate windows , such as a1140ne , oneseek , proteus , and search spaniel . the advantages of metasearchers are that the results can be sorted by different attributes such as host , keyword , date , etc ; which can be more informative than the output of a single search-engine . therefore browsing the results should be simpler . on the other hand , the result is not necessarily all the-web pages matching the query , as the number of results per search-engine retrieved by the metasearcher is limited (it can be changed by the user , but there is an upper limit) . nevertheless , pages returned by more than one search-engine should be more relevant . we expect that new metasearchers will do better ranking . a first step in this direction is the nec research institute metasearch-engine , inquirus [488 , 489] . the main difference is that inquirus actually downloads and analyzes each web-page obtained and then displays each page , highlighting the places where the query terms were found . the results are displayed as soon as they are available in a progressive manner , otherwise the waiting-time would be too long . this technique also allows non-existent pages or pages that have changed and do not contain the query any more to be discarded , and . more important , provides for better ranking than normal search-engines . on the other hand , this inetajsoaivher is not available to the general public . finding the needigital librarye in the haystack 389 measure average value range number of words 2.35 0 to 393 number of operators 0.41 0 to 958 repetitions of each query 3.97 1-1 .5 million queries per user-session 2.02 1-173 ,325 screens per query 1.39 1-78 ,496 table 13.6 queries on the web : average values . the use of metasearchers is justified by coverage studies that show that a small percentage of web-pages are in all search-engines [91] . in fact , fewer than 1 % of the-web pages indexed by altavista , hotbot , excite , and infoseek are in all of those search-engines . this fact is quite surprising and has not been explained (yet) . metasearchers for specific topics can be considered as software-agents and are covered in section 13.8.2 .
