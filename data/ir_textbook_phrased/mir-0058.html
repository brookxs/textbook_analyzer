3.2 retrieval-performance evaluation when considering retrieval-performance evaluation , we should first consider the retrieval-task that is to be evaluated . for instance , the retrieval-task could consist simply of a query processed in batch mode (i.e. , the user submits a query and receives an answer back) or of a whole interactive session (i.e. , the user specifies his information-need through a series of interactive steps with the system) . further , the retrieval-task could also comprise a combination of these two strategies . batch and interactive query tasks are quite distinct processes and thus their evaluations are also distinct . in fact , in an interactive session , user effort , characteristics of the interface-design , guidance provided by the system , and duration of the session are critical-aspects which should be observed and measured . in a batch session , none of these aspects is nearly as important as the quality of the answer set generated . besides the nature of the query request , one has also to consider the setting where the evaluation will take place and the type of interface used . regarding the setting , evaluation of experiments performed in a laboratory might be quite distinct from evaluation of experiments carried out in a real life situation . regarding the type of interface , while early bibliographic systems (which still dominate the commercial market as discussed in chapter 14) present the user with interfaces which normally operate in batch mode , newer systems (which are been popularized by the high quality graphic-displays available nowadays) usually present the user with complex-interfaces which often operate interactively . retrieval-performance evaluation in the early days of computer-based information-retrieval-systems focused primarily on laboratory-experiments designed for batch interfaces . in the 1990s , a lot more attention has been paid to the evaluation of real life experiments . despite this tendency , laboratory experimentation is still dominant . two main reasons are the repeatability and the scalability provided by the closed setting of a laboratory . retrieval-performance evaluation 75 in this book , we focus mainly on experiments performed in laboratories . in this chapter in particular we discuss solely the evaluation of systems which operate in batch mode . evaluation of systems which operate interactively is briefly discussed in chapter 10 .
