4.2 stemming algorithms the concept of stemming has been applied to information-systems from their initial automation in the 1960 's . the original goal of stemming was to improve performance and require less system-resources by reducing the number of unique-words that a system has to contain . with the continued significant increase in storage and computing power , use of stemming for performance reasons is no longer as important . stemming is now being reviewed for the potential improvements it can make in recall versus its associated decline in precision . a system-designer can trade-off the increased overhead of stemming in creating processing tokens versus reduced search-time overhead of processing query terms with trailing `` do n't cares '' (see section 2.1.5 term masking) to include all of their variants . the stemming process creates one large index for the stem versus term masking which requires the merging (oring) of the indexes for every term that matches the search-term .
