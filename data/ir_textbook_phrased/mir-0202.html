10.6.5 categories for results set context in section 10.4 we saw the use of category or directory information for providing overviews of text-collection content . category metadata can also be used to place the results of a query in context . for example , the original formulation of superbook allowed navigation within a highly structured-document , a computer manual . the core project extended the main idea to a collection of over 1000 full-text chemistry articles . a study of this representation demonstrated its superiority to a standard search-system on a variety of task-types [228] . since a table-of-contents is not available for this collection , context is provided by placing documents within a category-hierarchy containing terms relevant to chemistry . documents assigned a category are listed when that category is selected for more detailed viewing , and the categories themselves are organized into a hierarchy , thus providing a hierarchical view on the collection . another approach to using predefined categories to provide context for retrieval results is demonstrated by the dynacat system [650] . the dynacat system organizes retrieved documents according to which types of categories , selected from the large mesh taxonomy , are known in advance to be important for a given query type . dynacat begins with a set of query-types known to be useful for a given user population and collection . one query type can encompass many different queries . for example , the query type ` treatment-adverse effects ' covers queries such as ` what are the complications of a mastectomy ? * as well as ` what are the side-effects of aspirin ? 1 documents are organized according to a set of criteria associated with each query type . these criteria specify which types of categories that are acceptable to use for organizing the documents and consequently , which categories should be omitted from the display . once categories have been assigned to the retrieved documents , a hierarchy is formed based on where the categories exist within mesh . the algorithm selects only a subset of the category 298 user-interfaces and visualization i query : wttat are tite ways to frtevent breast cane * ! ibs betaffior ma bhswiot i mectomsios (14 refs) ; ï atttenae c9 rafggt ; t behavior (8 , ittfg) , ï psychology , social (3 ªflg) bsoclwiiiical heta1toli $ n , ami ; hmttluqb (5 yefg) ï diet (5j # fs) clemicals ma drags cß1mß) ï ahubo acids , peptiies , ´ m ; proteins (# j # fa) ï axitiiiieoplftstu : ani immnikosuppiessivv rr behawor anil behavior meclianisms # - ; ; attitude ï attltycfe to heaftli ï por la vida intervention mode ! for 5 , cancer prevention in latmas ï breast-cancer prevention education at a shopdina center in israel '' a student nurse community health proiect ï future challenaes in secondary drevention of breast-cancer for women at high risk ï a studv of diet and breast-cancer prevention in canada whv healthy wo m e n p a rti c i p - ate i n c o ntr o 1 ! e cl tri a s s ï knowledge , attitudes , practice ï por la vicla intervention mode ! for ^ c a n i e r p r eve nti o r `` gt ; i n lati n a s 4 figure 10.20 the dynacat interface for viewing category labels that correspond to query-types [650] . labels that might be assigned to the document to be used in the organization . figure 10.20 shows the results for a query on breast-cancer prevention . the interface is tiled into three windows . the top window displays the user 's query and the number of documents found . the left window shows the categories in the first two levels of the hierarchy , providing a table-of-contents view of the organization of search-results . the right pane displays ail the categories in the hierarchy and the titles of the documents that belong in those categories . an obstacle to using category labels to organize retrieval results is the requirement of precompiled knowledge about which categories are of interest for a particular user or a particular query type . the sonia system [692] circumvents this problem by using a combination of misupervised and supervised methods to organize a set of documents . the misupervised method (document-clustering similar to scatter/gat her) imposes an initial organization on a user 's personal-information collection or on a set of documents retrieved as the result of a query . the user can then invoke a direct-manipulation interface to make adjustoients to tliis initial clustering , causing it to align more closely with their preferences (iwailse uilsupervised methods do not usually produce an organization that n ´ tespond.s to a human-derived category-structure [857]) . the resulting organization is then used to train a supervised-text-categorization algorithm which automatically classifies any new documents that are added to the collection . as the collection grows it can be periodically reorganized by rerunning the clustering algorithm and redoing the manual adjustments . context 299
