13.1 introduction the world-wide-web dates from the end of the 1980s [85] and no one could have imagined its current impact . the boom in the use of the-web and its exponential growth are now well known . just the amount of textual data available is estimated to be in the order of one terabyte . in addition , other media , such as images , audio , and video , are also available . thus , the-web can be seen as a very-large , unstructured but ubiquitous database . this triggers the need for efficient tools to manage , retrieve , and filter information from this database . this problem is also becoming important in large intranets , where we want to extract or infer new information to support a decision-process , a task called data-mining . as mentioned in chapter 1 , we make the important distinction between data and information retrieval . we are interested in the latter case , in which the user searches for data that fulfills his information-need . we focus on text , because although there are techniques to search for images and other non-textual data , they can not be applied (yet) on a large-scale . we also emphasize syntactic search . that is , we search for web-documents that have user-specified words or patterns in their text . as discussed in chapter 2 , such words or patterns may or may not reflect the intrinsic semantics of the text . an alternative approach to syntactic search is to do a natural-language-analysis of the text . although the techniques to preprocess natural-language and extract the text-semantics are not new , they are not yet very effective and they are also too costly for large amounts of data . in addition , in most cases they are only effective with well structured-text , a thesaurus , and other contextual-information . there are basically three different forms of searching the-web , two of them are well known and are frequently used . the first is to use search-engines that index a portion of the-web documents as a full-text database . the second is to use web-directories , which classify selected web-documents by subject . the third and not yet fully available , is to search the-web exploiting its hyperlinkf f we will use hyperlink or link to denote a pointer (anchor) from a web-page to another web-page . 367 368 searching the-web structure . we cover all three forms of web-search here . we first discuss the challenges of searching the-web , followed by some web statistics and models which can be used to understand the complexity of the problem . next , we discuss in detail the main tools used today to search the-web . the discussion includes search-engines , web-directories , hybrid-systems , user-interfaces , and searching examples . we continue with new query-languages that exploit the graphical structure of the web . finally , we survey current trends and research-issues . as web-research is a very dynamic field , we may have missed some important work , for which we apologize in advance .
