5.2.2.6 problems with the vector-model in addition to the general problem of dynamically changing databases and the effect on weighting factors , there are problems with the vector-model on assignment of a weight for a particular processing token to an item . each processing token can be viewed as a new semantic topic . a major problem comes in the vector-model when there are multiple topics being discussed in a particular item . for example , assume that an item has an in-depth discussion of `` oil '' in `` mexico '' and also `` coal '' in `` pennsylvania . '' the vector-model does not have a mechanism to associate each energy source with its particular geographic area . there is no way to associate correlation factors between terms (i.e. , precoordination discussed in chapter 3) since each dimension in a vector is independent of the other dimensions . thus the item results in a high value in a search for 4 `` coal in mexico . '' 122 chapter 5 another major limitation of a vector-space is in associating positional-information with a processing term . the concept of proximity searching (e.g. , term `` a '' within 10 words of term `` b '') requires the logical-structure to contain storage of positional-information of a processing term . the concept of a vector-space allows only one scalar value to be associated with each processing term for each item . restricting searches to subsets of an item has been shown to provide increased precision (see chapter 7) . in effect this capability overcomes the multitopical item problem by looking at subsets of an item and thus increasing the probability that the subset is discussing a particular semantic topic .
