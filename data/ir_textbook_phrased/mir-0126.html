7.4.1 motivation text-compression is about finding ways to represent the text in fewer bits or bytes . the amount of space required to store text on computers can be reduced significantly using compression techniques . compression methods create a reduced representation by identifying and using structures that exist in the text . from the compressed version , the original text can be reconstructed exactly . text-compression is becoming an important issue in an information-retrieval environment . the widespread use of digital-libraries , office-automation 174 text operations systems , document-databases , and the-web has led to an explosion of textual-information available online . in this scenario , text-compression appears as an attractive option for reducing costs associated with space requirements , input/output (i/o) overhead , and communication-delays . the gain obtained from compressing text is that it requires less storage space , it takes less time to be transmitted over a communication-link , and it takes less time to search directly the compressed text . the price paid is the time necessary to code and decode the text . a major obstacle for storing text in compressed form is the need for ir systems to access text randomly . to access a given word in a compressed text , it is usually necessary to decode the entire text from the beginning until the desired word is reached . it could be argued that a large text could be divided into blocks that are compressed independently , thus allowing fast random-access to each block . however , efficient compression methods need to process some text before making compression effective (usually more than 10 kilobytes) . the smaller the blocks , the less effective compression is expected to be . our discussion here focuses on text-compression methods which are suitable for use in an ir environment . for instance , a successful idea aimed at merging the requirements of compression-algorithms and the needs of ir systems is to consider that the symbols to be compressed are words and not characters (character-based compression is the more conventional approach) . words are the atoms on which most ir systems are built . moreover , it is now known that much better compression is achieved by taking words as symbols (instead of characters) . further , new word-based-compression methods allow random-access to words within the compressed text which is a critical issue for an ir-system . besides the economy of space obtained by a compression-method , there are other important characteristics to be considered such as compression and decompression speed . in some situations , decompression speed is more important than compression speed . for instance , this is the case with textual-databases in which it is common to compress the text once and to read it many times from disk . another important characteristic of a compression-method is the possibility of performing compressed pattern-matching , defined as the task of performing pattern-matching in a compressed text without decompressing it . in this case , sequential-searching can be speeded up by compressing the search key rather than decoding the compressed text being searched . as a consequence , it is possible to search faster on compressed text because much less text has to be scanned . chapter 8 presents efficient methods to deal with searching the compressed text directly . when the text-collection is large , efficient text-retrieval requires specialized index techniques . a simple and popular indexing-structure for text-collections are the inverted-files . inverted-files (see chapter 8 for details) are especially adequate when the pattern to be searched for is formed by simple words . since this is a common type of query (for instance , when searching the-web) , inverted-files are widely used for indexing large text collections . an inverted-file is typically composed of (a) a vector containing all the distinct words in the text-collection (which is called the vocabulary) and (b) for text-compression 175 each word in the vocabulary , a list of all documents (identified by document numbers) in which that word occurs . because each list of document numbers (within the inverted-file) is organized in ascending order , specific compression methods have been proposed for them , leading to very efficient index-compression schemes . this is important because query-processing time is highly related to index access-time . thus , in this section , we also discuss some of the most important index-compression techniques . we first introduce basic concepts related to text-compression . we then present some of the most important statistical compression methods , followed by a brief review of compression methods based on a dictionary . at the end , we discuss the application of compression to inverted-files .
