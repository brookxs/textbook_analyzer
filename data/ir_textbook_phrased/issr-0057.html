4.4 n-gram data-structures n-grams can be viewed as a special technique for conflation (stemming) and as a unique data-structure in information-systems . n-grams are a fixed length consecutive series of `` n '' characters . unlike stemming that generally tries to determine the stem of a word that represents the semantic meaning of the word , ngrams do not care about semantics . instead they are algorithmically based upon a fixed number of characters . the searchable data-structure is transformed into overlapping n-grams , which are then used to create the searchable database . examples of bigrams , trigrams and pentagrams are given in figure 4.7 for the word phrase `` sea colony . '' for n-grams , with n greater than two , some systems allow interword symbols to be part of the n-gram set usually excluding the single-character with interword symbol option . the symbol # is used to represent the interword symbol which is anyone of a set of symbols (e.g. , blank , period , semicolon , colon , etc.) . each of the n-grams created becomes a separate processing tokens and are searchable . it is possible that the same n-gram can be created multiple times from a single word . the inquire dbms provides this feature . 86 chapter 4 se ea co ol lo on ny digrams (no interword symbols) sea col olo ion ony trigrams (no interword symbols) #se sea ea # #co col olo ion ony ny # trigrams (with interword symbol #) #sea # #colo colon olony iony # pentagrams (with interword symbol #) figure 4.7 bigrams , trigrams and pentagrams for `` sea colony ''
