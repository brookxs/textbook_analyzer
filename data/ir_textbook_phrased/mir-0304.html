15.6.1 protocols and federation in the 1980s it became clear that as library-catalog systems proliferated , and library patrons sought support for finding items not locally available through inter-library loan or remote cataloging search , some protocol was needed for searching remote bibliographic collections . the national-standard z39 .50 , which later became an international standard as well , led to intensive development of implementations and subsequent extensive utilization [515] . one example of widespread utilization was the wais system (based on z39 .50) , very popular before the world-wide-web emerged . ongoing development of z39 .50 has continued , including its application to digital librarys , as demonstrated in the cimi project described earlier , where a number of different clients and server implementations all worked together . also mentioned earlier is the ncstrl effort , starting with cs technical reports , in which the dienst protocol was developed [210] . this is a ` lighter ' protocol than z39 .50 , designed to support federated-searching of digital librarys , but also connected to the centralized preprint service (corr) at los alamos national laboratory . dienst seems suitable for electronic-theses-and-dissertations as well as technical reports , and so it has been considered in regard to ndigital librarytd . these protocols assume that each server and client will be changed to use the protocol . a less intrusive approach , but one harder to implement and enforce , is to have some mechanism to translate from a special server or gateway system to/from each of the information-sources of interest . the starts protocol [316] was proposed to move in this direction , but competition among search-services on the internet is so severe that acceptance seems unlikely . though 430 digital-libraries this is unfortunate , simple federated schemes have been implemented in the digital libraryi projects at stanford and illinois , and a simple one is in use in ndigital librarytd . yet , even more important than new protocols for digital-library federated-search is agreement on metadata-schemes , which does seem feasible .
