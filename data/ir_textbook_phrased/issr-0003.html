1.2 objectives of information-retrieval-systems the general objective of an information-retrieval-system is to minimize the overhead of a user locating needed information . overhead can be expressed as the time a user spends in all of the steps leading to reading an item containing the needed information (e.g. , query-generation , query-execution , scanning results of query to select items to read , reading non-relevant items) . the success of an information-system is very subjective , based upon what information is needed and the willingness of a user to accept overhead . under some circumstances , needed information can be defined as all information that is in the system that relates to a user 's need . in other cases it may be defined as sufficient information in the system to complete a task , allowing for missed data . for example , a financial advisor recommending a billion dollar purchase of another company needs to be sure that all relevant , significant information on the target company has been located and reviewed in writing the recommendation . in contrast , a student only requires sufficient references in a research-paper to satisfy the expectations of the teacher , which never is all inclusive . a system that supports reasonable retrieval requires fewer features than one which requires comprehensive retrieval . in many cases comprehensive retrieval is a negative feature because it overloads the user with more information than is needed . this makes it more difficult for the user to filter the relevant but non-useful information from the critical items . in information-retrieval the term `` relevant '' item is used to represent an item introduction to information-retrieval-systems containing the needed information . in reality the definition of relevance is not a binary-classification but a continuous function . from a user 's perspective `` relevant '' and `` needed '' are synonymous . from a system perspective , information could be relevant to a search statement (i.e. , matching the criteria of the search statement) even though it is not needed/relevant to user (e.g. , the user already knew the information) . a discussion on relevance and the natural redundancy of relevant-information is presented in chapter 11 . the two major measures commonly associated with information-systems are precision-and-recall . when a user decides to issue a search looking for information on a topic , the total database is logically divided into four segments shown in figure 1.1 . relevant items are those documents that contain information that helps the searcher in answering his question . non-relevant items are those items that do not provide any directly useful information . there are two possibilities with respect to each item : it can be retrieved or not retrieved by the user 's query . precision-and-recall are defined as : precision = number _ re trieved _ re levant number total retrieved / fai w relevant not retrieved non-relevant not retrieved non-relevant retrieved figure 1.1 effects of search on total document space recall = number ___ re trieved _ re levant number possible re levant where number ^ possible ^ relevant are the number of relevant items in the database . number_total_retieved is the total number of items retrieved from the query . numberjretrievedjlelevant is the number of items retrieved that are chapter 1 relevant to the user 's search need . precision measures one aspect of information-retrieval overhead for a user associated with a particular search . if a search has a 85 per cent precision , then 15 per cent of the user effort is overhead reviewing nonrelevant items . recall gauges how well a system processing a particular query is able to retrieve the relevant items that the user is interested in seeing . recall is a very useful concept , but due to the denominator , is non-calculable in operational systems . if the system knew the total set of relevant items in the database , it would have retrieved them . figure 1.2 a shows the values of precision-and-recall as the number of items retrieved increases , under an optimum query where every returned item is relevant . there are `` n '' relevant items in the database . figures 1.2 b and 1.2 c show the optimal and currently achievable relationships between precision-and-recall (harman-95) . in figure 1.2 a the basic properties of precision (solid line) and recall (dashed line) can be observed . precision starts off at 100 per cent and maintains that value as long as relevant items are retrieved . recall starts off close to zero and increases as long as relevant items are retrieved until all possible relevant items have been retrieved . once all `` n '' relevant items have been retrieved , the only items being retrieved are non-relevant . precision is directly affected by retrieval of non-relevant items and drops to a number close to zero . recall is not effected by retrieval of non-relevant items and thus remains at 100 per 100 percent n number items retrieved 1.2 a ideal precision-and-recall 1.0 10 recall figure 1.2 b ideal precision/recall graph introduction to information-retrieval-systems precision 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 recall 0.6 0.8 1.0 figure 1.2 c achievable precision/recall graph cent once achieved . precision/recall graphs show how values for precision-and-recall change within a search-results file (hit file) as viewed from the most relevant to least relevant item . as with figure 1.2 a , in the ideal case every item retrieved is relevant . thus precision stays at 100 per cent (1.0) . recall continues to increase by moving to the right on the x-axis until it also reaches the 100 per cent (1.0) point . although figure 1.2 c stops here , continuation stays at the same x-axis location (recall never changes) but precision decreases down the y-axis until it gets close to the x-axis as more non-relevant are discovered and precision decreases . figure 1.2 c is from the latest trec conference (see chapter 11) and is representative of current capabilities . to understand the implications of figure 1.2 c , its usefiil to describe the implications of a particular point on the precision/recall graph . assume that there are 100 relevant items in the data-base and from the graph at precision of .3 (i.e. , 30 per cent) there is an associated recall of .5 (i.e. , 50 per cent) . this means there would be 50 relevant items in the hit file from the recall value . a precision of 30 per cent means the user would likely review 167 items to find the 50 relevant items . the first objective of an information-retrieval-system is support of user-search generation . there are natural obstacles to specification of the information a user-needs that come from ambiguities inherent in languages , limits to the user 's ability to express what information is needed and differences between the user 's vocabulary corpus and that of the authors of the items in the database . natural chapter 1 languages suffer from word ambiguities such as homographs and use of acronyms that allow the same word to have multiple meanings (e.g. , the word `` field '' or the acronym `` u.s. '') - disambiguation techniques exist but introduce significant system overhead in processing power and extended search times and often require interaction with the user . many users have trouble in generating a good search statement . the typical user does not have significant experience with nor even the aptitude for boolean-logic statements . the use of boolean-logic is a legacy from the evolution of database-management-systems and implementation-constraints . until recently , commercial systems were based upon databases . it is only with the introduction of information-retrieval-systems such as retrievalware , topic , altavista , infoseek and inquery that the idea of accepting natural-language queries is becoming a standard system feature . this allows users to state in natural-language what they are interested in finding . but the completeness of the user specification is limited by the user 's willingness to construct long natural-language queries . most users on the internet enter one or two search-terms . multi-media adds an additional level of complexity in search specification . where the modal has been converted to text (e.g. , audio-transcription , ocr) the normal text techniques are still applicable . but query-specification when searching for an image , unique sound , or video segment lacks any proven best interface approaches . typically they are achieved by having prestored examples of known objects in the media and letting the user select them for the search (e.g. , images of leaders allowing for searches on `` tony blair '' .) this type specification becomes more complex when coupled with boolean or natural-language textual specifications . in addition to the complexities in generating a query , quite often the user is not an expert in the area that is being searched and lacks domain-specific vocabulary unique to that particular subject area . the user starts the search-process with a general concept of the information required , but not have a focused definition of exactly what is needed . a limited knowledge of the vocabulary associated with a particular area along with lack of focus on exactly what information is needed leads to use of inaccurate and in some cases misleading search-terms . even when the user is an expert in the area being searched , the ability to select the proper search-terms is constrained by lack of knowledge of the author 's vocabulary . all writers have a vocabulary limited by their life-experiences , environment where they were raised and ability to express themselves . other than in very technical restricted information domains , the user 's search vocabulary does not match the author 's vocabulary . users usually start with simple queries that suffer from failure-rates approaching 50 % (nordlie-99) . thus , an information-retrieval-system must provide tools to help overcome the search specification problems discussed above . in particular the search-tools must assist the user automatically and through system interaction in developing a search specification that represents the need of the user and the writing style of diverse authors (see figure 1.3) and multi-media specification . introduction to information-retrieval-systems authors ' vocabulary on the concept in the item user 's general-vocabulary figure 1.3 vocabulary domains in addition to finding the information relevant to a user 's needs , an objective of an information-system is to present the search-results in a format that facilitates the user in determining relevant items . historically data has been presented in an order dictated by how it was physically stored . typically , this is in arrival to the system order , thereby always displaying the results of a search sorted by time . for those users interested in current-events this is useful . but for the majority of searches it does not filter out less useful information . information-retrieval-systems provide functions that provide the results of a query in order of potential relevance to the user . this , in conjunction with user-search status (e.g. , listing titles of highest ranked items) and item formatting options , provides the user with features to assist in selection and review of the most likely relevant items first . even more sophisticated techniques use item clustering , item summarization and link-analysis to provide additional item selection insights (see chapter 8 .) other features such as viewing only `` unseen '' items also help a user who can not complete the item review-process in one session . in the area of question/answer systems that is coming into focus in information-retrieval , the retrieved items are not returned to the user . instead the answer to their question - or a short segment of text that contains the answer - is what is returned . this is a more complex process then summarization since the results need to be focused on the specific information-need versus general area of the users query . the approach to this problem most used in trec - s was to first perform a search using existing 10 chapter algorithms , then to syntactically parse the highest ranked retrieved items looking for specific passages that answer the question . see chapter 11 for more details . multi-media information-retrieval adds a significant layer of complexity on how to display multi-modal results . for example , how should video segments potentially relevant to a user 's query be represented for user-review and selection ? it could be represented by two thumbnail still-images of the start and end of the segment , or should the major scene changes be represented (the latter technique would avoid two pictures of the news announcer versus the subject of the video segment .)
