assessing relevance to properly evaluate a system , your test information-needs must be germane to the documents in the test document-collection , and appropriate for predicted usage of the system . these information-needs are best designed by domain-experts . using random combinations of query terms as an information-need is generally not a good idea because typically they will not resemble the actual distribution-of-information needs . given information-needs and documents , you need to collect relevance-assessments . this is a time-consuming and expensive process involving human beings . for tiny collections like cranfield , exhaustive judgments of relevance for each query and document pair were obtained . for large modern collections , it is usual for relevance to be assessed only for a subset of the documents for each query . the most standard approach is pooling , where relevance is assessed over a subset of the collection that is formed from the top documents returned by a number of different ir systems (usually the ones to be evaluated) , and perhaps other sources such as the results of boolean keyword searches or documents found by expert searchers in an interactive-process . table 8.2 : calculating the kappa-statistic . judge 2 relevance yes no total judge 1 yes 300 20 320 relevance no 10 70 80 total 310 90 400 observed proportion of the times the judges agreed pooled marginals probability that the two judges agreed by chance kappa-statistic a human is not a device that reliably reports a gold-standard judgment of relevance of a document to a query . rather , humans and their relevance-judgments are quite idiosyncratic and variable . but this is not a problem to be solved : in the final analysis , the success of an ir-system depends on how good it is at satisfying the needs of these idiosyncratic humans , one information-need at a time . nevertheless , it is interesting to consider and measure how much agreement between judges there is on relevance-judgments . in the social-sciences , a common measure for agreement between judges is the kappa-statistic . it is designed for categorical judgments and corrects a simple agreement-rate for the rate of chance-agreement . (46) marginal 8.2 interjudge agreement of relevance has been measured within the trec evaluations and for medical ir collections . using the above rules of thumb , the level of agreement normally falls in the range of `` fair '' (0.67-0 .8) . the fact that human agreement on a binary relevance-judgment is quite modest is one reason for not requiring more fine-grained relevance labeling from the test-set creator . to answer the question of whether ir-evaluation results are valid despite the variation of individual assessors ' judgments , people have experimented with evaluations taking one or the other of two judges ' opinions as the gold-standard . the choice can make a considerable absolute-difference to reported scores , but has in general been found to have little impact on the relative effectiveness ranking of either different systems or variants of a single system which are being compared for effectiveness . subsections critiques and justifications of the concept of relevance
