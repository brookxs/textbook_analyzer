15.4.3 structured-documents while multimedia depends on the stream abstraction , structured-documents require both the abstractions of streams and structures . indeed , structured-documents in their essence are streams with one or more structures imposed . 422 digital-libraries often by the insertion of markup in the stream , but sometimes through a separate external structure , like pointers in hypertext . since chapter 6 of this book covers many of the key issues of document-structure , we focus in this section on issues of particular relevance to digital librarys [288] . for example , since digital librarys typically include both documents and metadata describing them , it is important to realize that metadata as in marc-records can be represented as an sgml-document (see chapter 6 for more details) and that sgml content can be included in the base document and/or be kept separately [293] . structure is often important in documents when one wants to add value or make texts ` smart ' [167] . it can help identify important concepts [626] . sgml is often used to describe structure since most documents fall into one or more common logical-structures [750] , that can be formally described using a document-type-definition (dtd) . another type of structure that is important in digital librarys , as well as earlier paper forms , results from annotation [548] . in this case stream and structure are supplemented by scenarios since annotations result from users interacting with a document-collection , as well as collaborating with each other through these shared-artifacts [680] . structure is also important in retrieval . macleod was one of the first to describe special concerns related to ir involving structured-documents [533] . searching on structure as well as content remains one of the distinguishing advantages of ir systems like opentext (formerly ` pat ' [38]) . ongoing work considers retrieval with structured-documents , such as with patterns and hierarchical texts [439] . an alternative approach , at the heart of much of the work in the berkeley digital libraryi project [775] , shifts the burden of handling structure in documents to the user , by allowing multiple-layers of filters and tools to operate on so-called ` multivalent documents ' [774] . thus , a page-image including a table can be analyzed with a table tool that understands the table structure and sorts it by considering the values in a user-selected column . structure at the level above documents , that is , of collections of documents , is what makes searching necessary and possible . it also is a defining characteristic of digital librarys , especially when the collections are distributed .
