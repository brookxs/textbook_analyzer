12.5.1 image-features and distance-functions we mainly focus on the color-features , because color presents an interesting problem (namely , the % cross-talk '' of features) , which can be resolved by the gemini 358 multimedia-ir : indexing and searching pixel count orange pink dark blue bright red light blue figure 12.7 an example of a color-histogram of a fictitious sunset photograph : many red , pink , orange , purple , and blue-ish pixels ; few yellow , white , and green-ish ones . approach (algorithm 2) . for color , we compute a / e-element color-histogram for each item and scene , where k = 256 or 64 colors . each component in the color-histogram is the percentage of pixels that are most similar to that color . figure 12.7 gives an example of such a histogram of a fictitious photograph of a sunset : there are many red , pink , orange , and purple pixels , but only a few white and green ones . once these histograms are computed , one method to measure the distance between two histograms (a : x 1 vectors) x and y is given by xj - y3) (12.6) where the superscript t indicates matrix-transposition , and the color-to-color similarity-matrix a has entries ai3 which describe the similarity between color i and color j.
