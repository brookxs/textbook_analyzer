5.3 automatic local analysis in a user-relevance-feedback cycle , the user examines the top ranked documents and separates them into two classes : the relevant ones and the non-relevant ones . this information is then used to select new terms for query-expansion . the reasoning is that the expanded query will retrieve more relevant documents . thus , there is an underlying notion of clustering supporting the feedback strategy . according to this notion , known relevant documents contain terms which can be used to describe a larger cluster of relevant documents . in this case , the description of this larger cluster of relevant documents is built interactively with assistance from the user . a distinct approach is to attempt to obtain a description for a larger cluster of relevant documents automatically . this usually involves identifying terms which are related to the query terms . such terms might be synonyms , stemming variations , or terms which are close to the query terms in the text (i.e. , terms with a distance of at most k words from a query-term) . two basic types of strategies can be attempted : global ones and local ones . in a global strategy , all documents in the collection are used to determine a global thesaurus-like structure which defines term-relationships . this structure is then shown to the user who selects terms for query-expansion . global-strategies are discussed in section 5.4 . in a local-strategy , the documents retrieved for a given query q are examined at query time to determine terms for query-expansion . this is similar to a relevance-feedback cycle but might be done without assistance from the user (i.e. , the approach might be fully automatic) . two local strategies are discussed below : local-clustering and local-context-analysis . the first is based on the work done by attar and fraenkel in 1977 and is used here to establish many of the fundamental-ideas and concepts regarding the usage of clustering for query-expansion . the second is a recent work done by xu and croft in 1996 and illustrates the advantages of combining techniques from both local and global-analysis . 124 query-operations
