8.2.1 background a significant portion of the brain is devoted to vision and supports the maximum information transfer-function from the environment to a human being . the center of debates in the 1970s was whether vision should be considered data-collection or also has aspects of information-processing . in 1969 arnheim questioned the then current psychological division of cognitive operations of 204 chapter 8 perception and thinking as separate processes (arnheim-69) . until then perception was considered a data-collection task and thinking as a higher level function using the data . he contended that visual-perception includes the process of understanding the information , providing an ongoing feedback-mechanism between the perception and thinking . he further expanded his views arguing that treating perception and thinking as separate functions treats the-mind as a serial automata (arnheim-86) . under this paradigm , the two mental functions exclude each other , with perception dealing with individual instances versus generalizations . visualization is the transformation of information into a visual form which enables the user to observe and understand the information . this concept can be extended where the visual images provide a fundamentally different way to understand information that treats the visual-input not as discrete facts but as an understanding-process . the gestalt psychologists postulate that the-mind follows a set of rules to combine the input stimuli to a mental-representation that differs from the sum of the individual inputs (rock-90) : proximity - nearby figures are grouped together similarity - similar figures are grouped together continuity - figures are interpreted as smooth continuous patterns rather than discontinuous concatenations of shapes (e.g. , a circle with its diameter drawn is perceived as two continuous shapes , a circle and a line , versus two half circles concatenated together) closure - gaps within a figure are filled in to create a whole (e.g. , using dashed lines to represent a square does not prevent understanding it as a square) connectedness - uniform and linked spots , lines or areas are perceived as a single unit shifting the information-processing load from slower cognitive-processes to faster perceptual systems significantly improves the information-carrying interfaces between humans and computers (card-96) . there are many ways to present information in the visual-space . an understanding of the way the cognitive-processes work provides insights for the decisions on which of the presentations will maximize the information passing and understanding . there is not a single correct answer on the best way to present information .
