composite measures dissatisfaction in the past with methods of measuring effectiveness by a pair of numbers (e.g. precision-and-recall) which may co-vary in a loosely specified way has led to attempts to invest composite measures . these are still based on the ` contingency ' table but combine parts of it into a single number measure . unfortunately many of these measures are rather ad-hoc and can not be justified in any rational way . the simplest example of this kind of measure is the sum of precision-and-recall s = p + r this is simply related to a measure suggested by borko bk = p + r - 1 more complicated ones are vickery 's measure v can be shown to be a special case of a general measure which will be derived below . some single-number measures have derivations which can be justified in a rational manner . some of them will be given individual attention later on . suffice it here to point out that it is the model underlying the derivation of these measures that is important .
