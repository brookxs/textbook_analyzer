computational details i now turn to some of the more practical details of computing g (x) for each x when the variables xi are assumed to be stochastically dependent . the main aim of this section will be to demonstrate that the computations involved are feasible . the clearest way of doing this is to discuss the calculation of each ` object ' emim , mst , and g (.) separately and in that order .
