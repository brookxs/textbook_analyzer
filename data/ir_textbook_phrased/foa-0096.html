5.3.1 multidimensional-scaling in many kinds of retrieval-interfaces , it is easy and natural for a user to indicate a preference for one retrieved document over another . the relevance-feedback discussed in section 4.1 is our standard characterization of this information : ^ e - lt ; # - lt ; (5.21) the literature on multidimensional-scaling (mds) was developed to deal with assessments by human-subjects of the similarity or difference among multiple stimulus patterns [borg and lingoes , 1987] . a robust and important result from this analysis is that people can much more easily and consistently provide nonmetric assessments of the similarity than if they are forced to specify metric quantities . rather than an experimenter arbitrarily imposing dimensions they believe important , we can ask the subjects to globally judge , without criteria provided by the experimenter , the overall similarities of different facial-expressions . the proximities are then mapped into [mds] distances xgt ; and the configuration examined for systematic characteristics of the distribution of points . [borg and lingoes , 1987 , p. 72 , emphasis added] the `` facial-expression '' example is a reference to woodworth 's experiments in 1938 [woodworth , 1938] . imagine a hypothesis that facial-expressions can be characterized in terms of two dimensions of variability . we could test this by showing human-subjects pairs of pictures and asking them to judge how similar or dissimilar the two facial-expressions are , in terms of `` difference in emotional-expression or content . '' then imagine they are given some proximity p scale-from 1 , 2 , ... k - along which they are to rank the picture pairs ; each pair of pictures would therefore have a proximity-score pij . if these pictures are to be characterized in a two-dimensional plane , we can also associate with each pair of pictures a distance d {j according to their two-dimensional irhas historically ignored preferences 162 finding out about proximity can capture similarity or dissimilarity/distance coordinates ^ ij = proximity (evaluation) jj = distance (in two-dimensional plane) the mds analysis described by borg and lingoes (they actually prefer the term `` similarity structure analysis , '' or ssa) is a key contribution . it is an algorithm for iteratively moving vectors corresponding to the objects of evaluation (pictures of facial-expressions) within an arbitrary dimensional space so as to minimize as much as possible the stress they experience , relative to their pairwise proximities . we think that the pictures have been well placed if those with similar proximities are close together as measured by this distance . within any such space , we can replace the pairwise distances dij with di associated with each point (picture) measuring the distance of this point from the origin of the space . proximities pi are defined in terms of the projections of these points onto the space 's principal-component vectors . to quantify this notion of correspondence between humans ' proximity assessments and their embedding in arbitrary spaces , guttman has defined a measure of monotonic correspondence between two variables : fl2 = (5.22) ej : \ pi-pj \ - \ di-dj \ ' j this measure captures the extent to which the placement of the items within the two-dimensional space is consistent with the proximities . this formula really is as simple as it looks : it is approximately a correlation of proximities with distances , `` gated '' by the comparison of differences in the numerator and absolute values of differences in the denominator . the value of / x2 is always greater than simple linear correlation , and the two quantities are exactly equal when a linear relationship holds between proximity and distance . in the foa retrieval situation , the obvious measure of interest is the matching-function match (q , d) (cf. section 4.3.4) score with respect to a (henceforth implicit) query q : j2 match (di) - match (dj) d. vdl . / = d , | match (di) j) \ mathematical foundations 163 the / measure provides a criterion for the retrieval-function match (-) . in experimental situations the only preferences available are that rel gt ; - reu but in natural retrieval situations , users ' richer relevance-feedback preference data can be used . a particularly interesting use of this criterion is as part of error-correction learning (cf. section 7.3) . if we assume that the ranking-function r has certain free-variables © , that we again have a training-set of documents t , and that the / criterion is differentiate with respect to 0 , a gradient search-procedure can be used to adjust © toward an optimal retrieval : 91 (matchæ) v ^ 3 / (matchæ) 9matchæ (d) 9 © # ^ t 9matchæ (d) 9 © for example , bartell et al. [bartell et al. , 1994b ; bartell et al. , 1998] consider the problem of picking a document-query similarity-measure r parameterized by © to vary across a broad range of alternatives : matche (d) = simæ (d , q) = ----- ** 'd (5.25) 0 = (0i , 62) (5.26) this characterization of similarity-score includes standard inner-product (02 = 0 , 0i can be anything) , cosine (6 \ = 2 , 02 = 0.5) , and pseudocosine (0i = 1 , 02 = 1) as special cases . through empirical-testing using the cisi experimental corpus (cf. section 4.3.9) and its binary relevance-assessments for preference-relations (rel gt ; - rel) , bartell et al. found optimal values of 0 \ = 2.5 , 02 = 0.3 , a curious and nonstandard type of similarity-measure indeed , but functionally quite similar to standard cosine . in fact , changing the matching-function to this `` optimal '' value improves performance (as measured by average-precision) almost not at all .
