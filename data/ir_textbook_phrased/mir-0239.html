12.4.3 experiments performance-results with the gemini approach on time-series are reported in [6] . there , the method is compared to a sequential-scanning method . the r * - tree was used for the spatial-access-method within gemini . the sequences were artificially generated random-walks , with length n = 1024 ; their number a7 varied from 50 to 400 . figure 12.5 shows the break-up of the response-time , as a function of the number / of dft coefficients kept . the diamonds , triangles , and squares indicate total time , post-processing time , and i ? * - tree time , respectively . notice that , as we keep more features / , the i ? * ~ tree becomes bigger and slower , but more accurate (fewer false-alarms , and therefore shorter post-processing time) . this tradeoff reaches an equilibrium for / = 2 or 3 . for the rest of the experiments , the / = 2 fourier-coefficients were kept for indexing , resulting in a four-dimensional i ? * - tree (two real numbers for each complex dft coefficient) . 356 multimedia-ir : indexing and searching p ; 80 63 lt ; gt ; ----------------- ^ óó ? search a post 0 total 16 5 2 3 4 number of fourier-coefficients figure 12.5 breakup of the execution-time , for range-query (db size n = 400 sequences) . 178 - y ' '' d gemini a seq 80 42 4 21 11 1 t \ \ 50 100 200 sequence set-size 400 figure 12.6 search-time per query vs. number n of sequences , for whole-match queries ; gemini (black line) and sequential-scanning (gray line) . figure 12.6 shows the response-time for the two methods (gemini and sequential-scan) , as a function of the number of sequences n. clearly , gemini outperforms the sequential-scanning . the major conclusions from the application of gemini on time-series are the following : (1j gemini can be successfully applied to time-series , and specifically to the ones that behave like ` colored noises ' (stock prices movements , currency exchange rates , water level in rivers etc.) . (2) for signals with skewed spectrum like the above ones , the minimum in the response-time is achieved for a small number of fourier-coefficients (/ = 1,2,3) . moreover , the minimum is rather flat , which implies that two-dimensional color-images 357 a suboptimal choice for / will give search-time that is close to the minimum . thus , with the help of the lower-bounding lemma and the energy-concentrating properties of the dft , we managed to avoid the ` dimensionality-curse . ' (3) the success in id series suggests that gemini is promising for 2d or higher-dimensionality signals , if those signals also have skewed spectrum . the success of jpeg (that uses dot) indicates that real images indeed have a skewed spectrum . finally , the method has been extended to handle subpattern matching ; for time-sequences , the details are in [249] . we only mention the main idea here . assuming that query-patterns have length of at least iu , we preprocess every sequence of the database , by allowing a sliding-window of length w at each and every possible position , and by extracting the / features for a given positioning of the window . thus , every sequence becomes a trail in the / - dimensional feature-space , which can be further approximated by a set of few mbrs that cover it . representing each sequence by a few mbrs in feature-space may allow false-alarms , but no false dismissals . the approach can be generalized for subpattern matching in 2d signals (and , in general , in n-dimensional vector-fields) .
