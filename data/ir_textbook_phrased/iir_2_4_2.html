positional indexes for the reasons given , a biword index is not the standard solution . rather , a positional index is most commonly employed . here , for each term in the vocabulary , we store postings of the form docid : position1 , position2 , ... , as shown in figure 2.11 , where each position is a token index in the document . each posting will also usually record the term-frequency , for reasons discussed in chapter 6 . to process a phrase-query , you still need to access the inverted-index entries for each distinct term . as before , you would start with the least frequent term and then work to further restrict the list of possible candidates . in the merge-operation , the same general technique is used as before , but rather than simply checking that both terms are in a document , you also need to check that their positions of appearance in the document are compatible with the phrase-query being evaluated . this requires working out offsets between the words . worked example . satisfying phrase queries.phrasequery suppose the postings lists for to and be are as in figure 2.11 , and the query is `` to be or not to be '' . the postings lists to access are : to , be , or , not . we will examine intersecting the postings lists for to and be . we first look for documents that contain both terms . then , we look for places in the lists where there is an occurrence of be with a token index one higher than a position of to , and then we look for another occurrence of each word with token index 4 higher than the first occurrence . in the above lists , the pattern of occurrences that is a possible match is : to : ... ; 4 : ... ,429,433 ; ... be : ... ; 4 : ... ,430,434 ; ... end worked example . the same general method is applied for within word proximity searches , of the sort we saw in westlaw : employment / 3 place 2.12 2.4.3 subsections positional index-size .
