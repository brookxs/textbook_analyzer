the idea here is that the user explores a document space which has a flat organization . for instance , the documents might be represented as dots in a (two-dimensional) plan or as elements in a (single dimension) list . the user then glances here and there looking for information within the documents visited . for instance , he might look for correlations among neighbor documents or for keywords which are of interest to mm . such keywords could then be added to the original query in an attempt to provide better contextualization . this is a process called relevance-feedback which is discussed in detail in chapter 5 . also , the user could explore a single-document in a flat manner . for example , he could use a browser to look into a web-page , using the arrows and the scroll bar . one disadvantage is that in a given page or screen there may not be any indication about the context where the user is . for example , if he opens a novel at a random page , he might not know in which chapter that page is . web-search-engines such as `` yahoo! 1 provide , besides the standard search-interface , a hierarchical directory which can be used for browsing (and frequently , for searching) . however , the organization is not flat as discussed below . 66 modeling
