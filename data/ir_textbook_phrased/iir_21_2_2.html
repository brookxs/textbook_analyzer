the pagerank computation 214 (255) the entries in the principal-eigenvector are the steady-state probabilities of the random-walk with teleporting , and thus the pagerank values for the corresponding web-pages . we may interpret equation 255 as follows : if is the probability distribution of the surfer across the-web pages , he remains in the steady-state distribution . given that is the steady-state distribution , we have that , so 1 is an eigenvalue of p. thus if we were to compute the principal left eigenvector of the-matrix -- the one with eigenvalue 1 -- we would have computed the pagerank values . there are many algorithms available for computing left eigenvectors ; the references at the end of chapter 18 and the present chapter are a guide to these . we give here a rather elementary method , sometimes known as power-iteration . if is the initial distribution over the states , then the distribution at time is . as grows large , we would expect that the distribution is very similar to the distribution , since for large we would expect the markov chain to attain its steady-state . by theorem 21.2.1 this is independent of the initial distribution . the power-iteration method simulates the surfer 's walk : begin at a state and run the walk for a large number of steps , keeping track of the visit frequencies for each of the states . after a large number of steps , these frequencies `` settle down '' so that the variation in the computed frequencies is below some predetermined threshold . we declare these tabulated frequencies to be the pagerank values . we consider the-web graph in exercise 21.2.3 with . the transition-probability matrix of the surfer 's walk with teleportation is then (256) (257) (258) 21.3 figure 21.3 : the sequence of probability vectors . continuing for several steps , we see that the distribution converges to the steady-state of . in this simple example , we may directly calculate this steady-state probability-distribution by observing the symmetry of the markov chain : states 1 and 3 are symmetric , as evident from the fact that the first and third rows of the transition-probability matrix in equation 256 are identical . postulating , then , that they both have the same steady-state probability and denoting this probability by , we know that the steady-state distribution is of the form . now , using the identity , we solve a simple linear equation to obtain and consequently , . the pagerank values of pages (and the implicit ordering amongst them) are independent of any query a user might pose ; pagerank is thus a query-independent measure of the static quality of each web-page (recall such static quality measures from section 7.1.4) . on the other hand , the relative ordering of pages should , intuitively , depend on the query being served . for this reason , search-engines use static quality measures such as pagerank as just one of many factors in scoring a web-page on a query . indeed , the relative contribution of pagerank to the overall score may again be determined by machine-learned scoring as in section 15.4.1 . worked example . consider the graph in figure 21.4 . for a teleportation rate of 0.14 its (stochastic) transition-probability matrix is : (259) (260) 21.4 end worked example .
