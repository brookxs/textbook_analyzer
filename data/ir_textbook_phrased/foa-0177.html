8.3.1 authors note first the new precision/recall-like trade-offs facing authors : if they are aggressively selling their documents , then putting spam-like descriptors on them will make them be retrieved in the most possible situations . getting your document into the hands of only those readers you anticipate finding it relevant means anticipating their queries and how they 'll describe their information-need . who is the audience ? what words are familiar to this audience ? what words in this document will be unfamiliar to them ? how might you describe the unfamiliar concepts using familiar words ? at their core , these questions are no different from what authors have needed to ask since the beginning . the tendency of authors to oversell their documents is exactly what makes checkpoints in the publication-process valuable . we value news editors , publishers , reviewers , and all others whose profession it is to apply discretion . authors should think about foa because they need to have their documents found . publishers have traditionally helped with this process , but only for those authors they choose to publish . the www opens a much larger number of useful communication-channels to potential authors . not all of this authoring activity is healthy , however . moderation of newsgroups and the peer-review-process are two important checks on the flow of information that have worked traditionally in usenet and scientific exchanges . authors need to know how to write to be found . the ability to separate documents explicitly with meta-data about the documents means that there is no need to compromise the work itself to publicize it to an audience . it is true , of course , that the most effective ways of automatically producing meta-descriptions of a document still involve foa-style statistical keyword-analysis . but many authors are willing to manually add useful keywords or connect their documents to relevant-web pages or search-engines . for many authors and artists this explicit analysis of potential readerships is an important part of their art . conclusions and future-directions 309 of course , authors may or may not be aware of all of the ways potential readers might be interested in their work . this is where a third-party editorial role becomes most valuable . good editors are able to span the gap between what an author is trying to say and what an audience is interested in hearing .
