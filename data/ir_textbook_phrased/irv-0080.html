averaging techniques the method of pooling or averaging of the individual p-r curves seems to have depended largely on the retrieval-strategy employed . when retrieval is done by co-ordination level , micro-evaluation is adopted . if s is the set of requests then : where as is the set of documents relevant to request s . if [[lambda]] is the co-ordination level , then : where b [[lambda]] s is the set of documents retrieved at or above the co-ordination level [[lambda]] . the points (r [[lambda]] , p [[lambda]]) are now calculated as follows : figure 7.2 shows graphically what happens when two individual p-r curves are combined in this way . the raw data are given in table 7.1 . an alternative approach to averaging is macro-evaluation which can be independent of any parameter such as co-ordination level . the average curve is obtained by specifying a set of standard recall values for which average-precision values are calculated by averaging over all queries the individual precision values corresponding to the standard recall values . often no unique precision value corresponds exactly so it becomes necessary to interpolate . table 7.1 . the raw data for the micro-evaluation in figure 7.2
