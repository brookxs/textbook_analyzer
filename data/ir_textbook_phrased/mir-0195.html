10.5.4 graphical approaches to query-specification direct-manipulation-interfaces provide an alternative to command-line syntax . the properties of direct-manipulation are [725 , p. 205] : (1) continuous representation of the object of interest , (2) physical actions or button presses instead of complex syntax , and (3) rapid incremental reversible operations whose impact on the object of interest is immediately visible . direct-manipulation-interfaces often evoke enthusiasm from users , and for this reason alone it is worth exploring their use . although they are not without drawbacks , they are easier to use than other methods for many users in many contexts . query-specification 283 search for any documents in `` hci bibliography '' containing either query and boolean , or graphical , searching and browsing , but not rankino æhci bibliography match the selected query graphical presentation of boolean-expressions in a fl . richard query-processing in a heterogeneous retrieval heta patricia simpson on extending the uector - space oodel for boolean qu s. k. ti . uong , u slarko , u , u ragbavon , pen lleng fi direct rtanipulot ion interface for boolean inform peter g. flnlck , jeffrey 0 . brennon , rex h , `` lynn , dawi j figure 10.10 tion [417] . the vquery venn-diagram visualization for boolean-query specificaseveral variations of graphical-interfaces , both directly manipulable and static , have been developed for simplifying the specification of boolean syntax . user-studies tend to reveal that these graphical-interfaces are more effective in terms of accuracy and speed than command-language counterparts . three such approaches are described below . graphical depictions of venn diagrams have been proposed several times as a way to improve boolean-query specification . a query-term is associated with a ring or circle and intersection of rings indicates conjunction of terms . typically the number of documents that satisfy the various conjuncts are displayed within the appropriate segments of the diagram . several studies have found such interfaces more effective than their command-language-based syntax [417 , 368 , 558] . hertzum and prokjaer found that a simple venn-diagram representation produced faster and more accurate results than a boolean-query syntax . however , a problem with this format is the limitations on the complexity of the expression . for example , a maximum of three query terms can be anded together in a standard venn-diagram . innovations have been designed to get around this problem , as seen in the vquery system [417] (see figure 10.10) . in vquery , a direct-manipulation interface allows users to assign any number of query terms to ovals . if two or more ovals are placed such that they overlap with one another , and if the user selects the area of their intersection , an and is implied among those terms . (in figure 10.10 , the term `` query ' is conjoined with ` boolean ' .) if the user selects outside the area of intersection but within the ovals , an or is implied among the corresponding terms . a not operation 284 user-interfaces and visualization figure 10.11 the filter-flow visualization for boolean-query specification [841] . is associated with any term whose oval appears in the active area of the display but which remains unselected (in the figure , not ` ranking ' has been specified) . an active area indicates the current query ; all groups of ovals within the active area are considered part of a conjunction . ovals containing query terms can be moved out of the active area for later use . young and shneiderman [841] found improvements over standard boolean syntax by providing users with a direct-manipulation filter-flow model . the user is shown a scrollable list of attribute types on the left-hand side and selects attributes from another list of attribute types shown across the top of the screen . clicking on an attribute name causes a list box containing values for those attributes to be displayed in the main portion of the screen . the user then selects which values of the attributes to let the flow go through . placing two or more of these attributes in sequence creates the semantics of a conjunct over the selected values . placing two or more of these in parallel creates the semantics of a disjunct . the number of documents that match the query at each point is indicated by the width of the ` water * flowing from one attribute to the next . (see figure 10.11 . (-rrb- a conjunct can reduce the amount of flow . the items that match the full query are shown on the far right-hand-side . a user-study found that fewer errors were made using the filter flow model than a standard sql database-query . however , the examples and study pertain only to database-querying rather than information-access , since the possible query terms for information-access can not he represented realistically in a scrollable list . this interface could perhaps be modified to better suit information-access applications by having the user supply initial query terms , and using the attribute-selection facility to show those terms query-specification 285 stars : query-reformulation workspace file terms help from i ! tape bu --------- ii under scratch tape version 5 jdl apply changes j | display tides | figure 10.12 [21] . a block-oriented diagram visualization for boolean-query specification that are conceptually related to the query terms . another alternative is to use this display as a category metadata selection interface (see section 10.4) . anick et al [21] describe another innovative direct-manipulation interface for boolean-queries . initially the user-types a natural-language-query which is automatically converted to a representation in which each query-term is represented within a block . the blocks are arranged into rows and columns (see figure 10.12) . if two or more blocks appear along the same row they are considered to be anded together . two or more blocks within the same column are ored . thus the user can represent a technical-term in multiple ways within the same query , providing a kind of faceted query-interface . for example , the terms ` version 5 \ `` version 5-0 ' , and `` vs1 might be shown in the same column . users can quickly experiment with different combinations of terms `` within boolean-queries simply by activating and deactivating blocks . this facility also allows users to have multiple-representations of the same term in different places throughout the display , thus allowing rapid feedback on the consequences of specifying various combinations of query terms . informal evaluation of the system found that users were able to learn to manipulate the interface quickly and enjoyed using it . it was not formally compared to other interaction-techniques [21] . this interface provides a kind of query-preview : a low-cost , rapid turnaround visualization of the results of many variations on a query [643] . another example of query previewing can be found in some help-systems , which show all the words in the index whose first letters match the characters that the user has typed so far . the more characters typed , the fewer possible matches become available . the hibrowse system described above (646] also provides a kind of preview for viewing category hierarchies and facets , showing how many documents would be matched if a category one level below the current one were selected . it perhaps could be improved by showing the consequences of more combinations of categories in an animated manner . if based on prior action and interests of the user , query previewing may become more generally applicable for information-access interfaces . 286 user-interfaces and visualization average annual pay , 1991 ? anaheim , ca long beach * ca ? los angeles , ca d riverside , ca ¶ san diego , c a santa ana , ca n figure 10.13 fishkin) . a magic-lens interface for query-specification (courtesy of ken a final example of a graphical approach to query-specification is the use of niagic lenses . fishkin and stone have suggested an extension to the usage of this visualization-tool for the specification of boolean-queries [256] . information is represented as lists or icons within a 2d space . lenses act as filters on the document-set . (see figure 10.13 .) for example , a word can be associated with a transparent lens . when this lens is placed over an iconic representation of a set of documents , it can cause all documents that do not contain a given word to disappear . if a second lens representing another word is then laid over the first , the lenses combine to act as a conjunction of the two words with the document set , hiding any documents that do not contain both words . additional-information can be adjusted dynamically , such as a minimum threshold for how often the term occurs in the documents , or an on-off switch for word-stemming . for example . figure 10.13 shows a disjunctive query that finds cities with relatively low housing prices or high annual salaries . one lens ` calls out ' a clump of southern california cities , labeling each . above that is a lens screening for cities with average house price below $ 194,821 (the data is from 1990) , and above this one is a leiib screening for cities with average annual pay above $ 28,477 . this approach , while promising , has not been evaluated in an information-access setting .
