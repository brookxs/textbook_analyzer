288 finding out about 7.7.2 adapting to fluid language-use the advantages of my benefiting from your experience training a system are obvious . just as obvious , though , are ways in which you and i might differ in our notions of relevant documents . even this comparison is only possible if we each evaluate exactly the same query , and how often will that happen ?! if we are to change our representations of documents based on users ' opinions , should we value `` expert '' opinions over those of `` novices '' ? common-sense would suggest that if we could ascertain that one user was indeed expert in a particular topical area , then their assessments of relevance should perhaps carry more weight . but based at least on the experience of lawyers searching case-law [cohen , 1991 ; sprowl , 1976] experts are less likely to search in their own area of expertise , probably because they already know what they will find there . the typical user searches in areas they know less about . in that respect , perhaps the novice 's relevance-feedback is , in fact , a better characterization of what we should attempt to satisfy . once the index-representation is allowed to change in response to users ' relevance-feedback we are faced with the question of how fast this change should occur . some of these questions were mentioned in terms of conceptual drift by users and topic-tracking in news sources (cf. section 7.3.2) . adopting the longer-term archival perspective of a librarian perhaps , how quickly should we want our adaptive-system to track current trendy terms ? (cf. wired magazine 's tired/wired memes4 feature) . when old terms of art have been rendered obsolete , how can we nevertheless maintain an archival record of this previous ethology terminology ? * ^ ''
