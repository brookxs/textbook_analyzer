10.8 interface-support for the search-process the user-interface designer must make decisions about how to arrange various kinds of information on the computer screen and how to structure the possible sequences of interactions . this design-problem is especially daunting for a complex activity like information-access . in this section we discuss design choices surrounding the layout of information within complex-information-systems , and illustrate the ideas with examples of existing interfaces . we begin with a discussion of very simple search-interfaces , those used for string search in ` find ' operations , and then progress to rnultrwindow interfaces and sophisticated workspaces . this is followed by a discussion of the integration of scanning , selecting , and querying within information-access interfaces and concludes with interface-support for retaining the history of the search-process .
