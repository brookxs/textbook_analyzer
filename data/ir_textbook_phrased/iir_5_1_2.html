zipf 's law : modeling the distribution of terms 5.3 a commonly used model of the distribution of terms in a collection is zipf 's law . it states that , if is the most common term in the collection , is the next most common , and so on , then the collection frequency of the th most common term is proportional to : (3) 3 equivalently , we can write zipf 's law as or as where and is a constant to be defined in section 5.3.2 . it is therefore a power-law with exponent . see chapter 19 , page 19.2.1 , for another power-law , a law characterizing the distribution of links on web-pages . zipf 's law for reuters-rcv1 . frequency is plotted as a function of frequency rank for the terms in the collection . the line is the distribution predicted by zipf 's law (weighted least-squares fit ; intercept is 6.95) . the log-log graph in figure 5.2 plots the collection frequency of a term as a function of its rank for reuters-rcv1 . a line with slope -1 , corresponding to the zipf function , is also shown . the fit of the data to the law is not particularly good , but good enough to serve as a model for term distributions in our calculations in section 5.3 . exercises . assuming one machine word per posting , what is the size of the uncompressed (nonpositional) index for different tokenizations based on table 5.1 ? how do these numbers compare with table 5.6 ?
