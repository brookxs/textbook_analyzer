6.5.2 textual-images a particular class of images that is very important in office-systems , multimedia-retrieval and digital-libraries are images of documents that contain mainly typed or typeset text . these are called textual-images and are obtained by scanning the documents , usually for archiving purposes ó a procedure that also makes the images (and their associated text) available to anyone through a computer network . the fact that a large portion of a textual-image is text can be used for retrieval purposes and efficient compression . although we do not cover-image compression in this chapter , we have seen that the most popular image formats include some form of compression embedded in them . in the case of textual-images , further compression can be achieved by extracting the different text symbols or marks from the image , building a library of symbols for them , and representing each one (within the image) by a position in the library . as many symbols are repeated , the compression-ratio is quite good . although this technique is lossy (because the reconstructed image is not equal to the original) , the reconstructed image can be read without problems . additional-information can be stored to reproduce the original image , but for most applications this is not needed . if the image contains non-textual information such as logos or signatures , which might be necessary to reproduce , they may be extracted through a segmentation-process , stored , and compressed separately . when needed , the textual and non-textual parts of the image can be combined and displayed together . regarding the retrieval of textual-images , several alternatives are possible as follows : ï at creation time or when added to the database , a set of ke} rwords that describe the image is associated with it (for example , metadata can be used) . later , conventional text-retrieval techniques can be applied to those keywords . this alternative is valid for any multimedia-object . ï use ocr to extract the text of the image . the resultant ascii text can be used to extract keywords , as before , or as a full-text description of the multimedia 159 image . depending on the document-type , the ocr output could be reasonably good or actually quite bad (consider the first page of a newspaper , with several columns , different font types and sizes) . in any case , many typos are introduced and a usual keyword-based query might miss many documents (in this case , an approximate-search is better , but also slower) . use the symbols extracted from the images as basic units to combine image-retrieval techniques (see chapter 12) with sequence retrieval techniques (see chapter 8) . in this case , the query is transformed into a symbol sequence that has to match approximately another symbol sequence in the compressed image . this idea seems promising but has not been pursued yet .
