(active) colophon production of this book would have been impossible without the use of a number of tools . many of these were provided by their developers free of charge or as shareware . these include : # the emacs-editor and related tools from gnu project ; ï the htjhx and tgk formatting systems , and the oztex port to macqs ; ï the gimp image-manipulation package ; and * the linux-operating-system , to name only a few . said another way , this text should be considered a beneficiary of the open-source-movement , as recently enunciated by e. s. raymond 's cathedral and the bazaar1 and earlier by gnu manifesto2 by r. stallman . i firmly believe in the future importance of the open-source model and would like to express my appreciation in a more active way than simply listing the tools i 've used . cambridge university press seems to believe there is at least some chance that foa will make more money than it cost to produce ; 111 believe that when i see it . should that come www . tuxedo , org/esr / writings / cathedralbazaar / - www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html 318 (active) colophon 319 to pass , however , it is because you (the reader) bought it , and i think you should get some of the credit ! i therefore propose the following , admittedly unusual , procedure : after expenses directly related to producing foay i hereby commit to passing on 50 percent of all royalties i receive from foa to organizations who have produced the tools listed above (and others) . if you go to the foa web-site 3and register your copy of the text , you will then be allowed to `` vote '' on which of these worthy organizations you 'd like the money to go to ; the-web page will contain full details . 3 http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/-rik/foa/
