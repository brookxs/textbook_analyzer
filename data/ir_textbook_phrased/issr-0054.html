4.2.4 successor stemmers successor stemmers are based upon the length of prefixes that optimally stem expansions of additional suffixes . the algorithm is based upon an analogy in structural linguistics that investigated word and morpheme boundaries based upon the distribution of phonemes , the smallest unit of speech that distinguish one word from another (hafer-74) . the process determines the successor varieties for a word , uses this information to divide a word into segments and selects one of the segments as the stem . the successor variety of a segment of a word in a set of words is the number of distinct letters that occupy the segment length plus one character . for example , the successor variety for the first three letters (i.e. , word segment) of a five-letter word is the number of words that have the same first three letters but a different fourth letter plus one for the current word . a graphical-representation of successor variety is shown in a symbol tree . figure 4.2 shows the symbol tree for the terms bag , barn , bring , both , box , and bottle . the successor variety for any prefix of a word is the number of children that are associated with the node in the symbol tree representing that prefix . for example , the successor variety for the first letter `` b '' is three . the successor variety for the prefix uba '' is two . the successor varieties of a word are used to segment a word by applying one of the following four methods : 1 . cutoff-method : a cutoff value is selected to define stem length . the value varies for each possible set of words . 2 . peak and plateau : a segment break is made after a character whose successor variety exceeds that of the character immediately preceding it and the character immediately following it . 3 - complete word method : break on boundaries of complete words . data-structure 79 4 . entropy method : uses the distribution of successor variety letters . let dak | be the number of words beginning with the k length sequence of letters a. let | dakj | be the number of words in dak with successor j . the a / \ 9 r n n h t figure 4.2 symbol tree for terms bag , barn , bring , box , bottle , both probability that a member of d has the successor j is given by | dak , | / | daic | . the entropy (average information as defined by shannon-5 j) of | dtfj is : 80 chapter 4 26 hak = # - (| dakj | / | dak |) (log2 (| dakj | / | dak |)) p =\ using this formula a set of entropy measures can be calculated for a word and its predecessors . a cutoff value is selected and a boundary is identified whenever the cutoff value is reached . hafer and weiss experimented with the techniques , discovering that combinations of the techniques performed best , which they used in defining their stemming process . using the words in figure 4.2 plus the additional word `` boxer , '' the successor variety stemming is shown in figure 4.3 . prefix successor variety branch letters b 3 a , r , o bo 2 t , x box 1 e boxe 1 r boxer 1 blank figure 4.3 successor variety stemming if the cutoff-method with value four was selected then the stem would be `` boxe . '' the peak and plateau method can not apply because the successor variety monotonically decreases . applying the complete word method , the stem is `` box . '' the example given does not have enough values to apply the entropy method . the advantage of the peak and plateau and the complete word methods is that a cutoff value does not have to be selected (frakes-92) . after a word has been segmented , the segment to be used as the stem must be selected . hafer and weiss used the following rule : if (first segment occurs in lt ; = 12 words in database) first segment is stem else (second segment is stem) the idea is that if a segment is found in more than 12 words in the text being analyzed , it is probably a prefix . hafer and weiss noted that multiple prefixes in the english-language do not occur often and thus selecting the first or second segment in general determines the appropriate stem .
