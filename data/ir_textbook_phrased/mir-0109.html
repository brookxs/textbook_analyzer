6.5 multimedia multimedia usually stands for applications that handle different types of digital-data originating from distinct types of media . the most common types of media in multimedia-applications are text , sound , images , and video (which is an animated sequence of images) . the digital data originating from each of these four multimedia 157 types of media is quite distinct in volume , format , and processing requirements (for instance , video and audio impose real-time constraints on their processing) . as an immediate consequence , different types of formats are necessary for storing each type of media . in this section we cover formats and standard languages for multimedia-applications . in contrast with text formats , most formats for multimedia are partially binary and hence can only be processed by a computer . also , the presentation style is almost completely defined , perhaps with the exception of some spatial or temporal attributes .
