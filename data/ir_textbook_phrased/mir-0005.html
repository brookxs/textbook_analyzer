1.1.3 focus of the book despite the great increase in interest in information-retrieval , modern textbooks on ir with a broad (and extensive) coverage of the various topics in the field are still difficult to find . in an attempt to partially fulfill this gap , this book presents an overall view of research in ir from a computer scientist 's perspective . this means that the focus of the book is on computer algorithms and techniques used in information-retrieval-systems . a rather distinct viewpoint is taken by librarians and information science researchers , who adopt a human-centered interpretation of the ir problem . in this interpretation , the focus is on trying to understand how people interpret and use information as opposed to how to structure , store , and retrieve information automatically . while most of this book is dedicated to the computer scientist 's viewpoint of the ir problem , the human-centered viewpoint is discussed to some extent in the last two chapters . we put great emphasis on the integration of the different areas which are closed related to the information-retrieval problem and thus , should be treated together . for that reason , besides covering text-retrieval , library systems , user-interfaces , and the-web , this book also discusses visualization , multimedia-retrieval , and digital-libraries .
