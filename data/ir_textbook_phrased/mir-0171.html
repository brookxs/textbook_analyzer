9.3.2 collection partitioning the procedure used to assign documents to search servers in a distributed-ir system depends on a number of factors . first , we must consider whether or not the system is centrally administered . in a system comprising independently administered , heterogeneous search servers , the distributed document-collections will be built and maintained independently . in this case , there is no central control of the document-partitioning procedure and the question of how to partition the documents is essentially moot . it may be the case , however , that each independent search-server is focused on a particular subject area , resulting in a semantic-partitioning of the documents into distributed-collections focused on particular subject areas . this situation is common in meta-search systems that provide centralized access to a variety of back-end search-service providers . when the distributed-system is centrally administered , more options are available . the first option is simple replication of the collection across all of the search servers . this is appropriate when the collection is small enough to fit on a single search-server , but high-availability and query-processing throughput are required . in this scenario , the parallelism in the system is being exploited via multitasking (see figure 9.1) and the broker 's job is to route queries to the search servers and balance the loads on the servers . 252 parallel and distributed ir indexing the documents is handled in one of two ways . in the first method , each search-server separately indexes its replica of the documents . in the second method , each server is assigned a mutually exclusive subset of documents to index and the index subsets are replicated across the search servers . a merge of the subsets is required at each search-server to create the final indexes (which can be accomplished using the technique described under document-partitioning in section 9.2.2) . in either case , document updates and deletions must be broadcast to all servers in the system . document additions may be broadcast , or they may be batched and partitioned depending on their frequency and how quickly updates must be reflected by the system . the second option is random distribution of the documents . this is appropriate when a large-document-collection must be distributed for performance reasons but the documents will always be viewed and searched as if they are part of a single , logical collection . the broker broadcasts every query to all of the search servers and combines the results for the user . the final option is explicit semantic partitioning of the documents . here the documents are either already organized into semantically meaningful collections , such as by technical discipline , or an automatic-clustering or categorization procedure is used to partition the documents into subject specific collections .
