10.8.2 window-management for search-tasks more complex than the simple string-matching find operations described above , the interface designer must decide how to lay out the various choices and information displays within the interface . as discussed above , traditional bibliographic-search systems use tty-based command-line-interfaces or menus . when the system responds to a command , the new results screen obliterates the contents of the one before it , requiring the user to remember the context . for example , the user can usually see only one level of a subject hierarchy at a time , and must leave the subject view in order to see query-view or the document view . the main design choices in such a system are in the command or menu structure , and the order of presentation of the available options . in modern graphical-interfaces , the windowing-system can be used to divide functionality into different , simultaneously displayed views [582] . in information-access systems , it is often useful to link the information from one window to the information in another , for example , linking documents to their position in a table-of-contents , as seen in superbook . users can also use the selection to cut and paste information from one window into another , for example , copy a word from a display of thesaurus terms and paste the word into the query-specification form . when arranging information within windows , the designer must choose between a monolithic display , in which all the windows are laid out in predefined positions and are all simultaneously viewable , tiled windows , and overlapping-windows . user-studies have been conducted comparing these options when applied to various tasks [725 , 96] . usually the results of these studies depend on the domain in which the interface is used , and no clear guidelines have yet emerged for information-access interfaces . the monolithic interface has several advantages . it allows the designer to control the organization of the various options , makes all the information simultaneously viewable , and places the features in familiar positions , making them easier to find . but monolithic interfaces have disadvantages as well . they often work best if occupying the full viewing screen , and the number of views is inherently limited by the amount of room available on the screen (as opposed to overlapping-windows which allow display of more information than can fit on the screen at once) . many modern work-intensive applications adopt a monolithic design , but this can hamper the integration of information-access with other work-processes such as text-editing and data-analysis . plaisant et al. [644] discuss issues relating to coordinating information across different windows to providing overview plus details . a problem for any information-access interface is an inherent limit in how many kinds of information can be shown at once . information-access systems must always reserve room for a text-display area , and this must take up a significant proportion of screen-space in order for the text to be legible . a tool within a paint-program , for example , can be made quite small while nevertheless remaining recognizable and usable . for legibility reasons , it is difficult to compress many of the information-displays needed for an information-access system (such 312 user-interfaces and visualization as lists of thesaurus terms , query specifications , and lists of saved titles) in this manner . good layout , graphics , and font-design can improve the situation ; for example , web-search-results can look radically different depending on spacing , font , and other small touches [580] . overlapping-windows provide flexibility in arrangement , but can quickly lead to a crowded , disorganized display . researchers have observed that much user-activity is characterized by movement from one set of functionally related-windows to another . bannon et al. [54] define the notion of a workspace รณ the grouping together of sets of windows known to be functionally related to some activity or goal รณ arguing that this kind of organization more closely matches users ' goal structure than individual windows [96] . card et al. [140] also found that window usage could be categorized according to a ` working-set ' model . they looked at the relationship between the demands of the task and the number of windows in use , and found the largest number of individual windows were in use when users transitioned from one task to another . based on these and other observations , henderson and card [420] built a system intended to make it easier for users to move between ` multiple virtual-workspaces '' [96] . the system uses a 3d spatial metaphor , where each workspace is a ` room , ' and users transition between workspaces by ` moving ' through virtual doors . by ` traveling ' from one room to the next , users can change from one work-context to another . in each work-context , the application-programs and data files that are associated with that work-context are visible and readily available for reopening and perusal . the workspace notion as developed by card et al. also emphasizes the importance of having sessions persist across time . the user should be able to leave a room dedicated to some task , work on another task , and three days later return to the first room and see all of the applications still in the same state as before . this notion of bundling applications and data together for each task has since been widely adopted by window-manager software in workstation operating-system interfaces . elastic-windows [428] is an extension to the workspace or rooms notion to the organization of 2d tiled windows . the main idea is to make the transition easier from one role or task to another , by adjusting how much of the screen real-estate is consumed by the current role . the user can enlarge an entire group of windows with a simple gesture , and this resizing automatically causes the rest of the workspaces to reduce in size so they all still fit on the screen without overlap .
