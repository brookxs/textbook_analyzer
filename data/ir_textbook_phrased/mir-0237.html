12.4.1 distance-function according to gemini (algorithm 2) , the first step is to determine the distance-measure between two time-series . a typical distance-function is the euclidean-distance (equation 12.2) , which is routinely used in financial and forecasting applications . additional , more elaborate distance-functions , that , for example , include time-warping , are discussed in section 12.8 .
