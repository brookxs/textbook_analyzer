3.4.3 summary : smart weighting specification although the variety of potential keyword-weighting schemes (signal/noise , idf , keyword discrimination , etc.) may seem large , there is in fact a systematicity to this variation . smart is an extremely influential and widely used software-system for investigating ir techniques [salton , 1971 ; buckley , 1985] . one secret of its success is that smart provides a simple parameter-driven mechanism for easily changing from one form of index weighting to another . in smart , the weight is decomposed into three factors : = freqkd * discrim , ^ norm weighting and matching against indices 93 each of these components can then be specified independently : freclkd = discrimk = {0,1} binary fkd maxnorm max (fkd) k i , i fkd augmented 2 2max (fkd) k in {fkd) + 1 log ndoc log inverse 1 nd0cv a log -------) squared dk) ndoc - dk . , . , . , . log ------- รณ ------- probabilistic 1 at dk frequency norm = r 2 _ \ wi sum 2 fourth max (iy ;-rrb- max i vector (3.33) (3.34) (3.35)
