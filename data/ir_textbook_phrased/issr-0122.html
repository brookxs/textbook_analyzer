10.3 graph retrieval another important media class is graphics , to include tables and charts (e.g. , column , bar , line , pie , scatter) . graphs are constructed from more primitive data elements such as points , lines , and labels . an innovative example of a graph retrieval-system is sagebook (chuah , roth , and kerpedjiev 1997) created at carnegie mellon university (see www.cs.cmu.edu/groups/sage/sage.html) . sagebook , enables both search and customization of stored data graphics . just as we may require an audio query during audio-retrieval , sagebook supports datagraphic query , representation (i.e. , content-description) , indexing , search , and adaptation capabilities . figure 10.3 shows an example of a graphical-query and the data-graphics returned for that query . as illustrated in the bottom left hand side of figure 10.3 , queries are formulated via a graphical direct-manipulation interface (called v - , er fau picagfl _________ | ¶ -- sv - v , - r l | (l | , , , , lw ... . . , l , ' , ´ lw | | m , n ' . , , ml , ! ... ... ñ ... . ñ ... . , ¶ . ññ ´ , , * ª , ñ ´ , figure 10.3 . sagebrush query-interface and sagebook display of retrieved relevant graphics 246 chapter 10 sagebrush) by selecting and arranging spaces (e.g. , charts , tables) , objects contained within those spaces (e.g. , marks , bars) , and object properties (e.g. , color , size , shape , position) . the right hand side of figure 10.3 displays the relevant graphics retrieved by matching the underlying content and/or properties of the graphical-query at the bottom left of figure 10.3 with those of graphics stored in a library . both exact-matching and similarity_based matching is performed on both graphical-elements (or graphemes) as well as on the underlying data represented by the graphic . for example , in the query and responses in figure 10.3 , for two graphemes to match , they must be of the same class (i.e. bars , lines , marks) as well as use the same properties (i.e. color , shape , size , width) to encode data . the matches returned are sorted according to their degree of similarity to the query based on the match criteria . in figure 10.3 , all the data-graphics returned by a `` close graphics matching strategy '' (i.e. , they are all of type `` chart '' , have exactly one space in the graphic , and contain graphemes of type horizontal interval bar) are highlighted in the figure . in addition , retrieved data-graphics can be manually adapted . sagebook maintains an internal-representation of the syntax-and-semantics of data-graphics , which includes spatial-relationships between objects , relationships between datadomains (e.g. , interval , 2d coordinate) , and the various graphic and data attributes . search is performed both on graphical and data properties , with three and four alternative search-strategies , respectively , to enable varying degrees of match relaxation . just as in large text and imagery collections , several data-graphic grouping techniques based on data and graphical properties were designed to enable clustering for browsing large-collections . finally , sagebook provides automatic-adaptation techniques that can modify the retrieved graphic (e.g. , eliminating graphical-elements) that do not match the specified query . the ability to retrieve graphics by content may enable new capabilities in a broad range of domains beyond business-graphics . for example , graphics play a predominant role in domains such as cartography (terrain , elevation , features) , architecture (blueprints) , communications and networking (routers and links) , systems-engineering (components and connections) and military campaign planning (e.g. , forces and defenses overlayed on maps) . in each of these cases graphical-elements , their properties , relations , and structure , can be analyzed for retrieval purposes .
