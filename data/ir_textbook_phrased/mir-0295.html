15.4.2 multimedia-documents prom the 5s perspective , we see that documents are made up of one or more streams , often with a structure imposed (e.g. , a raster organization of a pixel stream represents a color-image) . multimedia-documents ' streams usually must be synchronized in some way , and so it is promising that a new standard for handling this over the-web has been adopted [379] . at the same time , as discussed in chapters 11 and 12 , ir has been applied to various types of multimedia-content . thus , at columbia university , a large image collection from the-web can be searched on content using visual-queries [158] . ibm developed the query-by-image-content (qbic) system for images and video [257] and has generously helped build a number of important image-collections to preserve and increase access to key antiquities [300] . similarly , the carnegie mellon university digital libraryi project , informedia [146] , has focused on video-content-analysis , word-spotting , summarization , search , and in-context results presentation [146] . better handling of multimedia is at the heart of future-research on many types of documents in digital librarys [354] . indeed , to properly handle the complexity of multimedia collections , very powerful representation , description , query-and-retrieval systems , such as those built upon logical-inference [283] , may be required .
