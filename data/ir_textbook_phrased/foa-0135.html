6.6.1 geographical hitlists singular tokens are those proper nouns - people , places , events that have a unique reference in the world . they are distinguished from general terms , which refer to categories of objects in the world . inference beyond the index 239 distinctions like this have been a part of linguistic-analysis since the beginning [searle , 1980] , and many with a background in ai will recall ron brachman 's clyde.the jslephant example [brachman and levesque , 1985 ; brachman and mcguinness , 1988] . in foa the distinction initially arose out of practical considerations . the basic morphological-process of folding case - porter 's stemmer and similar tools - is designed primarily to deal with what we could , in the current context , call general terms only . conversely , proper-names (e.g. , family and place names) rarely observe morphological transformation names . the capitalization that often flags singular proper nouns is thrown away rather than actually helping to ease the task of automatically identifying and parsing them . it is no wonder , then , that name-tagging techniques that deal intelligently with singular tokens were an early area of search-engine development [rau , 1988 ; jacobs , 1987] . identifying the subclass of people singulars is an especially active area . relatively small dictionaries of the `` movers and shakers '' of the modern world - politicians , captains of industry , artists , etc. - can provide an especially informative and commercially valuable set of additional indexing tokens in applications such as financial news services . chris needham has proposed an interesting strategy for progressively applying stronger models of representation based on various classes of singulars (personal-communication) . working on a representation for encyclopcedia britannicas editors , the procedure needham and his group hit upon was to 1 . first describe places in the world ; 2 . then describe people who live (are born , travel through , and then die) in these places ; and 3 . finally to describe events involving people at locations . specification of one layer of terminology provided a concrete frame-of-reference for the next : events involve people , who are associated with places . this suggests one argument for focusing on place-related singulars first . however , modeling even this `` simplest '' class of proper-names quickly required even tighter focus onto physical places about which it was quite easy to give very concrete references and distinguished from political places whose names and extents can vary dramatically . as 240 finding out about editors of the encyclopedia britannicagt ; these designers were especially aware of how historically and culturally sensitive resolving political place names could be . at least for physical locations , the emergence of global-positioning-system (gps) technologies that allow users to know their position within a single , reconciled geographic frame has helped to drive a growing market for geographical-information-systems (gis) software , and the development of worldwide authority lists of place names (e.g. , the u. s. board on geographic names (bgs) 20 and the earlier federal information processing standards (fips) 21 `` countries , dependencies , areas of special sovereignty , and their principal administrative divisions '' list) . like people 's names , place information is important . further , human-cognition has evolved to live in a three-dimensional world . we each have deep psychological commitments to basic features of our physical-space and orientation with respect to a spatial frame-of-reference [shepard , 1981 ; kosslyn , 1980] . in contrast to all the other abstract , disembodied dimensions along which information often barrages a user 's screen , place information is special . our experience of time is the other important experiential dimension , as demonstrated by representations like the time line . the orientation provided by such concrete frames can be critical . consider , for example , the query civil war battle and its conventional retrieval , as shown in figure 6.23 . we should be able to see these retrieved items in the geographical frame they naturally suggest , as shown in figure 6.24 . note the steps this required : first the textual hitlist was parsed for geographical tokens . next , the map coordinates for each of these wiw entries are collected , and a convex-hull (bounding polygon) for at least a majority of them is computed . finally the map that best contains this region is identified , zoomed into , and shifted to best fit . within this same frame , a user also immediately knows how to draw queries , for example , restricting a search to only those battles near the east coast or along a particular river . with modern graphical-techniques , animation of these battles as a timeline slider is slid back and forth is almost trivial . but the additional power to browsing users of visualization 1164.214.2.59 / gns/html/bgn . htnil 164.214.2.59 / gns/html/fips / pip10-4 . htnil inference beyond the index 241 britannica © cd civil vax * bat : t : i ´ : britannica cb contains at least -40 itewtf relevant to this query ... ¶ missionary ridge , battle of (699 bytes) in the ftroarican civil war , battle that ended the confederate siege of union troops at chattanooga , tenn. . see chattanooga , , battle of . carthage (1,225 bytes) city , seat of jasper county , southwestern missouri , ct. s . it lies along spring river , just east of joplin . istablished in 1s42 , it was named for ancient carthage . during the civil war , it was a centre of border warfare and was destroyed by confederate guerrillas in 1863 ;
