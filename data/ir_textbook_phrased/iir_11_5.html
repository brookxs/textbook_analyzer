references and further reading longer introductions to probability-theory can be found in most introductory probability-and-statistics books , such as (ross , 2006 , grinstead and snell , 1997 , rice , 2006) . an introduction to bayesian utility-theory can be found in (ripley , 1996) . the probabilistic-approach to ir originated in the uk in the 1950s . the first major presentation of a probabilistic-model is maron and kuhns (1960) . robertson and jones (1976) introduce the main foundations of the bim and van rijsbergen (1979) presents in detail the classic bim probabilistic-model . the idea of the prp is variously attributed to s. e. robertson , m. e. maron and w. s. cooper (the term `` probabilistic ordering principle '' is used in robertson and jones (1976) , but prp dominates in later work) . fuhr (1992) is a more recent presentation of probabilistic-ir , which includes coverage of other approaches such as probabilistic logics and bayesian-networks . crestani et al. (1998) is another survey . sp√§rck jones et al. (2000) is the definitive presentation of probabilistic-ir experiments by the `` london school '' , and robertson (2005) presents a retrospective on the group 's participation in trec evaluations , including detailed discussion of the okapi-bm25 scoring-function and its development . robertson et al. (2004) extend bm25 to the case of multiple weighted fields . the open-source indri search-engine , which is distributed with the lemur toolkit (http://www.lemurproject.org/) merges ideas from bayesian-inference networks and statistical-language-modeling approaches (see chapter 12) , in particular preserving the former 's support for structured-query operators .
