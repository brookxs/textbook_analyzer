1.4.1 structured aspects of documents in addition to their free-text , many documents will carry meta-data that gives some facts about the document . we may have publication information , for example , that this document appeared in this journal , in this issue , on this page . we are likely to know the author (s) of the document . queries will often refer to aspects of both free-text and meta-data . query 1 vm interested in documents about fools7 gold that have been published in childrens magazines in the last five years . the first portion of this query depends on the same about-ness relation that is at the core of our foa process . but the last two criteria , concerning publication type and date , seem to be just the sort of query against structured attributes that database-systems perform very successfully . in most real-life applications a hybrid of database and ir technologies will be necessary . (we distinguish between these techniques in section 1.6 .) the most interesting examples concern characteristics that do not clearly fall into either ir or database categories . for example , can you define precisely what you mean by a `` children 's magazine '' in terms of unambiguous attributes on which a database would depend ? consider another query . query 2 what sort of work has k. e. smith done on metabolic proteins affecting neurogenesis ? finding an exact-match for the string k. e. smith in the authors attribute is straightforward . but the conventions in much of medical and biological publication (as well as in some areas of physics) sometimes lead to dozens of authors on papers , from the director of the institute through all of the laboratory assistants . although k. b. smith might well fulfill the syntactic requirements of authorship on a particular paper , users searching for `` the work of '' this person might well have a more narrowly defined semantic-relationship in mind .
