4.2.2 using relevance-feedback to adapt documents ' indices an alternative use of relevance-feedback is to make changes to the documents rather than to the query . previously , the argument was that it is sensible to make the query look more like those documents the users liked ; now the argument is the converse : documents found relevant to a query should be described more like the query used to identify them . changes made to document-vectors according to this heuristic are known as document modifications and are shown in figure 4.7 . note that unlike query-modification , adaptive-document modifications made in response to rewhkre not expected to be of (immediate) use to the users who provide it . instead , the hope is that these changed document representations will be available later , to others who might be searching . as salton [salton and mcgill , 1983] described the goal : 116 finding out about following a large number of such interactions documents which are wanted by the users will have been moved slowly into the active portion of the document space - that part in which large numbers of users ' queries are concentrated , while items which are normally rejected will be located on the periphery of the space , [p. 145] this provocative proposal , allowing a search-engine to learn from its users , is considered in much greater detail in chapter 7 .
