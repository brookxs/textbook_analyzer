1 introduction to information-retrieval-systems 1.1 definition of information-retrieval-system 1.2 objectives of information-retrieval-systems l3 functional overview 1.4 relationship to database-management-systems 1.5 digital-libraries and data-warehouses 1.6 summary this chapter defines an information-storage-and-retrieval system (called an information-retrieval-system for brevity) and differentiates between information-retrieval and database-management-systems . tied closely to the definition of an information-retrieval-system are the system objectives . it is satisfaction of the objectives that drives those areas that receive the most attention in development . for example , academia pursues all aspects of information-systems , investigating new theories , algorithms and heuristics to advance the knowledge-base . academia does not worry about response-time , required resources to implement a system to support thousands of users nor operations and maintenance costs associated with system delivery . on the other hand , commercial institutions are not always concerned with the optimum theoretical approach , but the approach that minimizes development-costs and increases the salability of their product . this text considers both view points and technology states . throughout this text , information-retrieval is viewed from both the theoretical and practical viewpoint . the functional-view of an information-retrieval-system is introduced to put into perspective the technical areas discussed in later chapters . as detailed algorithms and architectures are discussed , they are viewed as subfiinctions within a total system . they are aiso correlated to the major objective of an information-retrieval-system which is minimization of human-resources required in the chapter 1 finding of needed information to accomplish a task . as with any discipline , standard measures are identified to compare the value of different algorithms . in information-systems , precision-and-recall are the key metrics used in evaluations . early introduction of these concepts in this chapter will help the reader in understanding the utility of the detailed algorithms-and-theory introduced throughout this text . there is a potential for confusion in the understanding of the differences between database-management-systems (dbms) and information retrieval-systems . it is easy to confuse the software that optimizes functional support of each type-of-system with actual information or structured-data that is being stored and manipulated . the importance of the differences lies in the inability of a database-management-system to provide the functions needed to process `` information . '' the opposite , an information-system containing structured-data , also suffers major functional deficiencies . these differences are discussed in detail in section 1.4 .
