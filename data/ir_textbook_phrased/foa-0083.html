4.5 summary in this chapter we began by making some assumptions about users of a search-engine in order to figure out how well the system is satisfying users ' information-needs . we focused on two separate notions of assessment : first , assessing the relevance of documents retrieved by the system in response to a particular query , and second , assessing the search-engine 's overall utility through aggregating relevance-judgments provided by many users performing many queries . section 4.1 discussed both metric and nonmetric relevance-feedback and the difficulties in getting users to provide relevance-judgments for documents in the retrieved set . we saw , however , that relevance-feedback could be used to either suggest query-refinements to the users or to modify the underlying document representations to improve future system-performance . the concept of consensual relevance introduced in section 4.2 addresses an issue raised in chapter 1 , where we asked what success criteria can be used in evaluating a search-engine . consensual relevance tells us that relevant documents are those documents that many users find to be useful . we can ask how useful a particular search-engine is , or compare one search-engine with another , by posing the question : how useful (relevant) do users find the documents retrieved in response to queries ? to answer that question we quantified several measures of system-performance . the generality of a query is a measure of what fraction of documents in the corpus is relevant to the query . fallout measures the fraction of irrelevant documents found in the retrieved set of a given query . the key notions of recall , the fraction of relevant documents in the retrieved set , and precision , the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant , allow us to make direct comparisons between two search-engines ' performances on any query . other methods of comparison assessing the retrieval 147 include sliding ratio , point alienation , expected search length , and oper afiner rhatarteristir rnrvps . g p ating characteristic curves .
