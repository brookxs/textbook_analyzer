information-retrieval-system capabilities 31 2.1.3 contiguous word phrases a contiguous word phrase (cwp) is both a way of specifying a query-term and a special search operator . a contiguous word phrase is two or more words that are treated as a single semantic unit . an example of a cwp is `` united-states-of-america . '' it is four words that specify a search-term representing a search statement system operation `` venetian '' adj `` blind '' would find items that mention a venetian blind on a window but not items discussing a blind venetian `` united '' within five words of would hit on `` united-states and `` american '' american interests , '' `` united airlines and american airlines '' not on `` united-states-of-america and the american dream '' `` nuclear '' within zero paragraphs of would find items that have `` nuclear '' `` clean-up '' and `` clean-up '' in the same paragraph . figure 2.2 use of proximity single specific semantic-concept (a country) that can be used with any of the operators discussed above . thus a query could specify `` manufacturing '' and `` united-states-of-america '' which returns any item that contains the word `` manufacturing '' and the contiguous words `` united-states-of-america . '' a contiguous word phrase also acts like a special search operator that is similar to the proximity (adjacency) operator but allows for additional specificity . if two terms are specified , the contiguous word phrase and the proximity operator using directional one word parameters or the adjacent operator are identical . for contiguous word phrases of more than two terms the only way of creating an equivalent search statement using proximity and boolean-operators is via nested adjacencies which are not found in most commercial systems . this is because proximity and boolean-operators are binary operators but contiguous word phrases are an `` n `` ary operator where `` n '' is the number of words in the cwp . contiguous word phrases are called literal strings in wais and exact phrases in retrievalware . in wais multiple adjacency (adj) operators are used to define a-literal string (e.g. , `` united '' adj `` states '' adj `` of adj `` america '') .
