5.2.6 computational considerations all these techniques depend , of course , on being able to compute the svd for the index relation . given the enormous size of this matrix รณ typically 104 keywords times 105 to 109 documents - this is a nontrivial concern . however , the fact that these matrices are sparse (i.e. , any one document-vector has a relatively small fraction of keywords associated with it) means that special techniques can be used . in particular , berry has developed methods based on lanczos and subspace iteration methods in his svdpack1 implementation [berry , 1992 ; berry et al. , 1994 ; letsche , 1996] . + once the document corpus has finally been compressed , another serious recurring computation must be done : every time a user-issues a query , it must be transformed from the original space of `` raw '' keywords into the reduced / c-dimensional space . this means we must keep the-matrix uk available to transform each query into the reduced representation . another computational issue has to do with the effect of new documents being added to the collection , or older ones being removed . this is one particular type * of drift we might expect in foa ; section 7.3.2 discusses several others . the addition or deletion of any one document will affect the svd statistics of the entire corpus very slightly , especially if it is a very-large corpus . svd is patentable ?! temporal drift
