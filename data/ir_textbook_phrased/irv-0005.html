an information-retrieval-system let me illustrate by means of a black-box what a typical ir-system would look like . the diagram shows three components : input , processor and output . such a trichotomy may seem a little trite , but the components constitute a convenient set of pegs upon which to hang a discussion . starting with the input side of things . the main problem here is to obtain a representation of each document and query suitable for a computer to use . let me emphasise that most computer-based-retrieval systems store only a representation of the document (or query) which means that the text of a document is lost once it has been processed for the purpose of generating its representation . a document representative could , for example , be a list of extracted words considered to be significant . rather than have the computer process the natural-language , an alternative approach is to have an artificial-language within which all queries and documents can be formulated . there is some evidence to show that this can be effective (barber et al. [6]) . of course it presupposes that a user is willing to be taught to express his information-need in the language . when the retrieval-system is on-line , it is possible for the user to change his request during one search-session in the light of a sample retrieval , thereby , it is hoped , improving the subsequent retrieval run . such a procedure is commonly referred to as feedback . an example of a sophisticated on-line retrieval-system is the medigital libraryine system (mccarn and leiter [7]) . i think it is fair to say that it will be only a short time before all retrieval-systems will be on-line . secondly , the processor , that part of the retrieval-system concerned with the retrieval-process . the process may involve structuring the information in some appropriate way , such as classifying it . it will also involve performing the actual retrieval-function , that is , executing the search-strategy in response to a query . in the diagram , the documents have been placed in a separate box to emphasise the fact that they are not just input but can be used during the retrieval-process in such a way that their structure is more correctly seen as part of the retrieval-process . finally , we come to the output , which is usually a set of citations or document numbers . in an operational system the story ends here . however , in an experimental-system it leaves the evaluation to be done .
