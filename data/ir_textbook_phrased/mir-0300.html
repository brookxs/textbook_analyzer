15.5 prototypes , projects , and interfaces though numerous efforts in the ir , hypertext , multimedia , and library-automation areas have been underway for years as precursors of today 's digital-library-systems , one of the first new efforts aimed at understanding the requirements for digital librarys and constructing a prototype from scratch was the envision project , launched in 1991 [269] . based on discussions with experts in the field and a careful study of prospective users of the computer-science collection to be built with the assistance of acm , the envision system was designed to extend the marian search-system [264] with novel visualization-techniques [273 , 360] . careful analysis has shown its 2d approach to management of search-results is easy to use and effective for a number of digital-library activities [610] . the core project , another early effort , is an electronic library prototype on chemical journal-articles . its collection included , for each article , both scanned images and an sgml marked-up version , as well as indexes for full-text boolean searching . it was undertaken by the american chemical society , chemical abstracts service , oclc , bellcore , and cornell university , along with other partners [237] . this project also was concerned with collection-building as well as testing of a variety of interfaces that were designed based on user-studies . one of the most visible project efforts is the digital libraries initiative , initially supported by nsf , darpa , and nasa [349] . phase 1 provided funding for six large projects over the period 1994-1998 . these projects spanned a wide 426 digital-libraries range of major topics in developing the national information infrastructure (nil) and addressed future technological problems . the illinois project [777] focused on manually structured-text documents in full systems with many users ; the berkeley project [775] emphasized automatically recognized image documents , also with large-systems . the santa barbara [776] and carnegie mellon [146] projects investigated the ability to manipulate new-media ; carnegie mellon focused on segmenting and indexing video using speech-recognition and program-structure , and santa barbara concentrated on indexing maps using image-processing and region metadata . stanford [745] and michigan [784] investigated the intermediaries to perform operations on large digital-libraries ; stanford investigated interoperability of different search-services , and michigan concentrated on interacting software-agents to provide services to users [710] . since these projects have been described elsewhere in depth , it should suffice here to highlight some of the connections of those projects with the ir community . first , each project has included a component dealing with document-collections . the illinois project produced sgml versions of a number of journals while the berkeley project concentrated on page images and other image classes . santa barbara adopted a spatial perspective , including satellite-imagery , while carnegie mellon university (cmu) focused on video . stanford built no collections , but rather afforded access to a number of information-sources to demonstrate interoperability . at the university of michigan , some of the emphasis was on having agents dynamically select documents from a distributed set of resources . second , the digital libraryi projects all worked on search . text-retrieval , and using automatically constructed cross-vocabulary thesauri to help find search-terms , was emphasized in illinois . image-searching was studied at berkeley and santa barbara while video searching was investigated at cmu . michigan worked with agents for distributed-search while stanford explored the coupling of a variety of architectures and interfaces for retrieval . finally , it is important to note that the digital libraryi efforts all spent time on interface-issues . stanford used animation and data-flows to provide flexible manipulation and integration of services [192] . at michigan , there were studies of the pad +4 - approach to 2d visualization [70] . further discussion of interfaces can be found below in subsection 15.5.2 . it should be noted that these projects only partially covered the 5s issues . structures were not well studied , except slightly in connection with the illinois work on sgml and the berkeley work on databases . scenarios were largely ignored , except in some of the interface investigations . similarly , spaces were not investigated much , except in connection with the vocabulary transfer work at illinois and the spatial collection and browsing work at santa barbara . other projects in the broader international scene , some of which are discussed in the next section , may afford more thorough 5s coverage . since the announcement of digital libraryl activities and interest related to digital-libraries have increased dramatically . the six digital libraryi projects were highly visible and grew in scope ; however , it was quickly realized that digital libraryi still needed additional direction and coherence . during the initial funding period of the digital libraryi prototypes , projects , and interfaces 427 program , additional workshops were created to develop consensus on the directions and boundaries with discussions from various communities . an important aspect that many people realized from the workshops is the importance of efforts in domains outside computer and information science to the advances in digital-libraries research [324] . a follow-on program , digital-libraries initiative - phase 2 (digital libraryi-2) , jointly supported by nsf , darpa , nasa , the national-library-of-medicine (nlm) , the library-of-congress (loc) , the national endowment for the humanities (neh) , and others , was announced in the spring of 1998 focus less on technology research than digital libraryi , but , more importantly , supporting research across the information life-cycle , from content-creation , access , and use to preservation-and-archiving , moving towards the concept of digital-libraries as human-centered-systems . digital libraryi-2 will emphasize the study of interactions between digital-libraries and humans , fuller understanding of and improving access to digital-content and collections , and interoperability and integration toward flexible information environments at the level of individual , group , and institution [324 , 216] . the program will involve people not only from science and engineering but also from arts and humanities .
