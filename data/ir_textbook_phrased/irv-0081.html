interpolation many interpolation techniques have been suggested in the literature . see , for example , keen [11] . figure 7.3 shows a typical p-r graph for a single query . the points a , b , c and d , i shall call the observed points , since these are the only points observed directly during an experiment the others may be inferred from these . thus given that a = (r1 , p1) has been observed , then the next point b is the one corresponding to an increase in recall , which follows from a unit increase in the number of relevant documents retrieved . between any two observed points the recall remains constant , since no more relevant documents are retrieved . it is an experimental fact that average precision-recall graphs are monotonically decreasing . consistent with this , a linear interpolation estimates the best possible performance between any two adjacent observed points . to avoid inflating the experimental-results it is probably better to perform a more conservative interpolation as follows : let (r [[lambda]] , p [[lambda]]) be the set of precision-recall values obtained by varying some parameter [[lambda]] . to obtain the set of observed points we specify a subset of the parameters [[lambda]] . thus (r [[theta]] , p [[theta]]) is an observed point if [[theta]] corresponds to a value of [[lambda]] at which an increase in recall is produced . we now have : gs = (r [[theta]] s , p [[theta]] s) the set of observed points for a request . to interpolate between any two points we define : ps (r) = {sup p : r ' gt ; = r s.t. (r ' , p) [[propersubset]] gs} where r is a standard recall value . from this we obtain the average-precision value at the standard recall value r by : the set of observed points is such that the interpolated function is monotonically decreasing . figure 7.3 shows the effect of the interpolation procedure , essentially it turns the p-r curve into a step-function with the jumps at the observed points . a necessary consequence of its monotonicity is that the average p-r curve will also be monotonically decreasing . it is possible to define the set of observed points in such a way that the interpolate function is not monotonically decreasing . in practice , even for this case , we have that the average precision-recall-curve is monotonically decreasing . in figure 7.4 we illustrate the interpolation and averaging process .
