learning weights machine-learned relevance 15 we are provided with a set of training-examples , each of which is a tuple consisting of a query and a document , together with a relevance-judgment for on . in the simplest form , each relevance-judgments is either relevant or non-relevant . more sophisticated implementations of the methodology make use of more nuanced judgments . the weights are then `` learned '' from these examples , in order that the learned scores approximate the relevance-judgments in the training-examples . for weighted zone scoring , the process may be viewed as learning a linear function of the boolean match scores contributed by the various zones . the expensive component of this methodology is the labor-intensive assembly of user-generated relevance-judgments from which to learn the weights , especially in a collection that changes frequently (such as the-web) . we now detail a simple example that illustrates how we can reduce the problem of learning the weights to a simple optimization-problem . we now consider a simple case of weighted zone scoring , where each document has a title zone and a body zone . given a query and a document , we use the given boolean match-function to compute boolean-variables and , depending on whether the title (respectively , body) zone of matches query . for instance , the algorithm in figure 6.4 uses an and of the query terms for this boolean-function . we will compute a score between 0 and 1 for each (document , query) pair using and by using a constant , as follows : (14) training-examples relevant non-relevant 6.5 figure 6.5 : an illustration of training-examples . for each training-example we have boolean values and that we use to compute a score from (14) (15) relevant non-relevant (16) (17) 17 picking the best value of in (17) in the formulation of section 6.1.3 reduces to the problem of minimizing a quadratic function of over the interval . this reduction is detailed in section 6.1.3 .
