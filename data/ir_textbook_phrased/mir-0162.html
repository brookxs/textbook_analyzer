9.1 introduction the volume of electronic-text available online today is staggering . by many accounts , the world-wide-web alone contains over 200 million pages of text , comprising nearly 500 gigabytes of data . moreover , the-web (see chapter 13) has been growing at an exponential rate , nearly doubling in size every six months . large information service-providers , such as lexis-nexis (see chapter 14) , have amassed document-databases that reach into the terabytes . on a slightly smaller scale , the largest corporate intranets now contain over a million web-pages . even private collections of online-documents stored on personal-computers are growing larger as disk space becomes cheaper and electronic content becomes easier to produce , download , and store . as document-collections grow larger , they become more expensive to manage with an information-retrieval-system . searching and indexing costs grow with the size of the underlying document-collection ; larger document-collections invariably result in longer response-times . as more documents are added to the system , performance may deteriorate to the point where the system is no longer usable . furthermore , the economic survival of commercial systems and web-search-engines depends on their ability to provide high query-processing rates . in fact , most of a web-search company 's gross income comes from selling ` advertising impressions ' (advertising banners displayed at the user 's screen) whose number is proportional to the number of query requests attended . to support the demanding requirements of modern search environments , we must turn to alternative architectures and algorithms . in this chapter we explore parallel and distributed information-retrieval-techniques . the application of parallelism can greatly enhance our ability to scale traditional information-retrieval algorithms and support larger and larger document-collections . we continue this introduction with a review of parallel-computing and parallel-program-performance measures . in section 9.2 we explore techniques for 229 230 parallel and distributed ir implementing information-retrieval algorithms on parallel platforms , including inverted-file and signature-file methods . in section 9.3 , we turn to distributed-information-retrieval and approaches to collection partitioning , source-selection , and distributed results-merging (often called collection-fusion) . we discuss future trends in section 9.4 , and conclude with a bibliographic discussion in section 9.5 .
