5.5 trends and research-issues the relevance-feedback strategies discussed here can be directly applied to the graphical-interfaces of modern information systems . however , since interactivity is now of greater importance , new techniques for capturing feedback information from the user are desirable . for instance , there is great interest in graphical-interfaces which display the documents in the answer set as points in a 2d or 3d-space . the motivation is to allow the user to quickly identify (by visual-inspection) relationships among the documents in the answer . in this scenario , a rather distinct strategy for quantifying feedback information might be required . thus , relevance strategies for dealing with visual-displays are an important research problem . in the past , global-analysis was viewed as an approach which did not yield good improvements in retrieval-performance . however , new results obtained at the beginning of the 1990s changed this perception . further , the-web has provided evidence that techniques based on global-analysis might be of interest to the users . for instance , this is the case with the highly popular ` yahoo! ' software which uses a manually built hierarchy of concepts to assist the user with forming the query . this suggests that investigating the utilization of global-analysis techniques in the web is a promising research problem . local analysis techniques are interesting because they take advantage of the local-context provided with the query . in this regard , they seem more appropriate than global-analysis techniques . furthermore , many positive results have been reported in the literature . the application of local analysis techniques to the-web , however , has not been explored and is a promising research direction . the main challenge is the computational burden imposed on the search-engine site due to the need to process document texts at query time . thus , a related research problem of relevance is the development of techniques for speeding up query-processing at the search-engine site . in truth , this problem is of interest even if one considers only the normal processing of the queries because the search-engines depend on processing as many queries as possible for economic survival . the combination of local analysis , global-analysis , visual-displays , and interactive-interfaces is also a current and important research problem . allowing the user to visually explore the document space and providing him with clues which assist with the query-formulation process are highly relevant issues . positive results in this area might become a turning-point regarding the design of user-interfaces and are likely to attract wide attention . 138 query-operations
