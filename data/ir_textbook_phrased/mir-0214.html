10.8.3 example systems the following sections describe the information layout and management approaches taken by several modern information access interfaces . the infogrid layout the infogrid system [667] is a typical example of a monolithic layout for an information-access interface . the layout assumes a large-display is available interface-support for the search-process 313 search parameters property sheet document-text control-panel thumbnail images holding area search paths control-panel table-of-contents toc subset document-text search parameters figure 10.28 diagrams of monolithic layouts for information-access interfaces . and is divided into a left-hand and right-hand-side (see figure 10.28) . the left-hand side is further subdivided into an area at the top that contains structured entry forms for specifying the properties of a query , a column of iconic controls lining the left side , and an area for retaining documents of interest along the bottom . the main central area is used for the viewing of retrieval results , either as thumbnail representations of the original documents , or derived organizations of the documents , such as scatter/gather-style cluster results . users can select documents from this area and store them in the holding area below or view them in the right-hand-side . most of the right-hand-side of the display is used for viewing selected documents , with the upper portion showing metadata associated with the selected document . the area below the document display is intended to show a graphical-history of earlier interactions . designers must make decisions about which kinds of information to show in the primary view (s) . if infogrid were used on a smaller display , either the document viewing area or the retrieval results viewing area would probably have to be shown via a pop-up overlapping window ; otherwise the user would have to toggle between the two views . if the system were to suggest terms for relevance-feedback , one of the existing views would have to be supplanted with this information or a pop-up window would have to be used to display the candidate-terms . the system does not provide detailed information for source-selection , although this could be achieved in a very simple way with a pop-up menu of choices from the control-panel . the superbook layout the layout of the infogrid is quite similar to that of superbook (see section 10.6) . the main difference is that superbook retains the table of contents-like display in the main left-hand pane , along with indicators of how many documents containing search hits occur in each level of the outline . like infogrid , the main pane of the right-hand-side is used to display selected documents . query 314 user-interfaces and visualization formulation is done just below the table-of-contents view (although in earlier versions this appeared in a separate window) . terms related to the user 's query are shown in this window as well large images appear in pop-up overlapping-windows . the superbook layout is the result of several cycles of iterative-design [481] . earlier versions used overlapping-windows instead of a monolithic layout , allowing users to sweep out a rectangular area on the screen in order to create a new text box . this new text box had its own set of buttons that allowed users to jump to occurrences of highlighted words in other documents or to the table-of-contents . superbook was redesigned after noting results of experimental-studies [350 , 532] showing that users can be more efficient if given fewer , well chosen interaction paths , rather than allowing wide latitude (a recent study of auditory-interfaces found that although users were more efficient with a more flexible interface , they nevertheless preferred the more rigid , predictable interface [801]) . the designers also took careful note of log-files of user-interactions . before the redesign , users had to choose to view the overall frequency of a hit , move the mouse to the table-of-contents window , click the button and wait for the results to be updated . since this pattern was observed to occur quite frequently , in the next version of the interface , the system was redesigned to automatically perform this sequence of actions immediately after a search was run . the superbook designers also attempted a redesign to allow the interface to fit into smaller displays . the redesign made use of small , overlapping-windows . some of the interaction-sequences that were found useful in this more constrained environment were integrated into later designs for large monolithic displays . the digital library1te interface the digital library1te system [193 , 192] makes a number of interesting design choices . it splits functionality into two parts : control of the search-process and display of results . the control portion is a graphical direct-manipulation display with animation (see figure 10.29) . queries , sources , documents , and groups of retrieved documents are represented as graphical objects . the user creates a query by filling out the editable fields within a query constructor object . the system manufactures a query object , which is represented by a small icon which can be dragged and dropped onto iconic representations of collections or search-services . if a service is active , it responds by creating an empty results set object and attaching the query to this . a set of retrieval results is represented as a circular pool , and documents within the result-set are represented as icons distributed along the perimeter of the pool . documents can be dragged out of the results set pool and dropped into other services , such as a document summarizer or a language translator . meanwhile , the user can make a copy of the query icon and drop it onto another search-service . placing the mouse over the iconic representation of the query causes a ` tool-tips * window to pop up to show the contents of the underlying query . queries can be stored and reused at a later time , thusgt ; facilitating retention of previously successful search-strategies . interface-support for the search-process 315 figure 10.29 the digital libraryite interface [193] . a flexible interface-architecture frees the user from the restriction of a rigid order of commands . on the other hand , as seen in the superbook discussion , such an architecture must provide guidelines , to help get the user started , give hints about valid ways to proceed , and prevent the user from making errors . the graphical portion of the digital libraryite interface makes liberal use of animation to help guide the user . for example , if the user attempts to drop a query in the document summarizer icon รณ an illegal operation รณ rather than failing and giving the user an accusatory error message [185] , the system takes control of the object being dropped , refusing to let it be placed on the representation for the target application , and moves the object left , right , and left again , mimicking a cshake-the-head-no ' gesture . animation is also used to help the user understand the state of the system , for example , in showing the progress of the retrieval of search-results by moving the result-set object away from the service from which it was invoked . digital libraryite uses a separate web-browser window for the display of detailed information about the retrieved documents , such as their bibliographic-citations and their full text . the browser window is also used to show scatter/gather-style cluster results and to allow users to select documents for relevance-feedback . earlier designs of the system attempted to incorporate text-display into the direct-manipulation portion , but this was found to be infeasible because of the space required [192] . thus , digital libraryite separates the control portion of the information-access process from the scanning and reading portion . this separation allows for reusable query-construction and service-selection , while at the same time allowing for a legible view of documents and relationships among retrieved documents . the selection in the display view is linked to the graphical control portion , so a document viewed in the display could be used as part of a query in a query constructor . 316 user-interfaces and visualization digital libraryite also incorporates the notion of a workspace , or ` workcenter , ' as it is known in this system . different workspaces are created for different kinds of tasks . for example , a workspace for buying computer software can be equipped with source icons representing good sources of reviews of computer software , good web-sites to search for price information and link to the user 's online credit service . the sketchtrieve interface the guiding principle behind the sketchtrieve interface [365] is the depiction of information-access as an informal process , in which half-finished ideas and partly explored paths can be retained for later use , saved and brought back to compare to later interactions , and the results can be combined via operations on graphical objects and connectors between them . it has been observed [584 , 722] that users use the physical layout of information within a spreadsheet to organize information . this idea motivates the design of sketchtrieve , which allows users to arrange retrieval results in a side-by-side manner to facilitate comparison and recombination (see figure 10.30) . the notion of a canvas or workspace for the retention of the previous context should be adopted more widely in future . many issues are not easily solved , such as how to show the results of a set of interrelated queries , with minor modifications based on query-expansion , relevance-feedback , and other forms of modification . one idea is to show sets of related retrieval results as a stack of 1 john a - . : -- .5 wortt ! . : jotno ar ` im f _ * t.ps pro ^ t : .1 h jv . * i : _ : ' : be lock : : ! . ;
