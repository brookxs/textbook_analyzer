10.5.5 phrases and proximity hi general , proximity iiifurmation can be quite1 effective at improving precision of on the web , the difference between a single-word query and a two-word query-specification 287 exact phrase match can mean the difference between an unmanageable mess of retrieved documents and a short list with mainly relevant documents . a large number-of-methods for specifying phrases have been developed . the syntax in lexis-nexis requires the proximity range to be specified with an infix operator . for example , ` white w/3 house ' means ` white within 3 words of house , independent of order . ' exact proximity of phrases is specified by simply listing one word beside the other , separated by a space . a popular method used by web-search-engines is the enclosure of the terms between quotation marks . shneiderman et al. [726] suggest providing a list of entry labels , as suggested above for specifying facets . the difference is , instead of a disjunction , the terms on each line are treated as a phrase . this is suggested as a way to guide users to more precise query-specification . the disadvantage of these methods is that they require exact-match of phrases , when it is often the case (in english) that one or a few words comes between the terms of interest . for example , in most cases the user probably wants ` president ' and ` lincoln ' to be adjacent , but still wants to catch cases of the sort ` president abraham lincoln . ' another consideration is whether or not stemming is performed on the terms included in the phrase . the best solution may be to allow users to specify exact phrases but treat them as small proximity ranges , with perhaps an exponential fall-off in weight in terms of distance of the terms . this has been shown to be a successful strategy7 in non-interactive ranking-algorithms [174] . it has also been shown that a combination of quorum ranking of faceted queries with the restriction that the facets occur within a small proximity range can dramatically improve precision of results [356 , 566] .
