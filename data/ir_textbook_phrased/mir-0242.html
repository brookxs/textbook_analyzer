12.5.2 lower-bounding in applying the gemini method for color indexing , there are two obstacles : first , the ` dimensionality-curse ' (k may be large , e.g. 64 or 256 for color-features) and , most importantly , the quadratic nature of the distance-function . the distance-function in the feature-space involves cross-talk among the features (see equation 12.6) , and thus it is a full quadratic form involving all cross terms . not only is such a function much more expensive to compute than a euclidean (or any lp) distance , but it also precludes efficient-implementation of commonly used spatial-access-methods . figure 12.8 illustrates the situation . to compute the distance between the two color-histograms x and q , the , e.g. , bright-red component off has to be compared not only to the bright-red component of q , but also to the pink , orange , etc. components of q. two-dimensional color-images 359 bright red pink orange _ e.g. , 64 colors . figure 12.8 illustration of the ` cross-talk ' between two color-histograms . to resolve the cross-talk problem , we try to apply the gemini approach (algorithm 2) . the first step of the algorithm has been done : the distance-function between two color-images is given by equation 12.6 , that is , v (-rrb- = dhisto-the second step is to find one or more numerical-features , whose euclidean-distance would lower-bound dhisto - thus , we ask the feature-extracting question again : / / we are allowed to use only one numerical feature to describe each color-image , what should this feature be ? taking a cue from the previous section on time-series , we can consider some average value , or the first few coefficients of the two-dimensional dft transform . since we have three color components , (e.g. , red , green , and blue) , we could consider the average amount of red , green , and blue in a given color-image . notice that different color-spaces (such as munsell) can be used , with absolutely no change in our indexing algorithms . thus , we continue the discussion with the rgb-color-space . this means that the color of an individual pixel is described by the triplet (r , g , b) (for cr ` ed , ` g'reen , 4b ` lue) . the average color vector of an image or item x = {ravg , gavgy bavg) t , is defined in the obvious way , with p = l p p = l p bavg = p = l where p is the number of pixels in the item , and r (p) , g (p) , and b (p) are the red , green and blue components (intensities , typically in the range 0-255) respectively of the p-th pixel . given the average colors j1 and y of two items , we define davg (-rrb- as the euclidean-distance between the three-dimensional average 360 multimedia-ir : indexing and searching color vectors , d2avg {x , y) = (x-y) \ x ~ y) (12.7) the third step of the gemini algorithm is to prove that our simplified distance davg (-rrb- lower-bounds the actual distance dhistq - indeed , this is true , as an application of the so-called quadratic distance-bounding or qdb theorem (see [244]) . the result is that , given a color query , our retrieval proceeds by first filtering the set of images based on their average (r , g , b) color , then doing a final , more accurate matching using their full / c-element histogram . the resulting speedup is discussed next .
