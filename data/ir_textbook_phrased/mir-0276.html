14.2 online ir systems and document-databases a synergistic relationship exists between the producers and vendors of document-databases ^ (see figure 14.1) . in general , database producers create a product which they license to the database vendors . these vendors or search-services provide search software and access to their customers , who benefit from the ability to search multiple databases from a single-source . it is common to speak of the online database industry , since production of databases has usually been undertaken by corporations , organizations , or government on a for-profit or cost-recovery basis . these database producers have seen databases as products for sale or lease , often to libraries , and usually by a third party or database vendor . the role of database vendor is to license databases from their producers and add value by making them available to users . database vendors provide some degree of standardization to the record formats , create indexes (usually in the form of inverted-files) , and provide a common interface for searching multiple databases . examples of well known database vendors are dialog , lexis-nexis , oclc , and h.w. wilson ; profiles are given in figure 14.2 . some database producers choose to serve as their own search-service providers , leading to a degree of vertical-integration within the database industry ; examples are the national-library-of-medicine (nlm) , which provides free access to its medline database through the-web , and the h.w. wilson company , which markets its own series of databases . a significant aspect of these major commercial-services is the very-large size of their databases and the need for rapid , reliable service for many simultaneous users . in a description of their computing complex , lexis-nexis [510] give their database-size as 1.3 billion documents , with 1.3 million subscribers , and 120 million annual searches . they return an answer set within six to ten seconds . | ` database ' is commonly used by producers and vendors of document-databases when referring to their product . these databases lack the tabular structure of relational-databases and contain bibliographic-information and/or the full-text of documents . this usage will be followed in this chapter . online ir systems and document-databases 399 database producers : design database-structure collect in-scope literature enter bibliographic-information in standard form abstract (or edit authors ' abstracts) index with (usually) controlled-vocabulary generate file updates at regular intervals market backfile and updates to vendors database vendors : create search software-license databases from producers standardize (as possible) record structure mount databases , creating inverted-indexes update databases as appropriate (daily , weekly , monthly) provide documentation for searchers market to clients provide service and training to client base figure 14.1 role of database producers and vendors . with a claimed availability above 99.99 % and reliability of 99.83 % . similarly , dialog claims to be over 50 times the size-of-the-web .
