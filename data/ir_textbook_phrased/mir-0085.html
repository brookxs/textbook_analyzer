5.2.1 query-expansion and term reweighting for the vector-model the application of relevance-feedback to the vector-model considers that the term-weight vectors of the documents identified as relevant (to a given query) have similarities among themselves (i.e. , relevant documents resemble each other) . further , it is assumed that non-relevant documents have term-weight vectors which are dissimilar from the ones for the relevant documents . the basic idea is to reformulate the query such that it gets closer to the term-weight vector-space of the relevant documents . let us define some additional terminology regarding the processing of a given query q as follows , dr : set of relevant documents , as identified by the user , among the retrieved documents ; dn : set of non-relevant documents among the retrieved documents ; cr : set of relevant documents among all documents in the collection ; user-relevance-feedback 119 | z) r | , | dn | , \ cr \ : number of documents in the sets dr , dni and cr , respectively ; a , / ? , 7 : tuning constants . consider first the unrealistic situation in which the complete set cr of relevant documents to a given query q is known in advance . in such a situation , it can be demonstrated that the best query-vector for distinguishing the relevant documents from the non-relevant documents is given by , the problem with this formulation is that the relevant documents which compose the set cr are not known a priori . in fact , we are looking for them . the natural way to avoid this problem is to formulate an initial query and to incrementally change the initial query vector . this incremental change is accomplished by restricting the computation to the documents known to be relevant (according to the user judgement) at that point . there are three classic and similar ways to calculate the modified query qm as follows , standard jrochio : qm = a q +] p dj vdjedr ide-regular : qm = a q + (3 ^ dj รณ 7 \ fd3edr ide ^ dec ^ hi : qm = a q + j3 ^ d3 - 7 maxnon_teievani {d]) where maxnon-reievant (dj) is a reference to the highest ranked non-relevant document . notice that now dr and dn stand for the sets of relevant and non-relevant documents (among the retrieved ones) according to the user judgement , respectively . in the original formulations , rochio [678] fixed a = 1 and ide [391] fixed a = ft = 7 = 1 . the expressions above are modern variants . the current understanding is that the three-techniques yield similar results (in the past , ide dec-hi was considered slightly better) . the rochio formulation is basically a direct adaptation of equation 5.1 in which the terms of the original query are added in . the motivation is that in practice the original query q may contain important information . usually , the information contained in the relevant documents is more important than the information provided by the non-relevant documents [698] . this suggests making the constant 7 smaller than the constant / 3 . an alternative approach is to set ~ to 0 which yields a positive-feedback strategy . the main advantages of the above relevance-feedback techniques are simplicity and good results . the simplicity is due to the fact that the modified term-weights are computed directly from the set of retrieved documents . the good 120 query-operations results are observed experimentally and are due to the fact that the modified query-vector does reflect a portion of the intended query-semantics . the main disadvantage is that no optimality criterion is adopted .
