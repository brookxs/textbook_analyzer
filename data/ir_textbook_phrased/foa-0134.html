6,6 deep interfaces probably because interface technology did not support rich graphical presentations and pointing-devices until late in the development of computer-science , the human-computer-interface (hci) is often an afterthought in software-engineering . this bias remains today in search-engine designs , which assume the indexing and match algorithms can be separated from the presentation of results [harman , 1992b ; rose and belew , 1990] . sometimes interface-design is approached as a data-visualization task [veerasamy and belkin , 1996] . korfhage 's vibe presentation [korfhage , 1995] highlights a user 's and author 's perspectives on topical areas . rather than assuming that there is one absolute preferred perspective on keywords , korfhage considers what the words look like from the perspective of users and authors , respectively . in terms of the vector-space-model , we can think of these as projections . the huge dimensional space of keywords , or even the still large reduced dimension representation , is still far more than we can visualize on a two-dimensional computer screen . we can try to impose other dimensions (e.g. , color or size) , but we still must pick some projected subspace of the larger data-set . norman and schneiderman have written extensively on the design of interfaces that are deeply connected to the user 's underlying task [norman , 1988 ; schneiderman , 1992] ; marchianoni has focused particularly on interfaces for the `` information-seeking '' task [marchianoni , 1995] . as part of the xerox parc group , hearst has explored a number of visualization-techniques (cf. figure 6.8) ; she has also recently provided an extensive survey of interface technologies [hearst , 1999] .
