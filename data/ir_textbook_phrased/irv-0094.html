bibliographic remarks quite a number of references to the work on evaluation have already been given in the main body of the chapter . nevertheless , there are still a few important ones worth mentioning . buried in the report by keen digger [32] (chapter 16) is an excellent discussion of the desirable properties of any measure of effectiveness . it also gives a checklist indicating which measure satisfies what . it is probably worth repeating here that part i of robertson 's paper [33] contains a discussion of measures-of-effectiveness based on the ` contingency ' table as well as a list showing who used what measure in their experiments . king and bryant [34] have written a book on the evaluation of information-services and products emphasising the commercial-aspects . goffman and newill [35] describe a methodology for evaluation in general . a parameter which i have mentioned in passing but which deserves closer study in generality . salton [36] has recently done a study of its effect on precision and fallout for different sized document-collections . the trade-off between precision-and-recall has for a long time been the subject of debate . cleverdon [37] who has always been involved in this debate has now restated his position . heine [38] , in response to this , has attempted to further clarify the trade-off in terms of the swets model . guazzo [39] and cawkell [40] describe an approach to the measurement of retrieval-effectiveness based on information-theory . the notion of relevance has at all times attracted much discussion . an interesting early philosophical paper on the subject is by weiler [41] . goffman [42] has done an investigation of relevance in terms of measure-theory . and more recently negoita [43] has examined the notion in terms of different kinds of logics . a short paper by good [44] which is in sympathy with the approach based on a theory of measurement given here , discusses the evaluation of retrieval-systems in terms of expected-utility . one conspicuous omission from this chapter is any discussion of cost-effectiveness . the main reason for this is that so far very little of importance can be said about it . a couple of attempts to work out mathematical cost-models for ir are cooper [45] and marschak [46] .
