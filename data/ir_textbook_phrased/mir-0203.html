10.6.6 using hyperlinks to organize retrieval results although the superbook authors describe it as a hypertext system , it is actually better thought of as a means of showing search-results in the context of a structure that users can understand and view all at once . the hypertext component was not analyzed separately to assess its importance , but it usually is not mentioned by the authors when describing what is successful about their design . in fact , it seems to be responsible for one of the main problems seen with the revised version of the system รณ that users tend to wander off (often unintentionally) from the pages they are reading , thus causing the time spent on a given topic to be longer for superbook in some cases . (using completion-time to evaluate users on browsing tasks can be problematic , however , since by definition browsing is a casual , unhurried process [804] .) this wandering may occur in part because superbook uses a non-standard kind of hypertext , in which any word is automatically linked to occurrences of the same word in other parts of the document . this has not turned out to be how hypertext-links are created in practice . today , hyperlinked help-systems and hyperlinks on the web make much more discriminating use of hyperlink connections (in part since they are usually generated by an author rather than automatically) . these links tend to be labeled in a somewhat meaningful manner by their surrounding context . back-of-the-book indexes often do not contain listings of every occurrence of a word , but rather to the more important uses or the beginnings of series of uses . automated hypertext linking should perhaps be based on similar principles . additionally , at least one study showed that users formed better mental-models of a small hypertext system that was organized hierarchically than one that allowed more flexible access [226] . problems relating to navigation of hypertext-structure have long been suspected and investigated in the hypertext-literature [181 , 551 , 440 , 334] . more recent work has made better use of hyperlink information for providing context for retrieval results . some of this work is described below . cha-cha : superbook on the web the cha-cha intranet-search system [164] extends the superbook idea to a large heterogeneous web-site such as might be found in an organization 's intranet . figure 10.21 shows an example . this system differs from superbook in several ways . on most web-sites there is no existing real table-of-contents or category-structure , and an intranet like those found at large universities or large corporations is usually not organized by one central unit . cha-cha uses link-structure present within the site to create what is intended to be a meaningful organization on top of the underlying chaos . after the user-issues a query , the shortest-paths from the root page to each of the search hits are recorded and a subset of these are selected to be shown as a hierarchy , so that each hit is shown only once . (users can begin with a query , rather than with a table-of-contents view .) if a user does not know to use the term ` health center * but instead queries on ` medical center / if `` medical * appears as a term in a document within 300 user-interfaces and visualization srvldte ^ vj jjsf university health-services health-services for faculty and staff ^ other programs available to faculty and staff ... colleges and schools w school of social-welfare : home-page ? programs , curricula , and courses ? msw program field-work agencies swf ? the letters science www home-page '' * departments divisions * townsend center for the humanities , uc berkeley 1 september townsend center newsletter i bioethics \ \ the ... ... uc berkeley libraries . w uc berkeley libraries ' * ' health sciences information-service b hsis medical-informatics w center for southeast asia studies ffi cseas newsletter.upcommg events , spring 1996 policies-and-guidelines for web-publishing at `` r image/multimedia database resources 1 medical ima , qe d ^ afragji 1-20 of ss5 matches ustviewr next * page summary jg health-net health-net healthnet health-care ... . university health-services (uhs) at the university of california at berkeley offers general medical office visits , physical-therapy , and laboratory services to faculty and staff who are healthnet members and have selected a personal care physician (pcp) at the tang center ... . . hospitalization : if you need to be hospitalized , in most cases you will be cared for at alta bates medical center by a physician affiliated with alta bates ... . . tittle is active in quality-assurance activities at university health-services where he has been a physician since 1977 , he received his medical degree from stanford-university in 1973 and specialized in internal medicine during his residencies at pacific medical center and ucs ... http://www.uhs . berkeley.edu/facstaff/healthnet.htm (sizes 10k) figure 10.21 the cha-cha interface for showing web intranet-search results in context displaying results on the query ` medical centre ' [164] . the health center part of the-web , the home-page (or starting point) of this center will be presented as well as the more specific hits . users can then either query or navigate within a subset of sites if they wish . the organization produced by this simple method is surprisingly comprehensible on the uc berkeley site . it seems especially useful for providing the information about the sources (the-web server) associated with the search hits , whose titles are often cryptic . the amit system [826] also applies the basic ideas behind superbook to the-web , but focuses on a single-topic web-site , which is likely to have a more reasonable topic-structure than a complex intranet . the link-structure of the-web site is used as contextualizing information but all of the paths to a given , document are shown and focus-plus-context is used to emphasize subsets of the document space . the webtoc system [585] is similar to amit but focuses on showing the structure and number of documents within each web subhierarchy , and is not tightly-coupled with search . context 301 j j ; file layout view operations fetch help figure 10.22 example of a web subset visualized by mapuccino (courtesy of m. jacovi , b. shaul and y. maarek) . mapuccino : graphical depiction of link-structure the mapuccino system (formerly webcutter) [527] allows the user to issue a query on a particular web-site . the system crawls the site in real-time , checking each encountered page for relevance to the query . when a relevant page is found , the weights on that page 's outlinks are increased . thus , the search is based partly on an assumption that relevant pages will occur near one another in the web-site . the subset of the-web site that has been crawled is depicted graphically in a nodes-and-links view (see figure 10.22) . this kind of display does not provide the user with information about what the contents of the pages are , but rather only shows their link-structure - other researchers have also investigated spreading-activation among hypertext-links as a way to guide an information-retrieval-system , e.g. , [278 , 555] .
