8.2.3 argument-structures another important notion of context surrounding any particular document is the system of argumentation within which it participates . the tendency of search-engines to slice and dice documents into salads of their constituent words has been called the bag-of-words phenomenon . it is typically used in contrast to syntactic-parsing methods , which place these words as part of well-structured , grammatical constructs . but there is another level of violence done to language when word-frequency counts are collected , and that has to do with the argument-structures by which sentences are strung together to form persuasive communicative-acts . many of modern cultures ' most well-documented communications involve the use of language as a persuasive device . mathematical theorem-proving , legal opinions , scientific papers , op-ed newspaper and magazine pages , artistic criticism , all have in common the fundamental purpose of convincing an audience . a mathematical paper (purportedly !) * convinces by proving theorems . in legal corpora , the fundamental principle of stare decisis on which the common law tradition is based has already been mentioned . within science , varying disciplines have wildly differing standards for what constitutes a convincing argument . political and artistic forms of math proofs are more informal than you may think ? 306 finding out about persuasion are being changed as they move from the media of newspapers and magazines to the www . while the modes of argument supporting each of these social-activities have diverged , there remains a common thread connecting all such documents , viz. , their common heritage as written artifacts . since long strips of papyrus were first rolled onto scrolls , our expectations about a fundamentally linear progression through a text have held . the greeks ' theories of narrative and rhetoric , analyzing how good stories and persuasive arguments are constructed , are still worth knowing today . clearly these theories were shaped by the linear media of scrolls and books that then conveyed culture . the fundamentally nonlinear capabilities of hypertext media seem to open the door to radically different notions of argument . on the other hand , many modern theories of cognition continue to highlight the fundamentally linear and sequential flow of human-attention [newell , 1990] ; we can only think about one thing at a time , no matter how fast we click . it will probably be artists , using new forms of media and hypertext authorship , who teach us the most about how these new-technologies can be used most expressively . it is still too early to tell how our existing social institutions will absorb these technological changes . attempts to index musical content offer some glimpses of the-future [bakhmutova et al , 1997 ; foote , 1997 ; ghias et al , 1995 ; wold etal , 1996] . the editors dual representation of a document
