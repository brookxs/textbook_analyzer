single-link and complete-link-clustering in single-link-clustering or single-linkage clustering , the similarity of two clusters is the similarity of their most similar members (see figure 17.3 , (a)) . this single-link merge criterion is local . we pay attention solely to the area where the two clusters come closest to each other . other , more distant parts of the cluster and the clusters ' overall structure are not taken into account . in complete-link-clustering or complete-linkage clustering , the similarity of two clusters is the similarity of their most dissimilar members (see figure 17.3 , (b)) . this is equivalent to choosing the cluster pair whose merge has the smallest diameter . this complete-link merge criterion is non-local ; the entire structure of the clustering can influence merge decisions . this results in a preference for compact clusters with small diameters over long , straggly clusters , but also causes sensitivity to outliers . a single-document far from the center can increase diameters of candidate merge clusters dramatically and completely change the final clustering . a dendrogram of a complete-link clustering.the same 30 documents were clustered with single-link-clustering in figure 17.1 . figure 17.4 depicts a single-link and a complete-link-clustering of eight documents . the first four steps , each producing a cluster consisting of a pair of two documents , are identical . then single-link-clustering joins the upper two pairs (and after that the lower two pairs) because on the maximum-similarity definition of cluster-similarity , those two clusters are closest . complete-link-clustering joins the left two pairs (and then the right two pairs) because those are the closest-pairs according to the minimum-similarity definition of cluster-similarity . figure 17.1 is an example of a single-link-clustering of a set of documents and figure 17.5 is the complete-link-clustering of the same set . when cutting the last merge in figure 17.5 , we obtain two clusters of similar size (documents 1-16 , from nyse closing averages to lloyd 's chief / u.s. grilling , and documents 17-30 , from ohio blue cross to clinton signs law) . there is no cut of the dendrogram in figure 17.1 that would give us an equally balanced clustering . both single-link and complete-link-clustering have graph-theoretic interpretations . define to be the combination similarity of the two clusters merged in step , and the graph that links all data points with a similarity of at least . then the clusters after step in single-link-clustering are the connected-components of and the clusters after step in complete-link-clustering are maximal-cliques of . a connected-component is a maximal set of connected points such that there is a path connecting each pair . a clique is a set of points that are completely linked with each other . these graph-theoretic interpretations motivate the terms single-link and complete-link-clustering . single-link clusters at step are maximal sets of points that are linked via at least one link (a single link) of similarity ; complete-link clusters at step are maximal sets of points that are completely linked with each other via links of similarity . single-link and complete-link-clustering reduce the assessment of cluster quality to a single similarity between a pair of documents : the two most similar documents in single-link-clustering and the two most dissimilar documents in complete-link-clustering . a measurement based on one pair can not fully reflect the distribution of documents in a cluster . it is therefore not surprising that both algorithms often produce undesirable clusters . single-link-clustering can produce straggling clusters as shown in figure 17.6 . since the merge criterion is strictly local , a chain of points can be extended for long distances without regard to the overall shape of the emerging cluster . this effect is called chaining . the chaining-effect is also apparent in figure 17.1 . the last eleven merges of the single-link-clustering (those above the line) add-on single documents or pairs of documents , corresponding to a chain . the complete-link-clustering in figure 17.5 avoids this problem . documents are split into two groups of roughly equal size when we cut the dendrogram at the last merge . in general , this is a more useful organization of the data than a clustering with chains . however , complete-link-clustering suffers from a different problem . it pays too much attention to outliers , points that do not fit well into the global structure of the cluster . in the example in figure 17.7 the four documents are split because of the outlier at the left edge (exercise 17.2.1) . complete-link-clustering does not find the most intuitive cluster structure in this example . subsections time-complexity of hac
