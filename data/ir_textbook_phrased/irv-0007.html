effectiveness and efficiency much of the research-and-development in information-retrieval is aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval . efficiency is usually measured in terms of the computer-resources used such as core , backing store , and c.p.u. time . it is difficult to measure efficiency in a machine-independent way . in any case , it should be measured in conjunction with effective-ness to obtain some idea of the benefit in terms of unit cost . in the previous section i mentioned that effectiveness is commonly measured in terms of precision-and-recall . i repeat here that precision is the ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of documents retrieved , and recall is the ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of relevant documents (both retrieved and not retrieved) . the reason for emphasising these two measures is that frequent reference is made to retrieval-effectiveness but its detailed discussion is delayed until chapter 7 . it will suffice until we reach that chapter to think of retrieval-effectiveness in terms of precision-and-recall . it would have been possible to give the chapter on evaluation before any of the other material but this , in my view , would have been like putting the cart before the horse . before we can appreciate the evaluation of observations we need to understand what gave rise to the observations . hence i have delayed discussing evaluation until some understanding of what makes an information-retrieval-system tick has been gained . readers not satisfied with this order can start by first reading chapter 7 which in any case can be read independently .
