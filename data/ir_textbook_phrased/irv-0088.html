foundation * problems of measurement have arisen in physics , psychology , and more recently , the social-sciences . clarification of these problems has been sought with the help of the theory of measurement . i shall attempt to do the same for information-retrieval . my purpose is to construct a framework , based on the mathematical theory of measurement within which measures-of-effectiveness for retrieval-systems can be derived . the basic mathematical notions underlying the measurement ideas will be introduced , but for their deeper understanding the reader is referred to the excellent book by krantz et al. [24] . it would be fair to say that the theory developed there is applied here . also of interest are the books by ellis [25] and lieberman [26] . the problems of measurement in information-retrieval differ from those encountered in the physical-sciences in one important aspect . in the physical-sciences there is usually an empirical ordering of the quantities we wish to measure . for example , we can establish empirically by means of a scale which masses are equal , and which are greater or less than others . such a situation does not hold in information-retrieval . in the case of the measurement of effectiveness by precision-and-recall , there is no absolute sense in which one can say that one particular pair of precision-recall values is better or worse than some other pair , or , for that matter , that they are comparable at all . however , to leave it at that is to admit defeat . there is * the next three sections are substantially the same as those appearing in my paper : ` foundations of evaluation ' , journal of documentation , 30 , 365-373 (1974) . they have been included with the kind permission of the managing editor of aslib . no reason why we can not postulate a particular ordering , or , to put it more mildly , why we can not show that a certain model for the measurement of effectiveness has acceptable properties . the immediate consequence of proceeding in this fashion is that each property ascribed to the model may be challenged . the only defence one has against this is that : (1) all properties ascribed are consistent ; (2) they bring out into the open all the assumptions made in measuring effectiveness ; (3) each property has an acceptable interpretation ; (4) the model leads to a plausible measure of effectiveness . it is as well to point out here that it does not lead to a unique measure , but it does show that certain classes of measures can be regarded as being equivalent .
