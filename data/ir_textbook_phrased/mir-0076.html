4.4.1 fixed structure the structure allowed in texts was traditionally quite restrictive . the documents had a fixed set of fields , much like a filled form . each field had some text inside . some fields were not present in all documents . only rarely could the fields appear in any order or repeat across a document . a document could not have text not classified under any field . fields were not allowed to nest or overlap . the retrieval activity allowed on them was restricted to specifying that a given basic pattern was to be found only in a given field . most current commercial systems use this model . this model is reasonable when the text-collection has a fixed structure . for instance , a mail archive could be regarded as a set of mails , where each mail has a sender , a receiver , a date , a subject , and a body-field . the user can thus search for the mails sent to a given person with ` football ' in the subject field . however , the model is inadequate to represent the hierarchical-structure present in an html-document , for instance . if the division of the text into fields is rigid enough , the content of some fields can even be interpreted not as text but as numbers , dates , etc. thereby allowing different queries to be posed on them (e.g. , month ranges in dates) . it is not hard to see that this idea leads naturally to the relational-model , each field corresponding to a column in the database table . looking at the database as a text allows us to query the textual fields with much more power than is common in relational-database-systems . on the other hand , relational-databases may make better use of their knowledge on the data-types involved to build specialized and more efficient indices . a number of approaches towards combining these trends have been proposed in recent years , their main problem being that they do not achieve optimal-performance because the text is usually stored together with other types of data . nevertheless , there are several proposals that extend sql (structured-query-language) to allow full-text-retrieval . among them we can mention proposals by leading relational-database vendors such as oracle and sybase , as well as sfql , which is covered in section 4.5 .
