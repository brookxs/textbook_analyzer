1.1.1 information versus data-retrieval data-retrieval , in the context of an ir-system , consists mainly of determining which documents of a collection contain the keywords in the user-query which , most frequently , is not enough to satisfy the user-information need . in fact , the user of an ir-system is concerned more with retrieving Â¶ information about a 2 introduction subject than with retrieving data which satisfies a given query . a data-retrieval language aims at retrieving all objects which satisfy clearly defined conditions such as those in a regular-expression or in a relational-algebra expression . thus , for a data-retrieval-system , a single erroneous object among a thousand retrieved objects means total failure . for an information-retrieval-system , however , the retrieved objects might be inaccurate and small errors are likely to go unnoticed . the main reason for this difference is that information-retrieval usually deals with natural-language-text which is not always well structured and could be semantically ambiguous . on the other hand , a data-retrieval-system (such as a relational-database) deals with data that has a well defined structure and semantics . data-retrieval , while providing a solution to the user of a database-system , does not solve the problem of retrieving information about a subject or topic . to be effective in its attempt to satisfy the user-information need , the ir-system must somehow interpret ' the contents of the information items (documents) in a collection and rank them according to a degree of relevance to the user-query . this ` interpretation ' of a document-content involves extracting syntactic-and-semantic-information from the document text and using this information to match the user-information need . the difficulty is not only knowing how to extract this information but also knowing how to use it to decide relevance . thus , the notion of relevance is at the center of information-retrieval . in fact , the primary goal of an ir-system is to retrieve all the documents which are relevant to a user-query while retrieving as few non-relevant documents as possible .
