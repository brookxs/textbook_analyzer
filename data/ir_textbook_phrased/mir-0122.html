7.2.4 index-terms selection if a full text representation of the text is adopted then all words in the text are used as index-terms . the alternative is to adopt a more abstract-view in which not all words are used as index-terms . this implies that the set of terms used as indices must be selected . in the area of bibliographic sciences , such a selection of index-terms is usually done by a specialist . an alternative approach is to select candidates for index-terms automatically . distinct automatic approaches for selecting index-terms can be used . a good approach is the identification of noun-groups (as done in the inquery-system [122]) which we now discuss . a sentence in natural-language-text is usually composed of nouns , pronouns , articles , verbs , adjectives , adverbs , and connectives . while the words in each grammatical class are used with a particular purpose , it can be argued that most of the semantics is carried by the noun words . thus , an intuitively promising strategy for selecting index-terms automatically is to use the nouns in the text . this can be done through the systematic elimination of verbs , adjectives , adverbs , connectives , articles , and pronouns . since it is common to combine two or three nouns in a single component (e.g. , computer-science) , it makes sense to cluster nouns which appear nearby in the text into a single indexing component (or concept) . thus , instead of simply 170 text operations using nouns as index-terms , we adopt noun-groups . a noun-group is a set of nouns whose syntactic-distance in the text (measured in terms of number of words between two nouns) does not exceed a predefined threshold (for instance , 3) . when noun-groups are adopted as indexing terms , we obtain a conceptual logical view of the documents in terms of sets of non-elementary index-terms .
