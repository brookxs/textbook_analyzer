15.4 document-models , representations , and access without documents there would be no ir or digital librarys . hence , it is appropriate to consider definitions of ` document ' [709] , and to develop suitable formalizations [508] , as well as to articulate research concerns [505] . for efficiency purposes , especially when handling millions of documents and gigabytes , terabytes , or petabytes of space , compression is crucial [825] . while that is becoming more manageable , converting very-large numbers of documents using high quality representations [151] can be prohibitively expensive , especially relative to the costs of retrieval , unless items are popular . all of these matters relate to the view of a document as a stream (along with one or more organizing structures) ; alternatively one can use-scenarios to provide focus on the usage of documents . these problems shift , and sometimes partially disappear , when one considers the entire life-cycle and social-context of a document [124 , 353] or when digital librarys become an integral part of automation efforts that deal with workflow and task-support for one or more document-collections .
