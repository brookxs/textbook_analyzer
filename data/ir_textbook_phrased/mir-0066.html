3.5 bibliographic discussion a nice chapter on retrieval-performance evaluation appeared in the book by salton and mcgill [698] . even if outdated , it is still interesting reading . the book by khorfage [451] also includes a full chapter on retrieval-evaluation . a recent paper by mizzaro [569] presents a very complete survey of relevance studies throughout the years . about 160 papers are discussed in this paper . two recent papers by shaw , burgin , and howel [422 , 423] discuss standards and evaluations in test-collections for cluster-based and vector-based retrieval-models . these papers also discuss the advantages of the harmonic mean (of recall and precision) as a single alternative measure for recall and precision . problems with recall and precision related to systems which require a weak document-ordering are discussed by raghavan , bollmann , and jung [664 , 663] . tague-sutcliffe proposes a measure of iiiformativeiiess for evaluating interactive user sessions [754] . bibliographic discussion 97 our discussion of the trec collection is based on the papers by har-man [342] and by vorhees and harman [794] . the trec collection is the most important reference collection nowadays for evaluation of complex-information requests which execute on a large-collection . our coverage of the cacm and isi collections is based on the work by fox [272] . these collections are small , require short setup-time , and provide a good environment for testing retrieval algorithms which are based on information derived from cross-citing patterns รณ a topic which has attracted much attention in the past [94 , 435 , 694 , 730 , 732 , 809] and which might nourish again in the context of the-web . the discussion on the cystic-fibrosis (cf) collection is based on the work by shaw , wood , wood , and tibbo [721] . the cf collection is also small but includes a set of relevance-scores carefully generated by human experts . furthermore , its example information requests present overlap among themselves which allows the testing of retrieval algorithms that take advantage of past user sessions to improve retrieval-performance .
