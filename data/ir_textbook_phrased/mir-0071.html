4.2.2 context queries many systems complement single-word queries with the ability to search words in a given context , that is , near other words . words which appear near each other may signal a higher likelihood of relevance than if they appear apart . for instance , we may want to form phrases of words or find words which are proximal in the text . therefore , we distinguish two types of queries : Ã¯ phrase is a sequence of single-word queries . an occurrence of the phrase is a sequence of words . for instance , it is possible to search for the word kenhance , ' and then for the word ` retrieval / in phrase queries it is normally understood that the separators in the text need not be the same as those in the query (e.g. , two spaces versus one space) , and uninteresting words are not considered at all . for instance , the previous example could match a text such as ' ... enhance the retrieval ... 1 . although the notion of a phrase is a very useful feature in most cases , not all systems implement it . ? proximity a more relaxed version of the phrase-query is the proximity-query . in this case , a sequence of single words or phrases is given , together 102 query-languages and translation syntax syntactic figure 4.1 an example of a query-syntax tree . it will retrieve all the documents which contain the word ` translation ' as well as either the word ` syntax ' or the word ` syntactic ' . with a maximum allowed distance between them . for instance , the above example could state that the two words should occur within four words , and therefore a match could be c. . . enhance the power of retrieval ... . ' this distance can be measured in characters or words depending on the system . the words and phrases may or may not be required to appear in the same order as in the query . phrases can be ranked in a fashion somewhat analogous to single words (see chapters 2 and 5 for details) . proximity-queries can be ranked in the same way if the parameters used by the ranking technique do not depend on physical-proximity . although it is not clear how to do better ranking , physical-proximity has semantic-value . this is because in most cases the proximity means that the words are in the same paragraph , and hence related in some way .
