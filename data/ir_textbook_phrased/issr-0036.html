3.1 history and objectives of indexing to understand the system-design associated with creation and manipulation of the searchable data-structures , it is necessary to understand the objectives of the indexing process . reviewing the history of indexing shows the dependency of information-processing capabilities on manual and then automatic-processing systems . through most of the 1980 's the goals of commercial information-retrieval-systems were constrained to facilitating the manual-indexing paradigm . in the i990 's , exponential growth in computer-processing capabilities with a continuing decrease in cost of computer-systems has allowed information-retrieval-systems to implement the previously theoretical functions introducing , a new information retrieval paradigm .
