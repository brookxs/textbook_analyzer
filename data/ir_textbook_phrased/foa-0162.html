7.6.2 the infospiders algorithm infospiders searches online for information relevant to the user by making autonomous decisions about what links to follow . algorithm 7.1 is the infospiders implementation of the local selection-algorithm . a central part of the system is the use of optional relevance-feedback . the user may assess the relevance of (some of) the documents visited by infospiders up to a certain point . such relevance-assessments take place asynchronously with respect to the online search and alter the subsequent behaviors of agents online by changing the energy-landscape of the environment . the process is akin to the replenishment of environmental resources ; the user interacts with the environment to bias the search-process . let us first overview the algorithm at a high level ; representation-dependent details will be given in the following subsections and experimental parameter-values in the next section . the user initially provides a list of keywords and a list of starting-points , in the form of a bookmark file . * the search is initialized by prefetching the starting documents . each agent is `` positioned '' at one of these documents and given a random behavior (depending on the representation of agents) and an initial reservoir of energy . * this list would typically be obtained by consulting a search-engine . 282 finding out about algorithm 7.1 an evolutionary-algorithm for distributed information agents initialize po agents , each with energy e = 0/2 loop : foreach alive agent a : pick link from current document fetch new document d ealt ;

if the document has not been visited before , its relevance must be estimated . this mechanism is implemented via a cache , which also speeds up the process by minimizing duplicate transfers of documents . while in the current , client-based implementation of infospiders this poses no problem ; caching is a form of communication and thus is a bottleneck for the performance of distributed-agents . in a distributed-implementation , we imagine that agents would have local caches . when using the current implementation to simulate the performance of distributed infospiders , we will simply set the cache-size to zero . adaptive-information-retrieval 283 agents are charged energy costs for the network load incurred by transferring documents . the cost-function c (-rrb- should depend on used resources , for example , transfer latency or document size . for simplicity we will assume a constant cost for accessing any new document and a (possibly smaller) constant cost for accessing the cache ; this way stationary behaviors , such as going back and forth between a pair of documents , are discouraged . just as for graph-search , instantaneous changes of energy are used as reward and penalty signals . this way agents adapt during their lifetime by q-learning . this adaptive process allows an agent to modify its behavior based on prior-experience by learning to predict which are the best links to follow . depending on its current energy-level , an agent may be killed or selected for reproduction . in the latter case , offspring are recombined through the use of local crossover , whereby an agent can only recombine with agents residing on the same document , if there are any . offspring are also mutated , providing the variation necessary for adapting agents by way of evolution . finally , the user may provide the system with relevance-feedback . it is important to stress that this process is entirely optional - infospiders can search in a completely unsupervised fashion once it is given a query and a set of starting-points . relevance-feedback takes place without direct online-interactions between user and agents . the user may assess any visited document d with feedback lt ; / gt ; (d) g {- i , 0 , +1} . all the words in the document are automatically assessed by updating a `` feedback list '' of encountered words . each word in this list , fc , is associated with a signed integer a) k that is initialized with 0 and updated each time any document is assessed by the user : \ / ke d : a) k ^ ~ o) k the word feedback list is maintained to keep a global profile of which words are relevant to the user . the ultimate output of the algorithm is a flux of links to documents ranked according to some relevance estimate - modulo relevance-assessments by the user . the algorithm terminates when the population becomes extinct for lack of relevant-information resources or when it is terminated by the user .
