2.1 introduction traditional information-retrieval-systems usually adopt index-terms to index and retrieve documents . in a restricted sense , an index term is a keyword (or group of related words) which has some meaning of its own (i.e. , which usually has the semantics of a noun) . in its more general form , an index term is simply any word which appears in the text of a document in the collection . retrieval based on index-terms is simple but raises key questions regarding the information-retrieval-task . for instance , retrieval using index-terms adopts as a fundamental foundation the idea that the semantics of the documents and of the user-information need can be naturally expressed through sets of index-terms . clearly , this is a considerable oversimplification of the problem because a lot of the semantics in a document or user request is lost when we replace its text with a set of words . furthermore , matching between each document and the user request is attempted in this very imprecise space of index-terms . thus , it is no surprise that the documents retrieved in response to a user request expressed as a set of keywords are frequently irrelevant . if one also considers that most users have no training in properly forming their queries , the problem is worsened with potentially disastrous results . the frequent dissatisfaction of web users with the answers they normally obtain is just one good example of this fact . clearly , one central problem regarding information-retrieval-systems is the issue of predicting which documents are relevant and which are not . such a decision is usually dependent on a ranking-algorithm which attempts to establish a simple ordering of the documents retrieved . documents appearing at the top of this ordering are considered to be more likely to be relevant . thus , ranking-algorithms are at the core of information-retrieval-systems . a ranking-algorithm operates according to basic premises regarding the notion of document-relevance . distinct sets of premises (regarding document-relevance) yield distinct information-retrieval-models . the ir model adopted determines the predictions of what is relevant and what is not (i.e. , the notion of relevance implemented by the system) . the purpose of this chapter is to cover the most important information-retrieval-models proposed over the years . by 19 20 modeling doing so , the chapter also provides a conceptual basis for most of the remaining chapters in this book . we first propose a taxonomy for categorizing the 15 ir-models we cover . second , we distinguish between two types of user retrieval tasks : ad-hoc and filtering . third , we present a formal characterization of ir-models which is useful for distinguishing the various components of a particular model . last , we discuss each of the ir-models included in our taxonomy .
