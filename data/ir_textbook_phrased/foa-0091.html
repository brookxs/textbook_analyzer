5.2.4 how many dimensions k to reduce to ? a central question remains : how many dimensions k should be used ? to date , the only answers are empirical . early experiments suggest that using too few dimensions dramatically degrades performance . ^ the original med corpus used in early lsi experiments [deerwester et al , 1990 ; dumais , 1991] happens to be distinguished by a particularly topically focused vocabulary . while a few hundred dimensions may suffice to discriminate this small set of documents , it might be necessary to use more dimensions when describing a broader domain of discourse . dimensionality-reduction using neural-networks earlier attempts to reduce dimensionality 158 finding out about i 1 10 100 1000 10,000 number of dimensions in lsa (log) figure 5.5 retrieval-performance as function of svd dimension (fc) . from [landauer and dumais , 1997] . reproduced with permission of the association of computing-machinery empirically , however , reduction to around 500 dimensions seems to provide significant improvements to even very-large-corpora . for example , figure 5.5 shows one experiment [landauer and dumais , 1997] , where / : is varied over four orders of magnitude . some attempts to select k theoretically , borrowing a rank-plus-shift method from signal-processing , have also been made [zha and zhang , 1998] . the most satisfying answer may come from probabilistic-models that relate the raw frequency statistics to an underlying distribution [papadimitriou et al. , 1998 ; hoffman , 1999] .
