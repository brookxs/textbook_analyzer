4.3 inverted-file structure the most common data structure used in both database-management and information retrieval-systems is the inverted-file structure . inverted-file structures are composed of three basic files : the document file , the inversion lists (sometimes called posting files) and the dictionary . the name ` inverted-file '' comes from its underlying methodology of storing an inversion of the documents : inversion of the document from the perspective that , for each word , a list of documents in which the word is found in is stored (the inversion list for that word) . each document in the system is given a unique numerical identifier . it is that identifier that is stored in the inversion list . the way to locate the inversion list for a particular word is via the dictionary . the dictionary is typically a sorted list of all unique-words data-structure 83 (processing tokens) in the system and a pointer to the location of its inversion list (see figure 4.5) . dictionaries can also store other information used in query-optimization such as the length of inversion lists . documents doc # 1 , computer , bit , byte doc # 2 , memory , byte doc # 3 , computer , bit , memory ________ doc # 4 , computer byte , dictionary bit (2) byte (3) computer (3) memory (2) inversion lists - bit - 1,3 `` byte - 1,2,4 Â¶ computer - 1 , 3 , 4 - memory - 2 , 3 figure 4.5 inverted-file structure additional-information may be used from the item to increase precision and provide a more optimum inversion list file-structure . for example , if zoning is used , the dictionary may be partitioned by zone . there could be a dictionary and set of inversion lists for the `` abstract '' zone in an item and another dictionary and set of inversion lists for the `` main body '' zone . this increases the overhead when a user wants to search the complete item versus restricting the search to a specific zone . another typical optimization occurs when the inversion list only contains one or two entries . those entries can be stored as part of the dictionary . the inversion list contains the document identifier for each document in which the word is found . to support proximity , contiguous word phrases and term-weighting algorithms , all occurrences of a word are stored in the inversion list along with the word position . thus if the word `` bit '' was the tenth , twelfth and eighteenth word in document # 1 , then the inversion list would appear : bit-1 (10) , 1 (12) , 1 (18) weights can also be stored in inversion lists . words with special characteristics are frequently stored in their own dictionaries to allow for optimum internal-representation and manipulation (e.g. , dates which require date ranging and numbers) . when a search is performed , the inversion lists for the terms in the query are located and the appropriate logic is applied between inversion lists . the result is a final hit list of items that satisfy the query . for systems that support ranking , the list is reorganized into ranked order . the document numbers are used to retrieve the documents from the document file . using the inversion lists in figure 84 chapter 4 4-5 , the query (bit and computer) would use the dictionary to find the inversion lists for `` bit '' and `` computer . '' these two lists would be logically anded : (1,3) and (1,3,4) resulting in the final hit list containing (1,3) . rather than using a dictionary to point to the inversion list , b-trees can be used . the inversion lists may be at the leaf level or referenced in higher level pointers . figure 4.6 shows how the words in figure 4.5 would appear . a b-tree of order m is defined as : a root-node with between 2 and 2m keys all other internal-nodes have between m and 2m keys all keys are kept in order from smaller to larger all leaves are at the same level or differ by at most one level . bit - 1,3 byte - 1 , 2 , 4 computer -1,3,4 memory -2 , 3 figure 4-6 b-tree inversion lists cutting and pedersen described use of b-trees as an efficient inverted-file storage mechanism for data that undergoes heavy updates (cutting-90) . the nature of information-systems is that items are seldom if ever modified once they are produced . most commercial systems take advantage of this fact by allowing document files and their associated inversion lists to grow to a certain maximum size and then to freeze them , starting a new structure . each of these databases of document file , dictionary , inversion lists is archived and made available for a user 's query . this has the advantage that for queries only interested in more recent information , only the latest databases need to be searched . since data-structure 85 older items are seldom deleted or modified , the archived databases may be permanently backed-up , thus saving on operations overhead . starting a new inverted database has significant overhead in adding new words and inversion lists until the frequently found words are added to the dictionary and inversion lists . previous knowledge of archived databases can be used to establish an existing dictionary and inversion structure at the start of a new database , thus saving significant overhead during the initial adding of new documents2 . inversion lists structures are used because they provide optimum performance in searching large-databases . the optimality comes from the minimization of data-flow in resolving a query . only data directly related to the query are retrieved from secondary-storage . also there are many techniques that can be used to optimize the resolution of the query based upon information maintained in the dictionary . inversion list file-structures are well suited to store concepts and their relationships . each inversion list can be thought of as representing a particular concept . the inversion list is then a concordance of all of the items that contain that concept . finer resolution of concepts can additionally be maintained by storing locations with an item and weights of the item in the inversion lists . with this information , relationships between concepts can be determined as part of search-algorithms (see chapter 7) . location of concepts is made easy by their listing in the dictionary and inversion lists . for natural-language-processing algorithms , other structures may be more appropriate or required in addition to inversion lists for maintaining the required semantic and syntactic-information .
