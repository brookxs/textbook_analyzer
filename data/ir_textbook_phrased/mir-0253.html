13.4 search-engines in this section we cover different architectures of retrieval-systems that model the-web as a full-text database . one main difference between standard ir systems and the wreb is that , in the web , all queries must be answered without accessing the text (that is , only the indices are available) . otherwise , that would require either storing locally a copy of the-web pages (too expensive) or accessing remote pages through the network at query time (too slow) . this difference has an impact on the indexing-and-searching-algorithms , as well as on the query-languages made available .
