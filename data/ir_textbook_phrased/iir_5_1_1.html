heaps ' law : estimating the number of terms heaps ' law.vocabulary size as a function of collection-size (number of tokens) for reuters-rcv1 . for these data , the dashed line is the best least-squares fit . thus , and . a better way of getting a handle on is heaps ' law , which estimates vocabulary-size as a function of collection-size : (1) 5.1 (2) the parameter is quite variable because vocabulary-growth depends a lot on the nature of the collection and how it is processed . case-folding and stemming reduce the growth rate of the vocabulary , whereas including numbers and spelling errors increase it . regardless of the values of the parameters for a particular collection , heaps ' law suggests that (i) the dictionary size continues to increase with more documents in the collection , rather than a maximum vocabulary-size being reached , and (ii) the size of the dictionary is quite large for large-collections . these two hypotheses have been empirically shown to be true of large text collections (section 5.4) . so dictionary-compression is important for an effective information-retrieval-system .
