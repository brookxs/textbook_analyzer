2.8.3 belief network-model the belief network-model , introduced in 1996 by ribeiro-neto and muntz [674] , is also based on an epistemological interpretation of probabilities . however , it departs from the inference-network model by adopting a clearly defined sample space . as a result , it yields a slightly different network topology which provides a separation between the document and the query portions of the network . this is the main difference between the two models and one which has theoretical implications . the probability space the probability space adopted was first introduced by wong and yao [830] and works as follows . all documents in the collection are indexed by index-terms and the universe of discourse u is the set k of all index-terms . definition the set k = {i , ... , kt} is the universe of discourse and defines the sample space for the belief network-model let u c k be a subset of k. to each subset u is associated a vector k such that gi (k) = 1 4 = $ - ki Ã¤ u . the introduction of the vector k is useful to keep the notation compatible with the one which has been used throughout this chapter . each index term is viewed as an elementary concept and at as a concept-space . a concept u is a subset of k and might represent a document in the collection or a user-query . in a belief network , set relationships are specified using random variables as follows . definition 7b each index term k % is associated a binary random-variable which is also referred to as ki . the random-variable kt is set to 1 to indicate that the index k % is a member of a concept/set represented by k. alternative probabilistic-models 57 this association of concepts with subsets is useful because it allows us to express the logical notions of conjunction , disjunction , negation , and implication as the more familiar set-theoretic notions of intersection , union , complementation , and inclusion . documents and user queries can be defined as concepts in the sample space k as follows . definition a document d3 in the collection is represented as a concept (i.e. , a set) composed of the terms which are used to index dj . analogously , a user-query q is represented as a concept composed of the terms which are used to index q . a probability-distribution p is defined over k as follows . let c be a generic concept in the space k representing a document or user-query . then , p (c) = ^ p (c | w) xp (u) (2.11) p (u) = ^ - 1 (2.12) equation 2.11 defines p (c) as the degree of coverage of the space k by c . such a coverage is computed by contrasting each of the concepts in k with c (through p (c \ u)) and by summing up the individual-contributions . this sum is weighted by the probability p {u) with which u occurs in k . since at the beginning the system has no knowledge of the probability with which a concept u occurs in the space k , we can assume that each u is equally likely which results in equation 2.12 . belief network-model in the belief network-model , the user-query q is modeled as a network node to which is associated a binary random-variable (as in the inference-network model) which is also referred to as q . this variable is set to 1 whenever q completely covers the concept-space k. thus , when we assess p (q) we compute the degree of coverage of the space k by q . this is equivalent to assessing the degree of belief associated with the following proposition : is it true that q completely covers all possible concepts in k ? a document d3 is modeled as a network node with which is associated a binary random-variable which is also referred to as d3 . this variable is 1 to indicate that dj completely covers the concept-space a '' . when we assess p (dj) % we compute the degree of coverage of the space k by dj . this is equivalent to assessing the degree of belief associated with the following proposition : is it true that dj completely covers all possible concepts in k ? according to the above formalism , the user-query and the documents in the collection are modeled as subsets of index-terms . each of these subsets is interpreted as a concept embedded in the concept-space k which works as a common sample space . furthermore , user queries and documents are modeled 58 modeling figure 2.10 basic belief network-model . identically . this is an important observation because it defines the topology of the belief network . figure 2.10 illustrates our belief network-model . as in the inference-network model , a query q is modeled as a binary random-variable which is pointed to by the index term nodes which compose the query-concept . documents are treated analogously to user queries (i.e. , both are concepts in the space k) . thus , contrary to the inference-network model , a document node is pointed to by the index term nodes which compose the document . this is the topological difference between the two models and one which has more implications than it seems at first glance . the ranking of a document dj relative to a given query q is interpreted as a concept-matching relationship and reflects the degree of coverage provided to the concept dj by the concept q. assumption in the belief network-model , p (dj \ q) is adopted as the rank of the document dj with respect to the query q. by the application of bayes ' theorem , we can write p {d3 \ q) = p (d3 a q) / p (q) . since p (q) is a constant for all documents in the collection , we can write p (dj \ q) ~ p (dj a q) i.e. , the rank assigned to a document dj is directly proportional to p (dj a q) . this last probability is computed through the application of equation 2.11 which yields p (dj \ q) in the belief network of figure 2.10 , instantiation of the index term variables logically separates the nodes q and d making them mutually independent (i.e. , the document and query portions of the network are logically separated by inalternative probabilistic-models stantiation of the index term nodes) . therefore , 59 which can be rewritten as p (k) (2.13) vfc to complete the belief network we need to specify the conditional-probabilities p (q \ k) and p (dj \ k) . distinct specifications of these probabilities allow the modeling of different ranking strategies (corresponding to different ir-models) . we now discuss how to specify these probabilities to subsume the vector-model . for the vector-model , the probabilities p {q \ k) and p (d3 \ k) are specified as follows . let , hi = k | (# (* ?) = 1 a as before . also , p (q \ k) = 0 9j (k) = 0) if k = h a gt (q) = 1 otherwise p (q \ k) = 1-p (q \ k) further , define 0 p (dj \ k) = 1-p (dj \ k) if k = ki a 9i (dj) = 1 otherwise then , the ordering of the retrieved documents (i.e. , the ranking) defined by p (dj \ q) coincides with the ordering generated by the vector-model as specified in section 2.5.3 . thus , the belief network-model can be tuned to subsume the vector-model which can not be accomplished with the inference-network model .
