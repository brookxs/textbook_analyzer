boolean search a boolean search-strategy retrieves those documents which are ` true ' for the query . this formulation only makes sense if the queries are expressed in terms of index-terms (or keywords) and combined by the usual logical connectives and , or , and not . for example , if the query q = (k1 and k2) or (k3 and (not k4)) then the boolean search will retrieve all documents indexed by k1 and k2 , as well as all documents indexed by k3 which are not indexed by k4 . an obvious way to implement the boolean search is through the inverted-file . we store a list for each keyword in the vocabulary , and in each list put the addresses (or numbers) of the documents containing that particular word . to satisfy a query we now perform the set-operations , corresponding to the logical connectives , on the ki-lists . for example , if k1 - list : d1 , d2 , d3 , d4 k2 - list : d1 , d2 k3 - list : d1 , d2 , d3 k4 - list : d1 and q = (k1 and k2) or (k3 and (not k4)) then to satisfy the (k1 and k2) part we intersect the k1 and k2 lists , to satisfy the (k3 and (not k4)) part we subtract the k4 list from the k3 list . the or is satisfied by now taking the union of the two sets of documents obtained for the parts . the result is the set {d1 , d2 , d3} which satisfies the query and each document in it is ` true ' for the query . a slight modification of the full boolean search is one which only allows and logic but takes account of the actual number of terms the query has in common with a document . this number has become known as the co-ordination level . the search-strategy is often called simple matching . because at any level we can have more than one document , the documents are said to be partially ranked by the co-ordination levels . for the same example as before with the query q = k1 and k2 and k3 we obtain the following ranking : co-ordination level-3 d1 , d2 2 d3 1 d4 in fact , simple matching may be viewed as using a primitive matching-function . for each document d we calculate | d [[intersection]] q | , that is the size of the overlap between d and q , each represented as a set of keywords . this is the simple matching coefficient mentioned in chapter 3 .
