precision-and-recall , and others we now leave the speculations about relevance and return to the promised detailed discussion of the measurement of effectiveness . relevance will once again be assumed to have its broader meaning of ` aboutness ' and ` appropriateness ' , that is , a document is ultimately determined to be relevant or not by the user . effectiveness is purely a measure of the ability of the system to satisfy the user in terms of the relevance of documents retrieved . initially , i shall concentrate on measuring effectiveness by precision-and-recall ; a similar analysis could be given for any pair of equivalent measures . it is helpful at this point to introduce the famous ` contingency ' table which is not really a contingency-table at all . a large number of measures-of-effectiveness can be derived from this table . to list but a few : (| . | is the counting measure) there is a functional relationship between all three involving a parameter called generality (g) which is a measure of the density of relevant documents in the collection . the relationship is : for each request submitted to a retrieval-system one of these tables can be constructed . based on each one of these tables a precision-recall value can be calculated . if the output of the retrieval-strategy depends on a parameter , such as rank position or co-ordination level (the number of terms a query has in common with a document) , it can be varied to give a different table for each value of the parameter and hence a different precision-recall value . if [[lambda]] is the parameter , then p [[lambda]] denotes precision , r [[lambda]] recall , and a precision-recall value will be denoted by the ordered pair (r [[lambda]] , p [[lambda]]) . the set of ordered pairs makes up the precision-recall graph . geometrically when the points have been joined up in some way they make up the precision-recall-curve . the performance of each request is usually given by a precision-recall-curve (see figure 7.1) . to measure the overall performance of a system , the set of surves , one for each request , is combined in some way to produce an average curve . * for a derivation of this relation from bayes ' theorem , the reader should consult the author 's recent paper on retrieval-effectiveness [10] .
