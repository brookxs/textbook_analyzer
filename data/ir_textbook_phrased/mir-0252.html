13.3.2 modeling the web can we model the document characteristics of the whole web ? yes , as has already been discussed partially in chapter 6 . the heaps ' and zipf 's laws are also valid in the web . in particular , the vocabulary grows faster (larger 3) and the word-distribution should be more biased (larger 0) . however , there are no experiments on large web collections to measure these parameters . 372 searching the-web language funredes alis tech . oclc spoken by (1998 , %) (june 1997 , %) (june 1998 , %) (millions) english 76.4 82.3 71 450 japanese 4.8 1.6 4 126 german 4.4 4.0 7 118 french 2.9 1.5 3 122 spanish 2.6 1.1 3 266 italian 1.5 0.8 1 63 portuguese 0.8 0.7 2 175 table 13.1 languages of the-web . 0 -1 11 1 ; = ; ~ 2 a j 1 (- -4 all files ------ v ' a \ \ image files -- w \ \ audio files -- \ \ \ i - j video files ¶ x '' ` i ' lt ; fllfll text files - , iaª . -6 c 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 4 6 log (file-size in bytes) log (file-size) figure 13.2 left : distribution for all file-sizes (courtesy of m. crovella , 1998) . right : right tail distribution for different file types (from crovella and bestavros , 1996) . all logarithms are in base 10 . an additional model is related to the distribution of document sizes . according to this model , the document sizes are self-similar [201] , that is , they have a large variance (a similar behavior appears in web-traffic) . this can be modeled by two different distributions . the main body of the distribution follows a logarithmic normal-distribution , such that the probability of finding a document of size x bytes is given by p (x) 1 - / x) 2/2ct2 where the average (/ i) and standard-deviation (a) are 9.357 and 1.318 , respectively [59 ; . figure 13.2 (left) shows the size distribution of the experimental-data . search-engines 373 the right tail of the distribution is iheavy-tailed . ' that is , the majority of documents are small , but there is a non-trivial number of large documents . this is intuitive for image or video files , but it is also true for html pages . a good fit is obtained with the pareto-distribution where x is measured in bytes and k and a are parameters of the distribution [59] (see figure 13.2 (right)) . for text files , a is about 1.36 , being smaller for images and other binary formats [201 , 819] . taking all web-documents into account , we get a = 1.1 and k = 9.3 kb [58] . that is , 9.3 kb is the cut point between both distributions , and 93 % of all the files have a size below this value . in fact , for less than 50 kb , images are the typical files , from 50 to 300 kb we have an increasing number of audio files , and over that to several megabytes , video files are more frequent . the parameters of these distributions were obtained from a sample of more than 54,000 web-pages requested by several users in a period of two months of 1995 . recent data collected in 1998 show that the size distributions have the same form , but parameters change [58] . related information can be found on web benchmarks such as webspec96 and the sun/inktomi inkbench [395] .
