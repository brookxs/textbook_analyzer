10.4 imagery retrieval increasing volumes of imagery ó from web-page images to personal-collections from digital-cameras ó have escalated the need for more effective and efficient imagery access . researchers have identified needs for indexing and search of not only the metadata associated with the imagery (e.g. , captions , annotations) but also retrieval directly on the content of the imagery . initial algorithm-development has focused on the automatic-indexing of visual-features of imagery (e.g. , color , texture , shape) which can be used as a means for retrieving similar multimedia-information-retrieval 247 images without the burden of manual-indexing (niblack and jain , 1993 , 1994 , 1995) . however , the ultimate objective is semantic based access to imagery . flicker et al. 's (1997) query-by-image-content (qbic) system (www.qbic.almadenjbm.com , seybold 1994) and its commercial version , ultimedia manager (www.ibm.com/software/data/umm/umm.html) , exemplifies this imagery attribute-indexing approach . qbic supports access to imagery collections on the basis of visual-properties such as color , shape , texture , and sketches (viewing from the-internet will show colors described in the text .) . in their approach , query facilities for specifying color parameters , drawing desired shapes , or selecting textures replace the traditional keyword-query found in text-retrieval . for example , figure 10.4 a illustrates a query to a database of all us stamps prior to 1995 in which qbic is asked to retrieve red images . the `` red stamps '' results are displayed in figure 10.4 b . if there are text captions associated with the imagery these of course can be exploited . for example , if we further refine this search by adding the keyword `` president '' we obtain the results shown in figure 10.4 c in which all stamps are both red in color and are related to `` president '' . for the careful reader , the female stamp in the bottom right hand corner of figure 10.4 c is of martha washington from the presidential stamp collection . qbic stamps database courtesy of w first select tpwemtopr by didnag ´ aw p ´ nªjng ´ i * to hack cffamctaagse of the desirec mat (ftaximtfigs of toe ´ js ´ eo) m new ´ gkms m pessted white , jwtmj tbm sslact ft cete ssxm toe este jacket to ptditi year kicubs ^ b. yam am ´ tfa ´ fctci : ttgt ; . the cote ªg ´ ttªlt ; w mtieryei-jfdessrsdrgbvtauftisit ; she uxt areas repeattfaa far each desaowi cote and m pilt ; ± up to 5 cdat/pettenittgs pan e it (ai % usl ths color percentage ^ . select rectange with you r ´ pant etty selection , e figure 10.4 a. qbic query by color red 248 chapter 10 bt # lt ; st vfew so frnrnrieatar figure 10.4 b. retrieved red stamps figure 10.4 c. red stamps of presidents multimedia-information-retrieval 249 using qbic the user can also specify queries such as `` find images with a coarsely textured , red round object and a green square '' . because robust , domain-independent object-identification remains difficult and manual image-annotation is tedious , the authors have developed automated and semiautomated object outlining tools (e.g. , foreground/background models to extract objects) to facilitate database population . more recently researchers have explored the application of content-based imagery access to video-retrieval . for example , flicker et al. (1997) perform shot-detection , extract a representative-frame (r-frame , sometimes called keyframe) for each shot , and derive a layered representation of moving-objects . this enables queries such as `` find me all shots panning left to right '' which yield a list of relevancy ranked r-frames (which acts as a thumbnail) , selection of which retrieves the associated video-shot . additional research in image-processing has addressed specific kinds of content-based-retrieval problems . consider face processing , where we distinguish face-detection (i.e. , identifying a face or faces in a scene) , face-recognition (authenticating that a given face is of a particular person) , and face-retrieval (find the closest matching face in a repository given an example or some search criteria) . for example , for the past few years the us immigration and naturalization service has been using a face-recognition system (www.faceit.com) to `` watch '' and approve registered `` fast lane '' drivers crossing the otay mesa port of entry at the us/mexico border . using a radiofrequency (rf) tag on the automobile , the system retrieves a picture of the driver registered with the automobile from a database , which is then matched to an image taken in real-time of the actual driver . if the verification is successful , the car is permitted to proceed without delay ; if not , the vehicle is routed to an inspection station . since faceltæ can find the head anywhere in the field-of-view of the camera , it works on any kind of vehicle (car , van , or sports utility) . system-performance can be assessed using measurements analogous to those used in text-retrieval , such as precision-and-recall . researchers have also developed systems to track human-movement (e.g. , heads , hands , feet) and to differentiate human expressions (pentland , 1997) such as a smile , surprise , anger , or disgust . this expression-recognition is related to research in emotion-recognition (picard , 1997) in the context of human-computer-interaction . face-recognition is also important in video-retrieval . for example , wactlar et al 's (2000) informedia digital-video-library system extracts information from audio and video and supports full content-search over digitized video sources . among other capabilities , informedia provides a facility called named face which automatically associates a name with a face and enables the user to search for a face given a name and vice versa .
