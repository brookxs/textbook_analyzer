9.3.5 web issues information-retrieval on the world-wide-web is covered extensively in chapter 13 . for completeness , we briefly mention here how parallel and distributed information-retrieval applies to the-web . the most direct application is to gather all of the documents on the web into a single , large-document-collection . the parallel and distributed techniques described above can then be used directly as if the-web were any other large-document-collection . this is the approach currently taken by most of the popular web-search services . alternatively , we can exploit the distributed-system of computers that make up the-web and spread the work of collecting , organizing , and searching all of the documents . this is the approach taken by the harvest system [108] . harvest comprises a number of components for gathering , summarizing , replicating , distributing , and searching documents . user queries are processed by brokers , which collect and refine information from gatherers and other brokers . the information at a particular broker is typically related to a restricted set of topics , allowing users to direct their queries to the most appropriate brokers . a central broker registry helps users find the best brokers for their queries (see figure 13.4) . trends and research-issues 255
