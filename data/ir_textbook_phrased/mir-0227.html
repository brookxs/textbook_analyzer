11.3.2 conditions on multimedia-data multimedia-query languages should provide predicates for expressing conditions on the attributes , the content , and the structure of multimedia objects . in general , query predicates can be classified into three different groups : ï attribute predicates concern the attributes (i.e. , the structured-content) of multimedia objects . ï structural predicates concern the structure of the data being considered . ï semantic-predicates concern the semantic and unstructured content of the data involved . by the term attribute predicates we mean predicates against traditional attributes , i.e. , attributes for which an exact value is supplied for each object . examples of attributes are the speaker of an audio object , the size of an object , or its type . by querying these predicates , the system applies an exact-match retrieval , using the same techniques as traditional dbmss . structural predicates concern the structure of multimedia objects . such predicates can be answered by using some form of metadata [99 , 442 ; and 336 multimedia-ir : models and languages information about the database-schema . with respect to traditional databases , structural queries play a fundamental role in multimedia-query processing , due to the complex structure of multimedia objects . an example of use of a structural predicate is the query : ` find all multimedia objects containing at least one image and a video-clip . ' on the other hand , semantic-predicates concern the semantic content of the queried data , depending on the features that have been extracted and stored for each multimedia-object . an example of a semantic-query is ` find all the objects containing the word office . ' note that the word ` office ' may appear either in a textual component of the object or as a text attribute of some image components . the query ` find all the red houses ' is a query on the image-content . this query can be executed only if color and shape are features that have been previously extracted from images . current systems support semantic-predicates only with respect to specific-features , such as the color , the shape , the texture , and sometimes the motion . for example , qbic allows the retrieval of images with similar shapes or similar textures with respect to the object example specified in the query [257] . more innovative approaches include the name-it project , whose aim is to process a video-clip and automatically associate spoken or typed names with their corresponding faces [708] . the main difference between attribute predicates and semantic-predicates is that , in the latter case , an exact-match can not be applied . this means that there is no guarantee that the objects retrieved by this type of predicate are 1009 ? correct or precise . in general , the result of a query involving semantic-predicates is a set of objects , each of which has an associated degree of relevance with respect to the query . the user can subsequently select the better matches and submit the query again . structural and semantic predicates can also refer to spatial or temporal-properties of multimedia objects . spatial semantic-predicates specify conditions about the relative positions of a set of objects in an image or a video . examples of spatial semantic-predicates are : contain , intersect , is contained in , is adjacent to . temporal semantic-predicates are mainly related to continuous-media , like audio and video . they allow one to express temporal-relationships among the various frames of a single audio or video . for example , the query ¶ `` fiuci all the objects that contain an audio component , where the hint of the discussion is first policy , and then economy ' is a temporal audio query . from the point-of-view of structural predicates , spatial and temporal predicates can be used to specify temporal-synchronization properties and spatial-layout properties for the presentation of multimedia objects [87 , 88] . for instance , in the query : ` find all the objects containing an image overlapping the associated text ' , a spatial structural predicate is used to impose a condition on the spatial-layout of the retrieved objects . analogously , the query : ` find all the objects in which a jingle is played for the duration of an linage display1 is an example of a structural temporal-query . note , moreover , that temporal and spatial predicates can be combined to express more articulated requirements . an example is the query : `` find all the objects in which the logo of a car company query-languages 337 is displayed and , when it disappears , a graphic showing the increases in the company sales is shown in the same position where the logo was , ' due to the complex structure of multimedia objects , all the previous types of predicates can refer either to the whole object or , if the underlying data-model supports complex object representation , to some subcomponents of the object . in the last case , the query-language must also be able to navigate the object-structure . a typical example in this direction is represented by path-expressions in object-oriented-systems [89] .
