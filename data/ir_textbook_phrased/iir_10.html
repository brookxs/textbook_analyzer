xml-retrieval information-retrieval-systems are often contrasted with relational-databases . traditionally , ir systems have retrieved information from unstructured-text - by which we mean `` raw '' text without markup . databases are designed for querying relational-data : sets of records that have values for predefined attributes such as employee number , title and salary . there are fundamental differences between information-retrieval and database-systems in terms of retrieval-model , data-structures and query-language as shown in table 10.1 . rdb search unstructured retrieval structured-retrieval objects records unstructured documents trees with text at leaves model relational-model vector-space others ? main data-structure table inverted-index ? queries sql free-text queries ? rdb (relational-database) search , unstructured-information retrieval and structured-information-retrieval . there is no consensus yet as to which methods work best for structured-retrieval although many researchers believe that xquery (page 10.5) will become the standard for structured-queries . some highly structured-text search-problems are most efficiently handled by a relational-database , for example , if the employee table contains an attribute for short textual job-descriptions and you want to find all employees who are involved with invoicing . in this case , the sql-query : select lastname from employees where job_desc like ` invoic % ' ; however , many structured-data sources containing text are best modeled as structured-documents rather than relational-data . we call the search over such structured-documents structured-retrieval . queries in structured-retrieval can be either structured or unstructured , but we will assume in this chapter that the collection consists only of structured-documents . applications of structured-retrieval include digital-libraries , patent-databases , , text in which entities like persons and locations have been tagged (in a process called) and output from office suites like openoffice that save documents as marked up text . in all of these applications , we want to be able to run queries that combine textual criteria with structural criteria . examples of such queries are give me a full-length article on fast-fourier-transforms (digital-libraries) , give me patents whose claims mention rsa-public-key encryption and that cite us patent 4,405,829 (patents) , or give me articles about sightseeing tours of the vatican and the coliseum (entity-tagged text) . these three queries are structured-queries that can not be answered well by an unranked retrieval-system . as we argued in westlaw unranked retrieval-models like the boolean-model suffer from low recall . for instance , an unranked system would return a potentially large number of articles that mention the vatican , the coliseum and sightseeing tours without ranking the ones that are most relevant for the query first . most users are also notoriously bad at precisely stating structural constraints . for instance , users may not know for which structured elements the search-system supports search . in our example , the user may be unsure whether to issue the query as sightseeing and (country : vatican or landmark : coliseum) , as sightseeing and (state : vatican or building : coliseum) or in some other form . users may also be completely unfamiliar with structured-search and advanced search interfaces or unwilling to use them . in this chapter , we look at how ranked-retrieval methods can be adapted to structured-documents to address these problems . we will only look at one standard for encoding structured-documents : extensible-markup-language or xml , which is currently the most widely used such standard . we will not cover the specifics that distinguish xml from other types of markup such as html and sgml . but most of what we say in this chapter is applicable to markup-languages in general . in the context of information-retrieval , we are only interested in xml as a language for encoding text and documents . a perhaps more widespread use of xml is to encode non-text data . for example , we may want to export data in xml-format from an enterprise-resource-planning-system and then read them into an analytics program to produce graphs for a presentation . this type of application of xml is called data-centric because numerical and non-text attribute-value data dominate and text is usually a small fraction of the overall data . most data-centric-xml is stored in databases - in contrast to the inverted index-based methods for text-centric xml that we present in this chapter . we call xml-retrieval structured-retrieval in this chapter . some researchers prefer the term semistructured retrieval to distinguish xml-retrieval from database-querying . we have adopted the terminology that is widespread in the xml-retrieval community . for instance , the standard way of referring to xml-queries is structured-queries , not semistructured queries . the term structured-retrieval is rarely used for database-querying and it always refers to xml-retrieval in this book . there is a second type of information-retrieval problem that is intermediate between unstructured retrieval and querying a relational-database : parametric and zone search , which we discussed in section 6.1 (page) . in the data-model of parametric and zone search , there are parametric fields (relational attributes like date or file-size) and zones - text attributes that each take a chunk of unstructured-text as value , e.g. , author and title in figure 6.1 (page) . the data-model is flat , that is , there is no nesting of attributes . the number of attributes is small . in contrast , xml-documents have the more complex tree-structure that we see in figure 10.2 in which attributes are nested . the number of attributes and nodes is greater than in parametric and zone search . after presenting the basic concepts of xml in section 10.1 , this chapter first discusses the challenges we face in xml-retrieval (section 10.2) . next we describe a vector-space-model for xml-retrieval (section 10.3) . section 10.4 presents inex , a shared task evaluation that has been held for a number of years and currently is the most important venue for xml-retrieval research . we discuss the differences between data-centric and text-centric approaches to xml in section 10.5 . subsections basic xml concepts challenges in xml-retrieval a vector-space-model for xml-retrieval-evaluation of xml-retrieval text-centric vs. data-centric-xml retrieval references and further reading exercises
