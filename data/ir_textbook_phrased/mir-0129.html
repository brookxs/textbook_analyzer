7.4.4 dictionary methods dictionary methods achieve compression by replacing groups of consecutive symbols (or phrases) with a pointer to an entry in a dictionary . thus , the central decision in the design of a dictionary method is the selection of entries in the dictionary . the choice of phrases can be made by static , semi-adaptive , or adaptive-algorithms . the simplest dictionary schemes use static dictionaries containing short phrases . static dictionary encoders are fast as they demand little effort for achieving a small amount of compression . one example that has been proposed several times in different forms is the digram coding , where selected pairs of letters are replaced with codewords . at each step the next two characters are inspected and verified if they correspond to a digram in the dictionary . if so , they are coded together and the coding position is shifted by two characters : otherwise , the single-character is represented by its normal code and the coding 184 text operations position is shifted by one character . the main problem with static dictionary encoders is that the dictionary might be suitable for one text and unsuitable for another . one way to avoid this problem is to use a semi-static dictionary scheme , constructing a new dictionary for each text to be compressed . however , the problem of deciding which phrases should be put in the dictionary is not an easy task at all . one elegant solution to this problem is to use an adaptive dictionary scheme , such as the one proposed in the 1970s by ziv and lempel . the ziv-lempel type of adaptive dictionary scheme uses the idea of replacing strings of characters with a reference to a previous occurrence of the string . this approach is effective because most characters can be coded as part of a string that has occurred earlier in the text . if the pointer to an earlier occurrence of a string is stored in fewer bits than the string it replaces then compression is achieved . adaptive dictionary methods present some disadvantages over the statistical word-based huffman method . first , they do not allow decoding to start in the middle of a compressed file . as a consequence direct-access to a position in the compressed text is not possible , unless the entire text is decoded from the beginning until the desired position is reached . second , dictionary schemes are still popular for their speed and economy of memory , but the new results in statistical-methods make them the method of choice in an ir environment . moreover , the improvement of computing-technology will soon make statistical-methods feasible for general use , and the interest in dictionary methods will eventually decrease .
