6.5.1 formats multimedia includes images , audio and video , as well as other binary-data . we now briefly survey the main formats used for all these data-types . they are used mainly in the web and in digital-libraries (see chapters 13 and 15) . there are several formats for images . the simplest formats are direct representations of a bit-mapped (or pixel-based) display such as xbm , bmp , or pcx . however , those formats consume too much space . for example , a typical computer screen which uses 256 colors for each pixel might require more than 1 mb (one megabyte) in storage just for describing the content of a single screen frame . in practice , images have a lot of redundancy and can be compressed efficiently . so , most popular image formats incorporate compression such as compuserve 's graphic interchange-format (gif) . gif is good for black-and-white pictures , as well as pictures that have a small number of colors or gray levels (say 256) . to improve compression ratios for higher resolutions , lossy-compression was developed . that is , uncompressing a compressed image does not give the original . this is done by the joint photographic experts group (jpeg) format , which tries to eliminate parts of the image that have less impact on the human eye . this format is parametric , in the sense that the loss can be tuned . another common image format is the tagged image file-format (tiff) . this format is used to exchange documents between different applications and different computer platforms . tiff has fields for metadata and also supports compression as well as different numbers of colors . yet another format is truevision targa image file (tga) , which is associated with video-game boards . there are many more image formats , many of them associated to particular applications ranging from fax (bi-level image formats such as jbig) to fingerprints (highly accurate and compressed formats such as wsq) and satellite-images (large resolution and full-color images) . in 1996 a new bit-mapped image format was proposed for the-internet : portable network-graphics (png) . this format could be important in the future . audio must be digitalized first in order to be stored properly . the most common formats for small pieces of digital-audio are au , midi , and wave . midi is an standard format to interchange music between electronic instruments and computers . for audio libraries other formats are used such as realaudio or cd formats . 158 text and multimedia languages and properties there are several formats for animations or moving-images (similar to video or tv) , but here we mention only the most popular ones . the main one is mpeg (moving pictures expert group) which is related to jpeg . mpeg works by coding the changes with respect to a base image which is given at fixed intervals . in this way , mpeg profits from the temporal image-redundancy that any video has . higher quality is achieved by using more frames and higher resolution . mpeg specifies different compression levels , but usually not all the applications support all of them . this format also includes the audio signal associated with the video . other video formats are avi , fli , and quicktime . avi may include compression (cinepac) , as well as quicktime , which was developed by apple . as for mpeg , audio is also included .
