6.1 citation : interdocument links the bibliography at the end of a scientific publication , links from one world-wide-web page to another , references in a legal brief to prior judicial opinions , and conversational threads connecting postings to one another within a common usenet group may seem completely unrelated . in each case , however , the author of one document has found it useful to cite another document . perhaps it is because the author wishes to extend a prior scientific or legal argument , or perhaps it is to attack it . it may be to pull together disjointed web-pages into a single `` home-page '' theme . or the citation may be designed to quiet a bunch of `` newby '' newsgroup discussion participants by alerting them to a faq (frequently asked question) answer . in all cases , a new piece of text is being woven into the larger fabric of other texts , uniting one author 's contribution into the legacy of many others . the value citations can offer in supporting the foa activity has been recognized by many [pao and 186 finding out about figure 6.2 basic structure of citations worthen , 1989 ; salton and bergmark , 1979] and leads to methods that allow users to capture and organize their own bibliographic materials [belew and holland , 1988] . as more and more scientific-publishing moves to open electronic repositories , efforts such as the open citation project2 are leading the way toward new standards for the exchange of this important information . at its core , a citation is a pointer from a document to a document . we typically think of a citation pointing from one document to another document of the same type : scientific papers cite other journal-articles , email-messages refer to prior messages , html pages point to one another . but in today 's quickly changing scene , it is not uncommon to find heterogeneous forms of citation , from one document-type to another , as shown in figure 6.2 . for many publications , citations are collected at the very end of a document , in its bibliography . often the real locus of a citation , however , is someplace earlier in the document , and many compositional styles insert an expicit bibliographic-citation there . we will be interested in the citation resolution of both ends of the pointer : how accurately do we know the location of the citation in the citing paper , and how precisely is its pointer into the cited paper ? does it point to a particular paragraph , page , section , or the entire document ? the application of very similar citation mechanisms has been exploited in different ways in different contexts . table 6.1 summarizes a number of dimensions across several contexts . here we consider citations as exemplified in two particular classes of documents , generated by science and by law , which have supported social-activities for a very 2 jourrials.ecs.soton.ac.iik / x3cites / inference beyond the index 187 table 6.1 comparing citations across document types science law email/news web purpose / ^ standing on the stare decisis many ! ?? programmatics shoulders of the giant that came before time scale 0 (years) 0 (10 years) 0 (day) 0 (day-years) mark-up sheparcts moderation faq topical home-pages ! inference impact impact public/private ?? co-citation similarity communication-graph theoretic (cliche = college , ...) audience ` hardness ' of science !? long time . section 6.1.5 will report on new analyses of citation-patterns observed on the www .
