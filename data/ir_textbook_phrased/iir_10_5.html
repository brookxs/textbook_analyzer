text-centric vs. data-centric-xml retrieval text-centric xml in contrast , data-centric-xml mainly encodes numerical and non-text attribute-value data . when querying data-centric-xml , we want to impose exact-match conditions in most cases . this puts the emphasis on the structural aspects of xml-documents and queries . an example is : find employees whose salary is the same this month as it was 12 months ago . text-centric approaches are appropriate for data that are essentially text-documents , marked up as xml to capture document-structure . this is becoming a de facto standard for publishing text-databases since most text-documents have some form of interesting structure - paragraphs , sections , footnotes etc. . examples include assembly manuals , issues of journals , shakespeare 's collected works and newswire articles . data-centric approaches are commonly used for data-collections with complex structures that mainly contain non-text data . a text-centric retrieval-engine will have a hard time with proteomic data in bioinformatics or with the representation of a city map that (together with street names and other textual descriptions) forms a navigational database . two other types of queries that are difficult to handle in a text-centric structured-retrieval model are joins and ordering constraints . the query for employees with unchanged salary requires a join . the following query imposes an ordering-constraint : retrieve the chapter of the book introduction to algorithms that follows the chapter binomial heaps . relational-databases are better equipped to handle many structural constraints , particularly joins (but ordering is also difficult in a database framework - the tuples of a relation in the relational-calculus are not ordered) . for this reason , most data-centric-xml retrieval-systems are extensions of relational-databases (see the references in section 10.6) . if text fields are short , exact-matching meets user-needs and retrieval results in form of unordered sets are acceptable , then using a relational-database for xml-retrieval is appropriate .
