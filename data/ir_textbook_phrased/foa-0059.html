3.8 summary we 've covered enormous ground in this chapter . we began by wondering just what it might mean to try to understand communicative-acts , like the publication of a document or the posing of a question or query . we looked in some detail at one of the most fundamental characteristics of texts , zipf 's law , and found it to be , in fact , quite meaningless ! but the next level of features , tokens like those produced by the machinery of chapter 2 , supported a rich analysis of the index , as a balance between the vocabularies of the documents ' authors and searchers ' subsequent queries . the vector-space provides a concrete model of potential keyword vocabularies and what it might mean to match within this space . finally , we considered an efficient-implementation of nearly complete-matching . in the next chapter we will consider the problem of evaluating how well all these techniques work in practice . however , there are gaps in this story that are so obvious we do n't even need to measure them . some of the gaps involve implementation issues that can be critical , especially when faced with very-large-corpora [harper and walker , 1992] . parallel-implementation techniques , for example , those pioneered on `` massively-parallel ' * simd (single instruction/multiple data) connection machines , become important in this respect [salton and buckley , 1988c ; stanfill and kahle , 1986a ; stone , 1987] . in the modern age of multiple search-engines each indexing (only partially overlapping versions [lawrence and giles , 1998]) of the www techniques for fusing multiple hitlists into a single list for the same user suggests another level of parallelism in the foa task [voorhees et al. , 1995] . 102 finding out about however , linguists , in particular , must have more serious , implementation-independent concerns . imagine that you are someone who has studied the range of human languages and who appreciates both their wide variety and equally remarkable commonalities . you would be appalled at the violence we have done to the syntactic-structure of language . for linguists , finding out about documents by counting their words must seem like trying to understand beijing by listening to a single microphone poised high over the-city : you can pick up on a few basic trends (like when most people are awake) , but most of the texture is missing ! dog bites man and mam bites dog clearly mean two different things . word-order obviously conveys meaning beyond that brought by the three words . and the problem does n't end with word-order . look how different the meaning of these phrases are : ï neutralization '' of the present ï representing neutrons ï representations , not neutrons despite the fact that all of them (conceivably) reduce to the same set of indexable tokens ! note especially how critical the same `` noise '' words thrown away on statistical grounds (in chapter 2) are when analyzing a sentence 's syntactic-structure . the attempt to understand the phenomena of meaning by looking for patterns in word-frequency statistics alone is reminiscent of the tea leaves and entrails of this chapter 's opening quote . still , the success of many www-search engines that use very little beyond this kind of gross analysis suggests that there is much more information in the statistics than traditional , syntactically focused linguists might have believed .
