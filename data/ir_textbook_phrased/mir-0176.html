9.5 bibliographic discussion a thorough overview of parallel-and-distributed-computing can be found in the parallel-and-distributed-computing handbook [852] , edited by albert zomaya . many interesting research papers specific to parallel and distributed information-systems can be found in the proceedings of the ieee international conference on parallel and distributed information-systems . stanfill et al [742 , 744 , 740] are responsible for much of the early work using massively-parallel hardware (in particular , the thinking-machines connection-machine) to solve ir problems . pogue and willet [645] also explored massively-parallel ir using the icl distributed array-processor . salton and buckley [701] provide some interesting comments on the early implementations of parallel ir , challenging both their speed and effectiveness . lu et al [524] analyze how to properly scale smp hardware for parallel ir and emphasize the importance of proper hardware balance . investigations into parallel and distributed inverted-file implementations have been performed by tomasic and garcia-molina [762 , 763 , 764] , jeong and omiecinski [404] , and ribeiro-neto and barbosa [673] . parallel-and-distributed-algorithms for suffix-array construction and search have been explored by navarro et al. [591] . given p processors and total text of size n , they obtain average indexing times that are o (n/p logn) cpu-time and 0 {n/p) communication-time . macleod et al [535] offer a number of strategies and tips for building distributed-information-retrieval systems . cahoon and mckinley [137] analyze the performance of the inquery distributed-information-retrieval system . source-selection and collection-fusion issues have been investigated by gra-vano et al using the g1oss system [318] , voorhees et al [792] , callan et al [139] , moffat arid zobel [574] , viles and french [787] , and others . acknowledgements the author gratefully acknowledges the support of ibm .
