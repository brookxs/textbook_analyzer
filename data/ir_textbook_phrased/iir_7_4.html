references and further reading heuristics for fast-query processing with early-termination are described by persin et al. (1996) , anh et al. (2001) , garcia et al. (2004) , anh and moffat (2006b) . cluster pruning is investigated by singitham et al. (2004) and by chierichetti et al. (2007) ; see also section 16.6 (page) . champion lists are described in persin (1994) and (under the name top docs) in brown (1995) , and further developed in long and suel (2003) , brin and page (1998) . while these heuristics are well-suited to free-text queries that can be viewed as vectors , they complicate phrase queries ; see anh and moffat (2006c) for an index-structure that supports both weighted-and boolean/phrase searches . carmel et al. (2001) clarke et al. (2000) and song et al. (2005) treat the use of query-term proximity in assessing relevance . pioneering work on learning of ranking-functions was done by fuhr (1989) , fuhr and pfeifer (1994) , cooper et al. (1994) , bartell et al. (1998) , bartell (1994) and by cohen et al. (1998) .
