140 chapter 6 6.1 introduction to clustering the concept of clustering has been around as long as there have been libraries . one of the first uses of clustering was an attempt to cluster items discussing the same subject . the goal of the clustering was to assist in the location of information . this eventually lead to indexing schemes used in organization of items in libraries and standards associated with use of electronic indexes . clustering of words originated with the generation of thesauri . thesaurus , coming from the latin word-meaning `` treasure , '' is similar to a dictionary in that it stores words . instead of definitions , it provides the synonyms and antonyms for the words . its primary purpose is to assist authors in selection of vocabulary . the goal of clustering is to provide a grouping of similar objects (e.g. , terms or items) into a `` class '' under a more general title . clustering also allows linkages between clusters to be specified . the term class is frequently used as a synonym for the term cluster . they are used interchangeably in this chapter . the process of clustering follows the following steps : a. define the domain for the clustering effort . if a thesaurus is being created , this equates to determining the scope of the thesaurus such as `` medical-terms . '' if document-clustering is being performed , it is determination of the set of items to be clustered . this can be a subset of the database or the complete database . defining the domain for the clustering identifies those objects to be used in the clustering process and reduce the potential for erroneous-data that could induce errors in the clustering process . b . once the domain is determined , determine the attributes of the objects to be clustered . if a thesaurus is being generated , determine the specific words in the objects to be used in the clustering process . similarly , if documents are being clustered , the clustering process may focus on specific zones within the items (e.g. , title and abstract only , main body of the item but not the references , etc.) that are to be used to determine similarity . the objective , as with the first step (a.) is to reduce erroneous associations . c. determine the strength of the relationships between the attributes whose co-occunrence in objects suggest those objects should be in the same class . for thesauri this is determining which words are synonyms and the strength of their term-relationships . for documents it may be defining a similarity-function based upon word co-occurrences that determine the similarity between two items . d . at this point , the total set of objects and the strengths of the relationships between the objects have been determined . the final step is document and term-clustering 141 applying some algorithm to determine the class (s) to which each item will be assigned . there are guidelines (not hard-constraints) on the characteristics of the classes : a well-defined semantic definition should exist for each class . there is a risk that the name assigned to the semantic definition of the class could also be misleading . in some systems numbers are assigned to classes to reduce the misinterpretation that a name attached to each class could have . a clustering of items into a class called `` computer '' could mislead a user into thinking that it includes items on main-memory that may actually reside in another class called `` hardware . '' the size of the classes should be within the same order of magnitude . one of the primary uses of the classes is to expand queries or expand the resultant set of retrieved items . if a particular class contains 90 per cent of the objects , that class is not useful for either purpose . it also places in question the utility of the other classes that are distributed across 10 per cent of the remaining objects . within a class , one object should not dominate the class . for example , assume a thesaurus class called `` computer '' exists and it contains the objects (words/word phrases) `` microprocessor , '' `` 286-processor , '' `` 386processor '' and `` pentium . '' if the term `` microprocessor '' is found 85 per cent of the time and the other terms are used 5 per cent each , there is a strong possibility that using `` microprocessor '' as a synonym for `` 286processor '' will introduce too many errors . it may be better to place `` microprocessor '' into its own class . whether an object can be assigned to multiple classes or just one must be decided at creation time . this is a tradeoff based upon the specificity and partitioning capability of the semantics of the objects . given the ambiguity of language in general , it is better to allow an object to be in multiple classes rather than constrained to one . this added flexibility comes at a cost of additional complexity in creating and maintaining the classes . there are additional important decisions associated with the generation of thesauri that are not part of item clustering (aitchison-72) : word coordination approach : specifies if phrases as well as individual terms are to be clustered (see discussion on precoordinatioe and postcoordination in chapter 3) . 142 chapter 6 word relationships : when the generation of a thesaurus includes a human-interface (versus being totally automated) , a variety of relationships between words are possible . aitchison and gilchrist (aitchison-72) specified three types of relationships : equivalence , hierarchical and nonhierarchical . equivalence relationships are the most common and represent synonyms . the definition of a synonym allows for some discretion in the thesaurus creation , allowing for terms that have significant overlap but differences . thus the terms photograph and print may be defined as synonyms even though prints also include lithography . the definition can even be expanded to include words that have the same `` role '' but not necessarily the same meaning . thus the words `` genius '' and `` moron '' may be synonyms in a class called `` intellectual capability . '' a very common technique is hierarchical-relationships where the class-name is a general term and the entries are specific examples of the general term . the previous example of `` computer '' class-name and `` microprocessor , '' `` pentium , '' etc. is an example of this case . nonhierarchical relationships cover other types of relationships such as `` object '' - `` attribute '' that would contain `` employee '' and `` job title . '' a more recent word relationship scheme (wang-85) classified relationships as parts-wholes , collocation , paradigmatic , taxonomy and synonymy , and antonymy . the only two of these classes that require further amplification are collocation and paradigmatic . collocation is a statistical measure that relates words that co-occur in the same proximity (sentence , phrase , paragraph) . paradigmatic relates words with the same semantic base such as `` formula '' and `` equation . '' in the expansion to semantic-networks other relationships are included such as contrasted words , child-of (sphere is a child-of geometric volume) , parent-of , part-of (foundation is part of a building) , and contains part-of (bicycle contains parts-of wheel , handlebars) (retrievalware-95) . homograph-resolution : a homograph is a word that has multiple , completely different meanings . for example , the term `` field '' could mean a electronic field , a field of grass , etc. . it is difficult to eliminate homographs by supplying a unique meaning for every homograph (limiting the thesaurus domain helps) . typically the system allows for homographs and requires that the user interact with the system to select the desired meaning . it is possible to determine the correct meaning of the homograph when a user enters multiple search-terms by analyzing the other terms entered (hay , crops , and field suggest the agricultural meaning for field) . vocabulary constraints : this includes guidelines on the normalization and specificity of the vocabulary . normalization may constrain the thesaurus to stems versos complete words . specificity may eliminate specific words document and term-clustering 143 or use general terms for class identifiers . the previous discussion in chapter 3 on these topics applies to their use in the thesauri . as is evident in these guidelines , clustering is as much an arcane art as it is a science . good clustering-of-terms or items assists the user by improving recall . but typically an increase in recall has an associated decrease in precision . automatic-clustering has the imprecision of information-retrieval algorithms , compounding the natural ambiguities that come from language . care must be taken to ensure that the increases in recall are not associated with such decreases in precision as to make the human-processing (reading) of the retrieved items unmanageable . the key to successful clustering lies in steps c. and d. , selection of a good measure of similarity and selection of a good algorithm for placing items in the same class . when hierarchical item clustering is used , there is a possibility of a decrease in recall discussed in section 6.4 . the only solution to this problem is to make minimal use of the hierarchy .
