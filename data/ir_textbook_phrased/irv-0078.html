relevance relevance is a subjective notion . different users may differ about the relevance or non-relevance of particular documents to given questions . however , the difference is not large enough to invalidate experiments which have been made with document-collections for which test questions with corresponding relevance-assessments are available . these questions are usually elicited from bona fide users , that is , users in a particular discipline who have an information-need . the relevance-assessments are made by a panel of experts in that discipline . so we now have the situation where a number of questions exist for which the ` correct ' responses are known . it is a general assumption in the field of ir that should a retrieval-strategy fare well under a large number of experimental conditions then it is likely to perform well in an operational situation where relevance is not known in advance . there is a concept of relevance which can be said to be objective and which deserves mention as an interesting source of speculation . this notion of relevance has been explicated by cooper [4] . it is properly termed ` logical relevance ' . its usefulness in present day retrieval-systems is limited . however , it can be shown to be of some importance when it is related to the development of question-answering-systems , such as the one recently designed by t. winograd at massachusetts institute of technology . logical relevance is most easily explicated if the questions are restricted to the yes-no type . this restriction may be lifted - for details see cooper 's original paper . relevance is defined in terms of logical-consequence . to make this possible a question is represented by a set of sentences . in the case of a yes-no question it is represented by two formal statements of the form ` p ' and ` not-p ' . for example , if the query were ` is hydrogen a halogen element ? ' , the part of statements would be the formal-language equivalent of ` hydrogen is a halogen element ' and ` hydrogen is not a halogen element ' . more complicated questions of the ` which ' and ` whether ' type can be transformed in this manner , for details the reader is referred to belnap [5,6] . if the two statements representing the question are termed component statements then the subset of the set of stored sentences is a premiss set for a component statement if an only if the component statement is a logical-consequence of that subset . (note we are now temporarily talking about stored sentences rather than stored documents .) a minimal premiss set for a component statement is one that is as small as possible in the sense that if any of its members were deleted , the component statement would no longer be a logical-consequence of the resulting set . logical relevance is now defined as a two-place relation between stored sentences and information need representations (that is , the question represented as component statements) . the final definition is as follows : a stored sentence is logically relevant to (a representation of) an information-need if-and-only-if it is a member of some minimal premiss set of stored sentences for some component statement of that need . although logical relevance is initially only defined between sentences it can easily be extended to apply to stored documents . a document is relevant to an information-need if-and-only-if it contains at least one sentence which is relevant to that need . earlier on i stated that this notion of relevance was only of limited use at the moment . the main reason for this is that the kind of system which would be required to implement a retrieval-strategy which would retrieve only the logically relevant documents has not been built yet . however , the components of such a system do exist to a certain extent . firstly , theorem-provers , which can prove theorems within formal-languages such as the first-order-predicate-calculus , have reached quite a level of sophistication now (see , for example , chang and lee [7]) . secondly , winograd 's system is capable of answering questions about its simple universe blocks in natural-language . in principle this system could be extended to construct a universe of documents , that is , the content of a document is analysed and incorporated into the universe of currently ` understood ' documents . it may be that the scale of a system of this kind will be too large for present day computers ; only the-future will tell . saracevic [8] has given a thorough review of the notion of relevance in information-science . robertson [9] has summarised some of the more recent work on probabilistic interpretations of relevance .
