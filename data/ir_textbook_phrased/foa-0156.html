7.5.2 boolean predicates a different approach to the text-classification-task has been proposed by cohen in his ripper system [cohen , 1996a ; cohen , 1996b] . the space of hypothesis considered by ripper is a set of boolean rules composed over a space of keywords . a simple example is shown in figure 7.6 , which extends the obvious definition of ireland to include documents that mention violent ira activities . like decision lists , ripper 's rule-sets are easier for human experts to interpret than a large system of bayesian probabilities . ripper is an example of a `` covering '' learning-algorithm ; cf. figure 7.7 . this means that it iteratively forms conjunctions of boolean predicates that `` cover '' some of the positive instances of a boolean classification while excluding all the negative instances . in the next iteration , the positive instances , which were covered previously , are removed from the training-set , and a new conjunctive clause is formed , which again covers some more positive instances while excluding all negative ones . ultimately , then , the rule-set will be in disjunctive-normal-form (dnf) . ripper also includes optimizations to simplify rules by removing conditions that do not affect performance and by picking conditions 274 finding out about + ¶ positive training-instance ó negative training-instance © seed figure 7.7 covering algorithms that provide the most information-gain [quinlan , 1993] . finally , cohen adapted these rule-learning techniques to the text domain by adding `` set-valued-attributes . '' these special attributes collapse a document 's representation to be simply the set of words it contains . ripper 's rules can then include tests for sets of words , rather than having to test the presence or absence of each word individually .
