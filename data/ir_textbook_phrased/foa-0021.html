1.8 summary this chapter has covered enormous ground and attempted to summarize topics that will be discussed in the rest of this text . major points include : ï we constantly and naturally find out about (foa) many , many things . computer search-engines need to support this activity , just as naturally . ï language is central to our foa activities . our understanding of prior work in linguistics and the philosophy of language will inform our search-engine development , and the increasing use of search-engines will provide empirical evidence reflecting back to these same disciplines . ï ir is the field of computer-science that traditionally deals with retrieving free-text documents in response to queries . this is done by indexing all the documents in a corpus with keyword descriptors . there are a number of techniques for automatically recommending keywords , but it also involves a great deal of art . ï users ' interests must be shaped into queries constructed from these same keywords . retrieval is accomplished by matching the query against the documents ' descriptions and returning a list of those that appear closest . ï a central component of the foa process is the users ' relevance-feedback , assessing how closely the retrieved documents match what they had `` in mind . '' ï search-engines accomplish a function related to database-systems , but their natural-language foundations create fundamental differences as well . overview 37 ï in order to know how to shop for a good search-engine , as well as to allow the science of foa to move forward , it is important to develop an evaluation-methodology by which we can fairly compare alternatives . in this overview we 've made some simplifying assumptions and raised more questions than we 've answered , but that is the goal ! by now , i hope you have been convinced that there are many facets to the problem of foa , ranging from a good characterization of what users seek , to what the documents mean , to methods for inferring semantic clues about each document , to the problem of evaluating whether our search-engines are performing as we intend . the rest of this book will consider each of these facets - and others - in greater detail . but like all truly great problems , issues surrounding foa will remain long after this text is dust .
