8.2.4 user as portal how could we possibly know so much about the story or argument an author is attempting to get across ?! or about just what question a user has in mind , and why they want the answer ?! in fact , more and more evidence is making itself available to make just such determinations . virtually every author now composes using a word-processor , and even if they are only interested in ultimately producing a paper-document , it generally carries with it much of the intra - and interdocument structure discussed in chapter 6 . further , it may be possible to infer even more of their thinking if the process of word-processing is allowed to leave a trace with the document * similarly , browsers retain more and more state (i.e. , permanent changes to the local computer 's files that exist after the browser program is no longer running) all the time . bookmark lists and search-history conclusions and future-directions 307 figure 8.5 query as portal , connecting corpora files are the most obvious examples . less obvious to most users are the cookies left by www servers on the user 's client , to better identify when they come to visit . the point is that there are actually fairly rich streams of information available about both author and user , above and beyond the query and document text with which we have been primarily concerned in this book . of course , there are some computations over these two data-sets that can be done a priori , before any search commences . but the more interesting computations are those that can only be done on the occasion of a particular query . a sketch of this perspective is shown in figure 8.5 , with the user and his active seeking behaviors creating a portal through which corpora can interact . here we propose that in fact each user 's query , each bit of relevance-feedback , and each move from one document to another effectively create the opportunity to juxtapose two corpora in ways that , until that moment , had never been analyzed in that way before .
