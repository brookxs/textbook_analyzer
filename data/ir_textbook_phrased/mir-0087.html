5.2.3 a variant of probabilistic term reweighting the discussion above on term reweighting is based on the classic probabilistic niodel introduced by robertson and sparck jones in 1976 . in 1983 , croft extended this weighting-scheme by suggesting distinct initial search-methods 122 query-operations and by adapting the probabilistic formula to include within-document frequency weights . this variant of probabilistic term reweighting is more flexible (and also more powerful) and is briefly reviewed in this section . the formula 5.2 for probabilistic-ranking can be rewritten as sim (dj , q) a where fij , q is interpreted as a factor which depends on the triple [k , d3 , q] . in the classic formulation , fmilt ; 7 is computed as a function of p (ki \ r) and p (kt \ r) (see equation 5.2) . in his variant , croft proposed that the initial search and the feedback searches use distinct formulations . for the initial search , he suggested juj = max (fij) where fx j is a normalized within-document frequency . the parameters c and k should be adjusted according to the collection . for automatically indexed collections , c should be initially set to 0 . for the feedback searches , croft suggested the following formulation for f. fc i log p (w iloc1 ^ * ' ^ 7 ijlt ; 9 `` vc + gl-p (h \ r) +1 âˆž g p (kt \ r)) ^ where p (kt \ r) and p {kt \ r) are computed as in equation 5.4 . this variant of probabilistic term reweighting has the following advantages : (1) it takes into account the within-document frequencies ; (2) it adopts a normalized version of these frequencies ; and (3) it introduces the constants c and k which provide for greater flexibility . however , it constitutes a more complex formulation and , as before , it operates solely on the terms originally in the query (without query-expansion) .
