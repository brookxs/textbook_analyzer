bibliographic remarks the early work of h.p. luhn has been emphasised in this chapter . therefore , the reader may like to consult the book by schultz [44] which contains a selection of his papers . in particular , it contains his 1957 and 1958 papers cited in the text . some other early papers which have had an impact on indexing are maron and kuhns [45] , and its sequel in maron [46] . the first paper contains an attempt to construct a probabilistic-model for indexing . batty [47] provides useful background-information to the early work on automatic keyword classification . an interesting paper which seems to have been largely ignored in the ir literature is simon [48] . simon postulates a stochastic-process which will generate a distribution for word-frequencies similar to the zipfian distribution . doyle [49] examines the role of statistics in text-analysis . a recent paper by sparck jones [50] compares many of the different approaches to index-term-weighting . a couple of state-of-the-art reports on automatic-indexing are stevens [51] and sparck jones [52] . salton [53] has compiled a report containing a theory of indexing . borko [54] has provided a convenient summary of some theoretical approaches to indexing . for an interesting attack on the use of statistical-methods in indexing , see ghose and dhawle [55] .
