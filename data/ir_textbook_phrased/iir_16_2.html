problem statement objective-function the objective-function is often defined in terms of similarity or distance between documents . below , we will see that the objective in - means clustering is to minimize the average distance between documents and their centroids or , equivalently , to maximize the similarity between documents and their centroids . the discussion of similarity-measures and distance-metrics in chapter 14 (page 14.1) also applies to this chapter . as in chapter 14 , we use both similarity and distance to talk about relatedness between documents . for documents , the type of similarity we want is usually topic similarity or high values on the same dimensions in the vector-space-model . for example , documents about china have high values on dimensions like chinese , beijing , and mao whereas documents about the uk tend to have high values for london , britain and queen . we approximate topic similarity with cosine-similarity or euclidean-distance in vector-space (chapter 6) . if we intend to capture similarity of a type other than topic , for example , similarity of language , then a different representation may be appropriate . when computing topic similarity , stop words can be safely ignored , but they are important cues for separating clusters of english (in which the occurs frequently and la infrequently) and french documents (in which the occurs infrequently and la frequently) . subsections a note on terminology . cardinality - the number of clusters
