relevance-feedback and pseudo-relevance-feedback the idea of relevance-feedback (-rrb- is to involve the user in the retrieval-process so as to improve the final result-set . in particular , the user gives feedback on the relevance of documents in an initial set of results . the basic procedure is : the user-issues a (short , simple) query . the system returns an initial set of retrieval results . the user marks some returned documents as relevant or nonrelevant . the system computes a better representation of the information-need based on the user-feedback . the system displays a revised set of retrieval results . (a) (b) relevance-feedback searching over images . (a) the user-views the initial query results for a query of bike , selects the first , third and fourth result in the top row and the fourth result in the bottom row as relevant , and submits this feedback . (b) the users sees the revised result-set . precision is greatly improved . from http://nayana.ece.ucsb.edu/imsearch/imsearch.html (newsam et al. , 2001) . image-search provides a good example of relevance-feedback . not only is it easy to see the results at work , but this is a domain where a user can easily have difficulty formulating what they want in words , but can easily indicate relevant or nonrelevant images . after the user enters an initial query for bike on the demonstration system at : http://nayana.ece.ucsb.edu/imsearch/imsearch.html 9.1 9.1 figure 9.2 shows a textual ir example where the user wishes to find out about new-applications of space satellites . subsections the rocchio-algorithm for relevance-feedback the underlying theory . the rocchio (1971) algorithm . probabilistic relevance feedback when does relevance-feedback work ? relevance-feedback on the web-evaluation of relevance-feedback strategies pseudo-relevance-feedback indirect relevance-feedback summary
