24 chapter 1 1.6 summary chapter 1 places into perspective a total information-storage-and-retrieval system . this perspective introduces new challenges to the problems that need to be theoretically addressed and commercially implemented . ten years ago commercial implementation of the algorithms being developed was not realistic , allowing theoreticians to limit their focus to very specific areas . bounding a problem is still essential in deriving theoretical results . but the commercialization and insertion of this technology into systems like the-internet that are widely being used changes the way problems are bounded . from a theoretical perspective , efficient scalability of algorithms to systems with gigabytes and terabytes of data , operating with minimal user-search statement information , and making maximum use of all functional-aspects of an information-system need to be considered . the dissemination systems using persistent indexes or mail files to modify ranking-algorithms and combining the search of structured-information fields and free-text into a consolidated weighted output are examples of potential new areas of investigation . the best way for the theoretician or the commercial developer to understand the importance of problems to be solved is to place them in the context of a total vision of a complete system . understanding the differences between digital-libraries and information retrieval-systems will add an additional dimension to the potential future-development of systems . the collaborative aspects of digital-libraries can be viewed as a new source of information that dynamically could interact with information-retrieval-techniques . for example , should the weighting algorithms and search-techniques discussed later in this book vary against a corpus based upon dialogue between people versus statically published material ? during the collaboration , in certain states , should the system be automatically searching for reference material to support the collaboration ?
