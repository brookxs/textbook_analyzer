frequency-based feature-selection frequency-based feature-selection frequency-based feature-selection selects some frequent terms that have no specific information about the class , for example , the days of the week (monday , tuesday , ...) , which are frequent across classes in newswire text . when many thousands of features are selected , then frequency-based feature-selection often does well . thus , if somewhat suboptimal accuracy is acceptable , then frequency-based feature-selection can be a good alternative to more complex methods . however , figure 13.8 is a case where frequency-based feature-selection performs a lot worse than mi and and should not be used .
