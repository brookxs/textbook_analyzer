54 chapter 3 3.1.2 objectives the objectives of indexing have changed with the evolution of information retrieval-systems . availability of the full text of the item in searchable form alters the objectives historically used in determining guidelines for manual-indexing . the full text searchable data-structure for items in the document file provides a new class of indexing called total document-indexing . in this environment , all of the words within the item are potential index descriptors of the subject (s) of the item . chapter 1 discusses the process of item normalization that takes all possible words in an item and transforms them into processing tokens used in defining the searchable representation of an item . in addition to determining the processing tokens , current systems have the ability to automatically weight the processing tokens based upon their potential importance in defining the concepts in the item . the first reaction of many people is to question the need for manual-indexing at all , given that total document-indexing is available for search . if one can search on any of the words in a document why does one need to add additional index-terms ? previously , indexing defined the source and major concepts of an item and provided a mechanism for standardization of index-terms (i.e. , use of a controlled-vocabulary) . a controlled-vocabulary is a finite-set of index-terms from which all index-terms must be selected (the domain of the index) . in a manual-indexing environment , the use of a controlled-vocabulary makes the indexing process slower , but potentially simplifies the search-process . the extra processing-time comes from the indexer trying to determine the appropriate index-terms for concepts that are not specifically in the controlled-vocabulary set . controlled-vocabularies aide the user in knowing the domain of terms that the indexer had to select from and thus which terms best describe the information needed . uncontrolled vocabularies have the opposite effect , making indexing faster but the search-process much more difficult . the availability of items in electronic-form changes the objectives of manual-indexing . the source information (frequently called citation data) can automatically be extracted . there is still some utility to the use of indexes for index term standardization . modern systems , with the automatic use of thesauri and other reference databases , can account for diversity of language/vocabulary use and thus reduce the need for controlled-vocabularies . most of the concepts discussed in the document is locatable via search of the total document index . the primary use of manual subject-indexing now shifts to abstraction of concepts and judgments on the value of the information . the automatic-text-analysis algorithms can not consistently perform abstraction on all concepts that are in an item . they can not correlate the facts in an item in a cause/effect relationship to determine additional related concepts to be indexed . an item that is discussing the increase in water temperatures at factory discharge locations could be discussing `` economic stability '' of a country that has fishing as its major industry . it requires the cataloging and indexing 55 associative capabilities of a human being to make the connection . a computer system would typically not be able to correlate the changes in temperature to economic stability . the additional index-terms added under this process enhance the recall capability of the system . for certain queries it may also increase the precision . this processing deficiency indicates the potential for future enhancements of information-retrieval-systems with artificial-intelligence techniques . the words used in an item do not always reflect the value of the concepts being presented . it is the combination of the words and their semantic implications that contain the value of the concepts being discussed . the utility of a concept is also determined by the user 's need . the public file indexer needs to consider the information-needs of all users of the library system . individual users of the system have their own domains of interest that bound the concepts in which they are interested . it takes a human being to evaluate the quality of the concepts being discussed in an item to determine if that concept should be indexed . the difference in `` user-need '' between the library class of indexers and the individual users is why private index-files are an essential part of any good information-system . it allows the user to logically subset the total document file into folders of interest including only those documents that , in the user 's judgment , have future value . it also allows the user to judge the utility of the concepts based upon his need versus the system need and perform concept-abstraction . selective indexing based upon the value of concepts increases the precision of searches . availability of full document-indexing saves the indexer from entering index-terms that are identical to words in the document . users may use public index-files as part of their search criteria to increase the recall . they may want to constrain the search by their private index file to increase the precision of the search . figure 3.1 shows the potential relationship between use of the words in an item to define the concepts . public indexing of the concept adds additional index-terms over the words in the item to achieve abstraction . the index file use fewer terms than found in the items because it only indexes the important concepts . private index-files are even more focused , limiting the number of items indexed to those that have value to the user and within items only the concepts bounded by the specific user 's interest domain . there is overlap between the private and public index-files , but the private index file is indexing fewer concepts in an item than the public index file and the file owner uses his specific vocabulary of index-terms . in addition to the primary objective of representing the concepts within an item to facilitate the user 's finding relevant-information , electronic indexes to items provide a basis for other applications to assist the user . the format of the index , in most cases , supports the ranking of the output to present the items most likely to be relevant to the user 's information-needs first (see chapters 5 and 7) . also , the index can be used to cluster items by concept (see chapter 6) . the clustering of items has the effect of making an electronic system similar to a physical-library . the paradigm of going to the library and browsing the book 56 chapter 3 shelves in a topical area is the same as electronically browsing through items clustered by concepts .
