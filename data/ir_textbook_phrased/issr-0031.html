information-retrieval-system capabilities 43 2.3.3 canned query the capability to name a query and store it to be retrieved and executed during a later user-session is called canned or stored queries . users tend to have areas-of-interest within which they execute their searches on a regular basis . a canned query allows a user to create and refine a search that focuses on the user 's general area-of-interest one time and then retrieve it to add additional search criteria to retrieve data that is currently needed . for example , a user may be responsible for european investments . rather than always having to create a query that limits the search to european geographic-search terms and then the specific question requiring resolution , a canned query can be created with all the needed geographic terms and used as a starting point for additional query-specification . significant effort can go into making the canned query into a comprehensive and focused-search since it is created once but used many times with additional search-terms for specific information-needs . queries that start with a canned query are significantly larger than ad-hoc queries . canned query-features also allow for variables to be inserted into the query and bound to specific values at execution-time .
