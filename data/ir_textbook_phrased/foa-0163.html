284 finding out about 7.6.3 adapting to `` spatial '' context in order to test infospiders , agents were allowed to breed in a controlled test environment previously used by steier [steier and belew , 1994a ; steier , 1994] : a portion of the encyclopedia-britannica . the advantage is that we can make use of readily available relevant sets of articles associated with a large number of queries . the subset corresponds to the human society topic , roughly one-tenth of the entire encyclopedia . links to other parts of the eb are removed , along with any terminal documents produced as a result . the final environment is made of n = 19,427 pages , organized in a hypertext graph (the eb is already in html format) . of these pages , 7859 are full articles constituting the micropcedia . these , together with 10,585 index pages (containing links to articles and pointed to by links in articles) , form a graph with many connected-components . the remaining 983 nodes form a hierarchical topical tree , called propcedia . these nodes contain topic titles and links to children nodes , ancestor nodes , and articles . micropaedia articles also have links to propaedia nodes . propaedia and index pages are included in the search set to ensure a connected graph and to be faithful to the eb information-architecture - an actual subset of the-web . now consider two agents , a and bgt ; born at the same time and attempting to satisfy the same query , but in different `` places '' within this hypergraph of eb document pages . as table 7.1 shows , the original query words were displaced from their top positions and replaced by new terms . for example , pbtvat and allevi had relatively low weights , while foumdat appeared to have the highest correlation with relevance-feedback at this time . as and b 's keyword vectors are shown in table 7.2 . in the course of the evolution leading to a and b through their ancestors , some query terms were lost from both genotypes . a was a third-generation agent ; its parent lost allevi through a mutation in favor of hull . at a 's birth , privat was mutated into th . b was a second-generation agent ; at its birth , both allevi and pbjvat were replaced by hull and addam , respectively , via mutation and crossover . these keyword vectors demonstrate how environmental features correlated with relevance were internalized into the agents * behaviors . the difference between a and b can be attributed to their evolutionary-adaptation to spatially local-context . a and b were born at documents adaptive-information-retrieval 285 table 7.1 part of the word feedback list and weights at time 550 rank new k ik 1 ï foiindat 0.335 2 red 0.310 3 ï mission 0.249 4 social 0.223 5 cross 0.197 6 hull 0.184 7 hous 0.183 8 organ 0.161 15 servic 0.114 16 activ 0.112 23 th 0.094 30 public 0.087 32 addam 0.079 37 human 0.075 41 privat 0.067 44 allevi 0.065 note : stars mark new terms not present in the original query . note that th does not correspond to the article the , which is a noise word and thus is removed from all documents ; rather , it corresponds to the th . used for ordinal numbers and often associated with centuries . table 7.2 keyword vectors for agents a and b a b organ qrga2t public public th addam servic servic social social human human activ activ hull bull d and d ^ , respectively * whose word-frequency distributions are partly shown in table 7.3 . th represented well the place where a was borngt ; being the second most frequent term there ; and addam represented well the place where b was born , being the third most frequent term there . 286 finding out about table 7.3 most frequent terms in the documents where agents a and b were born rankoa k freq (k , da) rankd k freqik , db) 1 wokkhous 0.076 1 hous 0.043 2 th 0.038 1 hull 0.043 2 poor 0.038 3 addam 0.025 4 social 0.030 4 centuri 0.030 38 american 0.004 note : word-frequencies are normalized by the total number of words in each document . by internalizing these words , the two situated-agents are better suited to their respective spatial contexts .
