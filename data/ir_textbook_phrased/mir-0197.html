10.5.6 natural-language and free-text queries statistical-ranking algorithms have the advantage of allowing users to specify queries naturally , without having to think about boolean or other operators . but they have the drawback of giving the user less feedback about and control over the results . usually the result of a statistical ranking is the listing of documents and the association of a score , probability , or percentage beside the title . users are given little feedback about why the document received the ranking it did and what the roles of the query terms are . this can be especially problematic if the user is particularly interested in one of the query terms being present . one search-strategy that can help with this particular problem with statistical-ranking algorithms is the specification of ` mandatory ' terms within the natural-language-query . this in effect helps the user-control which terms are considered important , rather than relying on the ranking-algorithm to correctly weight the query terms . but knowing to include a mandatory specification requires the user to know about a particular command and how it works . the preceding discussion assumes that a natural-language-query entered by the user is treated as a bag-of-words , with stopwords removed , for the purposes of document match . however , some systems attempt to parse natural-language queries in order to extract concepts to match against concepts in the 288 user-interfaces and visualization text-collection [399 , 552 , 748] . alternatively , the natural-language-syntax of a question can be used to attempt to answer the question . (question-answering in information-access is different than that of database-management-systems , since the information desired is encoded within the text of documents rather than specified by the database-schema .) the murax system [463] determines from the syntax of a question if the user is asking for a person , place , or date . it then attempts to find sentences within encyclopedia articles that contain noun-phrases that appear in the question , since these sentences are likely to contain the answer to the question . for example , given the question who was the pulitzer prize-winning novelist that ran for mayor of new york city ? , ' the system extracts the noun-phrases ` pulitzer prize , ' ` winning novelist , ' kmayor , ' and ` new york city . ' it then looks for proper nouns representing people 's names (since this is a ` who ' question) and finds , among others , the following sentences : the armies of the night (1968) , a personal-narrative of the 1967 peace march on the pentagon , won mailer the pulitzer prize and Âª the national book award . in 1969 mailer ran unsuccessfully as an independent candidate for mayor of new york city . thus the two sentences link together the relevant noun-phrases and the system hypothesizes (correctly) from the title of the article in which the sentences appear that norman mailer is the answer . another approach to automated-question-answering is the faq finder system which matches question-style queries against question-answer pairs on various topics [130] . the system uses a standard ir search to find the most likely faq (frequently-asked-questions) files for the question and then matches the terms in the question against the question portion of the question-answer pairs . a less automated approach to question-answering can be found in the ask jeeves system [34] . this system makes use of hand-picked web-sites and matches these to a predefined set of question-types . a user ^ s query is first matched against the question-types . the user selects the most accurate rephrase of their question and this in turn is linked to suggested web-sites . for example , the question `` who is the leader of sedan ? 1 is mapped into the question-type 4who is the head of state of x (sudan) ? 1 where the variable is replaced by a listbox of choices , with sudan the selected choice in this case . this is linked to a web-page that lists current heads of state . the system also automatically substitutes in the name ` sudan * in a query against that web-page , thus bringing the answer directly to the user 's attention . the question is also sent to standard web-search-engines . however , a system is only as good as its question templates . for example a question `` where can i find reviews of spas in calistoga ? 1 matches the question * where can 1 find x (reviews) of activities for children aged y (1) ? ' and `` where can i find a concise encyclopedia article on x (hot springs) ? ' context 289
