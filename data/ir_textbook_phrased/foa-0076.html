4.3.9 test-corpora by test-corpora we refer to collections of documents that have associated with them a series of queries for which relevance assesments are available . one of the earliest such test-sets was a collection of 1400 research papers on aerodynamics developed by c. cleverdon in the mid-1960s , known as the cranfield corpus [cleverdon and mills , 1963] . for most of the 1980s , a set of corpora known as cacm , cisi , inspec , med , and npl (sometimes referred to as the cornell corpora) were developed , maintained , and distributed by gerald salton and his students at cornell ; it became the de facto standard for testing within the ir community . for some time , the most influential test-corpora have been the trec corpora l associated with the text-retrieval evaluation conference meetings [harman , 1995] . table 4.3 gives a sample of statistics for a number of the most widely used corpora . one obvious trend is the increasing size of these collections over time . the reuters corpus2 classification labels are invaluable for ' note that my notation deviates from barteits somewhat . in particular , we assume here that rank (-rrb- increases from most - to least-highly ranked document , so that the first element of the hitlist has rank = 1 . potomac . ncsl . nlst . go v / tree / www.research.att.com / lewis/reuterss 1578.html 136 finding out about table 4.3 common test-corpora collection ndocs nqrys size (mb) term/doc q-drelass adi 82 35 ait 2109 14 2 400 gt ; 10,000 cacm 3204 64 2 24.5 cisi 1460 112 2 46.5 cranfield 1400 225 2 53.1 lisa 5872 35 3 medline 1033 30 1 npl 11,429 93 3 oshmed 34,8566 106 400 250 16,140 reuters 21,578 672 28 131 trec 740,000 200 2000 89-3543 # 3 100,000 training classifiers (cf. section 7.4) . with our ait corpus , the oshmed [hersh , 1994] is one of the few to provide multiple relevance-assessments of the same (q , d) pair . figure 4.16 shows a sample query from the trec experiments . for this query , and hundreds like it , considerable manual effort has gone into assessing whether documents in the trec-corpus should be considered `` relevant .
