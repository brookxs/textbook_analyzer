14.3 online-public-access-catalogs (opacs) library catalogs serve as lists of the library 's holdings , organized as finding tools for the collection . for many years the card catalog served this function , and later computer-produced catalogs in book , microfilm , and microfiche form . online catalogs were implemented in libraries during the 1970s , although these first catalogs were usually modules linked to the automated circulation system and had brief catalog records and very limited functionality . (the circulation system was the first component of what are now called library-management-systems (lmss) or integrated library systems (ilss) to be introduced) . by the 1980s , true online-public-access-catalogs had been implemented . hildreth [372] has described the history of online catalogs by classifying them according to three generations . in the first generation , opacs were largely known-item-finding tools , typically searchable by author , title , and control number , and contained relatively short , non-standard bibliographic-records . as is typical of technologies in their infancy , they were basically an old technology (the card catalog) in an automated form . in the second generation , increased search functionality included access by subject-headings and , latterly , keyword , 408 libraries and bibliographical systems some basic boolean search capability , and ability to browse subject-headings . second generation catalogs also offered a choice of display-formats (e.g. , short , medium , long) and improved usability (for instance , different dialogs for novices and experts , more informative error-messages , etc.) . according to hildreth , problems with second generation systems included failed searches , navigational confusion , problems with the subject-indexing vocabulary and excessively large , badly organized retrieval sets . needed enhancements for third-generation systems , as delineated by hildreth , included search-strategy assistance , integrated free text/controlled vocabulary approaches , augmented cataloging records , cross-database access , natural-language-input , individualized displays and context-sensitive error-correction . for many years library catalogs remained on what hildreth referred to as the ` second generation plateau . ' one of the barriers to innovation in opac development has been the cost of developing new systems and the need for a reliable customer base . prom the perspective of the library , selecting and migrating to a new system is a costly process , and with library budgets traditionally squeezed , libraries have been cautious in selecting new and untried systems . they have learned to be wary of the ` it 's in the next release ; syndrome , while system developers have required a stable customer base to fund new systems . third-generation systems are now appearing , and with features not envisioned by hildreth , who was speaking in a pre-web environment . the availability of electronic resources on the web has blurred the distinction between local and global resources , and between cataloging information and other electronic databases . according to a recent vendor survey [632] , automated system vendors have a vested interest in the transition of libraries to a mixed digital/print environment . many see their own survival dependent upon their ability to help libraries thrive in this mixed arena , (p. 47) therefore , much of the emphasis in recent library systems-development has been on the deployment of functionality for library-management-systems within new open-systems architectures [351] . features appearing in these new systems include improved graphical-user-interfaces (guis) , support for z39 .50 , electronic forms , hypertext-links and dublin-core (a developing metadata-standard for multimedia materials) , and incorporation of java-programming . systems are also beginning to move beyond the basic boolean search functionality , and some , like egsfs q series (described in section 14.3.3) have advanced-search-features .
