7.7.1 adaptive lenses a discussion of the routing or filtering task should make it clear that learning-technology can be placed at many levels within the foa system . a personal classification tool can be very useful to a single individual organizing his or her own email . these categories need not make any adaptive-information-retrieval 287 figure 7.12 adaptive lens sense to or be consistent with those used by anyone else . but when multiple-users all browse through shared corpora , it becomes possible for one person 's browsing-experience to benefit another 's . of course , interuser consistency in relfhk will help to determine just how statistically correlated these training signals are . but if users are clustered as part of socially cohesive-groups (for example , a research lab full of students and faculty pursuing the same research-questions) and they are searching documents of shared interests (for example , reprints they have all collected on topics of mutual interest , as part of a journal club perhaps) , it is not unreasonable to believe that their assessments will be very similar indeed . figure 7.12 shows a single individual with a classification-system on his or her own machine . but their searches often go through a second classifier or `` adaptive lens '' that they share with other members of a computer science group . the figure also shows two different social-groups of users , for example , computer scientists and cognitive scientists , each learning different connotations for the phrase neural-network , perhaps computationally and physiologically skewed , respectively . finally , these smaller groups are merged into progressively larger groups of users over which relfhk assessments are pooled .
