10.1 introduction this chapter discusses user-interfaces for communication between human information seekers and information retrieval-systems . information-seeking is an imprecise process . when users approach an information-access system they often have only a fuzzy understanding of how they can achieve their goals . thus the user-interface should aid in the understanding and expression of information-needs . it should also help users formulate their queries , select among available information-sources , understand search-results , and keep track of the progress of their search . the human-computer-interface is less well understood than other aspects of information-retrieval , in part because humans are more complex than computer-systems , and their motivations and behaviors are more difficult to measure and characterize . the area is also undergoing rapid change , and so the discussion in this chapter will emphasize recent developments rather than established wisdom . the chapter will first outline the human side of the information-seeking process and then focus on the aspects of this process that can best be supported by the user-interface . discussion will encompass current practice and technology , recently proposed innovative ideas , and suggestions for future areas of development . section 10.2 outlines design-principles for human-computer-interaction and introduces notions related to information-visualization , section 10.3 describes information-seeking-models , past and present . the next four sections describe user-interface support for starting the search-process , for query-specification , for viewing retrieval results in context , and for interactive-relevance-feedback . the last major section , section 10.8 , describes user-interface-techniques to support the information-access process as a whole . section 10.9 speculates on future developments and section 10.10 provides suggestions for further reading . figure 10.1 presents the flow of the chapter contents . 257 258 user-interfaces and visualization introduction hci background the information-access process starting-points query-specification context using relevance-judgements interface-support 4 conclusions figure 10.1 the flow of this chapter 's contents .
