10.6.2 query-term hits within document-content in systems in which the user can view the full text of a retrieved document , it is often useful to highlight the occurrences of the terms or descriptors that match those of the user 's query . it can also be useful for the system to scroll the view of the document to the first passage that contains one or more of the query terms , and highlight the matched terms in a contrasting color or reverse video . this display is thought to help draw the user 's attention to the parts of the document most likely to be relevant to the query . highlighting of query terms lias been found time and again to be a useful feature for information-access interfaces [481] , [542 , p. 31] . color highlighting has also recently been found to be useful for scanning lists of bibliographic-records [52] . 290 user-interfaces and visualization jjfc yi #i ^ ! http / / w mm tuiuimm help feebmok . computer scien technical repor mm 1 wilty results ' ****** ^ q ^ ^ ignore upper/bwer case differences , ignore word endings terms must appear within the same report 1 w ^ jk your quay contained mixed-case letters , wen though your preferences are to ignore upper/lower case differences word-count swaieou 301 penults for the query swunsan (more than 50 documents matched the query) 1 set i mto i 3] ^ s tecteacal r eport cmu/sei -87 - tr-2 the effect of software-support needs on the department-of-defense ' ' software-acquisition policy part 1 a framework for analyzing legal-issues anne c martin and kevin m deasy the effect of software-support needs on the department-of-defense software-acquisition poll # [ft r eh an improved treatment of external boundary for three-dimensional flow computations ?

(the segments for this version of the interface are fixed blocks of 100 tokens each .) the first document can be seen to have considerable overlap among the topics of interest towards the middle , but not at the beginning or the end (the actual end is cut off) . thus it most likely discusses topics in addition to research into osteoporosis . the second through fourth documents , which are considerably shorter , also have overlap among all terms of interest , and so are also probably of interest to the user . (the titles help to verify this .) the next three documents are all long , and from the tilebars we can tell they discuss research and prevention , but do not even touch on osteoporosis , and so probably are not of interest . because the tilebars interface - * allows the user to specify the query in terms 292 user-interfaces and visualization user-query {enter wtttds for different topk son different unas .) ron search 1 nwq oerj ' ... . i quit osteoporosis prevention research ' ' '' ' '' '' '' ' search limit v 50 v number of ousters : v ´ ¶ 100 3 v 4 250 ? 5 v v 500 . * v ioc 10 fr88513-0157 ap : groups seek $ 1 billion a year for aging research sjmn : women 's health legislation proposed clj ap : older athletes run for science \ fr : committee meetings fr : october advisory committees ; meetings fr8s120-0046 i fr : chronic-disease burden and prevention models ; program * ap : survey says experts split on diversion of funds for aids i i fr : consolidated delegations of authority for policy develop * j sjmn : research for breast-cancer is stuck in pil sr : figure 10.15 an example of the tilebars retrieval results visualization [355] . of facets , where the terms for each facet are listed on an entry line , a color can be assigned to each facet . when the user displays a document with query-term hits , the user can quickly ascertain what proportion of search topics appear in a passage based only on how many different highlight colors are visible . most systems that use highlighting use only a single color to bring attention to all of the search-terms . it would be difficult for users to specify in advance which patterns of term hits they are interested in . instead , tilebars allows users to scan graphic representations and recognize which documents are and are not of interest . it may be the case that tilebars may be most useful for helping users discard mislead-ingly interesting documents , but only preliminary studies have been conducted to date . passages can correspond to paragraphs or sections , fixed sized units of arbitrary length , or to automatically determined multiparagraph segments [355] . seesoft the seesoft visualization [232] represents text in a manner resembling columns of newspaper text , with one line ' of text on each horizontal line of the strip . (see figure 10.16 .) the representation is compact and aesthetically-pleasing . graphics are used to abstract away the details , providing an overview showing the amount and shape of the text . color highlighting is used to pick out various attributes , such as where a particular word appears in the text . details of a smaller portion of the display can be viewed via a pop-up window ; the overview context 293 shows more of the text but in less detail . figure 10.16 an example of the seesoft visualization for showing locations of characters within a text [232] . seesoft was originally designed for software-development , in which a line of text is a meaningful unit of information . (programmers tend to place each individual programming statement on one line of text .) thus seesoft shows attributes relevant to the programming domain , such as which lines of code were modified by which programmer , and how often particular lines have been modified , and how many days have elapsed since the lines were last modified . the seesoft developers then experimented with applying this idea to the display of text , although this has not been integrated into an information-access system . color highlighting is used to show which characters appear where in a book of fiction , and which passages of the bible contain references to particular people and items . note the use of the abstraction of an entire line to stand for a single word such as a character 's name (even though though this might obscure a tightly interwoven conversation between two characters) .
