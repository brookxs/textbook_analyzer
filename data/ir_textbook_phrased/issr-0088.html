6.2 thesaurus-generation manual generation of clusters usually focuses on generating a thesaurus (i.e. , clustering terms versus items) and has been used for hundreds of years . as items became available in electronic-form , automated term statistical-clustering techniques became available . automatically generated thesauri contain classes that reflect the use of words in the corpora . the classes do not naturally have a name , but are just a groups of statistically similar terms . the optimum technique for generating the classes requires intensive computation . other techniques starting with existing clusters can reduce the computations required but may not produce optimum classes . there are three basic methods for generation of a thesaurus ; hand crafted , co-occurrence , and header-modifier based . using manually made thesauri only helps in query-expansion if the thesauri is domain-specific for the domain being searched . general thesaurus (e.g. , wordnet) does not help as much because of the many different meanings for the same word (voorhees-93 , voorhees-94) . techniques for co-occurrence creation of thesauri are described in detail below . in header-modifier based thesauri term-relationships are found based upon linguistic relationships . words appearing in similar grammatical contexts are assumed to be similar (hindle-90 , grafenstette-94 , jing-94 , ruge-92) . the linguistic-parsing of the document discovers the following syntactical structures : subject-verb , verbobject , adjective-noun , and noun-noun . each noun has a set of verbs , adjectives and nouns that it co-occurs with , and a mutual-information value is calculated for each using typically a log function (see mandala-99) . then a final similarity-between-words is calculated using the mutual-information to classify the terms . 144 chapter 6 6.2.1 manual clustering the manual clustering process follows the steps described in section 6.1 in the generation of a thesaurus . the first step is to determine the domain for the clustering . defining the domain assists in reducing ambiguities caused by homographs and helps focus the creator . usually existing thesauri , concordances from items that cover the domain and dictionaries are used as starting-points for generating the set of potential words to be included in the new thesaurus . a concordance is an alphabetical listing of words from a set of items along with their frequency of occurrence and references of which items in which they are found . the art of manual thesaurus-construction resides in the selection of the set of words to be included . care is taken to not include words that are unrelated to the domain of the thesaurus or those that have very high frequency of occurrence and thus hold no information-value (e.g. , the term computer in a thesaurus focused on data-processing machines) . if a concordance is used , other tools such as kwoc , kwic or kwac may help in determining useful words . a key word out of context (kwoc) is another name for a concordance . key word in context (kwic) displays a possible term in its phrase context . it is structured to identify easily the location of the term under consideration in the sentence . key word and context (kwac) displays the keywords followed by their context . figure 6.1 shows the various displays for `` computer-design contains memory chips '' (note : the phrase is assumed to be from doc4 ; the other frequency and document ids for kwoc were kwoc term freq item ids chips 2 doc2 , doc4 computer 3 docl , doc4 , doclo design 1 doc4 memory 3 doc3 , doc4 , doc8 , docl2 kwic chips / computer-design contains memory computer-design contains memory chips / design contains memory chips / computer memory chips / computer-design contains kwac chips computer-design contains memory chips computer computer-design contains memory chips design computer-design contains memory chips memory computer-design contains memory chips figure 6.1 example of kwoc , kwic and kwac document and term-clustering 145 created for this example .) in the figure 6.1 the character '' / '' is used in kwic to indicate the end of the phrase . the kwic and kwac are useful in determining the meaning of homographs . the term `` chips '' could be wood chips or memory chips . in both the kwic and kwac displays , the editor of the thesaurus can read the sentence-fragment associated with the term and determine its meaning . the kwoc does not present any information that would help in resolving this ambiguity . once the terms are selected they are clustered based upon the word relationship guidelines and the interpretation of the strength of the relationship . this is also part of the art of manual creation of the thesaurus , using the judgment of the human analyst . the resultant thesaurus undergoes many quality-assurance reviews by additional editors using some of the guidelines already suggested before it is finalized .
