the vector-space-model for scoring in section 6.2 (page) we developed the notion of a document-vector that captures the relative-importance of the terms in a document . the representation of a set of documents as vectors in a common vector-space is known as the vector-space-model and is fundamental to a host of information-retrieval operations ranging from scoring documents on a query , document-classification and document-clustering . we first develop the basic ideas underlying vector-space scoring ; a pivotal step in this development is the view (section 6.3.2) of queries as vectors in the same vector-space as the document collection . subsections dot products queries as vectors computing vector scores
