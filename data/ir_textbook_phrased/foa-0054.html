3.5 matching queries against documents in chapter 2 we first identified documents , then lexical-features to be associated with each . then we built an inverted keyword list to make going from keywords to documents about those keywords as easy as possible . now we 'll become specific about how we measure the similarity between a document and a query . 94 finding out about the discussion of matching queries and documents is simplified if we adopt the vector-space perspective of section 3.4 and imagine both the query q and all documents d to be vectors in a space of dimensionality equal to nkwy the keyword vocabulary-size . in this space , the answer to the question of which documents are the best match for a query seems straightforward - those documents that are most similar , relative to some particular metric sim measuring distance between points in the space . students of algebra and abstract vector-spaces know that many different choices are possible ; see section 5.2.2 .
