2.3.1 stemming and other morphological-processing from the perspective of linguistics , many of the early-design issues we address are considered morphological transformations of language , i.e. , an analysis of what we can infer about language based on structural-features . as discussed briefly in chapter 1 , the arbitrary way in which white-space may or may not separate tokens whose meanings are interdependant (e.g. , recall the german word geschwdtoigkeits b1schraneuetg and english phrase speed limit example) will make us interested in phrasal units of indexing as well . in many asian texts , the relationship between characters and words is quite radically altered . the kanji alphabet and unicode standards help to define the problem but bring biases of their own [fujii and croft , 1993] , for now we will focus on one of the most common morphological tricks , stemming . stemming is a direct attempt to remove certain surface markings from words to reveal root form . beyond deciding which characters are to be combined into tokens , chapter 1 discussed how important it can be to use a token 's root form as an index term : we can extracting lexical-features 45 hope that our retrieval is robust even when the query contains the plural form cars while the document contains the singular car . linguists would say that the number feature (whether a noun is singular or plural) is morphologically marked . linguists also distinguish between inflectional-morphology like plurals , and derivational-morphology , which can change a word 's syntactic-category (e.g. , changing the noun product to the verb productize) and meaning more radically . in stemming , suffixes are dropped . even in the simple case of plural endings , it is n't as simple as removing ss . consider : woman/women leaf/leaves ferry/perries alumlsnis/alumot datum/data conversely , we can not assume that every time there is an ending s we can remove it ; stemming crisis and chess to crisi and ches would damage their meaning . the most common approach to this problem [fox , 1992] is to identify more elaborate patterns over character sequences that reliably pare tokens down to their root forms . a broad range of such patterns can be defined in terms of a context-sensitive transformation grammar . for example : rule 2.1 t *) sses - + / iss rule2 .2 (. * [aeiou] . *) ed-gt ; / i rule2 .3 (. * [aeiou] . *) y - + / u rule 2.1 says that strings ending in - sses should be transformed by taking the stem (i.e. , characters prior to these four) and adding only the two characters ss . rule 2.2 says that stems containing a vowel and ending in - ed should be transformed to leave only the stem ; rule 2.3 says that stems containing a vowel and ending in - y should be transformed to the stem with an i replacing the y. * * these rules are pseudo-code only , using grep-like syntax for regular-expressions . further , they are meant as illustrative examples . see fox 's chapter for a complete exposition of the actual rules used in porter 's stemmer f fox , 1992] . 46 finding out about a complete algorithm for stemming involves the specificaton of many such rules and a regime for handling conflicts when multiple rules match the same token . an early and influential algorithm due to lovins [lovins , 1968] specified 260 suffix patterns and used an iterative longest match heuristic . this means that first preference is given to the pattern (left-hand side of the grammar-rule) that matches the most characters in a target token (because this prefers more specific matches over shorter , more generally applicable ones) ; then rules are iteratively reapplied until no other rules match . the porter-stemmer [porter , 1980] (included as part of the foa software) is a simplified version of lovin 's technique that uses a reduced set of about 60 rules and organizes them into sets , with conflicts within one subset of rules resolved before going on to the next . in fact , if only the first set of rules in porter 's stemmer (focusing exclusively on plurals and the most straightforward suffixes like - ed and - ing) is used , the result has been called weak stemming [walker , 1989] . a key advantage of all such rule-based grammatical representations of the stemming process (and of efficient implementations of them , such as that provided by fox) is that modifications to the rules and to ordering among the rules can be accomplished by changing the grammar rather than by endless ad-hoc hacking (ad hacking ? :-rrb- in response to particular character sequences . the use of any stemmer obviously reduces the size of the keyword vocabulary and consequently results in a compression of the index-files . such compression can vary from 10 to 50 percent , depending on the total size of the keyword vocabulary and how aggressive (e.g. , how many suffix rules are used) the stemmer is . the primary effect of stemming , however , is that two keywords that were once treated independently are considered interchangeable . stemming is therefore an example of a recall-increasing operation because it will cause a keyword used in the query to match more documents . the fundamental problem with any stemming technique , of course , is that the morphological-features being stripped away may obscure differences in the words ' meanings . for example , the token gravity has two word senses5 one describing an attractive force between any two masses and the other having to do with a serious mood . but once the word gravitation '' has been stemmed , we have lost the information that might constrain us to the first interpretation . krovetz extracting lexical-features 47 [krovetz , 1993] considers several more sophisticated approaches to keyword morphology , including augmenting porter 's stemmer with a dictionary that is checked after each phase of stemming rules has been applied .
