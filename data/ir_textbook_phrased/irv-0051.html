matching-functions many of the more sophisticated search-strategies are implemented by means of a matching-function . this is a function similar to an association-measure , but differing in that a matching-function measures the association between a query and a document or cluster profile , whereas an association-measure is applied to objects of the same king . mathematically the two functions have the same properties ; they only differ in their interpretations . there are many examples of matching-functions in the literature . perhaps the simplest is the one associated with the simple matching search-strategy . if m is the matching-function , d the set of keywords representing the document , and q the set representing the query , then : is another example of a matching-function . it is of course the same as dice 's coefficient of chapter 3 . a popular one used by the smart project , which they call cosine correlation , assumes that the document and query are represented as numerical vectors in t-space , that is q = (q1 , q2 , . . , qt) and d = (d1 , d2 , ... , dt) where qi and di are numerical weights associated with the keyword i . the cosine correlation is now simply or , in the notation for a vector-space with a euclidean norm , where [[theta]] is the angle between vectors q and d.
