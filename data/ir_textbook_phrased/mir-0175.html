9.4 trends and research-issues parallel-computing holds great potential for tackling the performance and scale issues associated with the large and growing document-collections currently available online . in this chapter we have surveyed a number of techniques for exploiting modern parallel-architectures . the trend in parallel hardware is the development of general mimd machines . coincident with this trend is the availability of features in modern programming-languages , such as threads and associated synchronization constructs , that greatly facilitate the task of developing programs for these architectures . in spite of this trend , research in parallel ir algorithms on mimd machines is relatively young , with few standard results to draw on . much of the early work in parallel ir was aimed at supporting signature-files on simd architectures . although simd machines are well suited to processing signature-files , both simd machines and signature-files have fallen out of favor in their respective communities . simd machines are difficult to program and are well suited to a relatively small class of problems . as chapter 8 points out , signature-files provide poor support for document-ranking and hold few , if any , advantages over inverted-files in terms of functionality , index-size , and processing speed [851] . distributed-computing can be viewed as a form of mimd computing with relatively high interprocessor-communication costs . most of the parallel ir algorithms discussed in this chapter , however , have a high ratio of computation to communication , and are well suited to both symmetric multiprocessor and distributed implementations . in fact , by using an appropriate abstraction-layer for inter-process-communication , we can easily implement a parallel-system that works well on both multiprocessor and distributed-architectures with relatively little modification . many challenges remain in the area of parallel and distributed text-retrieval . while we have presented a number of approaches in this chapter , none stand out as the definitive solution for building parallel or distributed-information-retrieval systems . in addition to the continued development and investigation of parallel indexing and search-techniques for systems based on inverted-files and suffix-arrays , two specific challenges stand out . the first challenge is measuring retrieval-effectiveness on large text collections . although we can easily measure the speedup achieved by a given parallel-system , measuring the quality of the results produced by that system is another story . this challenge , of course , is not unique to parallel ir systems . large-collections pose problems particularly when it comes to generating relevance-judgments for queries . the pooling techniques used in trec (see chapter 3) may not work . there , ranked result lists are combined from multiple systems to produce a relatively small set of documents for human-evaluation . the assumption is that most , if not all , of the relevant documents will be included in the pool . with large-collections , this assumption may not hold . moreover , it is unclear how important recall is in this context . the second significant challenge is interoperability , or building distributed-ir systems from heterogeneous components . the need for distributed-systems 256 parallel and distributed ir comprising heterogeneous back-end search servers is clear from the popularity of meta-search services-on-the-web . the functionality of these systems is limited , however , due to the lack of term statistics from the back-end search servers , which would otherwise allow for accurate reranking and result list merging . moreover , each search-server employs its own , custom query-language , opening up the possibility that the original intent of the query is lost when it is translated to the back-end query-languages . protocol standardization efforts , such as starts [317] , attempt to address these problems , but commitment to these standards by the entire community of search providers is required .
