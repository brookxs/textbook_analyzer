6.3.3 taxonomies as their central role in wordnet suggests , the hierarchic bt/nt , or hypernymy , relations are especially important . because of the constant analytic pressure of the western intellectual tradition , topics continue to be refined into smaller topics , which the next generation of scholars immediately refines further . this has led to a wide range of classification taxonomies associated with various social-groups of scholars and scientists . 218 finding out about library-of-congress loc numbers subject-headings assoc. computing-machinery david waltz (scientific-data link) extension ofc.jr . taxonomy figure 6.16 nesting taxonomies from various sources figure 6.16 shows several different sources from which indexing information might be obtained . the single most important source of subject-indexing is the library-of-congress (loc) . its indexing system is the basis of most large libraries because it covers all disciplines . for exactly the same reason , however , the indexers at the loc have too much to do , and the resulting indices are admittedly crude . partly as a response to the lack of adequate indexing-structures , various professional groups have developed their own taxonomies to help organize the information within their particular technical specialty . for example , the association of computing-machinery has developed the acm computing reviews classification15 for use by its computing reviews publication [acm , 1986] . this taxonomy is much more specific , and therefore more widely used by computer specialists . however , it lacks many of the advantages of the loc system . in general , the keywords are assigned by the authors rather than by trained librarians . the system is rarely , if ever , integrated into the operations of libraries . and although the indexing-structure is 5 is6-www . infbrmatik . unl-dortmund . de/crclass . html inference beyond the index 219 much more refined than that of the loc , it is still too crude for most research currently going on in any subspecialty . this has caused some practitioners in various subspecialties to develop their own extensions . for example , david waltz was commissioned by scientific data-link to extend the acm 's computing reviews taxonomy for the sub-specialty of artificial-intelligence [waltz , 1985] . waltz 's extension is extremely refined and helpful to ai practitioners . at the same time , it is even more ad-hoc , its `` sponsoring institution '' has less impact , and consequently it is even less well accepted within libraries . all three of these indexing-systems are examples of top-down knowledge-structures . that is , they are developed by various social institutions as prescriptive languages used to represent the consensus opinion as to how information is to be organized . such `` consensual '' knowledge-structures are critical if individuals are to share information . each indexing system represents a compromise between increased scope and diminished resolution . increased scope brings along with it broader acceptance and adherence . these advantages occur at the expense of acceptance by users actively involved in technical specialties . the central role of hierarchic bt/nt relations in organizing keyword vocabularies should make us especially concerned with a precise-semantics for this relationship . most would agree that if b is a broader term than a , then a `` is a '' b . but as knowledge engineers within ai have known for a long time , the ubiquitous is_a relation admits a number of interpretations , which can support different types of inference [brachman , 1979 ; brachman , 1983] . in general , the bt/nt relation seems to correspond most closely to the `` a kind of '' implication relating predicates a andb : (vx) b (x) - gt ; a (x) (6.11) earlier generations of internet-users participated in the construction of the extensive usenet hierarchy16 of discussion-boards , on topics from alt.sex.fetish.robots to comp.sys.mac.oop.tcl ; see section 7.5.5 for an example of the use of this hierarchy in text-classification tasks . these days the most widely known taxonomies are sfe ftp : / / rtfm.irsjt.edu / pub/usenet-by-liierarcby / 220 finding out about www directories such as yahoo! ,17 whose employees have constructed a hierarchy , primarily of places to spend money . one of the most exciting recent developments is the development of collaborative-classification efforts such as the open-directory-project (dmoz) yls which involves large communities of experts , each working to make sense within his or her own area of expertise .
