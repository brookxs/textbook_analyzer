1.3.1 query sessions as we consider the specific-features of each query , it is important to remember the role these short expressions play in the larger foa process . queries are generated as an attempt by users to express their information-need . as with any linguistic-expression , conveying a thought you have can be difficult , and this is likely to be especially true of the muddled cognitive-state of our foa searcher . users who are familiar with the special syntactic-features of a query-language may be able to express their need more easily , but others for whom this unnatural syntax is new or `` typical '' users difficult will have additional difficulties .1 have changed overview 15 1 2 figure 1.5 a query-session as with many of the idealizing assumptions we are at least temporarily making , it is often simpler to think about only one iteration of the three-step query/retrieve/assess foa process at a time . in most realistic situations we can expect that single queries will not occur in isolation but as part of an iteration of the foa process . an initial query begins the dialog ; the search-engine 's response provides clues to the user about directions to pursue next ; these are expressed as another query . an abstract-view of this sequence is presented in figure 1.5 . note especially the concatenation of a series of basic foa three-step iterations . data are produced by the user , then by the search-engine , and then by the user ; this constructs a very natural alternation of user-search engine exchanges . users ' assessments can also function as their next query statement . this can be achieved simply if we have some method for automatically constructing a query from relevance-feedback . for example , if users click on documents they like , the search-engine can , by itself , form a new query that focuses on those keywords that are especially associated with these documents . there are many such techniques for using relevance-feedback from a single query/retrieval , and there are many more things we can learn from the entire query-session . the full query-session provides more complete evidence about the users ' information-need than we can gain from any one query . in fact , as will be discussed extensively in chapter 7 , there exist algorithmic means by which the search-engine itself might `` learn '' from such evidence . learning-methods might even be expected to make transitive leaps , from the users ' initial expressions of their information-needs to the final documents that satisfied them . * (of course , this tran - transitivity sitive leap is only warranted if we are certain that users ended the session 16 finding out about satisfied and are n't just quitting in frustration !) for all these reasons , we must try to identify a query-session 's boundaries , that is , when one focused-search session ends and the next session , involving the same user searching on a different topic , begins .
