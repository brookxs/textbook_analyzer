8.3.3 the changing economics of publishing every aspect of the publishing business is undergoing radical transformation : 誰 the costs of production , creating bits rather than applying ink to paper ; 誰 the means of distribution , permitting a file versus trucking pallets of books ; 誰 even the fundamental social-interactions , schmoozing with your agent over lunch versus contracting with someone you 've never met ; 誰 having all of these things occur in hours and days rather than months and years . in such turbulent times , economic-models that encompass many forms-of-interaction among readers , writers , editors , and publishers are very useful . m. wellman provides one useful analysis of digital-library economics .14 14 ai.eect.iimicli.edu / people/weljman/ijmeoon . htmi 312 finding out about one easy dimension is the contrast between product and service . when a magazine is something you buy once a month at the grocery store , it is easiest to imagine it as a product . but when a personalized newspaper appears on your computer screen every morning , it seems more like a service . stefik has characterized the processing of content in terms of a refinery model [stefik , 1995 ; belew , 1985] . crude , raw data are produced in large volumes (e.g. , by satellites , video cameras , and so on) . people who watch these data-streams , and now automatic data mining algorithms , find interesting correlations and report on them . individual observations and correlations are integrated into larger stories , related to prior work , and the like . at each stage of refining , the raw number of bits diminishes , but the information , and thus the knowledge (perhaps even the wisdom ? i) , is increased as the individual facts become integrated into more meaningful accounts . along with each change comes increased economic-value . another model for interaction comes from the open-source model of software-development . the best metaphor for this may be the hippies ' notion of co-ops : everyone contributes a little bit , so that a valuable resource is available to many . this model is most often applied to software-development , but fine-grained `` clipping services '' and moderation-forhire newsgroups are very similar . more and more business-models for such interactions are already being explored , with some paid for by computists is a members and others filling more informal roles . ^ good example if publishers are to have a role in the-future , the editorial enhance ment and other added-value they provide beyond the authors ' original content must be significant . for example , a key feature of publishing in academic-journals is the authority conferred to a publication by the process of peer-review . an article published in a major journal is not only made available to a wide audience , but it comes with a `` seal of approval '' of external validation by recognized experts in the field (viz. , the editorial board and referees of their choosing) that the document represents significant work . the increased speed and reduced cost promised by electronic-communication associated with electronic-journals will not be realized unless social mechanisms such as these can be successfully transferred from the printed communication-channel . another traditional distinction that electronically produced hypertext tends to blur is between the rough working notes and drafts that conclusions and future-directions 313 an author maintains personally and the polished prose that is typically published . when two documents were both typed from scratch , there was every reason that they should be as different as possible . but as word-processing technologies have allowed us to cut and paste , it seems that different versions of approximately the same document wind up being published independently . it is sometimes worthwhile saying the same thing more than once (e.g. , with different audiences in mind) , and in some fields it is common to first publish a shorter , in-progress report in a conference-proceedings , with a more thorough and refined version of the same text appearing subsequently in a journal . but viewed cynically , the pressure on academics to `` publish or perish , '' together with the increasing number of more and less formal publication channels , makes the ease of such self-plagiarism an issue . just as funding agencies like the national-science-foundation now limit the number of publications that can be mentioned (in support of grant proposals or as part of an investigator 's vita) , publishers and professional-societies may find it necessary to limit the raw quantity of publications in order to preserve their quality . obviously , this text itself is an example of an experiment in electronic-publishing , and hence in publishing economics . for more details about how the economics is intended to play out , see the final '' (active) colophon .
