a variant of the multinomial-model 99 12.2.1 (129) 99 99 equation 129 is equivalent to the sequence-model in equation 113 as for terms that do not occur in (-rrb- and a term that occurs times will contribute factors both in equation 113 and in equation 129 . exercises . which of the documents in table 13.5 have identical and different bag-of-words representations for (i) the bernoulli model (ii) the multinomial-model ? if there are differences , describe them . the rationale for the positional independence-assumption is that there is no useful information in the fact that a term occurs in position of a document . find exceptions . consider formulaic documents with a fixed document-structure . table 13.3 gives bernoulli and multinomial estimates for the word the . explain the difference .
